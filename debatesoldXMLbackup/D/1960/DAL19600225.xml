    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:&mdash;</P>

      <P>When speaking last week, I referred to the hours of trading set out in the Bill and this morning I should like to mention that&mdash;I suppose, in common with quite a number of Deputies&mdash;I have received a number of letters from the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, all protesting against the Bill on the grounds that it extends the hours during which drink may be purchased in taverns.  They claim that an extension of hours will lead to excessive drinking, that it will have a bad effect morally on the people, and that it will increase the danger or the risk of traffic casualties. Like many other Deputies, I have a great admiration for the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association.  I agree they are doing very wonderful work and they deserve to be encouraged in every way possible.  At the same time, I feel I must exercise my own judgment as to how I will vote when this section is being decided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that the extension of hours will lead to excessive drinking.  I remember when drink was very cheap, when the pint of stout cost 2½d and a glass of whiskey could be bought for 4d.  At that time, the ordinary people of the country were very depressed; they had to work terribly long hours in very poor conditions.  They could not patronise bars and could not have bars in their own homes, so they went to the public house for rest, solace, or whatever one likes to call it, but at <Col N="857" /> the present time I rather think that the price of these intoxicants has made it impossible for people to indulge in them to great excess.  For the great majority, their incomes limit the amount they can consume.</P>
      <P>In any case, listening to the speeches made here and to the suggestions in these letters from the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, one might conclude that we were a country of topers and that drunkenness was quite common and needed to be checked very severely.  I do not at all believe that.  At the time I speak of, when drink was cheap, it was quite an ordinary thing to find policemen hauling people to the barracks, something, I am glad to say, we never see now.  The usual charge when they appeared in court was, &ldquo;drunk and disorderly&rdquo; but I do not recall reading a case of &ldquo;drunk and disorderly&rdquo; for very many months past. Indeed, the few cases which are presented are mainly in respect of itinerants.  Consequently I think that, generally speaking, we in this country drink in moderation.</P>
      <P>In that regard, I should like to refer to the terms of the pledge which members of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association take.  They make what is known as the &ldquo;Heroic Offering&rdquo; in atonement for excess in the use of intoxicants by other people and that, I think, presupposes that the taking of drink is a boon, a providential boon rather than being sinful, if one cares to put it that way. Taken in moderation, it is a gift of Providence and my contention is that people drink in moderation at the present time.  If the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, in pursuing their good work, feel there will be excesses when this Bill has been passed, I think they are somewhat exaggerating the position and shouldnot have any worries in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other aspect is the moral aspect.  They feel that the extension of hours will cause moral upset. Great Britian has already been mentioned, where the pubs close earlier than here and where the law is rigidly enforced.  With laxity in enforcement of the law, or even as it <Col N="858" /> stands at present, there seems to be no comparision between the moral behaviour of the people here and the people in England where there is such restriction.</P>
    <P>Two or three of the letters also refer to bloodshed on the roads but I recently read in the papers that in Northern Ireland the number of casualties, killed and injured, on the roads, was something over 5,000 last year.  Here in our own part of Ireland, the number was over 4,000.  In other words, in Northern Ireland, there was a very much higher percentage of people killed and injured on the roads, notwithstanding the fact that their licensing laws are rigidly enforced and the hours are shorter.  I think that, on these three counts, the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association need have no fears.</P>
    <P>A number of the letters I received also stated that there was no demand for this new legislation and that, in fact, a plebiscite would show that the people were against it.  They are entitled to publish what they think, but I think that I meet as many of the people who visit public houses as the members of that Association and I feel the Association are exaggerating their fears.</P>
    <P>Last week, I listened to two or three members from the Fine Gael benches.  Deputy Dockrell assured the House that restriction was necessary and quoted the fact that licences were necessary for the use of a gun or the purchase of ammunition.  He felt that the restriction on the sale of drink to the hours of 10 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. was justified.  A week or so before that, Deputy Esmonde, speaking on the Hire Purchase Bill, protested very vigorously against what he called Governmental control and interference with the rights of the people.  I would fall more to the side of Deputy Esmonde than to that of Deputy Dockrell because I believe that what we should have is the minimum of restriction, not the maximum. I believe that the closing of the public houses at 10.30 p.m. in the summer, which is really 9.30 p.m., is restrictive and I am hoping that we will have one member on the Fine Gael benches who will vote for the <Col N="859" /> hours mentioned in this Bill as they give a minimum of restriction.</P>
    <P>I say these few words only to justify my action in voting for this Bill with the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, for the members of which I have the highest regard and whose organisation should be encouraged.  I would say a last word in that regard&mdash;the terms of their pledge is that they make a &ldquo;Heroic Offering&rdquo; in atonement. That in itself justifies the pledge.  I think the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association need have no fears that the hours in the Bill will lead to excessive drinking.  The Bill will also have the effect of giving us a law that can be enforced because it is just and equitable to the people.  Restrictions lead only to more drinking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties relating to this Bill is a difficulty we all appreciate, that the hours which are suitable in one district or parish may not be suitable in the next.  The proximity of a football field or sportsground to a public house will influence the hours which the owner of that public house would like.  I can understand why Deputies who represent rural districts support the hours proposed in this Bill.  I believe that it is a genuine and well-intentioned attempt to meet the real needs of the rural community.  However, I make no apology for making my protest against the Bill on behalf of over threequarters of a million people who do not want closing hours of 11.30 p.m. in the summer and 11 p.m. in the winter.  I pray the Minister not to enforce on the people of Dublin and the environs of Dublin hours of drinking which are not wanted by the drinkers themselves, by the workers in the trade, by the owners of licensed houses, by the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, and are not wanted by the families of the people who drink.  I would ask the Minister and the Government to think again before imposing, against the stated wish of the people of the city, those hours of drinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage, the Minister said that these hours were purely permissive and that it was not mandatory on any publican to keep open to those hours. I seriously ask the Minister does he <Col N="860" /> expect that public house owners will keep open at different hours from their rivals across the street who will keep open until 11.30?  Would we not then have in the same street the undesirable <i>bona fide</i> traffic we have at the moment?  The houses which would close early would be those operated by trade union labour and they would vomit out semi-inebriated people who would cross the street into a small family-owned public house at the other side where they would fight and struggle for drink in the last hour or half hour.</P>
    <P>One of the troubles about the existing law is the last minute rush for drink.  It would be so much worse if only one of every five public houses were to avail of the hours allowed by the Bill to be worked.  If the trade unions refuse to work them, we shall have the situation of the last minute rush for drinks from the houses which close early to those which remain open.  The social consequences of that must be obvious to all and I would ask the Minister not to impose upon an unwilling people the hours suggested in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I can well appreciate the desire of the Minister, the Government and the Commission to achieve a degree of uniformity in order to wipe out the anachronism of the <i>bona fide</i> trade. I have put down some amendments suggesting hours of opening which, I believe, will meet the requirements of the people of the city.  Because of the fact that the hours are not very much more than those which we have at present and that they keep a differential of only half an hour between the country and city public houses, I believe they would have the same effect of killing the undesirable <i>bona fide</i> traffic as the proposals the Minister has put into this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would refer the Minister to any parish on the fringe of Dublin which is within the metropolitan area at present. If the people of Terenure, on the one hand, and of Drumcondra, on the other, leave their local public house at 10.30 p.m. and the nearest public house outside the metropolitan area&mdash; now a <i>bona fide</i> house&mdash;is a half a mile or a mile away, I respectfully suggest that it will not be worth the <Col N="861" /> while of the people coming out of the city public house half an hour earlier to make a mad dash to a public house a mile or a half a mile up the road because by the time they get there, they will be shouting &ldquo;Time&rdquo; in the other house.  If the law is to be enforced, they will be no sooner inside the door than they will be put out.</P>
    <P>The hours I suggest have the advantage that you will not have the public houses in Dublin closing at the same time as public transport goes off the streets.  I do not think the Government have paid sufficient attention to the social, physical and geographical problems that will arise night after night in Dublin if all the city public houses close at 11.30 p.m.  Even at present, quite frequently, there is a rush for the last couple of buses on any route.  You have the last-minute cinema crowds, the people who go for a cup of coffee or a cup of tea after a show, the people in the catering business and the show business&mdash;all rushing for the last buses.  Are we to add to that the people coming out of the public houses slightly &ldquo;under the weather&rdquo;?  I am not speaking of them in any derogatory way.  But if a man has a few pints or a few &ldquo;small ones&rdquo; and is a little bit &ldquo;under the weather&rdquo;, there is a danger he will be a little cantankerous.  Add on to every bus queue 20 semi-inebriated people night after night, who will be fighting with other people for the last buses, and the morning after the police courts at Inn's Quay will be even more crowded than they are.  Conductors and drivers probably will be assaulted and there will be all kinds of difficulties night after night.</P>
    <P>Therefore, quite sincerely, I ask the Minister not to put into the Bill a provision whereby the public houses will close at the same time as public transport goes off the streets.  That is why I have tabled the amendment suggesting that in the months of June, July, August and September, the closing hour in Dublin city and in the other county boroughs&mdash;although I do not profess to speak with any knowledge of the needs of the other county boroughs, I certainly do speak with some knowledge of the needs of Dublin&mdash;should be 11 p.m.  For the <Col N="862" /> rest of the year the city closing should be 10.30 p.m.  My own opinion, which has been endorsed by everybody I have consulted about this Bill, with one exception, is that the most desirable closing hour for the county boroughs is 10.30 p.m.  That is borne out by the Minority Report of the Intoxicating Liquor Commission, in which it is clearly stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>...a substantial number of the Commission find themselves in disagreement on the question of extending hours in the County Boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.</P>
    <P>The Minority Report goes on to say that:</P>
    <P>...there was no general demand for longer hours in the county boroughs.</P>
    <P>The same paragraph concludes with a suggestion that in the county boroughs, there should be 10.30 p.m. closing all the year round.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the Second Stage of the Bill, I drew the Minister's attention to the fact that it was not correct to say that a majority of the Commission wanted a closing hour in the whole country of 10.30 p.m.  Mr. Clear and Mr. O'Flynn of the Pioneer Association said they put their names most reluctantly to the Majority Report merely for the purpose of achieving uniformity in order that the abuse of <i>bona fide</i> traffic might be wiped out. They did that, I suggest, not because they wanted an extension to 11.30 p.m. everywhere but because they wanted a compromise solution for a general closing hour in all areas of 11 p.m.</P>
    <P>The Minority Report suggested a closing hour of 10.30 p.m. in the county boroughs and 11.30 p.m. in the rural areas.  They went on to say&mdash; with a little too much optimism, I think&mdash;that the differential in trading hours between the county boroughs and the other areas&mdash;at present two hours in winter and one-and-a-half hours in summer&mdash;if reduced to one hour, would have the advantage of removing the undesirable <i>bona fide</i> traffic.  If you leave a differential of one hour between the city houses and the rural houses, there will be a last-minute <Col N="863" /> dash out to the <i>bona fide</i> house. The hours I suggest leave a harmless differential of a half hour.  Therefore, I ask the Minister and the Government to consider my amendment and to think again before imposing on an unwilling population in the city hours of drinking for which there has been no demand and to which there is a considerable amount of opposition.</P>
    <P>In his speech on the Second Stage, the Minister gave utterance to what I regard as a very reactionary statement. He said, in relation to the opposition of the trade unions to the extended hours at night time:</P>
    <P>Acceptance could never be given to the proposition that the working of late or unorthodox hours, which suit the convenience of the public, should be forbidden by law because the employers and employees would prefer not to work them.</P>

      <P>Column 196, volume 177, of the Dáil Debates.  This House has on many occasions in the past, quite rightly, enacted legislation to protect workers against working awkward hours.  The Shops Acts, the Factory Acts and other legislative proposals have provided that reasonable hours will be worked.  It is well known that, by agreement sometimes and other times only by the force of argument on the part of trade unions, the working hours of work people have been regulated to proper periods.  I would suggest to the Minister that the unions are not being unreasonable.  They protested against being asked to work up to an hour which would coincide with the removal of public transport from the streets.  The unions are not being unreasonable when they say that the family life of their members would be disrupted if they were asked to work night after night up to an hour before which their wives and families would have gone to bed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am earnestly asking the Minister to think once again before compelling the workers to work hours which are unfair to them, on the one hand, and <Col N="864" /> which, on the other hand, are not wanted by the drinking public.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Commission were influenced by the weight of the evidence in connection with <i>bona fide</i> drinking, and that they arrived at the conclusion that there was need for extra drinking facilities in the city, because the rush to the <i>bona fide</i> houses proved there was a need for extra hours.  On the fringe of Dublin city, there are only a small number of <i>bona fide</i> houses relative to the number of public houses in the city.  I doubt if as much as one or two per cent.  of the people who consume alcoholic liquor in public houses in the city, rush to the <i>bona fide</i> houses on the fringe of the city at night.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known principle that it is very bad law to make a law to suit a bad case.  That is what we are doing when we force, on an unwilling population, a law which will provide for the needs of a very small minority. I have taken the trouble&mdash;and I am sure very many other Deputies have done so&mdash;of consulting the boys who &ldquo;do the <i>bona fide.</i>&rdquo;  I use the proper verb in the jargon of drinking when I refer to people who &ldquo;do the <i>bona fide.</i>&rdquo; They would not regret in the least if the temptation were taken out of their way.  I believe 75 per cent.  of those who go to a <i>bona fide</i> house regret it the following morning, because they have sick heads and stomachs which last throughout the day and which can be cured only by another trip to a <i>bona fide</i> house that night.  If the temptation provided by <i>bona fide</i> houses were removed, I believe they would be quite content to leave the city public houses at the closing hour with the slight addition proposed in my amendments to the hours which the Government suggest in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Longer hours are not wanted and there is no public demand for them. As an earnest of goodwill and an indication of our sincerity, I believe the city people are prepared to accept the closing hour in the four months of the summer as 11 o'clock in the evening.  That would be half an hour before public transport ceases, and <Col N="865" /> people coming out of the public houses in dribs and drabs would be able to get public transport in the last half-hour and be safely home before the last public transport had gone off the streets.</P>
    <P>I have considerable sympathy with the unions in their opposition to the longer hours.  By and large, particularly in the city, most of the staffs of public houses are members of unions. The men who man the public houses in Dublin are very fine types, many of whom come from the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have suggested in another amendment that the opening hours in the morning should not be any earlier in the cities than 11 o'clock.  The individual whose head is sore the following morning and who thinks he needs a cure before 11 o'clock can get some kind of concoction in a chemist's shop which will open at 9 a.m. so there is no need to ask the majority of those who work in public houses to be at their places of employment at an hour when no reasonable person needs a drink.  I can never see why a man should want a drink at 10 a.m. in the winter or 10.30 a.m. in the summer.  I always find it harder to get up in the winter than in the summer.  One of the strange things which our fathers in this House enacted a generation ago, was later opening hours in the summer than in the winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we do not allow the public houses to open until 11 a.m., the effect will be to reduce the working hours and not to create an addition to them. My desire is that there should be a slight reduction in the working hours which would compensate the workers for having to work the extra half-hour <Col N="866" /> in the evening.  I appreciate that an hour worked in the middle of the morning is much less arduous than the last half-hour before closing in the evening.</P>
    <P>The effect of opening until 11 p.m. would be that, compared with existing legislation, from 1st January to 10th April and from 2nd October to 31st December, there would be one hour less in the morning, and if the House would be good enough to adopt my humble suggestion in connection with the hours for the cities during that time, the workers would be asked to work an extra half-hour in the evening and the result would be a net saving in working hours of three hours per week.  For the rest of the year from 10th April to 1st June, compared with existing legislation, there would be, in that seven and a half weeks, half an hour less to be worked in the mornings and the same hours in the evening as we have at present.  From 1st June to the end of September or the beginning of October, when summer time is abolished, the effect of my amendment would be that the workers would work the same length of hours as they work at the moment.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to consider these hours because my suggestion would lessen the burden we are throwing on to the employees and the employers alike by asking them to work hours which are more awkward for them than the hours we have at the moment.  One of the reasons, quite honestly, why the cities are not in favour of the extended hours proposed in this Bill, is that they appreciate that the unions will, quite rightly &mdash;and they will have my complete support&mdash;look for additional wages, and no fairminded man can oppose them.  The publican will then have to pass on the burden to the consumer and goodness knows, for the working man and the unemployed man in the city of Dublin, the price of drink is already prohibitive.</P>
    <P>If a member of this House were to go to an average public house on an average weekday, an hour or two before closing time, he would sometimes find the number of staff greater than the number of customers.  The last <Col N="867" /> rush in the business inevitably takes place during the last hour or half-hour. The reason for that is not that people would not like to have a nice easy-going session from 7 or 8 o'clock until closing time, but they simply cannot afford it.  If the price of drink in Dublin is to be increased still further, we shall be killing the goose that lays the golden egg.</P>
    <P>I am therefore respectfully suggesting that we might to some extent meet the wishes of those in the trade were we to reduce at one end the hours they are asked to work.  The hours, I respectfully suggest, are sufficient because I suppose there is less than .01 of public house customers, even in the centre of the city, who go looking for drink before 11 a.m.  If a person were in such a bad way that he needs a cure in the morning, he can always get it from the doctor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon made a suggestion which is worth considering, that is, that instead of a publican closing his door when closing time comes, he should leave it open, that the onus should be on the customer to leave.  If that happened and were our courts to impose heavier fines on the customer, with a prohibition against the publican paying the fine&mdash;which is just as important&mdash;there might not be the number of breaches of the licensing laws as there are at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sometimes very difficult for the publican and his staff to clear a pub at closing time.  The invariable experience is that when a prosecution takes place, the customer is fined anything from 2/6d. to 10/&mdash;in many cases, the publican, in order to keep his trade, pays the fine&mdash;and the publican is fined anything from £2 to £5 <Col N="868" /> and runs the risk of losing his licence. The offenders, of course, are the customers.</P>
    <P>I am sure that many members of the House, including myself, would quite readily admit guilt in relation to this matter, but if the onus were passed on to the customer, there would not be the breaches of the licensing laws that we have experienced in the past.  No matter what the Minister's intention may be, no matter what licensing laws this House may adopt, it will be exceedingly difficult to enforce the licensing laws, unless the onus is put on the customer and not on the publican.  Of course, some responsibility would have to be put on the publican. Otherwise, there would be some publicans who would entice people against their own interests and advantage. Nevertheless, the time has come when greater onus should be put on the customer than has been the case in the past.</P>
    <P>On this account, I sincerely ask the Minister to meet me to this extent: while appreciating the need for uniformity so far as it can be achieved, I ask him not to chase after that principle and thereby create in the cities vast social problems which can only be imagined.  The Minister may say that I am exaggerating.  I do not believe I am.  I believe social problems will arise night after night if the hours which the publican does not want are provided.  I would respectfully say also that if these longer hours are provided in the cities, the most undesirable elements will certainly avail of them night after night after night, whereas the quiet family man may not avail of them.  It has been suggested that you can provide the longer hours and that the person can go home, if he wants to.  That is quite right but the undesirable fellow, the fellow who does not know where to stop, the night owl who stays out all night, is the type who will avail of these hours night after night.</P>

      <P>It does not always, unfortunately, <Col N="869" /> until it is too late.  He will do it night after night, to his own ruin.  I can appreciate the high sentiments of people who do not believe in State interference with the individual, but it was said on another occasion here and it needs to be said again, that this is not a milk Bill; it is not a mineral water Bill; it is not a water Bill.  This is a Bill dealing with something the appetite for which increases as it is consumed.  On that account, there are limits in relation to licensing laws.  There is no need to discuss the principle.  It is generally accepted.  It is a question of what the need is.  I suggest to the Minister that the need in the cities is not for the longer hours which he is asking the House to adopt but for a slight extension, perhaps.  If the extension is limited to the hours which I am suggesting, one of the main purposes of this Bill will be achieved, namely, the abolition of the abuses of the <i>bona fide</i> trade because if the differential between city and country is kept to half an hour, it will not be worth while to go on an excursion for drink.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to discuss these amendments without appearing to moralise or to tell people how they should live.  That is a difficulty in which many Deputies find themselves.  The difficulty is reduced when it is realised from the discussions that have taken place, the amendments that have been put down and the Report of the Commission, that the entire country agrees that there should be some control of the hours of drinking. That has been unanimously accepted by the House because there has been no suggestion, by way of amendment or otherwise, that public houses and bars should be allowed to remain open for 24 hours per day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could waste a lot of time in discussing these amendments.  The issues as far as these sections are concerned are narrowed down to the question whether the hour at night should be 10 p.m., 10.30 p.m. or 11 p.m.  It should not take very long to make up our minds on that question. I want to say immediately, <Col N="870" /> merely to be on record, that I have considered that 10 p.m. closing in winter is too early; but that 10.30 p.m. in summer is too early, but that 11.30 p.m. is too late and that 11 p.m. in the winter is too late.  So, whether it is Solomon's judgment or not, I am in favour of the 11 p.m. closing in summer and the 10.30 p.m. closing in winter.</P>
    <P>Some people have said that there seems to be nothing wrong with men being in public houses until 12 or 12.30 at night.  Deputy Corry, who always speaks here for the rural community, has talked about the agricultural worker or the small farmer being finished work at 10 p.m. and suggested that that is the only time he can go to a public house to have a few drinks. We should try to change that pattern. I think the Minister can do it if he provides for the hours which have been suggested in the amendment or the hours which I suggested.  I do not believe that we in Ireland make the proper use of our mornings.  We always seem to concentrate our work and drinking into a certain part of the day. With all due respect to the rural community&mdash;this is not by way of criticism&mdash;I would ask: does anybody ever consider the time at which the majority of the people of this country start to work?  I am not referring in particular to the rural community.</P>

      <P>Some do.  I do not say nobody in the rural area starts work at 4.30, 5.30 or 6.30 in the morning but the pattern is, I understand, to commence work very late in the morning with the result that only one and a half or two hours are left in which to drink.  That pattern of life has existed for many years, and I do not think it desirable to change it.  I do not refer only to the rural community.  There are also civil servants who start work at 9.30, 10 or 10.30 in the morning.  It means that four or five hours of daylight have gone and I do not think it is good enough for anybody here to ask the Minister to have the public houses open till 11.30 or 12 at night. There is a greater case for moving the work a bit further towards the beginning of the day.</P>
      <P>Pleas have been made here for a general opening and a suggestion was made that the drinking public would make their own hours, that their pocket would regulate their drinking hours and the amount of liquor they would consume. Other countries have been quoted as examples of this.  Many people have instanced France and other continental countries where one can get a drink at any time during the whole 24 hours. That is not a situation that should be encouraged here.  I do not think we should imitate France or any other continental country in that respect because I would hate to see this country become a country of alcoholics.  We have a reputation in this country for being good drinkers and hard drinkers but nobody could say we have a big percentage of alcoholics.  The Irishman who drinks consumes a good deal in about two hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>But he is not an alcoholic. He does not sip all day as some <Col N="872" /> of the people on the Continent do.  I should like to support the view of Deputy Ryan when he talks about the attitude of the trade unions.  The trade unions are violently opposed to the opening of the public houses until 11.30 p.m. and we should have a certain amount of sympathy for the point of view of the workers concerned. The 11.30 closing time for the public houses in Dublin means that the barmen in the majority of cases will not get to their homes till 12.30 a.m. and perhaps later.  I am not as conversant as Deputy Ryan would be with the problem of travelling in Dublin but if the barman does not leave the public house until 12 or maybe later and has to travel to Drimnagh or Ballyfermot, it is nearly one o'clock when he gets home.</P>
      <P>There is also the suggestion in this Bill that the public houses should open on Sunday thus imposing upon the barmen another five hours' work in the public house and another two hours for travelling, cleaning up, and so on. What sort of family life will such a barman have?  I met representatives of the union concerned.  I am sure the Minister did, too, as well as members of the other Parties and their point of view is that they do not want their family life disrupted.  They do not want to be inconvenienced to the extent of spending only a few hours at home, whether for sleeping or enjoying the company of their family.  They are genuine in making that protest.  I do not think they would be so averse to the opening of public houses till 11 o'clock although they would prefer 10.30.  However their point of view ought to be respected because they represent a fairly big section of the Dublin community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put on record that while I believe the existing hours are too early, the proposal in the Bill makes them too late.  I would support the compromise that has been suggested in one or two of the amendments whereby the drinking hours in the winter would be up to 10.30 and in the summer up to 11 o'clock.  There is no convincing argument I could put to the Minister but I would draw attention to the attitude of the trade union and the general public.  In the light of <Col N="873" /> that attitude I believe the closing hours suggested in the amendment, namely, 11 o'clock would be acceptable to the workers, the trade and the drinking public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of those who gave evidence before the Intoxicating Liquor Commission on behalf of the Bray and District Licensed Grocers and Vintners Protection Association.  The hours we sought for Bray and district, including North Wicklow, are practically the same as those recommended in the Commission's findings.  Since the findings of the Commission were published I have not heard anyone dissenting from the hours proposed in the Bill.  The hour of closing, 11.30 in the summertime, from June to September, seems to be the ideal for seaside places like Bray, Arklow, Greystones or any of the other places which cater for tourists such as Glendalough, Roundwood and all around my constituency.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill on behalf of the trade and the general public.  I always considered that in an urban area like Bray it was wrong that people had to travel three miles on Sunday to get a drink.  This caused family disruption because they left home to get a drink and instead of going back to their lunch they stayed on consuming a substantial quantity of liquor and did not return home until closing time on Sunday night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We know why we have the section, the amendment and the Bill.  They are before us as a result of the findings of a Commission set up by the previous Government, the inter-Party Government. The Minister adopted the recommendations of the greater number of the members of that Commission and introduced his Bill.  I have not the slightest doubt that that Bill, were it put to this House a week after it was introduced, would have passed as it stood.  Pressure groups have since become active in relation to members of this House.</P>
      <P>My fear, speaking as a rural Deputy, is that the purpose of the section and the amendment and the Bill itself will be defeated.  I welcomed the extension of the hours for drinking for the rural population on weekdays and on Sundays as I thought it was the emancipation of the rural dweller.  To my amazement, I met a countryman the other day and when I asked him what he thought of the Bill and of the amendment, he said: &ldquo;You are making a mess of the whole thing up there.  Why do you want it at all? Sure we can drink at any hour of the day we like, Sunday or Monday, all over the country.  Now you are focussing attention on it.  You will have the Gardaí raiding and we shall not be able to get a drink at all.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>After 12 or at any hour.  That was the respect in which the licensing laws were held.  If we want to continue in that way, if we want to act like the ostrich and stick our heads in the sand, let us do so.  I want to see the laws enacted by this Oireachtas respected by the public and enforced by the Gárda.  While the populace and the authorities are not behind the laws, they will not be enforced. I am satisfied we shall get the co-operation of the public, the Gárda and the judiciary, as well as the respect of the Irish nation and of our visitors, <Col N="875" /> if we enact this Bill and extend the drinking hours.</P>
      <P>Let me give a small example.  We have an island off our coast in Donegal where there are five public houses.  Prior to the Treaty, we had a police barracks with a sergeant and four policemen on the island.  I am assured that at the old petty sessions court, there was at least one licensing prosecution per month and at least ten summonses for drunkenness.  After the Treaty, the State, in its wisdom, abolished the police barracks on the island.  Now the Gárda have no means of access to the island by surprise.  The public houses there are open almost at any time a person wants a drink.  I spent many nights on the island and I speak from experience.  You can have a drink there at any hour of the night you want it.</P>
      <P>I have never yet, in my 29 years' experience of the district court, come across one charge of drunkenness on the island.  I have never yet come across an assault case arising out of drunkenness.  There are 14 motor vehicles on the island and I have never yet heard of an accident arising out of which a driver has been charged, under Section 30, with driving while drunk.  I have never heard of one prosecution under Section 30 because if a man wants to drink there, he can have it at any hour he wants it.</P>
      <P>Why have we all this talk about drunkenness?  I shall tell you.  A man has only a certain amount to spend on drink, be it 5/-, 10/-, 15/- or £1, in the week.  That is all he has to spend.  Saturday night may be his night of choice to spend it.  He may not, for domestic and other reasons, be able to get to a public house, say, until 9 o'clock on a Saturday night. If it is winter time and if he has to get out at 10 p.m. he will spend his 10/- or 15/- no matter what happens and, if he has not spent it when closing hour comes, what does he do? He buys what, in my opinion, is the most dangerous feature of the whole matter, namely, the bottle for the hip pocket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same thing happens after 12 o'clock at night dances.  If a man could go in and sip his drink and <Col N="876" /> dance, come back and finish his drink, you would never see drunkenness, but we cannot do that.  The result is that people who want spirits at a dance have it in their hip pocket.  They are drinking it undiluted out of the bottle and one knows the effect spirits, on such an occasion, has on an individual.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, speaking as a rural Deputy, not to be persuaded by any person but to stick to the hours suggested in this Bill, namely, 11.30 at night during certain months of the summer season and 11 o'clock at night during the winter.  I also appeal to him to insist that the hours he has set out for Sunday opening&mdash;I think they are 12.30 p.m. to 2 p.m.&mdash;be accepted.  It does not arise on this but the amendment is sensible and will suit rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is not fair for a rural Deputy to give his views on what should take place in the city of Dublin.  However I might mention that, in the case of Deputies from rural Ireland who have to spend part of the year in Dublin, there are certain occasions such as an All-Ireland Final or a Fianna Fáil or a Fine Gael Árd Fheis, when rural constituents come up and want a drink.  I know of no Deputy who cannot find ways and means of getting them a drink.  I should much prefer to see them enabled to have a drink, respecting our laws and taking it legitimately.</P>
    <P>I have much sympathy with Deputy Ryan and Deputy Corish with regard to the trade unions.  We should bear in mind that, according to the law of this State at the moment, one is entitled to go into a restaurant and demand a hot meal up to midnight.  In how many hotels will you get a hot meal after 10 p.m.?  Although they are bound to serve it, they do not remain open.</P>
    <P>If public houses in the city were permitted to remain open late at night, possibly some of them might decide to close early while others might decide to remain open, depending entirely on the clientele they had built up.  While it is very unfair, as I say, for country Deputies to suggest what the law in the city should be, if <Col N="877" /> Deputies on all sides of the House representing Dublin city feel that the public houses should close at 10.30 p.m., then certainly I would bow to their suggestion; but so far as rural Ireland is concerned, I appeal to the Minister to stick to the decision he has made and to the hours suggested in the Bill and not let any pressure groups persuade him to change them.</P>
    <P>I know certain pressure groups for whom I have a great respect.  I know that they are now endeavouring to persuade Deputies to vote against the late closing of public houses.  If those gentlemen had done their duty over the past 20 years and assisted the Guards by reporting breaches of the licensing laws, there would be no necessity now for them to exercise pressure on people who wish to exercise their right to vote as they feel their consciences justify them in voting.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine for these gentlemen to hold up their hands and say: &ldquo;You will ruin Ireland by permitting the people to drink after hours&rdquo;.  We are drinking after hours but I never heard of one of them reporting the drinking after hours to the Guards. Their opinion should not weigh too heavily with the Minister.  The Minister will agree with me that people in rural Ireland who work late at night are entitled to go into a public house. As Deputy Corry said, the public house is the clubhouse of the labouring man and he should be permitted to stay there at night.</P>
    <P>Listening to and reading this debate one would imagine that once the Bill becomes an Act and the public houses open at 10.30 in the morning and close at 11.30 at night, every man will run in at 10.30 a.m. when they open and remain there until 11.30 p.m., or go in every night at 8 p.m. and stay there until 11.30 p.m.  A man can only afford to go in one or two nights a week, if he lives down the country and we should give him a reasonable hour.  In some parishes in Ireland, we still have old time and 11.30 p.m. is not a late hour and has never been a late hour.  I heard some Deputy interrupt and say that in Dublin the people are up and about their business at 7.30 a.m.  In rural Ireland, there is <Col N="878" /> not much use shaking hay at 7.30 a.m. when it is still covered with dew, but you have to stick it out sometimes until 10.30 at night.  Nature prescribes the hours which you have to work in rural Ireland; the trade unions usually do it in Dublin.  We have no control over the working hours in rural Ireland so that is a very important point to bear in mind.</P>
    <P>I speak from my own experience.  I speak as a Deputy, as a dweller in rural Ireland who is not ashamed to say that he takes a drink and takes it in a public house, and I feel I should be entitled to have a drink without breaking the law up to 11 o'clock at night. I speak also as a solicitor who has defended many publicans.  We have reached the stage now where automatically the fine is ten shillings.  Men found on the premises, if they are represented by a solicitor, are given D.P.O.A.&mdash;dismissed under the Probation of Offenders Act.  If they are not defended by a solicitor, they are fined 2/6.  Is that not a disgrace?</P>

      <P>That is exactly what is happening.  We are drinking until 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning and we say &ldquo;Cheap enough.&rdquo;  That is not the way in which we want the laws to be respected.  I do believe that we shall get the co-operation of the publicans and the public if we have these hours.  I have discussed it with many publicans and they say they are in agreement with the penalty which the Minister suggests under the Bill, namely, endorsement after the first prosecution.  As a matter of fact, there is one thing with which they do not agree, that is, the penalty of £1 to be imposed on persons found on licensed premises.  They think it should be slightly higher and I am inclined to agree with them.  There is the old point that if you have no receiver, you will have no thief.  If you have no drinker after hours, you will have no breach of the licensing laws.  If you could deter him by a stiff penalty, you would get somewhere.  The penalty proposed is a minimum of £1 and a maximum of £5.  If this Bill goes through, I shall have the greatest respect <Col N="879" /> for our licensing laws and I think they will be respected by the people.</P>
      <P>There is another point which arises on the section.  It is the amendment of the Schedule where it is left to the district justices and to their discretion to grant general area exemption orders. I think it is in Section 16 of the 1927 Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

For instance, if there is a Pattern down in some part of Cork, or a feis in Roscommon or Donegal, or an influx of visitors to a seaside resort on a Sunday, the district justice, on an application from a number of publicans or the Garda superintendent, may grant certain hours of opening.</P>

As I said, the Minister is a Deputy representing the city of Dublin.  He knows more about conditions here, as I am sure do Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Ryan and others, than I, but as a rural Deputy my mind is open on the amendment.

My only consideration when speaking originally was the workers concerned in the trade.</P>
      <P>Since the Taoiseach, in his wisdom, has decided that this is a Government decision, arising out of the findings of the Commission, that therefore there will not be a free vote of the House and that the Bill will be passed, I find myself in a dilemma.  Apart from the Commission and the findings of the Commission, I wonder would the Minister, with the advent of the municipal elections, ensure that the same ballot paper be used to get an expression from the people.  With regard to Dublin, I believe it is essential to have some extension of the licensing laws as they exist at the moment.  Irrespective of any pressure that may be brought to bear upon me, I hope there will be uniformity of hours.  Having regard to the facilities available in Dublin, one has only to ring a taxi and within four or five minutes, one can be outside the city for a drink.  I have nothing against those people who have very wellconducted inns and houses in the county.  I believe they will lose nothing.</P>
      <P>Instead of taking a taxi and leaving their &ldquo;locals&rdquo; at closing time, people will decide to go out at 8 o'clock and they may make a night of it, if they feel like it.  I know the city and I know the licensing laws and, like Deputy Corry, I may have found myself on premises later than I should have been. I believe that the hours will not make any difference in so far as the city or the city limits are concerned.  I sincerely believe that there will be no loss to those who are affected, say, in the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  Eventually, the conditions will regularise themselves and they may find that instead of losing trade, they will gain trade, because people, instead of rushing out for an hour, will go out for a couple of hours not only to enjoy the liquor but also to enjoy the other amenities which these people provide in their houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While my suggestion as to getting the feeling of the people concerned may not be feasible, I am sure the <Col N="881" /> Minister and the Government do not want to force legislation on the country if they feel that the country as a whole, or the majority of the people, would not welcome it.  I was in the United States when they brought in a law to prohibit drinking.  Even the youngest person to-day knows the tragedy and the dangers that ensued from that.  I am not suggesting that the same thing would happen here. Nevertheless, taking into consideration our temperament, it is a well-known fact that if we are told we cannot do this or do that, there are many people who will risk doing it.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the new law becomes operative, every precaution will be taken to see that it is enforced.  The good example should be shown and no breaches should be tolerated.</P>

      <P>One can get quite an amount of amusement listening to the various views given by different Deputies.  One thing sticks out, however, that is, the two different worlds which exist today between what one might call the official class and the ordinary worker, particularly in the rural areas.  Deputy Corish took us to task.  In the earlier days, I was foolish enough to come to this House fairly early in the morning, thinking that I could get work done before the Dáil assembled at half-past ten.  I never yet saw any fellow from the city there. He was in bed.  If you get up in Dublin at the hour at which we have to get up in the rural areas, the landlady will say that you are waking the house in the middle of the night.</P>
      <P>Nothing amuses me more than Deputy Ryan's and Deputy Dillon's proposal to open the pub doors at closing time.  The publican has the clock on the wall and he will see what the closing time is.  If he opens the door and the fellow sees the door open, he will think it is not closing time and walk in.  Deputy Ryan wants that man fined and the publican not fined at all.</P>

      <P>I had experience of the pressure groups to which Deputy Carroll referred.  It is over 12 years since I got relief in the House for the ordinary rural publican.  I saw the pressure groups go to work and I saw a flood of complaints from every crank in the country about it.  Six weeks afterwards, I brought in a Bill which closed the city public houses in Dublin and the pressure groups were howling and shouting about the moral law and all the rest of it.  The whole world would be wrong if the country boys got a drink in a pub on a Sunday. They did not use their pressure then to close the city as well as the country houses.  They kept their mouths shut but now the same pressure groups are coming in here, approaching Deputies to see that the city pubs are kept open.  That is why I say that up to the present Dublin has been running the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of us found ourselves in a rather funny position when this matter was being discussed at the Commission. I hate injuring any man, particularly in his business, but evidence was given at the Commission that publicans within a circle of four or five miles from the city would suffer if the <i>bona fide</i> trade was abolished. Some of us did feel it, but there has to be some change in it now, and in that change there will be no drink for the fellow who can travel a distance of three miles in a motor car.  I am convinced that if we are to have respect for enforcement of the law, we must have a unified closing time and <Col N="883" /> there is no use in approaching the problem in any other way.  Let that unified hour be 11 or 12 o'clock, but for my part I would like to have it as close as possible to the hour at present enjoyed by the upper class, the gentlemen with the motor cars who can drink up until 12 o'clock at night. That is why I am in favour of the 11.30 p.m. closing and, if I had my way, I would make it 11.30 the whole year around because there is no difference between summer and winter in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish is very anxious about the hours that a city person would work, very anxious that such a person would not be upset in any way.  I know people earning their livelihood in my own district who have to go in to work at 12 o'clock at night and they are glad to have that work and thank God for it.  They work in different shifts.  There is nothing to stop the Dublin people concerned holding a general meeting and making the city a closed borough, as far as organisation is concerned, and making a uniform closing hour of 10 p.m. or 10.30 p.m.  We shall not cry after them if they do that, and again I repeat that to have different closing hours is wrong.  I myself made a mistake about it but I am man enough to admit it.</P>
    <P>We all know that during the summer months men are working in the rural areas until 9 o'clock at night.  They are paid overtime for it now, thank God, but there was a time when they were not.  The ordinary small farmer saving hay with his family is entitled to get into a public house when he finishes his work and I would appeal to the Minister, if for nothing else except what Deputy O'Donnell told us about the islands in his area, to have consideration for that problem.  He told us he would not go to the islands any more if the hours were changed and I think on that account alone the Minister ought to stick to the hours they have there, and endeavour to have a uniform closing hour.</P>
    <P>As I said before, these groups had representatives on the Commission and they signed the report.  Despite anything the Minister said the other day, there was nothing to stop these people <Col N="884" /> proposing an amendment at the Commission and seeing what support they would get for it, but instead the representatives of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association did sign the majority report.</P>
    <P>That Commission was set up by the inter-Party Government and various Deputies, including myself, served on it.  In addition, various members of the public representing different interests were called in on it, and I am sure the people I mention were representing the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that he would be fined and not the publican. To my mind, those things are foolish. I am glad that the Minister has taken the stand that he has taken on this matter and that the Bill will go through the House with the recommendations of the Commission.  We all know what people down the country think.  For the past 12 years, since this House refused to do justice to the rural community, the rural community and the Garda have decided that they will not enforce an unjust law.  That has been going on for 12 years and I think it would be very hard, even now, to get respect for a law that has been held in contempt for 10 or 12 years.  It cannot be denied by any Deputy here that the law has been held in contempt.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to delay the House but there is one other thing I would like to say.  Some people from the ecountry go into publichouses in Dublin and they have noticed that about 20 minutes before closing time, the gentleman behind the bar says: <Col N="886" />&ldquo;Time gentlemen, please&rdquo; as a reminder that they should call again. That is repeated every three or four minutes until closing time.  That is my experience of the Dublin publican and his anxiety to close up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration of what is involved in this section and the amendments to it demands certain specific inquiry at the outset.  As far as I can see, they deal with two matters&mdash; the first being the change in the existing closing hours from 10.30 p.m. to 11.30 p.m.  The other is implied in the first one, namely, that when the hours are changed, the <i>bona fide</i> trade will have been disposed of?  Before any change is brought about, or should be brought about, the necessity for it should be clear and the demand for it should be generally noticeable throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The fact that one Government or another set up a Commission to inquire into certain matters and that that Commission brought in certain recommendations does not mean that the recommendations ought to be adopted either in whole or in part.  I am not in the slightest influenced by the fact that the Commission which brought in this report was a Commission set up under the Government in which my Party played a big part.  One has to have regard to the evidence put before that Commission, to how it was treated and how it was compared with conflicting evidence given and the results brought about.</P>
      <P>As far as I can gather from the explanatory memorandum or from the Minister's Second Reading speech, there is no serious demand and no serious necessity for this change from 10.30 p.m. to 11.30 p.m.  If it is a proposal designed to achieve uniformity, that uniformity could be achieved by completely abolishing the <i>bona fide</i> trade and leaving the hours as they stand, 10 p.m. in winter and 10.30 p.m. in the summer.  Why is it necessary, in order to achieve the abolition of what is a relatively small trade, to impose something on the whole of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am of the view that the Government, in this regard, are engaging in <Col N="887" /> what almost inevitably leads to faulty results&mdash;compromise.  I have no time for compromise in matters of public concern. As I have already said, I am not disposed to be influenced by what the findings of any Commission may be.  I am not disposed to be influenced by the smug references to disregard for the law and the bringing of the law into disrepute.  Can any Deputy here or can the Minister say how it will be possible to enforce a closing hour of 11.30 p.m. rather than a closing hour of 10.30 p.m.?  If the law is there, why can it not be enforced in relation to any particular hour, even 9.30 p.m.?  All this talk of lack of ability to enforce the law is utter codology.  It can be enforced at 10.30 p.m. or 10 p.m. just as well as at 11 p.m. or 11.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment accept the suggestion that the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, which from its various branches and from its general headquarters has made representations to us, can be regarded as a pressure group.  The motives of such an organisation cannot and should not be questioned and should not be made the subject matter of derision here.  I think it was Deputy Loughman who said that the proposed hours in the Bill were acceptable to the people and were just and, therefore, can be enforced.  How were the previous hours unacceptable to the people?  How were they unjust and how could they, in consequence, fail to be enforced?</P>
    <P>I do not see any merit in the argument that the hours should be extended in order to assist our tourist trade.  The licensing laws of any other country&mdash;even of those which engage in the tourist trade to a greater extent than we do&mdash;are not altered to suit our coming.  I should hate to think that this country would come to be described in the tourist brochures of the countries of Europe and the world as a country in which it is possible to drink to a later hour than in any other country.</P>
    <P>It has been argued here by Deputy Corry and suggested by Deputy Moher&mdash;and indeed by Deputy <Col N="888" /> O'Donnell of my own Party&mdash;that the rural deweller should be entitled to get a drink up to 11.30 p.m. and that it would be easier for him to keep the law.  Deputy Moher, in a bitter aside in defence of the rural dweller, when Deputy Corish suggested that Dublin people got up earlier than people in the country, said that Deputy Corish must never have lived in a dairying area where people begin work at 5.30 a.m. Very good.  I accept that statement unreservedly from Deputy Moher.  But why, in the name of goodness, does Deputy Moher want a closing hour as late as 11.30 p.m. for a person who has to rise at 5 a.m.?  I should have thought, having regard to the natural need for sleep, that the person who has to get up at 5.30 a.m. will not be able to give a reasonable return the next day if he stays drinking until 11.30 the night before.</P>
    <P>That is an aspect of this proposed closing at 11.30 p.m. which should have some weight with the Minister and the Government&mdash;indeed, it is something to which the general public should direct their minds&mdash;the capacity of a person to give a fair return for the salary or wages he receives on the day after spending an evening drinking until 11.30 p.m., not to mention the possibility of 12 o'clock with this meal business.  It is all very fine for people whose work is not easily subject to supervision or to examination for the first half of the next day.</P>
    <P>Again, it must have a domestic effect, either through keeping people out later, on the one hand, or the spending of money necessary for the upkeep of the household, on the other. At present, I should say, that the general practice of the average drinker who has a few drinks is to go to his public house about 9 p.m. or 9.30 p.m. in the summer time and finish at 10.30 p.m.  He spends about an hour or an hour and a half there, not necessarily drinking all the time but engaging in conversation and, in other words, using it as a club.  What will he do now?  Will he go again at 9.30 p.m. and stay until 11.30 p.m., which must necessarily cost him more?  Or will he take the other line and say: &ldquo;Now that the pubs are open until 11.30 p.m.  I shall be able to go to a <Col N="889" /> picture which I can leave about 10 o'clock and I shall still have about one and a half hours for the few drinks&rdquo;?  In that case, he would have the double expenditure of the picture, or whatever entertainment he chooses, and of the drink afterwards.  It must take such people some time to go home.  I think there is a good deal to be said for the point made by Deputy Ryan about what could happen, and probably will happen, in regard to public transport around that time.</P>
    <P>I do not think that a heavier fine on the customer for a breach of the licensing laws meets the case, because a person who stays on for some reason or other with a drink in his hand may not be the person entirely responsible for the breach.  I would leave the fines as they are in relation to ordinary breaches, but where it could be shown that a person in absolutely closed hours had persuaded the publican to let him in.  I would have a substantial fine.</P>
    <P>We must consider the situation when an all-the-year-round customer arrives at a public house during closed hours and knocks at the door.  The knock is answered, because it might be any kind of important message.  There are two people standing at the hall door&mdash;the publican inside facing his customer on the outside&mdash;and the customer is pleading with the publican.  The customer might even be a person in a privileged position.  We are not unaccustomed to such happenings, where patronage plays a part in the influencing of mankind.  In those circumstances, the customer is using his position of patronage and his position as a customer to put the publican into the awkward position of letting him in. Then he is caught.  In that case, the fine on the customer should be substantially higher than that on the publican.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the speeches on the Second Reading and, so far, on Committee, one would imagine that every public house in this country was full of customers after the regular closing hours.  Such is not the case. I come from a constituency where public houses are situated remotely <Col N="890" /> enough from Garda supervision to make it possible for them to be open. I think it will be accepted generally that if a fact-finding body were to go over a certain selected part of rural Ireland to examine this position for themselves, they would find that the majority of public houses here close at the proper hour and that those that remain open are frequented by the same people all the year round.  Moreover, they would find in the majority of cases that those public houses which remained open were owned by publicans who felt they could remain open with impunity, by reason of the patronage they enjoyed from some source or other.</P>
    <P>I should not like it to go out that we are a nation of alcoholics or hard drinkers.  We certainly can take our drinks and in the vast majority of cases, hold them.  For that reason. let us keep to the time we have and not make this horrible admission of failure, this admission of complete inability to see that the laws were enforced right up to the present time.</P>
    <P>I assert that if we cannot keep the pubs uniformly closed at 10 p.m. or 10.30 p.m. under the existing law, we shall not be able to do it at 11 p.m. or 11.30 p.m. More particularly, if that is the reason underlying this change, if tourism is the reason, or even partially the reason, then it is disgraceful that this Government should lend themselves to the proposition that this country should be regarded by visitors as one in which they can drink for a longer time than they can drink in their own countries.</P>

      <P>When one stands up to speak on this amendment, having listened to the debate from 10.30 this morning, one feels that it is nonsensical to throw out a suggestion, or to make a speech, because we have been told by the Taoiseach that this is the Report of the Commission, and so far as the Government are concerned, they are carrying it out.  What then is the use in anyone on this side of the House, or on any side of the House, standing up and saying: &ldquo;This change or that change or the other change, should be made,&rdquo; when the Minister, on <Col N="891" /> behalf of the Government, and the Taoiseach say: &ldquo;This is the Report of the Commission; this is the Bill; we have a majority and this will be the law?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>May I say that many commissions were set up from time to time in this country?  Were the recommendations of each of those commissions carried out?  Not at all.  Why then should not helpful amendments be put forward to this Bill?  In the House at the moment we have people representing the business end of the matter; the legal profession is well represented; we have Deputies for Dublin city and Deputies from rural Ireland; Deputies who are members of the Pioneer Association; and Deputies, like myself, who take an odd drink.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a bit of shame. Surely the Minister and the Government should not have closed minds on this matter.  To give an example, Deputy Corry spoke for less than half an hour and he said that the legislation enacted here in 1942 was legislation for Dublin alone, and that it was the damnation of rural Ireland. On that occasion, the very same Deputy Corry had to vote for that legislation which he has been crying about ever since.  The same thing is happening today as happened in 1942. The Commission have decided and the Fianna Fáil Government, with their majority in the House, say: &ldquo;This will be the law, whether it is right or wrong.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that all this talk, and all this speech-making, is a vote of censure on the Garda authorities. That should not be the case because the 1942 legislation was such that it was impossible for the Garda authorities to enforce it throughout Ireland, for the simple reason that it was not uniform.  No matter what hours are decided&mdash;and I shall give my views on what they should be&mdash;may I appeal to the Minister to let them be the same throughout the 26 counties over which we have jurisdiction?  If there is the slightest difference between <Col N="892" /> one area and another, it will be impossible for the Garda authorities to enforce the law.  It is our job to make the laws, and it is their job to enforce them.  Do not think that I am defending the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister and to his predecessor and all the Ministers for Justice before him, that there is not a Deputy who during his time did not approach the Department of Justice and the Minister in cases where a member of the Garda did his duty.  If the Garda or the sergeant did his duty, he might be shifted far away, with the result that they said to themselves: &ldquo;If I am wise, I shall not bother at all because I previously tried to uphold the law and was badly thanked for it, I was shifted away because I tried to do so.&rdquo; Therefore, we in this House are far more responsible than any other section of the people for the fact that the law was not carried out.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to emphasise to the Minister that no matter what hours are decided upon and no matter what decision is reached, they should be uniform for every public house throughout Ireland.  If that is not the case, we shall drift back to where we were previously.  Listening to speeches and reading reports in the daily papers of the speeches made here, one would imagine we were a country of drunken &ldquo;bowsies&rdquo;, that every one of us was watching to get into a public house at midnight or 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning.  That is not the case at all and we are belittling our people by suggesting it is so.  I am not, never was, and, I am afraid, never shall be, a member of the Pioneer Association, but I protest against that Association being referred to as a pressure group. They are not a pressure group and I believe people who refer to them as such are beneath contempt.  They are far from being a pressure group. They have nothing to gain.  They are people who have a belief, who are sincere and honest about it and who have proved it.  To refer to them as a pressure group is disgusting.  I despise such statements.  They are beneath contempt and should not be made in this House.</P>
    <P>We have heard different suggestions about what the hours should be.  In my honest view, 10.30 p.m. in either <Col N="893" /> city or rural area is late enough for anybody.  I believe that not a drink should be sold across the counter after 10.30 p.m.  In other countries the moment closing time comes the law is enforced, no further drink is served and the customers must leave the premises.  The closing hour is late enough for city people and it is just suitable for the people in rural Ireland. Deputy O'Donnell suggested that men work in the fields in rural areas in summer time, shaking out hay, at 10.30 p.m.  Did anybody ever hear such a suggestion?</P>

      <P>Hay must be gathered in before 9.30 p.m. or the dew will catch it..  I honestly believe that 10.30 p.m. is late enough.  Public houses should not be open any later. They should be compelled to close at that time.  That closing hour should be uniformly observed throughout the country.  It will be to the advantage of the people.  Any man who has finished work at 9 or 9.30 has plenty of time to go to the pub and have a drink or two until 10.30 p.m.  Let the law be that they close at that hour and not a minute later.</P>
      <P>Of course, up to now it was very difficult to know what the laws were. At a certain seaside resort in the South of Ireland, in the month of June, an American visitor noticed that the public houses kept going all night.  He asked a Garda: &ldquo;Will you tell me at what time the saloons close here?&rdquo; The answer he got was: &ldquo;About the end of October, Sir.&rdquo;  That was the position but let it not be the position any longer.  Let the Minister not say to me&mdash;because I shall not believe him &mdash;that it would be impossible to make them close at 10.30 p.m.  If the law is respected as it should be, and is uniform throughout the country on that matter, even if you state 3 p.m. in the Bill, that should be enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no use to suggest, as Deputy O'Donnell did, that the fines should be heavier.  In his profession, the legal profession, he is a good man and if he had a case in six months' time he would ask the justice to reduce a fine on the ground that it was too heavy.  That <Col N="894" /> kind of thing is done and will continue to be done; the sympathy of the justices would be in that direction.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has said that the report of the Commission is embodied in the Bill and that there will be no change.  My appeal is to have the closing hour 10.30 p.m.  I believe 11.30 p.m. is too late.  A man who has to work next day, who leaves the public house at 10.30 will retire at 11.30 or 12, allowing time to go home and have supper.  If he has to get up at 7.30 or 8 a.m. he would need to be in bed at 12 o'clock.  It is as easy to enforce the law at 10.30 as it is at 11 p.m.</P>

I should like to say in respect to the views which have been expressed during the course of this morning's debate that they only go to show the complexity of the question we are discussing.

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be all to the good but, as I say, it goes to show the complexity of the question we are now discussing.  We are discussing 11 amendments, all pertaining to the question of the hours during which drinking may take place on weekdays and, so far, we have got nothing from the Opposition that we can regard as representative.  We here are standing behind the recommendations which are contained in the Bill.</P>
      <P>As I said early on, we are not accepting in their entirety the recommendations of the Commission.  We have altered those in some slight respects.  We did not accept the suggestion or recommendation that the hours should be the same all the year round.  We made what could be regarded as a wise and reasonable compromise when we decided that we could accept the recommendations of the Commission for four months of the year and reduced them by a half-hour in respect to the remaining eight months of what might be regarded as the winter period.</P>
      <P>Statements have been made by Deputy Ryan and others with respect to the long hours this will impose on the assistants.  I can best quote Deputy Belton who is not only a Deputy but also a man who is interested in the licensed trade.  Deputy Belton made this statement in relation to the publicans' assistants which I quote from Col. 124, Vol. 178 of the Official Report of the 18th November, 1959:</P>
      <P>They are in a catering trade and must work and carry on their employment when the rest of the people have their leisure hours or are on holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a fair statement of the situation in respect to those who are engaged in the licensed business.  When we talk and try to jerk tears from the eyes of the people who are listening by suggesting that these poor assistants <Col N="897" /> are deprived of their family life by reason of these long hours, we seem to forget that there are very many other occupations in which people work very much longer hours than the hours suggested in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I was recently at a dinner given by a trade union organisation at which there were 700 people.  I was struck by the fact that there were about 70 or 100 girls attending to the needs of the guests at the dinner.  The dinner did not finish until some little time after 12 o'clock and those girls were still there.  That was a trade union dinner and those girls were members of a trade union.  They were working within the specified hours permitted by the trade union.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred similarly to the excessive hours, as he called them, that the assistants had to work.  Once again I find myself trying to correct these misstatements that are being made and I hope my remarks will not have to be repeated.  This was mentioned last week&mdash;and strange to say it was mentioned by a Labour Deputy, Deputy Larkin.  These hours are governed by the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act of 1938 and the assistants do not have to work more than 48 hours per week, which are trade union hours, and they are entitled then to work eight hours' overtime.  Therefore saying that this is enforced slavery for the assistants in licensed premises is a misstatement of the facts and I hope it will not be repeated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan also spoke about the extra half hour and said that if there were a differentiation&mdash;which I personally do not favour&mdash;between the county boroughs and the rural areas, there would be a mad rush from the city to the country during that half hour.  Of course we know that is not what would happen.  What would happen probably is that the people who would want late drinking would be there long before the half hour; they would get out there early because of the fact that they would have an extra half hour to drink.  That is the way I would imagine that would be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan also suggested&mdash;in fact he has an amendment down in <Col N="898" /> this connection&mdash;a later hour of opening in the morning.  The opening hour contained in the Bill is 10.30. He suggested it should be 11.  The Deputy, being a legal man, must know that if the publican so desires he can keep his premises closed in the morning until 11 o'clock.  He need not open till 11 or 12 or he need not open at all if he does not like.  To legislate for the later hour is quite unnecessary. Half-past ten is the hour which has been there over a considerable period of time.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made by Deputy Ryan to the fact that customers who are found on the premises after hours get off with a half-crown fine or some minor type of penalty.  I am bringing in an amendment to ensure that persons found on the premises in future will be liable to a minimum fine of £1&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should increase it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and a maximum fine of £5.  We realise that very often the publican is the victim of circumstances over which he may not have a great deal of control and we are going to impose a penalty on the person who is responsible for causing the publican to break the law.</P>
      <P>A case in point is that mentioned by Deputy O'Donnell.  Deputy O'Donnell strongly favours the hours in the Bill and other Deputies have more or less supported him in that respect.  When we come to consider this thing on its merits it will be found that the hours I am recommending, the hours in the Bill, will be those most suitable to meet the needs of the persons who like to take a drink after their day's work. Deputy O'Donnell also said that not only are the fines imposed ridiculously low in some cases but that very often the Probation of Offenders Act is applied.  I do not think the Deputy is correct in that.</P>

      <P>Deputy Carroll said he had supported the Second Reading but, now, as a result of pressure put on him, he is having qualms of conscience.  I recommend the Deputy to look at the recommendations of the representatives of the Pioneer Association. I think his qualms of conscience will be eased. They, too, found themselves in that position.  They had to accept an alternative which they did not strongly favour but they preferred to accept it rather than to have the <i>bona fide</i> trade carried on.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lindsay talked about the Commission, and other matters.  Why did the Government of that day set up the Commission, if they did not think there was a serious situation which needed remedial attention?  It was set up, as he himself remarked, in the time of the Coalition Government. The terms of reference given to that Commission were to inquire into the operation of the law relating to the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor and to make recommendations.  That is all they did.</P>
      <P>The Commission sat for 12 months. They listened to evidence from a very large number of witnesses and, having heard these witnesses, they made recommendations.  By and large, the recommendations are reasonable.  We are not accepting them in their entirety but we are accepting them to a very large extent.  We realise that, because of the long period during which the Commission sat to inquire into this whole subject and the very large number of witnesses from every possible walk of life who were heard, they made decisions after very full investigation.  By and large, the recommendations in the Bill are recommendations over which we ought to stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the varying views expressed in the course of the discussion, I suggest Deputies should read the 11 amendments on the Order Paper in the names of Deputies on the Fine Gael side of the House, as well as Independent and Labour Deputies. <Col N="900" /> If they read down these amendments, they will see that they, too, vary in the same respect as the views expressed in the course of the debate.  No two amendments agree with each other. From that point of view alone, I strongly recommend the House to agree to the hours outlined in the Bill because I could not accept any of the amendments.  There is only one there in the name of Deputy Russell which suggests the deletion of the words &ldquo;half-past&rdquo; towards which I would have a leaning, but I cannot on my own say I am prepared to accept it.  All I can say is that I shall be prepared to have the views expressed by all Deputies in the course of the discussion examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to the Commission's Report in connection with the recommendation of 11.30 p.m. all the year round. I presume, as a compromise, the Minister has brought in the hours of 11.30 p.m. in this Bill for four months.  Is he prepared to consider extending that hour of 11.30 p.m. to the period during Summer Time which now runs from mid-April to the first week in October?  I assure the Minister that, if he makes the four months final, it is more than likely that pressure will be brought to bear upon him later to extend that period.  I think he should by some means or another bring in an amendment, if necessary, on Report Stage, to make the summer period opening to 11.30 p.m. coincide with new time. There is just as strong an argument to bring in the month of May under the 11.30 p.m. closing hour as there is for the month of June.</P>
      <P>As far as rural Ireland is concerned, I understand that many people have very strong views on the matter and that even pressure groups have indicated their view that the Minister should go further than the four months and extend the hour to the period of what is known as Summer Time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I listened to the <Col N="901" /> Minister in his recent contribution and particularly towards the close of his remarks, I felt he had come around to a more open frame of mind after having listened to the arguments advanced in support of various amendments to this section.  He spoke earlier of the complexity of the measure and said that that fact was being brought home to him.  It was quite obvious to us from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; that it would be a complex measure.  In our decision to allow freedom of expression on these benches in relation to this Bill, we were conscious that it was a complex measure and a measure on which there were many differing views.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the amendments and to the fact that they revealed a variety of views in relation to closing hours.  If his Party had been permitted the same freedom of expression, there is no doubt that we would probably have an even greater variety of views.</P>
      <P>In introducing a Bill such as this, with the vital effect it has on the whole social life of the community, it is only natural that, varied as are the habits of our people in different parts of the country, it should be impossible to arrive at unanimity in support of any particular programme.</P>
      <P>I, too, resent very much reference to pressure groups in relation to this Bill. What is our function in this House? We are not sent here merely to speak our own minds.  We are sent here as public representatives.  The public are quite entitled to exercise any influence they desire in relation to any measure brought into this House.  In fact, I am amazed more pressure was not brought to bear on public representatives in relation to this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If bodies or individuals are concerned with the provisions of this Bill for whatever motives you may like&mdash; whether it be for particular reasons, because of the effect it will have on their employment, because of interest in the drinking habits of our people in the case of bodies such as the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association &mdash;they are entitled at this stage of the Bill, or any other stage, to approach their public representatives to give voice to their opinions.  Is it not helpful to the members of the House <Col N="902" /> to have organisations and sections of the people who will come to them and tender their advice before it becomes law?  The time when it is possible for us to amend this Bill is the proper time for us to hearken to this advice and to see how much there is in it which could be of assistance in evolving ultimately a Bill which will meet the requirements of the time.</P>
    <P>I am aghast at some of the statements made in support of the Bill.  I am aghast at the deifying of the people who have been breaking the law down the years.  Whether the law was right or wrong, it should not have been broken.  We have heard Deputies say that they have been in public houses at the dead of night and have seen their neighbours there drinking to a late hour.  One would think that every person engaged in the licensed trade has been breaking the law and that the Government in office had shut their eyes to the fact or, if not, had been incapable of administering the law.</P>
    <P>We all know there are reputable people in the licensed trade who down through the years have complied with the law and shut their doors at the proper time.  It is not fair to those engaged in the trade to assert that anybody who complied with the law was a &ldquo;sissy&rdquo;.  I live on licensed premises and I know what the life is like and I assert that in every town throughout the country, there are people who have complied with the law.</P>
    <P>In discussing the hours of closing proposed in the Bill, I want to say emphatically that, in my opinion and in the opinion of the majority of the people I have discussed it with, 11.30 p.m. is too late.  First of all, in recent years, there has been a complete change in the lives of our people. Today there are many demands on the pocket of the worker or the small farmer.  There are many other demands on him for the expenditure of any money he may have to spare.  He could well spend what money is available to him for the consumption of drink in shorter hours than those proposed in this measure.  It would be inimical to the increased production which is demanded by all Parties and Governments as so necessary for the <Col N="903" /> survival of our country to extend the hours.</P>
    <P>We all know that there is an increase in delinquency and that many people who desire to get a quiet night's sleep are denied it by the hooliganism that goes on not alone in the cities but in the towns and now even in rural parts.  Anything designed to give any benediction to later hours will not be helpful towards cleaning up that kind of hooliganism. The people who live and work in licensed premises are entitled to reasonable hours and in most of the instances brought to my notice, they favour closing at 11 o'clock.</P>
    <P>I agree that doing away with the <i>bona fide</i> trade is a good thing and it was overdue, but the Government could do well to carry out, as the Minister has just informed us, a revision of their proposals in consequence of the views expressed here.  I again assert that we are not influenced by pressure groups in our decision, but we are influenced to some extent by the views they express because they are quite entitled to express them.  I think it would be good if the Government, as they have done in relation to Sunday hours, looked again at this and accepted a compromise closing hour of 11 p.m.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good to hear kind words being expressed about members of the licensed trade because there are people who try to hold them up as vultures who go out into the street and try to get people into their public houses and make them drunk, or allow them to get drunk so long as the money is in their pockets.  People who speak in that strain know nothing whatever about the licensed trade.  They forget that the people who hold licences to sell intoxicating liquor are hardworking, conscientious and charitable people. They are always the first to receive appeals for local or national charities. By virtue of the fact that there is such huge competition in the licensed trade, they find that much of their profits do not find their way into their banking account, if they are lucky enough to have one.  Very often, they have to deal with a type of <Col N="904" /> customer with whom a draper or a hardware merchant or others do not have to deal.  They have to deal sometimes with people who decide that the publican or his assistants are fair game for abuses of one kind or another.</P>
      <P>I should like to see in this Bill some provision to help the licensed traders to defend themselves, or to ensure that the laws of the country will defend them, against people who on certain occasions will even use force.  The Commission which sat for many months recommended an 11.30 p.m. closing at night.  With that, I am in wholehearted agreement and I speak as one who has taken drink at both sides of the counter and I offer no apologies for that.  We hear too much about drunkenness and about the danger of being drunk.  It is very hard to know when a man is drunk.  There is the saying &ldquo;He is not drunk who to the floor will fall and rise and ask for more, but drunk is he who prostrate lies without the strength to drink or rise.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>What we desire in this House is by our contributions to give to the consuming public and to the people who hold licences a law which they can respect and a law outside of which there will be no necessity to go to do their legitimate business. We hear a lot of talk about extending the hours for drinking but these people are talking through their hats.  They have not read the Bill and they have not read the Report of the Commission. The hours of drinking are being curtailed and curtailed at a time when television is coming and will play a very important part in the future of the licensed trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know, those of us who are interested and who took the trouble to find out, that in many towns in England and in many streets, there are derelict public houses, public houses which did a reasonably good trade up to a few years ago.  That goes to show quite clearly that the public house is not the den of iniquity it has been held up to be by some foolish people.  In this country and every other place where people meet, it has <Col N="905" /> become a place for social chats where people enjoy the sociable atmosphere and the amenities provided.  In England, since the advent of television, many public houses have closed down and that is the greatest indication that the public house is a place where people meet to talk and have a drink on their night out.</P>
    <P>My particular reason for asking for 11.30 p.m. is this.  The people who travel up to now were entitled to 12 o'clock drinking.  They are the people who spend most money on drink.  The worker's spending powers are very much curtailed.  He has to pay for many things on the H.P. system.  He has higher rents and rates to pay than before the housing problem was more or less solved.  All these demands on his pay packet are really a deterrent to his drinking so that he cannot drink as much as he would like, his spending powers not being as great as they were.  The result is that any time at all will suit the worker of the town to go home because he has not nowadays the surplus money he used to have to enjoy a pint or two extra.</P>
    <P>This question of drunkenness, too, is grossly exaggerated.  I speak with fairly good knowledge.  I say quite candidly that drunken men in this country are about as scarce as Red Indians on the shores of Manhattan. I defy contradiction on that.  If people take a drink, it is not a crime.  The Master Himself not alone allowed the guests to drink but when the wine ran short, He performed a miracle.  I refer to the Marriage Feast of Cana.</P>
    <P>The bone of contention between the different people on both sides of the House is the 11.30 closing.  They all hold different views on the matter.  That is why I think the members of the Commission ought to know.  They weighed the pros and cons; they turned the question over and back for a long time.  Among the signatories to the Report were the people who are responsible for the Total Abstinence Association in this country.  I am, indeed, pleased to think that there are members of this House who, I know, never drank intoxicating liquor but who, nevertheless, have been on the whole very fair in their observations here.  It is good to think that they <Col N="906" /> have not been selfish.  It is not because they themselves do not drink that they will not allow anybody else to do so.</P>
    <P>Again, I am afraid there are a number of people who look down their noses at those who are in charge of the licensed premises of this country. They forget that these licensed traders contribute to the Revenue Commis sioners.  Many critics accept such money in the form of wages, salaries and so forth.  There is not, as far as I know, any taint on the money collected by the Revenue Commissioners from the licensed trade.</P>
    <P>City traders and other people have been telling us here quite candidly that they want 10.30 p.m.  That is their affair.  If the Bill is passed, there is no section in it which forces licensed traders in the city of Dublin to continue trading until 11.30 p.m.  If they have sufficient trade during the period of 10 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. they are very lucky.  That is due to the huge volume of business transacted in the city where there is a population of 750,000.  Naturally, the licensed traders get a fair amount of that trade. In small towns, where you have 30, 35 or 40 members of the licensed trade, one can readily appreciate the great hardships on certain traders even to keep body and soul together. There are more publicans, poets and politicians in the county homes than any other section of the community.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister is not here. He is a man who never drank intoxicating liquor.  I must compliment him on the way he handled this Bill. He was not a dog in the manger but has been very open-minded on the matter and has listened to whatever anybody had to say.  I would ask this House to be unanimous on the 11.30 p.m. closing all the year round. If it is right to open between June and September, there is not a greater thirst obtaining during that period than there is during the winter.</P>
    <P>Most of the money collected by the licensed traders goes to the Revenue Commissioners.  The profits are small; competition is keen; the hours are hard; and the hardships are numerous.  If you give the licensed traders 11.30 p.m., you are taking from them any excuse for not obeying <Col N="907" /> the law.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider that point.  We do not ask him to go outside the Report of the Commission.  We ask him to act in accordance with that Report.  It is only half an hour but I think it would represent a great saving in this matter of raids, inspections and prosecutions by the Garda and so forth.</P>
    <P>No matter how we like it, a member of the Garda who insists on the strict enforcement of the licensing laws is not the most popular man in a town. That is quite true&mdash;he is not.  Still, in the town of Clonmel in my constituency, there have been more prosecutions, more inspections and more raids than in any town in Ireland, I think. I can truthfully say that not one member of the licensed trade ever approached me to have the sergeant or any Guards removed.  They did not.  If they did, I would turn the deaf ear to them.  I would not interfere in matters of that kind.  If a sergeant or Guard thinks his purpose is to carry out rigidly the licensing laws, that is his affair, not mine.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £90,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960, for Primary Education, including National School Teachers' Superannuation, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary to meet the cost of increases in the salaries and other grants payable to teachers in National Schools. The increases, which have been <Col N="908" /> accorded with effect as from 1st January, 1960, arise from the acceptance of the agreed recommendations of the Conciliation Council for National Teachers, on a claim submitted by the teachers' side of the Council in accordance with the agreed scheme of conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    <P>The claim of the national teachers was similar to the claims presented by other groups of public servants towards the end of the past calendar year.  It was for compensation in respect of the increase in the cost of living between 1955 and 1959 additional to the compensation accorded already by the salary increases which had been granted in 1958.</P>
    <P>The matter was considered by the Conciliation Council at meetings on the 7th and 9th January, 1960, as a result of which agreed recommendations were submitted in favour of revised scales of salary to operate as from 1st January, 1960.  The agreed recommendations have been accepted by me with the approval of the Minister for Finance and consequential revisions have been made in the rates of grant to national schools paid on a capitation basis.</P>
    <P>The additional cost of the revised scales of salary and rates of capitation grant in respect of some 13,800 teachers in national schools is estimated at £415,000 for a full year.  The amount which will become payable in the present financial year is estimated at £95,000; it is anticipated that £5,000 will become available through an increase in appropriations-in-aid and the net additional sum required is, therefore, £90,000.</P>

      <P>We accept the Supplementary Estimate just moved by the Minister.  While it was necessary to give this increase to the national teachers, so that their remuneration would bear some relation to the cost of living, I should prefer if the Minister had said, instead of mentioning the period 1955 to 1959, that the increase really took place between 1957 and 1959.  Secondly, I want to say that it is pleasant to know that the recommendations in relation to the conciliation and arbitration award are being respected on all fronts, particularly in regard to the national teachers.  Having <Col N="909" /> regard to the magnificent work they do, I do not think any pay is too great for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960 for a grant to Bord Fáilte Éireann (No. 5 of 1955) and for certain additional Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to make available to Bord Fáilte Éireann a sum of £30,000 to meet commitments which arise in the present financial year in respect of scenic development works and additional advertising and publicity overseas.</P>
      <P>The grant made to Bord Fáilte Éireann for the current financial year for administration and general expenses was £450,000 but it transpires that this sum will not suffice to meet all the commitments arising under the two headings which are referred to. The additional sum of £30,000 required can, however, be met from savings on Subhead B of the Vote and consequently only a token additional sum of £10 will be required under Subhead A.  The savings on Subhead B are due to the fact that proposals for the development of major tourist resorts have not proceeded as quickly as was originally anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £10,000 is required under the heading of scenic development works to finance the removal of permanent obstacles to scenic views. Bord Fáilte Éireann receive frequent <Col N="911" /> complaints to the effect that visitors touring the country by car or motor coach are denied views of some of our finest scenery by the high obstacles which flank many of our roads.  The powers of local authorities to incur expenditure on hedge cutting are confined to cases where traffic hazards or problems affecting road maintenance are concerned and it has become quite clear that the improvements which are desirable in this respect will not be achieved unless Bord Fáilte Éireann assume responsibility for initiating action in the matter and for seeing that the works are carried out.</P>
    <P>Within the past twelve months or so Bord Fáilte Éireann have invited local authorities to submit schemes for the removal of walls and other obstacles which impede the view in important tourist areas, and schemes estimated to cost £100,000 have been received by the Board in response to this invitation. In the present financial year the Board have committed themselves to recouping local authorities to the extent of £10,000 in respect of schemes of this kind.  This amount will have to be paid to the local authorities concerned before 31st March next.</P>
    <P>There is, perhaps, nothing so frustrating for tourists as to find that some particularly appealing view which they would like to enjoy is shut off by high walls and hedges.  The task of removing these sources of annoyance and irritation to visitors is one in which our landowners and farmers must cooperate and I should like to take this opportunity of again appealing to all owners of property to show their appreciation of the scenic attractions of their district and a realisation of the importance of tourism to the national economy by co-operating with Bord Fáilte Éireann and local authorities in this work.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £20,000 is required by Bord Fáilte Éireann for expenditure on advertising and publicity in the United States and Britain. This money will be expended entirely on activities designed to stimulate additional visitor traffic and no extra administrative expenses are envisaged.</P>
    <P>There was an unexpected decrease <Col N="912" /> in American tourist traffic to this country during 1959.  This was experienced by other European countries.  It is anticipated that there will be a big increase in American traffic to Europe as a whole during the present year and it is obviously desirable, therefore, that a vigorous effort should be made not alone to recover the ground lost last year but to increase our share of this important traffic.  Although Bord Fáilte Éireann have opened an additional office in Chicago their overall expenditure in the United States during the year ended 31st March, 1959 showed a decrease of approximately 29 per cent. compared with 1955.  This reduction was dictated by the increasing demands of the British market and by commitments on development works at home.</P>
    <P>The principal decrease was in expenditure on advertising and publicity which fell by 56 per cent. since 1955, during a period when advertising and publicity costs in the United States have risen by more than 50 per cent.  This means that the Board are now making a greatly reduced impact on the United States travel market which has expanded rapidly and become increasingly competitive during the period in question. The Board are seriously concerned at the fact that their current investment in publicity and advertising may not enable them to maintain, much less increase, their share of this rapidly growing market.  The Board consider, therefore, that a supplementary programme of advertising, publicity and promotional activities should be undertaken in the United States before the end of the current financial year.  This programme will cost £8,000.</P>
    <P>In Britain the Board's overall expenditure has practically doubled since 1953.  This increase has been largely due to the establishment and operation of offices in Manchester and Glasgow which were considered to be urgent priority operations for the exploitation of the British market.  The funds available did not, however, permit the Board to budget for the additional advertising and publicity support which would ensure the maximum utilisation of these new information <Col N="913" /> centres.  In fact, the Board's expenditure in Britain on advertising and publicity during the current financial year is little above the level of 1956, although costs have increased during the past few years and the market has become highly competitive.</P>
    <P>The Board consider heavier publicity expenditure in this market to be essential especially at the present time when the buoyant state of the British economy offers a favourable opportunity for increasing their efforts there. The Board, accordingly, propose to undertake a supplementary programme of activities during what remains of the current financial year.  These activities include co-operative advertising and promotion with carriers and travel agents, additional advertising coverage in the Press as well as the production of additional printed publicity material to support these activities. The estimated cost of this supplementary programme is £12,000.</P>
    <P>I am confident there will be general agreement regarding the desirability of incurring the expenditure for which provision is made in this Estimate and I recommend that the House should approve of the Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the small amount involved in this Estimate it really does not merit any criticism at all.  Permit me to say immediately that we accept this Supplementary Estimate and that the activities for which the money is required appear to be very praiseworthy indeed.  In fact, I think that more and more will have to be spent on advertising as time goes on and the market becomes more and more competitive.  I must say that in parts of the country I have been extremely impressed by the removal of barriers and by the scenic views hitherto hidden from the native and the tourist.  It is amazing how often a native finds that when a hedge has been cut away there is something really beautiful to be seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have a tremendous task before them in the development of tourism and I think that advertising is probably the field in which they will have to exercise greatest activity.  There are other activities which might merit <Col N="914" /> some criticism but these can be left until the discussion on the general Estimate.  For these reasons, we accept this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only one or two comments I should like to make on this Estimate.  The Minister has said that he needs only £10 in view of the fact that there has been a saving under subhead B.  If I understood him correctly, subhead B is a heading of expenditure which provides for the development of tourist resorts.  We have been led to believe by various Ministers and members of the Government that tourism could be a great source of income to this country and that the sooner we develop Ireland to receive tourists the better.</P>
      <P>While we have a certain amount of natural attractions in the country we still have to create artificial attractions to attract the tourist and one of these would be in the line of resorts and especially seaside resorts. It seems a pity that Bord Fáilte cannot spend £30,000 on the development of resorts in the year which ends on the 31st March, 1960.  It is amazing that Bord Fáilte could not find some resort or resorts on which to spend money in the present financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received complaints that this year a very important part of the country, the south-east coast, could not get a penny for development.  I am led to believe that from Arklow to Tramore not one penny is to be spent on resorts.  I think most people will agree that that part of the country could be well developed as regards resorts and seaside resorts.  Owing to the nature of the coastline and the soil it has extremely good beaches and resorts generally.  Year after year. I am sure, Bord Fáilte are asking for extra money.  Why is it they now find themselves in the position of handing back £30,000?  We all know that money spent on tourism is money well spent.  Now it is being described as a &ldquo;saving,&rdquo;&mdash;as if the Board set themselves the task of saving unnecessarily. Of course there is a difference between savings and economies. When replying the Minister might say what difficulty Bord Fáilte <Col N="915" /> had in spending the money provided for the development of resorts.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Board of Works gave encouragement to local authorities to clear obstacles in order to open up scenic views.  That is very laudable. Board Fáilte and local bodies are now co-operating in the resumption of that work.  Could the Minister say&mdash;or perhaps it is the function of Board Fáilte&mdash;how that money is distributed?  It seems to me that a bigger proportion of the money is spent in certain areas.  When people outside this country think of a holiday in Ireland, they think of Killarney. Killarney already has a famous name and its beauty is unsurpassed either in this country or anywhere else.  We also have the unrivalled attractions of Connemara and Donegal.  But these are the names one sees plastered on every advertisement issued by Board Fáilte to encourage tourists to come here.</P>
    <P>I do not think any place in Ireland has better attractions to offer than Killarney, Connemara, Donegal and what I would term the generally accepted tourist centres.  But I am afraid Bord Fáilte will have to approach the whole problem from a different point of view.  Apart from those who land at Shannon, people coming to this country arrive in the east, at Dublin Airport, the North Wall, Dún Laoghaire or Rosslare Harbour.  Some of them can afford to go to Killarney, Connemara, Donegal and the other accepted tourist resorts. However, there are a big number of people in Britain who want to go to Ireland&mdash;a lot of them because they are of Irish extraction&mdash;simply for the sake of saying they have been in Ireland.  If they get as far as Louth, Dublin, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Wicklow or Waterford, they are proud that at least they have had a holiday in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We should, therefore, publicise and make more attractive the eastern parts of the country to attract that type of potential visitor, especially visitors from Britain.  It costs only a few pounds to come across from London to Dún Laoghaire, the North Wall or <Col N="916" /> Rosslare Harbour.  We encourage them to go to Killarney, Connemara and Donegal.  If they can afford it, they are welcome to do so; but the ordinary, working-class visitor landing in Dublin will find that if he wants to travel to any of the places in the south and west, it will cost twice the amount of money.  I do not want to take people away from these places and bring them to the east.  We must readily admit that the scenic attractions in the south and west surpass anything we have to offer in the east. But we can still attract to the east a lot of people who cannot afford to go to these other places.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of the administration of the moneys at the disposal of Bord Fáilte.  Recently Bord Fáilte issued a circular headed &ldquo;Better Hotels&rdquo;, in which they offered hotel owners certain financial inducements to improve their hotels. That is laudable in itself.  But I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister a paragraph in that circular.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has referred to the Board's attitude towards the removal of barriers obstructing scenic views.  I hope no time will be lost in having an approach made to the local authorities, and to the landowners concerned.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister in that regard.  Quite a number of advertising hoardings have been erected&mdash;whether by accident or design, I do not know&mdash;at points on our main roads which give very appealing scenic views.  I sincerely trust that either through the local authorities, if they have any powers to do so, or through the intervention of Bord Fáilte, some control will be exercised in future over the erection of these hoardings.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish also made the point &mdash;and made it very well&mdash;in connection with the Board's policy of more or less laying emphasis on advertising certain tourist centres, and not advertising others to any great extent.  My view, for what it is worth, is that we have not, so far, tapped the English market in the matter of tourism as well as we might.  There was probably a very good reason for that in the past in that we were depending on the American traffic.  Most people realise now that there are large numbers of people in England who are anxious for many reasons to come to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish mentioned some of those reasons, the main one being that some of those people are of Irish extraction and naturally have a tendency <Col N="918" /> to come to the country of their forebears.  There is more to it than that.  There are people in England who are anxious to spend their holidays&mdash;particularly the working people &mdash;in a centre not too far removed from their homes and, for that reason, this country appeals to them.  The distance is not great and the expense of getting here not too great.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister, and to the Board, that they might cater for that type of tourist.</P>
    <P>Someone said to me, some time ago, that if we could understand the value to this country of the English working class tourist, we would be rather surprised.  That was said to me by a gentleman who has some knowledge of the matter.  He suggested that the ordinary working class tourist from England would be as useful as an American millionaire.  I am doubtful if that is quite correct, but perhaps we have not assessed, as fully as we might, the value to this country of the English tourist.</P>
    <P>The point made by Deputy Corish with regard to certain centres being selected for advertising purposes by Bord Fáilte is a good one.  English people work mostly on the basis of information they receive from a travel agency, if they are lucky enough to be in a financial position to book their tour through such an agency, but if they arrange it themselves, they go on the information they get in official publications.  There are many tourist resorts, not necessarily seaside resorts, which would have an appeal for holiday-makers, so a more comprehensive list should be circulated, particularly to tourists from Britain.</P>
    <P>On the question of publicity which the Minister mentioned in regard to the British trade, I am glad that the Board are looking into that matter. More effective advertising penetration is necessary to capture the British tourist trade which we are probably losing to other countries at the moment, and various methods of approach to the potential trade have been suggested.  I remember when the main Estimate for Tourism was before the House last year, one speaker suggested that some direct type of <Col N="919" /> approach to the British working people might prove a very effective means of capturing their support for the tourist trade here.</P>
    <P>There are many other forms of contact, of course, which advertising can make.  The showing of films in clubs, canteens and places of entertainment in Britain, could prove to be an effective medium, and I recommend that suggestion, for what it is worth, to Bord Fáilte.  The Minister also referred to the possibility of a substantial increase in tourist traffic this year by reason of certain well-known events on the Continent.  I subscribe to that view, and I appeal to those who service that industry in the matter of hotels, guest houses and transport companies, to play their part in trying to get the best that can be got from the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>The activities of Bord Fáilte are appreciated more now than they were some years ago because tourism has become big business, so to speak, in this country.  The responsibility for increasing that business must, to a certain degree, rest with us and also with our hoteliers and owners of guest houses.  There is very little use in Bord Fáilte carrying out a great advertising campaign in England, Scotland, America, or anywhere else, about the facilities we have to offer, and the great beauties of our country, unless the local people are prepared to co-operate whole-heartedly in living up to the beautiful picture painted by the advertisements.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, there are times when people do not leave the country with a good impression, if we do not live up to what they expect.  It is absolutely essential that when tourists come here, they should be treated well, that they should get their board and lodgings at a reasonable price, and that we do not take too much advantage of them.  For the greater part, they are not over-wealthy.  They have to be careful during the year to put so much aside each month to save for their holidays, and we should ensure that they get good value for their money while in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> One other very important aspect of the development of tourism is the cooperation which should exist between Bord Fáilte, the local authorities and the local development associations&mdash; more especially, the local authorities because they are elected by the people, and have the spending of public money for which they must answer to the people.  Where local authorities are prepared to spend public money for the development of a local resort, it should be very carefully considered by the Board, and every help should be given by Bord Fáilte to the local authority for whatever project they have in mind, because, as a rule, they cannot afford to spend public money wastefully.  The Board should consider very seriously any recommendations for the development of tourist resorts.</P>
    <P>Tourism, then, is big business, because every tourist who comes here will consume a certain amount of food and a certain amount of drink, both of which are produced in this country.  We should ensure that whatever we advertise in connection with any resort&mdash;let it be sea angling or fishing or hunting&mdash;when the tourist comes seeking certain amusements, he will not be disappointed.  Whatever we advertise, we should be prepared to give, and then the tourist will be reasonably satisfied that he has got at least what he came for and what he expected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister is it the fault of the local authorities or the fault of Bord Fáilte that the money he refers to has not been expended on the development of resorts?  If the fault lies with the local authorities then, of course, we cannot blame Bord Fáilte to any great extent but, if the fault lies with Bord Fáilte, we should have an opportunity in this House of having a discussion on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are confined in this debate to a discussion of the items that appear under the subheads in the Supplementary Estimates.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle rightly pointed out that we cannot widen the scope of the debate, <Col N="921" /> that there will be opportunity on the main Estimate.</P>
    <P>I would put this to the Minister for consideration:&mdash; These matters are generally part of and buried in his main Estimate for Industry and Commerce and he may in the course of his speech on that Estimate cover a very wide field, including tourism and all the other aspects of his Department, with the result that there is no opportunity for any Deputy to deal thoroughly with any of the various departments for which the Minister has responsibility.  Therefore, since there is not a special debate on Bord Fáilte and tourism, it should be open to Deputies to discuss the whole field of tourism on a Supplementary Estimate. I do not propose to do so on this occasion because I am sure the Acting Chairman would put his foot down but I would ask the Minister in future, on the occasion of an Estimate in respect of a State body, to consider having a special debate in the House on the matter, so that in the following April or May, when the Estimate for Industry and Commerce is being discussed, tourism and Bord Fáilte could be debated separately.</P>
    <P>Within the limited scope available to me, I should like to make a few comments. Bord Fáilte are seeking more money in this Supplementary Estimate for publicity in America.  An extraordinary position has arisen in the last 12 months on the American scene.  Our expenditure on publicity to sell whiskey has been doubled; we are increasing our publicity and expenditure in America to sell tourism. Despite the increased expenditure, the returns in both respects are diminishing. Can that be explained?  I cannot query the Minister in regard to whiskey but I can query him here in regard to tourism.</P>
    <P>The Minister more or less suggested that generally tourism of American origin has declined in Europe this year, that there were fewer American visitors to Europe and, consequently, we were affected.  That is the type of argument adduced in this House when anything goes wrong.  When we complain about emigration from rural Ireland we are told that emigration is occurring all <Col N="922" /> over Europe, that it is an international trend.  We are increasing expenditure in America on publicity in order to attract tourists but the number of tourists did not increase last year.</P>
    <P>Could it be that we are making a great mistake in the beaming of our publicity on America?  Are we directing the publicity at the right segments of the American population?  There are a number of Irish-American societies who cater for a large number of Irish people and people of Irish extraction.  Occasionally, these societies protest at the actions of our Ministers abroad.  There was a recent example of an Irish-American society protesting against the decision of our Minister for External Affairs in the United Nations.  Instead of having these societies engaged in protests of that nature, their aid should be enlisted by Bord Fáilte in encouraging their members to show a true love of Ireland by supporting our tourist campaign.</P>
    <P>It is a better proposition to spend money in making these societies aware of their responsibility to this country rather than on television programmes in America which cost fabulous sums, the effect of which is ephemeral and may be gone in a few hours while the money expended is out of all proportion to the results achieved.  It would be better to spend the money, or some of it, in encouraging Irish-American groups to take an interest in this country and, instead of criticising the actions of our Government, to show a practical interest in the country by returning on holidays or encouraging their friends to come here.</P>
    <P>I agree that there should be greater expenditure on publicity in Britain.  It is time that Bord Fáilte woke up to the untapped tourist well that is next door to us.  The majority of the people who come to this country and who are described by Bord Fáilte as tourists are Irish people resident in Britain coming home on holidays at various times of the year, particularly the summer months and Christmas. We will not discuss that misnomer of our own people on this occasion.  It is sufficient to remind Bord Fáilte that on occasion they take credit for the return to this country of people who normally would come home on <Col N="923" /> holidays by describing them as tourists.  There should be some practical way of segregating these people from people of British or European origin.</P>
    <P>There is a possibility that the funds expended on tourism in Britain are not being expended in the best possible way.  To give an example, I have often seen more publicity given to the arrival in this country of half a dozen snobs in jodhpurs for a hunt in Kildare or with the snobs in Galway and their lady friends than would be given to an entire shipload of English middle class or working people.  Is there any comparison between the importance of the two to this country?  The same encouragement is not given to the working class people, who constitute the majority of the people of Britain, as is given to certain elements catered for in a monthly magazine issued by Bord Fáilte.  That is a very expensive piece of work and I am presented with a copy of it every month as, I am sure, is every other Deputy.  In practically every issue we find an article singing the praises of the hunt in Ireland.  The normal person in Britain who reads that would be of the opinion that this was still a country of squires and squireens.</P>
    <P>I doubt if there is much appeal in that type of publicity for the Englishman who wants to bring his wife and family to the seaside here or, if he is a sportsman, who wants to bring his wife here and spend a holiday fishing or shooting.  I am not suggesting that the element interested in the hunting fields are not welcome but greater value to the Exchequer would be gained by encouraging a greater proportion of the ordinary English people to come here.</P>
    <P>The question of scenic development was mentioned and also the question of removing high walls which prevent people from seeing various beauty shots.  That is very desirable but I do not think there is any power available to Bord Fáilte to take action in that regard.  The Minister in his opening statement used the word &ldquo;invite&rdquo;, that Bord Fáilte can only invite local <Col N="924" /> authorities to submit suggestions for consideration by the Board.  I may be wrong but I think Bord Fáilte have no power to interfere directly, compulsorily or otherwise, and that the initiative must come from the local authority.</P>
    <P>The greatest offenders as far as high walls are concerned are those people, groups or companies&mdash;I shall not give them any more detailed description than that&mdash;who reside behind the demesne walls.  From here to Maynooth, which is only 15 miles from the city, there is mile after mile of high wall preventing the public, whether tourists or Irish people, seeing some of the attractive scenery behind these walls.</P>
    <P>We shall be told that in this regard we are up against the rights of private individuals and private property owners.  However, when Bord Fáilte know of road widening taking place or the removal of dangerous corners they should suggest at that stage that the local authority would remove these high walls in the vicinity and erect attractive iron railings in their place. That could be done in conjunction with improvements taking place on the roads and it would be a cheaper proposition in the long run to have those things done together.  It would at the same time protect the privacy of a number of people who might object, if the walls were removed only in part.  I do not suggest that gaps should be created in the walls presenting an ugly appearance but you could remove sections of these walls and substitute iron railings and have the work done in an artistic fashion.  We know there will be a great deal expended this year and in the next few years by the local authorities on the improvement of roads and perhaps Bord Fáilte will consider communicating with the various local authorities.</P>
    <P>These high walls are a problem in every local authority area and not merely in what might be described as tourist centres.  Very often people on their way to Connemara, down to West Cork or up to Donegal, come across these forbidding high walls and it is in these areas rather than in the tourist resort areas that money could be spent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> I do not know what the position is with regard to the expenditure on hotels, whether provision is made in this Supplementary Estimate for grants and loans to hoteliers.  If there is not, I suppose I cannot say very much about it.  However, it strikes me as rather peculiar that we concentrate so much on seaside resorts while the inland areas which are ideal for tourist development are still neglected.  The best way I can make this relevant is by referring to the expenditure on publicity in Britain.  It was only a very recent development that Board Fáilte gave their blessing to the development of Midland towns like Athlone.  All the development took place in these areas before Bord Fáilte knew anything about it.  I refer specifically to Athlone as an area to which hundreds of people come from Britain each year to stay in private houses while on a fishing tour.  There are places like Banagher and other towns along the Shannon.</P>
    <P>The private houses in various parts of the town of Athlone have been catering for these anglers for the past ten or tweleve years and a number of housewives in Athlone and elsewhere did special courses in domestic economy in order to be able to cater efficiently and at a reasonable charge for the middle income and lower income groups from Britain.  There is no question of luxury accommodation, but clean food and comfortable lodgings are provided.  These facilities were made available by private houses in various towns in the midlands and were so much appreciated by the visitors that each year the number of people coming from Britain has increased.</P>
    <P>These houses are not recognised by Bord Fáilte as guest houses or anything else.  They are playing a very valuable part in the economy generally as well as in their towns in bringing much-needed finance here.  They are playing their own part in the tourist drive.  Credit for what they are doing is very often given to another section.  Very often Bord Fáilte take credit for the fact that hundreds of these visitors come to fishing areas, inland lakes, and so on, while all along the local people are directly advertising in fishing journals, for example, <Col N="926" /> and have their own direct connections with Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Acting-Chairman (Mr. Sheldon) Acting-Chairman (Mr. Sheldon)">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to make it relevant by suggesting that the extra expenditure on publicity in Britain, for which authority is now being given, should be spent on advertising the tourist attractions of inland facilities as far as fishing, and so on, are concerneed. I shall not dwell on what has been mentioned already but I have in mind the value of attracting not so much the higher income groups in Britain in this respect as the working-class and the middle-income groups.</P>
      <P>I should like to suggest again that it might be possible for the Minister to arrange that the debate on tourism generally be taken separately rather than have it, as in the past, buried in the middle of his Estimate which is for one of the most important Departments for which any Minister is responsible.  The field is wide and the amount of time limited.  It is desirable, in respect of sections of his Department which deal with State or semi-State companies, that there should be a separate discussion on each of these sections for which in the long run the Minister carries responsibility.  The argument will be put forward that it is open to a Deputy on the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce to cover any aspect of it he likes.  I appreciate that that is true but from the point of view of making a searching examination and perhaps a more constructive contribution to the debate in connection with various matters under the Minister's control it might be advisable to adopt my suggestion, namely to have the particular section discussed separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputies for the manner in which they have received the proposal that this extra £30,000 be authorised for the expenditure I suggested.  The principal question, I think, which was raised was: How is it possible to effect a <Col N="927" /> saving so as to require only a token Estimate?  I would point out that, under the ordinary Administration and Promotional Expenses, Bord Fáilte have power to make grants for resort development but that envisages resort development of a comparatively minor nature when on compares it with the powers they have under Subhead B for major resort development.</P>
      <P>Major resort development was made possible by reason of the passage through the Dáil and the Seanad of the recent Tourist Traffic Bill which was passed at the end of July of last year.  There was, however, an advance provision in the Estimates to cover a certain portion of that expenditure. The over-all sum was £1,000,000 over a period of, I think, ten years and a due proportion of it was set aside for expenditure in this year.  The legislation was passed in July but the type of expenditure envisaged was of a major nature which would require to be well-planned and to which the local authority would make a reasonable contribution.  It may have been too optimistic to expect that a considerable sum of that money would be spent in this financial year.  The fact is that while Bord Fáilte have, in broad outline in certain respects and in detail in others, outlined the schemes for the expenditure of that money on major resort development none of them has come to the stage when actual expenditure could be incurred in this financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan asked me at whose door the blame should be laid. I can only say that he could gather for himself from my remarks where he would see fit to lay the blame. Perhaps there was delay on the part of Bord Fáilte or on the part of the local authorities concerned.  I think Bord Fáilte did proceed with due and commendable expedition to select the areas which would be suitable for this type of expenditure, to communicate with the local authorities that they had selected such areas and to request the local authorities to put forward well-planned schemes of development. I will not suggest that the local authorities were in any way dilatory <Col N="928" /> in meeting the request of Bord Fáilte. I am leaving it at that for the Deputy's own conclusions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish complained about the lack of expenditure along the south-east coast.  He referred in particular to Wexford.  I do not think he can sustain the suggestion that Bord Fáilte have in any way been ungenerous to Wexford.  I think he was rather mistaken in suggesting that no money was spent in Wexford on tourist development.  No money was spent on major tourist development as is envisaged in the Act of last year but that is true of all the country for the reasons I have stated. Bord Fáilte have to my knowledge contributed to a considerable extent, under the ordinary resort grants schemes, to making amenities available in the Wexford area.  I do not have to refer to the extent to which they have assisted the establishment and the undeniable success of the Wexford Festival.  Considerable expenditure was involved there which was well justified in the event.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan was wrong in suggesting that increased publicity in the United States has resulted in decreased tourist results in this country. I set out fairly clearly in my opening remarks that the amount spent in the year ended March, 1959, was about 29 per cent. less than the over-all amount expended in the year 1955 on tourist promotion in the United States.  I pointed out, too, that the cost of publicity in the United States has increased by roughly 50 per cent.  That may have been a contributory factor to a falling-off in American tourist traffic in 1959.  I would say that that was an experience shared with other European countries and I am given to understand the reason is that 1959 represents what might be described as a valley year in American tourism.</P>
    <P>In 1958, there were two outstanding events in Europe&mdash;the centenary of the Lourdes Apparitions and the Brussels Exhibition&mdash;which attracted something in the region of 12 to 15 million people, many of them, of course, coming from the United States.  The year 1959, as I said, was a valley year and, in 1960, there are many other outstanding events in Europe, including <Col N="929" /> the Olympic Games and the suggested year of the Revelation of Fatima.  It is reasonable to assume that Americans who desired to travel to Europe in that period, between, say, 1957 and 1960, would possibly have decided to come either in 1958 or 1960 to coincide with these outstanding events in Europe.  That is a reasonable suggestion which is open to acceptance.</P>
    <P>As far as unsightly obstructions in the countryside are concerned, I do not want to suggest that Bord Fáilte have power to remove all unsightly obstructions of this nature.  The Department of Local Government is preparing a Bill to give greater power to the local authorities to remove derelict sites.  That would be an exercise quite apart from Bord Fáilte's activities but Bord Fáilte, as a result of their general obligation to promote tourism and develop scenic attractions, have the power to expend money on removing obstructions of this nature. These are obstructions to places of scenic interest but they can do so only by agreement, first, with the owners of the particular property and secondly, in consultation and in association with the local authority itself.</P>
    <P>I do not think we could ever get away with what Deputy McQuillan suggests, that all the high walls should be knocked down, much as we object to them.  There are high walls in many of the most beautiful parts of the country.  They obscure beautiful scenery from the passing traveller, whether he be cyclist, walker or motorist, but I do not think that we could justify such an invasion of the privacy of the individual as knocking down any high walls that surround his property much as some of us might like to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that I did not suggest that they should all be knocked down.  I specifically referred to the fact that when local authority improvement work was being carried out, where they were removing dangerous corners or widening roads attractive iron railings should be substituted so that tourists will be able to see the scenery.</P>

      <P>I am sorry if I misunderstood the Deputy.  I did not intend to misquote him.  As far as the suggestion about the installation of railings where walls have been knocked down is concerned, I think that has been carried out fairly extensively, not only by the local authorities at the present time, but by the Board of Works.</P>
      <P>It is a form of expense that I should like to see proceeded with at an increasing pace but I should like to say that this is not the main function of Bord Fáilte.  It is not a function they can undertake of their own volition except with the necessary consent and co-operation I have referred to.</P>
      <P>I do not think there are any other points that were raised that I need reply to except perhaps the suggestion made by Deputy McQuillan that there has not been a fair share of expenditure for tourist development in midland areas by Bord Fáilte.  I do not know to what extent they can show figures to differentiate between expenditure in the midlands and seaside areas but the fact is that Bord Fáilte have assisted materially in the promotion of angling on inland lakes. They have assisted, to my own knowledge when I was in the Department of Education, to a very material extent in the equipping of people living in houses where they can provide accommodation for tourists.  They have equipped them with a knowledge of fundamental housekeeping so that they might be able to cater for tourists.  Perhaps they might be able to devote a greater part of their budget in that way but I am sure Bord Fáilte will be fully alive to the matter.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £119,400, be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Ard-Chlaraitheora), and certain services administered by that Office, including Grants to Local Authorities and miscellaneous Grants.</P>
      <P>The need for this Supplementary Estimate arises from the fact that the costs of the health services as now calculated by the local authorities for both the years 1958/59 and 1959/60 are greater than had been estimated in November and December, 1958, when the original Estimate was prepared.</P>
      <P>The provision under Subhead H&mdash; Grants to Health Authorities&mdash;is to cover balances of grants payable in the course of the year 1959/60 in respect of the year 1958/59 and previous years, and, also, instalments of grants payable in, and in respect of, the year 1959/60.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that in framing the estimates of grants, which are at the rate of 50 per cent. of the local authority expenditure, my Department has to rely very much on the local authorities' statements of currents rates of costs and forecasts of future costs.  The information on which the main provision for balances of grant is based is supplied in the months of October to December in respect of the year ending on 31st March following, and consists of statements of realised expenditure for the first half of the year and of anticipated costs for the second half.  The provision for instalments of current grant is based on information supplied at the same time, and consisting of estimates of expenditure and receipts by local authorities in the year commencing on the following 1st April.  In compiling this information, therefore, local <Col N="932" /> authorities have to plot the course of their finances rather far ahead, and if a number of authorities fail to give due effect to any movement, upward or downward, in the costs of the different services the cumulative effect on the estimate of he requirements of my Department in respect of grants payable from the Vote can be considerable. In the present instance the over-all under-estimate of local expenditure was only about 0.7 per cent. of the earlier estimate of the 1958/59 costs, and about 1.2 per cent. of the original 1959/60 figure.  Nevertheless, supplementary provision of £150,000 under the grant subhead is necessary.</P>
    <P>The increases and decreases in local expenditure as between the figures on which the original Estimate was based and the figures on which the Supplementary Estimate is based followed a consistent pattern over the two years 1958/59 and 1959/60.  Broadly, hospital services, other than tuberculosis hospitals, and the general medical services show higher costs than had been budgeted for, while savings appear in respect of tuberculosis services, allowances to persons suffering from infectious diseases, maternity grants and allowances to disabled persons.</P>
    <P>In the case of general hospital services, the main increases in expenditure are in respect of payments by health authorities to voluntary hospitals for the accommodation and treatment of patients receiving services under the Health Acts.  The occupancy of voluntary hospitals appears to have increased significantly over the years 1958 and 1959.  Many of the additional days of occupancy are attributable to patients receiving Health Act services, and also the increasing awareness of patients of their rights under the Acts, and consequently the proportion of the services provided in voluntary hospitals which results in claims on health authorities, may be assumed to have been growing over those years, and, indeed, to be still growing.</P>
    <P>The costs of mental hospitals show considerable increases over the original estimates for both the years 1958/59; and 1959/60.  In the former year, the increase was £123,000 and in the latter, <Col N="933" /> £50,000.  The increases appear mainly under the headings: Food, Repairs, Maintenance, Salaries and Medicines. These increases reflect improvements in the standards of the hospitals, and, in the case of the cost of medicines, they follow inevitably on the adoption of modern methods of treatment.  I feel sure that in view of the need for improvement in the mental hospital services this evidence of the raising of standards will be welcome.</P>
    <P>Another service which in both years has proved to be more costly than has been anticipated is that described as &ldquo;Hospitals and Homes for Chronic Sick, Mental Defectives etc.&rdquo;  In 1958/59 the increase of expenditure by local authorities over estimates was £48,000 and in 1959/60, £70,000.  The greatest single cause in this case is the payment by health authorities for patients maintained in voluntary institutions for mental defectives.  Other factors are the generally increased costs of county homes.  To the extent to which these increases reflect extensions and improvements of the services provided for mentally defective and aged or chronically sick patients I am sure that it will be accepted as a desirable development.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of hospital services, there is only one item for which an upward revision of the estimates has not been necesary.  This is the cost of tuberculosis hospitals, on which a saving of £48,000 in total expenditure is expected in respect of 1958/59, and on which no variation from estimates is foreseen in respect of 1959/60.  This situation is a reflection of the fall in the number of patients needing hospital treatment.</P>
    <P>In respect of the year 1958/59, the general medical services are now calculated to cost £46,000 more than had been provided for, and in respect of the year 1959/60 the cost as now estimated is £60,000 greater than had been estimated.  These increases are attributable almost entirely to the cost of medicines.  The experience of local authorities is that the prescribing of newly developed drugs, which, of course, are more expensive than the older remedies, is constantly increasing. The arrangements for the <Col N="934" /> purchase of drugs by local authorities are designed to ensure that the best terms possible are obtained from the suppliers, and I am satisfied that that result is being achieved.  When, however, completely new substances are produced at high cost and are adopted by the medical profession as more effective alternatives to existing medicines an upward trend in total costs of medicines is inevitable, and it is extremely difficult for the local authorities to forecast over a long period the amount of increases which they will be called upon to meet.</P>
    <P>In respect of both the years 1958/59 and 1959/60, the original estimates have proved to be adequate for all other field services, with the exception of the miscellaneous group of items covered by the description &ldquo;Other Services&rdquo; which in respect of the year 1959/60 are now calculated to cost £70,000 more than has been budgeted for.  This miscellaneous group includes out-patients specialist services, administration costs, superannuation charges and ambulance services, and the increase in requirements as now calculated is the result of a number of factors which happened to operate more or less simultaneously to push up costs, but which are not significant in the sense of any basic developments.</P>
    <P>I shall now come to the cost of the 1958/1959 services and the position is that the cost, other than tuberculosis hospitals, exceeds the original estimate by £301,000, while on all other services savings amounting to £183,000 are anticipated.  The net increase over the originally estimated cost is thus £118,000 which represents £59,000 in terms of the grants payable from the Health Vote to health authorities, but the original provision for 1958/59 also included a sum of £12,000 to cover grants payable on completion of the audits of the years prior to 1958/59 and it is now calculated that a saving of £9,000 will be recorded in that item. The net additional expenditure therefore necessary to meet balances of grants in respect of the years up to and including 1958/59 is £50,000.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the cost of the services for the year 1959/60 is that for the same services as showed <Col N="935" /> increases over estimates in respect of the year 1958/59, and for the miscellaneous group of items described as &ldquo;Other Services&rdquo;, there is an aggregate estimated increase of £290,000. The combined saving on the remaining services is estimated at £90,000, and the net under-estimate contained in the figures on which the original Subhead provision for grant instalments in respect of the year 1959/60 was based was thus £200,000.  The additional sum necessary to cover the grant instalments to local authorities is £100,000 so that the total additional provision now sought under subhead H&mdash;Grants to Health Authorities&mdash;is accordingly £150,000.</P>
    <P>I might add that this additional provision for the year 1959/60 takes no account of the added costs of the health services which will follow from the general upward revision of the pay of local authority staffs at present under consideration.  The decision of local bodies on proposals for such revisions of pay will not have been taken in time to permit the consequential expenditure to be included in the accounts on which will be based the further instalment of grant payable before the end of the financial year. The additional grant in this respect will accordingly have to be met from the Vote for the year 1960/61.</P>
    <P>The additional provision in respect of Grants to Health Authorities is offset as indicated in the Supplementary Estimate to the extent of £30,600, in part by savings on other subheads amounting to £8,600 but mainly by an increase of £22,000 over the original provision for Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>The savings on other subheads arise mainly as a result of vacancies on the staff of my Department which result in a saving of £6,600 on the subheads related to salaries, wages and allowances. The remaining £2,000 saving is the result of casual variation from the original provision under a number of other subheads.</P>
    <P>The receipts to the Vote accounted for under the heading Appropriations-in-Aid include sums paid from the <Col N="936" /> Local Taxation Account which vary with the inflow of licence duties and estate duty.  The most recent information indicates that the amounts to be received into the Health Vote will be greater than the amounts shown in the original Estimates by £500 in the case of the Licence Duties Grant and £10,500 in the case of Estate Duty Grant.</P>
    <P>Provision was made in the original Estimate for the receipt as an Appropriation-in-Aid of £1,770, being instalments of principal and interest on a loan of £13,200 advanced from the Vote for the year 1957/58 to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board and repayable over a period of 10 years. Early in the present year, the Board, on their own initiative, intimated that they wished to repay the full amount of the loan outstanding, and I have accepted the repayment.  The amount to be received under this heading is, for that reason, increased by £11,700. I need hardly say that I welcome the continuing expansion of the operations of the Board which made the repayment possible.</P>
    <P>The additional receipts which I have referred to, amount to £22,700.  It is necessary to reduce this figure by a sum of £700 representing a short-fall now anticipated on the receipts in respect of searches and certified copies of entries of births, deaths and marriages. The receipts under this heading vary with the public demand for certificates and the experience to date indicates that the original figure of £11,200 for this item should be reduced to £10,500.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the original provision under Subhead H for Grants to Health Authorities, has proved to be less than requirements by £150,000, while on other debit subheads of the Vote it is now estimated that £8,600 will be saved, and also that receipts to the appropriations-in-aid will be greater than originally estimated by £22,000, leaving the net supplementary sum, which I now ask the House to grant, at £119,400.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy has perhaps experienced, foods of this kind are bought <Col N="938" /> not so much for their nutritive content as for their taste and flavour and other qualities which appeal to the palate.  In any event, as I indicated in reply to a Parliamentary Question on this matter recently, I take the view that the provisions under which I am empowered to fix standards for foods are specifically limited in their application to foods which are of special importance to the public health and I consider that it would be an abuse of my powers to attempt to use these provisions to establish a standard minimal meat content for sausages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The initial difficulty in the consideration of this matter is to decide what is a nursing home.  It would obviously be unnecessary and undesirable to include in the scope of any legislation a household into which an aged and ailing relative is taken, mainly for charity even if some payment towards expenses is made by the patient, or a household in which, for instance, a person had lived as a boarder, for many years perhaps, if the members of the household continued to care for that person after he or she had become ill.</P>
      <P>Apart from the foregoing, it would not be possible to provide in legislation for minimum standards of care and skill.  The standard of care and skill needed would vary enormously according to the condition of the patient or patients.</P>
      <P>This question has been considered on a number of occasions, particularly in 1933, 1934, 1945 and 1946 and again more recently, and in every case the conclusion was that it would be impossible to frame legislation which would deal effectively with this problem while at the same time ensuring that charitable persons such as I have mentioned who are prepared to provide loving care for relatives and friends would not be subjected unduly to regimentation and regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain fishermen in the Cashen district were formerly held to be insurable under the Social Welfare Acts at the special rate payable in respect of share fishermen.  A question was, however, raised as to whether these men were, in fact, insurable.  It was decided by a deciding officer that they were.  Following the decisions a demand was made for payment of the necessary contributions liability for which falls on the owner of the boat or bailee.  The demand was resisted and proceedings in the district court were instituted.  When the case came before the court, the solicitor acting for the defence pleaded that there was no employment within the meaning of the Social Welfare Acts as the fishermen concerned were in effect partners and joint owners of the boat. The District Justice adjourned the case so that the deciding officer might have an opportunity to revise his decision and at the same time give formal decisions in respect of additional share fishermen for whom payment of contributions had been demanded. The deciding officer referred the latter cases to an appeals officer for decision, pending which he deferred further consideration of the first case.  The appeals officer after an oral hearing at which all the parties concerned gave evidence decided that the share fishermen were not employed in insurable employment and contributions were not payable in respect of them.  In consequence, a number of fishermen from the area have not been entitled to unemployment benefit in recent months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is now in a position to, and, if so, if he will furnish, the details which he stated were not available on the 10th instant of the <Col N="942" /> three cases in which old age and other pensions payable by his Department were reduced in amount or stopped because the pensioner won a prize in a football pool, raffle or other like event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated in the reply to the Deputy's previous question on this subject, the law requires that where a person who is in receipt of any pension which is subject to a means test receives an increase in means, that person's means must be re-assessed to take the increase into account and if it appears that the person is not entitled to the rate of pension in payment, the pension must be reduced or revoked as the case may require.</P>
      <P>In one of the cases to which the Deputy's question refers, the pensioner, who had been in receipt of the maximum old age pension, held a halfshare in a winning sweepstake ticket which realised £13,500.  The annual value of this sum for old age pension purposes, amounted to £1,328 15s. 0. As this, of course, exceeded the statutory limit of £104 15s. 0, for receipt of a pension the pension was accordingly revoked.</P>
      <P>In the second case, the pensioner, who had been in receipt of the maximum pension, also held a winning sweepstake ticket and received £2,480. The annual value of this sum exceeds the statutory limit for receipt of a pension and the question of revoking the pension has been taken up.</P>
      <P>In the remaining case, the pensioner was in receipt of an old age pension of 15/- per week.  She won £187 7s. 8d. in a crossword competition and her means were re-assessed to take into account the increase in capital.  This resulted in a reduction of 5/- per week in her pension.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  I am informed by the Commissioner of Valuation that without considerable research, for which staff cannot be made available in the Valuation Office at the present time due to the statutory obligation on the <Col N="944" /> Commissioner to issue the revised valuation lists by 1st March, 1960, it would not be possible to state the average time taken to make a valuation.

I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to remember that auctioneers down the country are just as dependable as some of the gentlemen sent from the city of Dublin.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no legal obstacle to the execution of drainage works on the rivers mentioned under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  All of those rivers, however, discharge directly or indirectly into the Shannon and are associated with the Shannon flood problem.

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the answer given fully covers the Deputy's question. There is no legal obstacle to considering them, but at the moment it would be unwise to tell the Deputy they are being considered because they are very much a part of the Shannon flood problem.  The Deputy knows perfectly well that anything which will aggravate that problem further will not be undertaken until a decision is taken regarding the Shannon drainage generally.</P>

      <P>I want to get the facts clear.  Is it not the position that the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act specifically precludes the Board of Works from embarking on piecemeal drainage within an existing catchment area? Is it not true that a number of the rivers referred to are part of the Shannon catchment area and, therefore, the Board of Works, by reason of a section in the Act I have referred to, are precluded from embarking on a drainage scheme until such time as a scheme is envisaged for the Shannon itself?</P>

      <P>The requirement that applications for licences be made not later than 1st March, 1960, is an essential part of the new procedure whereby certain classes of licence will be issued only to applicants approved by the Commission.

The pay is based, as I have stated, on the amount of business transacted in the office. Some of the offices are money order <Col N="961" /> offices.  Some of them are not money order offices.  In relation to the question of defalcations mentioned by the Deputy, the defalcations are small in comparison with the large amount of money&mdash;it reaches millions of pounds &mdash;handled by officials of the Post Office and are not related in any way to the question of the amount of remuneration payable to sub-postmasters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamMurphy" hpid="Mr. W. Murphy Mr. W. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking on this Bill as a rural Deputy having no interest other than the interest of the rural population and the rural publican. Last week, other Deputies in speaking here represented themselves as rural Deputies.  It may seem strange that I as a rural Deputy have different ideas of the rural publican from those people who represented the rural publican as one whose whole idea was to break the law any time and every time he could.  They even stated that at any hour of the night you could knock at his door and get a drink.  I have spent my life in Clare and I can assure the House that those are not the facts.</P>
      <P>I admit there are perhaps a few cases of publicans who, due to force of circumstances, due to the depressed state of business in our towns and villages to-day, had to break the law now and again in order to meet commitments which they had to meet as publicans.  Who has been treated worse than the publican over the years in every Bill that has been passed through this House?  He has to live under the law whether he likes it or not.  He is supposed to open at a certain time and close at a certain time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we make these references to the rural publican breaking the law, we are not being fair to the Garda.  As far as I know, the Garda do their duty without fear or favour. It is not right for any Deputy by a statement made in the House to bring before the higher officers of the Garda Síochána what one might call a complaint in regard to the way the Garda are carrying out their duties in relation to public houses.  I do not think that is right.  What we should be discussing <Col N="964" /> here is not what has happened under previous legislation.  We are trying to help the Minister to select an hour which will suit both the rural and the city trade.  The Minister has my sympathy because that is a very difficult matter to decide.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to suggest an hour because from listening to the statement of the Minister today, I believe the hour has already been decided. I may be wrong but that is the impression the Minister left on my mind.  However, in selecting that hour, I hope there will be no differentiation between the city publican will enjoy the same facilities as the city publican and the city people.  Whatever hour is decided upon, I hope it will be one which will give the publican a fair chance of abiding by the law and a fair chance of providing for himself and his family a decent standard of living, something to which they are entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on having the courage to introduce an Intoxicating Liquor Bill because I do not care to what Party the Minister may belong, it takes a man of great courage to introduce such a Bill.  I remember years ago an ex-Minister for Justice mentioning to me that any man who decided to introduce an Intoxicating Liquor Bill would bring a hornet's nest around his head and would deserve the congratulations of every side of the House on its introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is parochial and has created great controversy among all sections of the people and all sections of the trade.  In the Bill, it is suggested that during the months of June, July, August and September, the closing hour should be 11.30 p.m., and during the other months, the closing hour should be 10.30 p.m.  I have no really fixed opinions as to whether these closing hours are correct or not, but if there is a case for 11.30 p.m. for those four summer months, the month of May should also be included.  Every rural Deputy who is claiming that the rural people are working in the fields until <Col N="965" /> 9.30 p.m. and 10 o'clock and that they require time to get refreshments knows there are longer hours of daylight in the month of May than in the months of July, August and September. There is a great case to be made for 11.30 p.m. closing during the month of May.</P>
    <P>I do not hold with those rural Deputies who say rural people work until 9.30 at night, that they work from a quarter to five in the morning, as Deputy Corry said.  They do not work from a quarter to five in the morning.  There are a few people whose jobs require them to work continuously from that time. The only time the farmer works from 4.45 a.m. is when he decides to go to a fair.  Deputy Palmer has just indicated to me that he is milking his cows at that time.  Can any farmer Deputy tell me that he out milking his cows at a quarter to five in the morning?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>He is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not.  He is out milking the cows about 7 a.m.  The people are completely divided on the merits of this Bill.  Even the members of this House and the members of the various political Parties are divided. The members of the licensed trade are divided as to the merits of the Bill and the employees themselves are divided as to the most suitable hours of trading.</P>
      <P>It was suggested by somebody that it would be time enough for licensed houses to open at 11 a.m.  I suppose there is a great case to be made for that.  I do not know of any publican who has customers waiting to come into his premises at 10 a.m. or 10.30 a.m.  There are other considerations. The staff have to clean up the premises from the day before.  The place has to be restocked.  Bottling has to be done.  If the opening hour of the licensed house is not until 11 a.m. or 11.30 a.m., time must be found during the day to do all the work that is done behind the scenes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon's suggestion should seriously be considered.  It was that instead of closing public house doors <Col N="966" /> at closing time at night, they should be opened and the onus of getting out of the premises placed on the customer and not on the publican.  When you consider that the publican has to rattle glasses, to keep shouting &ldquo;Time&rdquo;, and to plead with his customers to get out, you will appreciate that it is really most degrading for him.  If the doors were opened and a policeman on duty outside saw fit to walk into the premises, he should be encouraged to do so and penalise any customer who, after a reasonable time, failed to vacate them.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in some circles that a new type of penalty should be imposed on publicans in matters such as this.  No matter how long the customer remains on the premises in such circumstances, the publican should not be concerned, provided he is not caught serving a drink.  If he is caught serving a drink, then impose a penalty such as a day's suspension or two days' suspension of licence as the justice thinks fit, but there should be no such thing as an endorsement of licence.  Those penalties would ultimately be more severe than any type of reprimand that could be meted out in a district court.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish&mdash;he did not give it as his own opinion&mdash;mentioned that there is a viewpoint in this country that it might be the right thing if we had no closing hours but a 24-hours' trade.  He quoted France as an example.  I would point out that there is a greater incidence of juvenile alcoholism in France than in any country in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not advocate it &mdash;on the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know; I said the Deputy mentioned that there was a certain viewpoint in this country. There is a licensing Bill going through the House of Keys in the Isle of Man. An admirable suggestion is made there.  I understand it concerns Sunday trading hours in the Isle of Man where there are no trading hours at the moment.  The suggestion is that a trial period of 12 months should be given when such a controversial Bill is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some members of the public or <Col N="967" /> members of the Oireachtas might suggest: &ldquo;You have a trial period because the Minister is in a position to introduce another Bill in a year or two, if this Bill does not seem workable.&rdquo;  I recall what a previous Minister for Justice, Deputy G. Boland, said after he had introduced the 1942 Licensing Bill.  I think that, 12 months after the enactment of that Bill, he said he was sorry he had not gone further. In other words, he had regrets that he did not go further with the Bill of 1942.  Eighteen years had to elapse before a new Bill was introduced.  If there were a trial period of a year or two in order to see how the provisions of this Bill would work out, there would be an obligation on the Minister to review the whole position within that specified year and I think it would help in the introduction of a Bill as controversial as this.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have suggested that there should be a later opening than 11.30 p.m.&mdash;say, to midnight.  In the city of Dublin, many city centre publicans applied for and were granted special exemption orders for the period of the Spring Show, the Horse Show and An Tostal.  You could play football in the pubs after 11 p.m.  It was expected that the extension of hours would attract many customers.  I believe sincerely that it failed to serve the purpose for which the licence was granted.  That is the greatest case that can be made against late trading hours.</P>
    <P>The question of late trading hours and their influence on dangerous driving, driving accidents, and so on, is something that has been dragged up and down byways and back lanes and everywhere else.  Figures were given recently showing that deaths and accidents in Northern Ireland over the past 12 months were 5,000 and in Éire, 4,000.  In the past 12 months, one might say we have had open trading in the Twenty-Six Counties.  There was most restricted trading in the Six Counties, most restricted, I suggest, as far as the ordinary licensed houses were concerned, but almost unrestricted underground and shebeen trading&mdash;and that is where the difference comes in.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> Will the unrestricted trading and the shebeen trading which I believe is going on to a great extent in this country be curtailed under this Bill, and will those people who carry on that type of trade be subject to the same police supervision as the public houses are subject to at the moment? I believe that the suggested closing hours&mdash;11.30 p.m. or 11 p.m.&mdash;should apply to every type of house that is entitled to serve liquor, be it a pub, hotel, restaurant, or any such premises.</P>
    <P>The days have long since passed&mdash; and successive Ministers for Justice must be in agreement with me when they see fit to introduce an Intoxicating Liquor Bill like this&mdash;when a drink was required to enable a person to travel and apparently that is the reason why we feel we should make provision for a person sitting down for a meal to have a drink.</P>
    <P>If 11.30 p.m. is considered sufficiently late for a licensed house to trade, I suggest to the Minister that 11.30 p.m. is late enough for every other place.  Deputy Ryan and Deputy Lindsay deplored the possibility of customers trooping out from public houses in the city of Dublin and hanging out of the late buses going home.  I think they are just playing on their imagination when they suggest such a thing.  The people who will be drinking at 11.30 p.m., if this Bill is passed, will be drinking locally.  The few people who will be drinking in the centre of the city at that time of night, and live in the suburbs, will be people with their own transport.  It is wrong to suggest or even to imply that 20, 30 or 40 per cent. of the people who come from the public houses in the centre of the city on any week evening are under the influence of drink.  The percentage of people who leave the city pubs at night under the influence of drink is very small indeed.  One Deputy even got up and congratulated the Irish people on the fact that they were not alcoholics.</P>
    <P>On this amendment, I have nothing further to add, other than to make a special plea to the Minister to consider including the month of May or, which would make it more <Col N="969" /> definite, to include rather than the four summer months as mentioned in the section, that period which is known as &ldquo;new time.&rdquo;  I would also ask the Minister to use his good offices with the Department of Local Government in suggesting that in view of the hardship that will be inflicted on those publicans who are to lose as a result of the abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> trade, their valuation, which affects their licence fees and their rates, should come under very favourable consideration.  Some of these houses have been purchased, renovated and reconstructed at great expense and they have a colossal burden of taxation placed on them. It is safe to say that 60 to 70 per cent. of their trade will be wiped out as a result of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Naturally when a legislative measure like this comes before the House for discussion, Deputies will inevitably examine it from the point of view of how it will affect the constituency which they represent, whether it is a rural or an urban constituency.  Deputy Cosgrave, in speaking to the amendment which he has put down, said that his constituency was partly rural and partly urban.  In my opinion, he argued very convincingly for an extension of the closing hour in rural areas and more or less for a retention of the present hour in the built-up or urban area. I find myself in a somewhat similar position in so far as I have some experience&mdash;being associated with the sale of drink in the city&mdash;from the publican's point of view and I represent a rural constituency.</P>

    <P>I think that there is some merit in the contention that an extension should be made in the rural areas, but as far as Dublin city is concerned, at any rate, and as far as my personal view goes, I think the present closing hours of 10 p.m. in winter and 10.30 p.m. in the summer are quite adequate to meet the ordinary demands of the public.  But since there appears to be a need to wind up what is known as the <i>bona fide</i> traffic, it is absolutely essential that whatever emerges from this debate, we should stick to the principle of uniformity.  I feel if the <Col N="970" /> Dáil decided to depart from that principle we would inevitably reproduce most of the inadequacies that we have known from the <i>bona fide</i> trade.</P>
    <P>I feel the spirit of the proposal would be defeated if there was only a slight difference between city and rural areas.  To some extent, a half hour might not make a tremendous difference.  There would not be a stampede from the city to the suburban districts, but nevertheless the risk is there and if there should be any road accidents or any ill-consequences as a result of departing from uniformity, there would be a hue and cry from the public and general condemnation of the measure this House introduced because of the departure from the principle of uniformity.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that uniformity should be adhered to in the strictest sense of the term.  Having said that, and although I have said that the present time is quite suitable in the Dublin area, I recognise that, in justice, we must to some extent meet the circumstances of people whose livelihoods will be impaired to an extent by doing away with the <i>bona fide</i> traffic. There are people in the suburbs of this city who have invested huge capital sums and physical effort into building up their business and I should be long sorry to be a member of this House when it legislated to do away with their livelihoods completely.</P>
    <P>I feel that to meet the situation, the Dáil would be wise in extending the hours by, say, one half hour.  You would adequately meet the needs of the rural areas if the general closing hour were 11 p.m.  If there is need for an extension, it is certainly in the summer time when the sun is high in the sky and it is broad daylight at 10.30 p.m. or 11 p.m.  People in rural areas are inclined to stay at their work and they look for recreation and refreshment only when the light begins to close in and you would not want to deprive these people of the normal recreation of having a drink.  I think an extension of a half an hour would be quite in order and justifiable.  I would say that 11 p.m. all over the country in summer time and 10.30 p.m. in winter time would meet the normal drinking requirements <Col N="971" /> of the consuming public. These hours certainly would meet and satisfy the requirements of people engaged in the trade.</P>
    <P>The Minister, on a number of occasions during the debate, directed the attention of Deputies to the provisions and safeguards under the Shop Acts whereby assistants will not be called upon to work longer than a 48 hour week and six hours over-time and to the fact that the extension of the hours will not involve them in any additional work.  That is all very well from the assistants' point of view.  Undoubtedly, it will lead to the recruitment of additional staff with a consequential increase in the price of drink.</P>
    <P>You must have your house adequately staffed if your doors are open. In order to fulfil the requirements of the Shop Acts, I think the law will compel many publicans at any rate to recruit additional staff.  That will inevitably lead to an increase in the price of drink while the assistants will not be involved in any extra work.  I am afraid, if the hours are extended to 10.30 p.m., we shall see an increase in the price of drink.  Certainly the people in the city houses working up to 11.30 p.m. will have to clean up the place and do whatever little tidying up that is necessary and get transport home.  I think that is going to constitute a very serious problem for them.  I certainly think that 11.30 p.m. must lead to some disruption in the home.</P>
    <P>I am associated with the business to some extent.  I represent a rural constituency and I feel I can look at this problem through rational rather than parochial glasses.  I am convinced that 11 p.m. in the summer time and 10.30 p.m. in the winter time would be the most suitable hours to meet the normal drinking requirements of the public.  It has been said that publicans will not be compelled to remain open if they choose, that they are quite within their rights to close at whatever time they decide to do so.  That seems a reasonable argument to advance but if a number of organised publicans in the city areas decide that they will close, as they <Col N="972" /> have been doing at 10.30 that will lead to abuses.  The outcome might be the growing up round the city centre area of &ldquo;speakeasies&rdquo;.  Whatever the outcome may be, I am convinced that the fines should be much more severe than they have been, in order to promote a healthy respect for the law.  The person found drinking after hours should be penalised at least to the same extent as the publican who is involved in a breach of the licensing laws.</P>
    <P>Whilst Deputy Dillon's suggestion merits serious consideration, I do not think it is practicable.  The suggestion is that one could switch off the lights, come out from behind the counter and remind the customers of the risks they are running by remaining on.  It would be a very simple solution to the problem if it could be dealt with in that way.  I do not think it is altogether as simple as that.  The atmosphere in a public house, as a rule, does not lend itself to the kind of simple reminder where you say that the customer is transgressing the law and will be responsible if the police happen to come along.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything further I want to say beyond repeating that, when the Minister and the Government come to make a final decision in this matter, they should very seriously consider fixing the hours at 10.30 p.m. in the winter months all over the country and 11 p.m. in the summer months and that they should certainly not depart from the principle of uniformity.</P>

      <P>The views put forward by Deputy Maher are my views also. When I heard him urge the Minister that the hours of closing should be 10.30 p.m. in the winter and 11 p.m. in the summer, I could not help thinking it was a pity the Minister decided that the Fianna Fáil Party would vote as a Party <i>en bloc</i> and not be allowed to express, or at least to record, their viewpoint by voting for a particular hour of closing, because I feel there are many other Fianna Fáil Deputies in the House who might possibly hold similar views to those expressed by Deputy Maher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody agrees that there is a <Col N="973" /> dire need for more effective control of this liquor business.  It is a very controversial issue.  So controversial is it that it has taken a number of years for the Commission to report.  The Report is now before the House for discussion. Many views have been expressed in regard to the hour of closing but no matter what hour we determine for the closing of public houses, in my opinion it will come to nought unless the people generally, those who frequent public houses excessively, become reorientated in their attitude to this whole business of drinking.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that no amount of legislation will prevent excessive drinking. That is a question for each individual. If this Bill passes, as it appears it will, what will be the effects of the hours of closing?  The barmen, the assistants, who work in public houses at present have a fairly long day as it is.  If we pass a measure causing them to have a longer working day, I think it will be bad.  It will have a spiral effect, a vicious circle effect, for in so far as those barmen will press for higher wages the publican, if he can lawfully do so, will increase the price of his drink.</P>
    <P>Another bad effect that will result from extending the hours of closing will relate to the traffic on the roads, especially at night time.  I think it is mostly at night time that serious accidents occur.  If we are to extend the closing hours it will mean that more people will be travelling on the roads later at night in their cars.  Some of them will be very much under the influence of drink.  Others will have a little drink but I think it is accepted as correct that a person does not need to be intoxicated or to have an excessive amount of drink taken to render him incapable of reacting quickly and properly to an emergency when driving a motor car.  A very small amount of drink would render him incapable of proper reaction.  The two effects I have mentioned, one relating to a longer working day for the barmen and bar assistants and the other with its tendency to create greater hazards on the road at night at a late hour, pale into insignificance when we visualise the deleterious effect <Col N="974" /> increased facilities for drinking could have on home life itself.  Are there not enough broken homes in the country without adding to their number?</P>
    <P>I am not attempting to moralise on this subject.  I am just expressing viewpoints as they occur to me and I am speaking as I think I should.  In my opinion, there are enough facilities for drinking at present.  People who wish to drink have the whole long day in which to do so and the Minister would be doing a very bad day's work if he extended the facilities.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that there should be a differential in the hours of closing as between rural areas and urban districts, cities and towns.  I can sympathise with the viewpoint expressed in that regard because I agree that rural workers, especially in the summer months, work pretty late. Sometimes they do not finish until 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening and they have not the same opportunity of frequenting a public house and availing of drinking facilities as their urban brothers have.</P>
    <P>However, there is a great danger that if a differential were brought into being, it would revive the <i>bona fide</i> trade because the urban dweller who drinks could go out to the rural areas at 8 or 8.30 at night and stay there until the public houses closed.  That would have a twin-edged effect.  It would mean that the <i>bona fide</i> trade would be re-established and also that the urban public houses would suffer financially from lack of trade and custom because their regular customers could go into the rural areas for an extra half hour or hour's drinking.</P>
    <P>I am of the opinion that there should be a common closing hour of 10.30 p.m. in the winter and of 11 p.m. in the three or four summer months.  That would provide ample opportunities for all reasonable persons who wanted to drink.  The views of the various unions affected by this measure and the views of the publicans, the Pioneer Association and of the public generally have been expressed in no uncertain manner, and I think I am right in saying that the <Col N="975" /> consensus of opinion appears to weigh favourably towards retaining, or at least not increasing, the present opening hours.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of a plebiscite and it has been suggested that the Minister should put a question on the ballot papers for the local government elections this year to let the people express their views on this very controversial matter.  I do not agree that there should be a plebiscite because the members of this House have been elected to represent the people.</P>

      <P>The people put them here and I presume the people have confidence in them to run the country as best they can.  I think this House is the sole authority in matters of that kind, subject to ratification, endorsement or rejection in the successive elections.</P>
      <P>One thing which, to a great extent, would reduce the frequency of infringements of the licensing laws would be to impose very heavy fines on both publican and customer, whenever infringements are discovered and proven. There are faults on both sides, on the publican's side and on the customer's side.  Of course, some publicans are conscientious and obey the letter of the law, but there are others who are unscrupulous.  Likewise, we find unscrupulous people who drink, as well as good conscientious people and, as a strict deterrent and a measure of the sincerity of the Minister's desire to improve the position, I believe he should seriously consider heavy fines. I understand that we are prevented from referring to the Sunday hours on this section so I shall refrain from making any reference to that point until the proper time.</P>

      <P>As a rural Deputy, I wish to make a few remarks on this Bill.  Deputy Corburn said there was disunity on this side of the House with regard to the opening hours, but if he goes back over the debates, he will find the same applies on that side.  I heard several Deputies over there advocate a closing hour of 11.30 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards a free vote, we shall all make up our minds and do what we think is best.  On the suggestion that there should be closing at 11 p.m. in the towns and at 11.30 p.m. in the rural areas, I do not think that people will travel a distance of seven or eight miles, and back again, for an extra half-hour's drinking. Deputy Ryan, speaking about the city and late hours, said that people would miss their buses and have sick heads the following morning, but they need not go back to a publichouse for a cure.  They can go into a chemist's shop and get a cure, but in many small villages we do not have chemists' shops.  We do not need them in the country areas because very few people who drink in the local villages have sick heads.  The man who comes into a village will not go home drunk.  I often did it myself and accompanied other gentlemen home from a village and very few of them get drunk.  They come into a village pub to have a chat, a game of cards or rings, and very few of them are drunk when they go home.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan has spoken of people going home drunk late at night in Dublin and getting up in the morning with sore heads.  I do not believe that is true.  If they should have to walk a half a mile or a mile, it is a pretty good cure for a sore head the following morning.  Reference has also been made to drinking at dances. I know cases where a public house is closed at 10 p.m. and the people in it go to a dance hall a couple of hundred yards away and drink until 3 o'clock in the morning.  I have seen plenty of court cases as a result of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all been circularised by the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association. We all know that they are doing good work but they are trying to put it down the throats of Deputies that we are voting for later hours and excessive drinking.  That is not the case. If the law is to be enforced, and it should be enforced, it will cut out a lot of excessive drinking.  People found in public houses should be <Col N="977" /> fined as heavily or more heavily than the publican.  I know that once those people get in, the publican finds it very hard to get them out again and that is the cause of a lot of trouble.</P>
    <P>It has been said that in the country areas they do not get up too early in the morning.  Perhaps some people do not but some farmers are on the roads at 5.30 a.m. delivering milk.  Those of us who come here to the Dáil know that the first thing we hear in the mornings is the milkmen and the busmen going to their jobs.  I do not think we shall do any harm by extending the closing time to 11.30 p.m. in the country areas.  I have heard all the rural Deputies give that opinion. I think these people who are trying to influence us should take a reasonable view of this matter and forget about trying to force us to vote one way or the other.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion made here that May should be included in the four months of summer and I think there is a case to be made for that. New time comes into operation in the month of April and I would support the suggestion that May be included in the summer months.  We welcome this Bill and I think the Minister has made a good case for it.  Deputy Maher may not like the proposed 11.30 p.m. closing but we shall suit ourselves and vote according to our consciences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Government have not made up their minds as regards the hours proposed in this Bill.  It they have, it is the end of it, but I hope they will be agreeable and that in the end, we shall get an agreed Bill.  I think that on a matter of national importance, and this is a matter of national importance, we should get agreement.  The fixing of the hours for the closing of public houses is of major importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country, for a number of years, had a bad name for people who drank too much or who were not able to hold their drink.  However, money values have changed and that change has had the result that we do not see many drunken people now. Of course, there may be a minority of people in this country, as there are in every other country, who drink <Col N="978" /> more than they should, but the majority of people want to see the law enforced.  I hope that when the Bill is passed, the law will be enforced in justice to everybody.</P>
    <P>The principal matter we want to uphold is the preservation of family life.  Any of us who come from country areas know to what extent family life has been destroyed by people drinking in public houses after closing time and spending the money that belongs to their wives and children.  We find misery in many homes because a man or a boy stays out late in a public house and spends more money than he should.  That happened because the law was too lax.  In bringing in a law like this, we should regard it as permanent legislation. I do not like measures being brought in here and then changed every other year.  In the case of the licensing laws, there should be no need for much change from one year to another.  We should take an example from the North of Ireland. We claim to be a more Christian people than they are and yet we find that they have 10 o'clock closing the whole year round and that the law is strictly enforced.  Is there any reason why we cannot do the same thing here?</P>
    <P>I think a closing hour of 11.30 p.m. is too late.  We must cater for the Irish people first and you will find that if you enforce your own laws, you will get respect for them from the foreigner.  We should make Irish laws for the Irish people and make the stranger abide by those laws.  A closing hour of 10.30 p.m. the whole year round would be reasonable.  If a man leaves a public house at that hour, it will take him another hour to get home and by the time he is in bed, it will be 12 o'clock.  This nation needs more production and you will not get more production if you have the people staying up until after the midnight hour and waking up with sore heads.</P>
    <P>These are the things that should be considered.  When you bring in a Bill to deal with a matter like this, it should be a good Bill and one that will meet the wishes of the majority of the people.  A very large number <Col N="979" /> of people are concerned about this Bill.  No matter where you go, the first question you are asked is: &ldquo;What way are you going to vote on this question of hours?&rdquo;  It is not a case of the Pioneers trying to shove this matter down our throats.  It is the talk of fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters all over the country.</P>
    <P>This country, being a Christian country, ought to have Christian laws and the first thing to be considered is family life.  If you have late drinking hours, you are making family life very hard.  I know many good homes which are in misery because of a lounger of a father or a son who holds on to the weekly wage instead of giving it to his family.  The result is that the children are almost hungry. They are sad, too, because they see their mother unable to buy the necessaries of life.  You have this big lounger having a royal time of it because we allow late drinking hours.</P>
    <P>I believe 10.30 p.m. is late enough. It is time for anybody to be in bed. We think 10.30 very late when we come out of here at night and we see the streets almost empty.  The Government should think twice before trying to force through a Bill with the late hour of 11.30 p.m.  They are just trying to imitate the stranger, whereas they should be considering the ordinary people of Ireland.  They should be trying to bring back our people to Christian habits.</P>
    <P>There was a time when our people had a bad name for drinking.  When drink was cheap, we made proper fools of ourselves.  If drink were cheap in the morning, our people would make proper fools of themselves again.  It is not that we are &ldquo;goody-goodies&rdquo; today; it is simply that drink is dear and money scarce. A sober Ireland will always be a free Ireland and, therefore, we should adopt reasonable drinking hours.  You will get the blessings of everybody&mdash; the wives, the children, the clergymen &mdash;if you are manly enough to stand for what is right.</P>
    <P>The Government should be honest with the country and should re-establish the noble traditions of the Irish <Col N="980" /> race.  We should have a sober Ireland of which we can be proud and which will observe decent licensing laws.  But when the law has to be enforced, it should be enforced.  We do not want the position we had for the past five or six years when you could walk out the front door of a public house and go in by the back door&mdash;when the Guard leaving the barracks may be told by the publican on the phone: &ldquo;I will be ready in five minutes.  The boys have gone out.&rdquo;  If we have decent laws, they should be observed.  We are sick and tired of all that went on.  The law was not being enforced because it was as crooked and as rotten as it could be.  If we do not amend the law now, we are not worth our salt.</P>
    <P>We should be able to get agreement on the hours in this measure.  We should be able to show the country that we can get agreement on something. If we got that agreement, I believe the country would accept it. But there are about 100 different points of view.  The publicans have their point of view; so have the city Deputies; and so have the people down the country.  But we should cater for the majority.  There will always be a small minority out to break the law and have a royal time. But we should cater for those worth catering for: the children who are the fathers and mothers of tomorrow, and the old parents at home waiting for a drunken son to come home, perhaps to kick up a row, and knock down the dresser if there is not a good plate of meat set in front of him.  We should cater for the simple Irish people who want to live decent lives.  The Government should fix an hour that will be reasonable, and 10.30 p.m. would be reasonable the whole year around. Enforce that and you will have the blessings of the whole country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say at the outset that I am very pleased that the old <i>bona fide</i> system is to be abolished under this Bill.  That is definitely a step in the right direction.  Since the improvement in transport facilities over the past 20 or 30 years, that provision has become completely obsolete. In addition, it had been badly abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> On the amendment before the House concerning closing hours, I am completely opposed to the hours mentioned in the Bill.  I stand over the fact that the old hours were quite ample and that everybody was satisfied with them.  Deputy Fanning stands over the hours proposed in the Bill, which propose to give until 11.30 p.m. in the three summer months and 11 p.m. for the rest of the year.  He also stands over the differential between the hours in the city and town areas as against the rural areas.</P>
    <P>The first thing I want to say is that I would be in favour of uniformity. We will steer into the very same trouble as we have had in regard to enforcement and into the same abuses, if we have different hours.  We should have the same for one as for the other. This is not a huge, scattered empire like the United States or Russia which would require different regulations as between one area and another.  It would not impose any hardship to have the same regulations in town and country.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the proposal to increase the hours of drinking is made.  No representations were made to me on the possibility of increasing the hours, but I am absolutely deluged with representations from many people and many organisations to retain the present hours and not to support an increase.  I should like the Minister, when replying, to tell us what representations were made to him and what were the grounds for increasing the hours.  Deputy Giles mentioned the fact that quite a lot of damage was done in the past by over-drinking in this country.  We are all too painfully aware of that. Serious damage was done in the past, and I believe is still being done in an odd case.</P>
    <P>Many publicans have put this case to me, and I shall try to quote the words of a particular publican as well as I can remember them.  He said to me: &ldquo;A publican's life is a martyr's life.  We have to stand all day long during the opening hours listening to people talking about their own business, <Col N="982" /> and sometimes talking the greatest nonsense possible, while having a bottle of stout or a pint.&rdquo;  The case he put to me was that the publican at least wants the privacy of his home after 10.30 p.m.&mdash;or 10 p.m., if he can get it.  His house, according to statute, must be completely open up to that hour.  This publican put it to me that the publicans themselves want some little privacy, just as their customers do in their own homes. That is one aspect of the matter to which the Government ought to pay attention in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I want to protest against the reference made today by a Fianna Fáil Deputy to pressure groups exercising pressure on Deputies in connection with the Bill.  I presume the reference was to the Pioneer Association. The Pioneers are a very numerous body in this country.</P>
