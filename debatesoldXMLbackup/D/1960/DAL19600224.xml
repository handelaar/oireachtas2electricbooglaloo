    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach what impact the recently formed European Free Trade Area or Outer Seven is likely to have on the ability of this country to expand its exports of agricultural and industrial products to Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to assess with any accuracy the probable effects on exports from this country to Britain of the establishment of the European Free Trade Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards industrial goods we at present enjoy duty-free entry to the British market in respect of a wide range of products.  For the most part the same products from the other six members of EFTA are at present, on import to Britain, subject to duty.  The advantage we thus enjoy in respect of these exports will become progressively less according as Britain, beginning on 1 July next, gradually reduces over the next 10 years, and finally eliminates on 1 January, 1970, the duties to which such imports from those countries are subject.  In cases where quota restrictions on the goods of member countries of EFTA are relaxed as a result of the EFTA Convention our exports to Britain could also be affected.  We must therefore expect our industrial exports to Britain to meet progressively stronger competition from the other members of <Col N="686" /> EFTA, whether or not we are associated with that group.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to agricultural goods is different.  Generally speaking, the EFTA Convention does not involve the elimination of trade barriers in respect of agricultural products as defined in the Convention. It does, however, envisage the conclusion of agricultural agreements between two or more member States &ldquo;in order to facilitate the expansion of trade in agricultural goods&rdquo;; and any provisions regarding tariffs contained in such agreements will apply in favour of all other member States. Britain has made such an agreement with Denmark which will affect preference margins we have hitherto enjoyed in respect of bacon, canned cream and blue-veined cheese.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach, with regard to the Local Appointments Commission, has there been any significant reduction in the number of applicants?  Has that body not been completely ineffective or has it been boycotted?</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will give the break-down of the gross external assets, stated by him to be £210.2 millions at the 31st December, 1959, under the headings of the gross external assets held by the Central Bank, the Associated Banks and Departmental Funds.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the value of the net external assets of the State at 31st December, 1956, 1957, 1958 and 1959, giving in each case a break-down of the amount of the external assets held by the Central Bank, the Associated Banks and Departmental Funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to take questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>The break-down of the figure of £210.2 million for the external assets of the banking system and Departmental funds as at 31st December, 1959, is: Central Bank, £86.8 million; Associated Banks (net), £103.5 million; Departmental Funds, £19.9 million.  In the case of the Central Bank and Departmental Funds the &ldquo;gross&rdquo; and &ldquo;net&rdquo; external assets are identical.  In the case of the Associated Banks the gross external assets held by all the banks as at 31st December, 1959, were £267.0 million.  As this gross figure does not take account of the banks' own external liabilities the net figure is appropriate for use in computing the external assets of the State.  I might add for the Deputy's information that, in the case of a bank incorporated outside the State, the &ldquo;net external assets&rdquo; is taken as meaning the excess of its liabilities in the State over its assets in the State.</P>
      <P>The figures in Table 16 of the Report of the Central Bank for the year to 31st March, 1959, to which I referred in my reply of 10th February, 1960, may, therefore, be taken as referring to the net external assets of the banking system and Departmental Funds. As I indicated in that reply, sufficient information in not available on which to base a reliable estimate of the magnitude of the external assets in private hands.</P>

      <P>My attention has been drawn to a newspaper report containing a <Col N="692" /> statement that a district medical officer has not been available in Templemore. I am informed by the local authority that the district medical officer, Templemore dispensary district, went on sick leave, at short notice, on 4th January and did not resume duty until 26th January.  The local authority appointed a private practitioner residing in Roscrea, as a substitute for the district medical officer.  This practitioner acted as substitute throughout the whole period of the district medical officer's illness.</P>
      <P>In regard to a midwife for the town of Templemore, the permanent dispensary midwife for the Templemore dispensary district has been on sick leave since the end of July, 1959.  She has been replaced throughout her absence&mdash;from the end of July, 1959 to 6th February, 1960 by a midwife residing in the dispensary district and just outside the town of Templemore, and since the latter date by a midwife attached to an adjoining district.  The town of Templemore, has not, therefore, been left without either a doctor or a midwife at any time during the recent absences of the doctor or the midwife of the dispensary district.</P>
      <P>In regard to the statement that a sick man was without attention for hours, I have no information on this matter; but I am having this particular matter&mdash;and some other complaints regarding the health services in this area&mdash;investigated fully.</P>

      <P>No recent representations covering the general question referred to by the Deputy can be traced by my Department.  In regard to the question of financial assistance to persons unable to earn a living by reason of physical or mental defect, I would refer the Deputy to Section 5 of the Health Act, 1947 and Subsection (5) of Section 50 of the Health Act, 1953, and to the Scheme of Allowances for Disabled Persons payable under those sections.  In dealing with deaf mutes, however, I am advised that in the majority of cases the problem is not one of providing permanent financial assistance towards their maintenance but one of affording suitable education and training with a view to enabling such persons to earn a living.  Health Authorities are entitled under the provisions of the Health Acts to provide institutional <Col N="694" /> services including education and training for children in this class.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health in view of the fact that less than one-third of those children who are eligible for dental services under the schools dental service have in fact been examined what steps, if any, have been or are being taken to ensure that an adequate number of dentists will be made available for this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has apparently based his assumption that &ldquo;less than one-third of those children who are eligible for dental services under the schools dental service have in fact been examined&rdquo; on the tabular statement which accompanied the reply which I made to a question in the House on 17th instant.  He appears to have overlooked the significance of the first note to that table, which drew attention to the fact that the service is a continuing one while a child remains at school and that, consequently, a child who is not <Col N="695" /> examined or treated in a particular year may have been examined or treated in the preceding year and may be examined and, if necessary, treated in the succeeding year.  The position, therefore, is very much better than stated by the Deputy, although I agree that the present service is inadequate.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years there has been a considerable expansion in the dental service available for national school children.  The number of wholetime dentists employed by local authorities has increased by over 50 per cent. in that period.  Owing mainly to the attraction of employment for dentists abroad, particularly in Great Britain, difficulty has been experienced in filling vacancies for dentists in the local authority service.  I have the whole question under review at present and pending the completion of that review I do not propose to indicate the steps which may be taken to improve the service.</P>
      <P>It is clear, however, that treatment services alone will not solve the problem of dental health of children.  If the fluoridation of piped water supplies, for which provision is included in a Bill now before this House, is introduced, there should in time be a big reduction in the incidence of dental caries among children That reduction would enable the services of the public dental officers to be used to much better effect than is now possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that there were fewer dentists employed in the schools dental service in 1958 than in 1957, taking the whole-time and part-time dentists together?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is in error.  At present there are 73 whole-time and 50 part-time dental surgeons employed by local authorities, not counting about eight whole-time posts vacant for some months.  In 1955, there were 47 whole-time and 44 part-time dental surgeons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The years mentioned by me were 1957 and 1958, and the Minister's tabular statement showed <Col N="696" /> that the 1958 figure is 122 and the 1957 figure, 136.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health how many additional dentists are estimated as being required to ensure adequate inspection and treatment services under the schools dental service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The incidence of dental caries is so high among our school children, and the present school dental service in consequence falls so far short of being adequate to cope with the problem, that it is very difficult to give a reliable estimate of the figure sought by the Deputy.  If one were to take a ratio of one dentist to 1,500 school children, which would correspond to the dentist-to-population ratio applying to the population generally in Norway, the extra number of whole-time dentists required for the schools service would be of the order of 275. On the other hand a World Health Organisation Expert Committee has expressed the opinion that even in those countries, such as Norway, with the highest ratio of dentists to population, no more than one-third of the dental needs of the people are being met.  This suggests that, if we are to depend on treatment services alone, the number of additional dentists required to provide an adequate service for school children would be greater than the figure I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>In general the regulations governing attendance at the Local Offices of the Department for the purpose of furnishing evidence of unemployment require persons who reside within 2 miles from the Local Office to attend daily; those who reside over 2 miles and up to 4 miles to attend on alternate days and those resident over 4 miles and up to 6 miles to attend once per week. Persons resident over 6 miles from the Local Office are not required to attend <Col N="699" /> at all and instead they furnish evidence of unemployment certified by the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Relaxations of these requirements are in operation in the Dublin area and provide that persons (other than dock labourers and other casual workers) resident up to 2 miles from the appropriate Employment Exchange be required to attend only on alternate days; those resident over 2 miles and up to 4 miles to attend on two days per week while those who reside over 4 but less than 6 miles from the Exchange&mdash;of whom there are some in the Ballyfermot and other areas in the outer suburbs&mdash;are required to attend once per week.

    <P>NOTE.&mdash;Contribution rates were increased on the 3rd September, 1956, but some stamps at the old rates in respect of employment prior to that date were sold in the year ended 31st March, 1959.  The numbers of old rate stamps sold are shown separately except in the cases of the 2/6 and 2/- rates.  It is not possible to segregate the stamps sold at those two rates between the different kinds of employment covered by them.</P>

    <P>I would, however, refer the Deputy to section 11 of the Valuation (Ireland) <Col N="705" /> Act, 1852, which provides that the valuation in regard to houses and buildings shall be made upon an estimate of the net annual value thereof; that is to say, the rent for which, one year with another, the same might in its actual state be reasonably expected to let from year to year, the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance, and other expenses (if any) necessary to maintain the hereditament in its actual state, and all rates, taxes, and public charges, if any, (except tithe rentcharge) being paid by the tenant.</P>

For instance, in Meath, on the valuation of £20, the rate is £10 6 8, whereas in Donegal, on the valuation of £20, the rate is £19 6 0.  Would the Minister recommend to the Commissioners of Valuation that they should take the rates into account in assessing the annual net value and not to adopt the standard letting value as applied by local authorities?  By doing so, he would ease the hardship which is being imposed upon ratepayers, particularly in counties where the rates are high.</P>

      <P>The granting of a licence to run periodical lotteries is a matter for the district court.  The applications are heard in open court.  It would be contrary to established practice for me to supply the names of parties to court proceedings of any kind and I am not prepared to depart from that practice.</P>
      <P>Under the Gaming and Lotteries Act, there is no authority to require the organisations concerned to supply information about their financial position generally as distinct from information relating to the lotteries which they run.  There is authority to provide, by police regulations, for the keeping of accounts in relation to those lotteries and the furnishing of returns and information relating thereto.  The purpose of this provision is to enable the Garda Síochána to secure information to assist them in the detection of fraud and in the enforcement of the Act and it would, I think, be wrong, as it would almost certainly be contrary to the wishes and perhaps the interests of the organisations concerned, that information obtained in this way for a particular purpose should be made public for any other purpose.</P>

      <P>Apart from logs of veneer quality which it is necessary to conserve for our new veneer mill, ash, beech and sycamore are the only timbers on which a serious export limitation is at present imposed.  The latter are allowed to be exported only when sawn to small dimensions.  There is a scarcity of these timbers and the control is maintained in the interest of the manufacturers who use them.</P>
      <P>All other timbers are allowed to be exported freely, either in the round in the case of certain softwoods, or very roughly sawn in all other cases.  I see no need to alter these restrictions at present.</P>

In a tabular statement the number of applicants was given as 130 and the number of houses under construction as 25.  The facts are that there are no new houses being built for the Waterford County Borough, but there may be 25 houses under construction. That is where the error or the riddle came in.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Order for the Committee Stage of the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill 1958, be discharged and that the Bill be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Actually, I have the draft of the <Col N="730" /> new Bill here with me but there is one matter still under discussion with the Incorporated Law Society and until that particular matter is settled we cannot bring the Bill before the Government.  I hope that when this matter is disposed of and Government approval obtained the Bill will be ready for circulation, but I do not know when it will be possible to take it in the House in view of the amount of legislation that the Department of Justice is dealing with at the moment. As the Deputy knows, we are taking the Intoxicating Liquor Bill at present.  We anticipate time.  This, may take a considerable time.  This, together with the Financial Business which will be intervening, makes it impossible for me to say when the Solicitors Bill will actually be ready for discussion in the House unless perhaps we could interrupt other business for a short time, say the Intoxicating Liquor Bill or something like that.  I am afraid I cannot see the new Solicitors Bill coming in during this session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are prepared to agree to the procedure proposed by the Minister for Justice in the light of circumstances obtaining.  There is on us an obligation emphatically to direct the attention of the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government to the situation which has been created as a result of the difficulties of proceeding with the number of Bills at present on the Order Paper and to point out that the existing situation is one in which it is virtually impossible for the profession to maintain the discipline they conceive it to be their duty, and rightly, in our judgment, conceive it to be their duty, to enforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter which I trust is not absent from the Minister's mind, that is, that in relief of clients, the solicitors' profession has given a qualified joint undertaking to indemnify clients who may sustain loss as a result of a default of a solicitor. The present position is that, while that obligation still rests upon the profession, albeit in a qualified form, they have not got the powers to maintain the standards of practice <Col N="731" /> which would give the profession reasonable security against large claims developing against them consequent on an individual's default.  Therefore, the existing situation is one which this Legislature cannot with propriety allow to remain outstanding indefinitely.</P>
    <P>We fully appreciate the difficulties with which the Minister for Justice is contending in this matter, which is highly technical.  It is extremely desirable that, on this second or third attempt effectively to legislate in this matter, there should be no miscarriage. At the same time, the Minister and the Government ought seriously to consider giving a high priority to what I hope will be an agreed solution of this solicitors' problem, even at the cost of postponing other legislation which might not be so urgent of enactment as this legislation most undoubtedly is from the point of view of both the profession itself and of litigants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the problems which the Deputy has mentioned.  I am also conscious of the desirability of proceeding with the Bill at the earliest possible moment, but the question the Deputy has just mentioned is the question which is at present being negotiated between the Department and the Incorporated Law Society.  I think that when that is settled, we shall be in a position to produce the Bill to the Government and when the Government have approved of it, we shall be in a position to come to a decision, as the Deputy has suggested, on the question of giving it priority over other business. It may be that we shall have to give priority if the matter is as pressing as the Deputy suggests it is.  I myself think it is rather important at the moment from the point of view that there may be people at present who are entitled to compensation and who cannot get it because the Bill is held up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have the opportunity of being present for the Committee Stage of the Bill, but certainly I read the debate with interest and I appreciate also the distance the Minister went to try to clarify the various points raised by Deputies who spoke on all sides of the House. Deputy Cosgrave appeared worried about a certain type of vehicle, particularly furniture vans, and the Minister gave an indication that he would consider the position between then and the Final Stage.</P>
      <P>These furniture removal vans are definitely in a peculiar position.  For instance, if one purchases new furniture, it is often delivered in containers, such as boxes or bales, which would not be included in the unladen weight of the vehicle for the purpose of assessing unladen weight under this Bill. But strange as it may seem, once this furniture becomes secondhand, and is moved in a vehicle which has a furniture container carried thereon, the unladen weight of the vehicle includes the container itself.  The Minister did express the view that such furniture removal vans were standard and were confined to haulage contractors of such class of merchandise and that up to the present such containers have been included in the unladen weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may be so, but a practice has grown up of procuring containers which are merely placed on the chassis or the bodywork of the vehicle for the purpose of removing furniture.  If the container is merely placed thereon and not affixed in any way by bolts or tied on with ropes, I wonder would the container be taken into consideration in calculating the unladen weight of the vehicle?  It would cut both ways. It might be that owners of lorries might try to evade the purpose of the Bill by merely placing such containers on the vehicle, or again, you might find these <i>bona fide</i> hauliers who have contaiers attached or fixed to their vehicles, removing the attachment merely for the purpose of reducing the unladen weight.  Perhaps the Minister <Col N="733" /> would answer that point when making his final speech.</P>
    <P>The Minister also went a good distance to meet some of the objections to the Bill by giving certain tax remissions where vehicles are used merely for a portion of the year.  He mentioned particularly the containers used on creamery vehicles.  There is one point which really worries me in that regard.  The Minister said that where the container&mdash;I may be wrong about this&mdash;is used during a certain month and if it is not used for the remainder of the year, there would be a remission for the remainder of the year.  If I am wrong in that&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position then.  Could the Minister state when the unladen weight of the vehicle would be ascertained.  For instance, take a farmer using his vehicle at harvest time, merely for bringing in his crops, or take the creamery using its vehicle merely at the peak milk period of the summer months, would it be necessary, to procure the unladen weight of the vehicle at the beginning of the tax year?  If that is so, then when one taxes the vehicle in January, one would be paying tax on it up to, say, September, bringing the vehicle out for the harvest and then, when the harvest is finished, one could get a rebate, say, from 1st October to the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>What is worrying me is this.  The Minister has gone a long way to make certain concessions to people who use vehicles for certain months and he particularly instanced the case of milk producers who use the vehicles merely in the peak periods and who in the winter months, would be entitled to a remission of duty on removing these containers from the vehicles.  Is it at the beginning of the tax year that the unladen weight will be ascertained?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister tells me he intends to do it by regulation that is sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I did outline to a fair degree on Committee Stage, during the Deputy's unavoidable absence, the details of how that regulation is likely to work, but we are not final on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister tells me that after consultation with his advisers, he will make regulations, I am quite satisfied.  I have no doubt that the regulations will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> A question was also raised on Committee Stage on what is now known as the hardship rule applied by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The Minister was asked a question as to the number of applicants who sought the application of the hardship rule and while he did not confine himself to any particular figure, he said that possibly between then and the Final Stage of the Bill, he might be able to give a figure.  That was in reply to a question put by Deputy Norton.  Perhaps the Minister might be able to give that in his final statement.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in regard to which it is difficult for the Minister, I know, to assist people.  It is a matter which is worrying.  There are some classes of merchandise of a sterling value and fairly small which are carried but which occupy a considerable bulk.  May I instance hay by way of contrast, say, with coal?  A person who carries a lorry-load of unbaled hay requires very high cribs or creels as they are called in some parts of the country.  There is also the transport of unbaled seaweed&mdash;a type of merchandise transport which is growing very much in the Minister's and my county.  These commodities are not of very high sterling value but very high cribs or creels&mdash;what are called double creels&mdash;are necessary for their transport, whereas smaller and much lighter creels or cribs are required for the transport of a much more valuable commodity, namely coal.</P>
    <P>It is unfair that the person who has to transport the cheaper commodity should have to pay a much higher tax by way of unladen weight on the mode of transport which he uses.  I appreciate the difficulty for any Minister or his Department in trying to alleviate the burden on these classes of people.  I merely mention them to show that there is a burden.  Possibly while the Minister cannot do it in this Bill, he might, by way of regulation be able to do something to ease the burden on these unfortunate people.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appreciates that, on the Fifth Stage, only what is contained in the Bill may be discussed.</P>

    <Col N="736" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. The Minister went a certain distance with me by telling me that regulations would be introduced.  I am trying to suggest what might be incorporated in those regulations.  The Bill enables regulations to be made and in that way I am only suggesting to the Minister what might possibly be done.</P>
      <P>We had considerable discussion on Committee Stage on Section 3, subsection (1) (c), which deals with the obligation to carry a member of the Garda Síochána or a member of the local authority.  What the Minister said on Committee Stage certainly worried the House, that the owner of a vehicle such as this might be compelled by this Bill, when this becomes as Act, to do something which would take him outside the scope of his insurance.  We cannot compel insurance companies to give other than the cover required by the Road Traffic Act, 1993.  We cannot go beyond that, but where the cover is limited, say, to the ownerdriver, or a named driver without passengers, if in the enforcement of this Bill, the owner or the driver is compelled to carry a member of the local authority or of the Garda and thereby breaks the law as laid down by the Road Traffic Act, 1933, there is something very dangerous in the situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister did say that he or his colleague would introduce legislation later to cover the State servants compelled to travel on such vehicles.  I have no doubt that the Minister will introduce that, but there is an interim period between the time this Bill will become an Act and the time the new legislation which he proposes will become law.  That is really what is worrying me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us go back&mdash;I do not propose to quote as this is not Committee Stage&mdash; to Section 3, subsection (1) which refers to a member of the Garda &ldquo;suspecting.&rdquo; The Minister pointed out that the operative word there would be &ldquo;suspects&rdquo; a breach of the Act, in which case the Garda would be entitled to do certain things.  The Minister says that all Gardaí are rational men. Of that I have no doubt but we have the exception and possibly nobody knows them better than a member of <Col N="737" /> my profession.  Unfortunately, we have got exceptions in the Garda who will always, when the question is put to them in cross-examination, say: &ldquo;I suspect a breach of the law&rdquo; knowing very well that they have no powers of intervention other than when they suspect, but to keep themselves within that ambit, they always suspect.  In other words, they have a suspicious mind.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, if at all possible, to suspend the operation of this section, pending the introduction of such legislation as he might consider it necessary to introduce to cover State servants.  It was actually when dealing with this section that the Minister said there should be no stupid interpretation of the law.  However, somebody has said that the law is an ass.  Following that to its logical conclusion, the interpretation of the law might sometimes be stupid.</P>
    <P>We must try to legislate for the exception as well as for the general rule. If we could manage to do that under this Bill, then I think we would be going a considerable distance.  The Minister, when speaking on Second Reading, said the purpose of the Bill was not to collect additional taxation but merely to catch those people whom he described as interlopers, the gentlemen who strip their vehicles and try to escape their legal obligations, but I am inclined to think that one of the aims of the Bill is to try to augment the Road Fund by this extra £100,000.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that the suggestions made by the various speakers have been met by the Minister as reasonably as possible.  I have no doubt that anything outstanding may possibly be met by him in the regulations which he and his Department will later draft.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is really a pity that Deputy O'Donnell should have been unavoidably absent from the Committee Stage of this Bill because many of the points which he raised this evening were raised by other Deputies on that Stage.  He has mentioned a few of the items already discussed at some <Col N="738" /> length but possibly he has put a new complexion on them and for that reason I might say a few words in reply.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the question of carrier vans that would not be bolted to the body of a truck which might be weighed without any fixtures whatever.  The carrier might just rest on the flat body of a truck, and he said that would appear to be something which could be left out as far as weighing for taxation purposes was concerned.  Possibly the Deputy put the point more as a question and the answer is that unless they conform to another section of the Bill, which says that if they are taken off or put on a truck at either end of the journey, in whole, and still loaded, they could be exempted.  They are subject to that condition but if the container is tied, bolted, or just sitting on the body of the truck it will undoubtedly come within the terms of the taxation laws as we are now enacting them.</P>
      <P>In so far as the question of the part-year charge and the question of any rebate or refund are concerned, that was dealt with on Committee Stage.  Possibly they are scattered by way of question and answer but generally the information the Deputy seeks is to be found there.  I just want to say again that in so far as the user of a vehicle with a container which is only required for a part of the year is concerned, unquestionably we are going to issue regulations which will cover such cases, and which will allow the owner to get a refund at the end of the period of usage of the machine with the container.  These regulations will be put into effect to enable a rebate to be made to such owners so that the amount of taxation will not fall as heavily on them as was first anticipated.</P>
      <P>The hardship rule raised by the Deputy is really within the province of another Department but nevertheless it is one which was mentioned by, I think, Deputy Norton on the Second and Committee Stages of the Bill.  The number of applicants at that time, which was this day week, and we had to get them by telephone for Deputy Norton was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Only 80 had applied this day week for the additional 7 cwts. which they are entitled to get but for which they are obliged to make application. There were a further 80 applications&mdash;possibly they would be duplicates&mdash;under the hardship clause seeking more than the 7 cwts. which has been given generally in the Bill introduced this year by the Minister for Transport and Power.  Those further 80 had been received under that head and of them, to date, only one has been granted.  All the others had to be referred back for further information and are still under consideration.  That information is a week old and I do not know what change has been made in the positions since, but I think the general pattern indicated was really to assure Deputy Norton on the point raised by him.  The figures would incate at this stage that, to some degree, towards the end of February there is not any real hardship being caused generally to these licensed hauliers, particularly if we have regard to the numbers who have come forward to seek anything granted by the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was mentioned by the Deputy of a light load requiring a large container.  I think I appreciate what he is trying to get at.  Possibly we differ in this but I think he may have taken instances of commodities with which I would certainly not agree. I do not agree that the hauling of unbaled hay is a process wherein a load can be carried better, more efficiently, and in greater quantity by virtue of crates being put on a lorry. In fact I think general experience with unbaled hay is that no crates are used and very often no sides or tail boards but, what is required above all, is somebody who can build the load which may protrude very far over the end and even over the cab of the truck.  The same might be said of dry and semi-dry sea weed, <Col N="740" /> but I dispute the actual cases instanced by Deputy O'Donnell as being good instances of light loads requiring crates, as compared with a load of coal which requires only a small container to carry a heavy weight.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate the point made but I think the Deputy and the House will appreciate that this is the very essence of the taxation code. Certainly I did not institute it and I should have to have to try to smooth out all the little asides that one can see in it.  The Bill is merely continuing the principles already enunciated and carried out over the years in other Bills in regard to taxation.  Though a case can be made in various directions as to how the incidence of taxation may, for the purposes of one particular commodity, appear to bear more heavily on the owner of a vehicle carrying that kind of commodity, nevertheless I think it is fairly true to say that the general code of taxation is long established, well understood, and nothing that we are proposing to do in this Bill radically alters in any way the basic principles which have come to be accepted by the House and by the public generally throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell then got on to a point, with which some play was made on Committee Stage, in regard to paragraph 2 of subsection 1 of Section 3 of the Bill, which obliges the driver or owner of a vehicle to carry a member of the Garda Síochána in his vehicle to a weighbridge where that vehicle's weight has been the subject of challenge or is suspected of being over-weight from the point of view of the taxation code.  I should say, first, that I did not say exactly what Deputy O'Donnell gathered, or seems to have gathered, that I was introducing legislation to cure this matter.  Actually what I said will be found at Column 432, Volume 179 of the Official Report, where it states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;However, we shall have regard to it in impending legislation and we hope to rectify even that little matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> That is not a commitment; it is not even regarded as a necessity or essential to be dealt with in regard to the Bill.  The reason I direct the attention of the House to that paragraph is that it is not clearly established on the evidence that any such amendment is absolutely necessary or essential, whatever about being desirable. Examples of a similar provision will be found in Section 16 and Section 98 of the Road Traffic Act, 1933, and again in the Emergency Powers (No. 386) Order, 1945.  As I pointed out here on the last occasion, since they came into operation, none of these provisions has given rise to any difficulty nor has any doubt ever been expressed in regard to them.</P>
    <P>I have also been advised that compliance with a statutory requirement of the kind in this section does not invalidate an insurance policy or upset the protection afforded by it to a third party.  While I am quite happy about the position in regard to this matter and the question of liability, I would not object to a specific provision being made to confirm the position and put an end to any of the arguments that may arise, although, as I have said, they have never arisen in the past.</P>
    <P>The place for these provisions is in the Road Traffic Bill, which I hope to have before the House during the course of this year.  As I said, over the years nothing has transpired to make it appear that this provision is actually necessary, but if for no other reason than to put an end to the arguments about it, when the Road Traffic Bill comes before the House, I shall give consideration to the inserting of a provision in it clearing up the matter once and for all.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell said he appreciated to some degree what I said about the purpose of the Bill being to catch interlopers.  I do not think I actually used that word, but it is a good word to describe those who have been in the habit of stripping their trucks in order to reduce the weight and then, as soon as the truck has been taxed putting on the standard equipment which should have been weighed.  While <Col N="742" /> that is the plea I make for the Bill, the Deputy was inclined to think that its purpose was to acquire additional aid for the Road Fund to the extent of £100,000.  If that had been the purpose, no such Bill would ever have been introduced by me.  The Bill was introduced because experience has shown that there was a leak from the Road Fund by virtue of these manipulations of the weighings for tax purposes and that that leak was becoming greater and was likely to increase substantially in the future.  Rather than wait until the bottom had gone out of the sack altogether, we in the Department felt it was incumbent on us to recommend to the Government that measures should be taken to stop the leak.  That is the sole reason the Bill is before the House.</P>

      <P>May I ask a question? There is a hardship on lorry owners in Kerry who have to take their lorries to Tralee, sometimes 50 or 60 miles, in order to get them weighed.  Could the lorries not be weighed a little nearer home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a new provision in the Bill which gives power to appoint weighbridges other than the local authority weighbridge which, in the past, was usually the only one used in each county.  As a result of that, we hope to improve the situation and obviate the undoubted hardship on truck owners of having to go 60 or 80 miles to have their trucks weighed, even if it is only once a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be obligatory on the local authority to set them up.  We are giving power to the local authority to appoint weighbridges other than the weighbridges that own ownership.  They may, in fact, appoint any public weighbridge that conforms with the normal weights and measures regulations.  The reason for that is twofold.  There are a number of such weighbridges in different centres in various counties.  The provision of quite a number of additional weighbridges by the councils themselves <Col N="743" /> for this purpose only would seem to be rather wasteful and would not, I think, be accepted by the councils.  However, there are quite a number of public weighbridges not in council ownership, and we are giving the councils power in this Bill to appoint such weighbridges for the purposes of the functions hitherto carried out only by the council.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before section 29, in page 10, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) In this section &lsquo;the relevant provision of the Acts&rsquo; means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  subsection (2) of section 2 of the Act of 1923,</P>
      <P>(b)  subsection (2) of section 9, subsection (2) of section 10, subsection (2) of section 11, subsection (2) of section 12, and subsection (2) of section 13 of the Act of 1927, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> (c)  subsection (3) of section 10 of the Act of 1932.</P>
    <P>(2)  The relevant provisions of the Acts, as respects any person who was engaged in pre-truce military service and who is in receipt of a disability pension or a wound pension under the Acts, shall be construed as if, in respect of a disease contracted during service which terminated before the 10th day of December, 1932, or a wound received before the 10th day of December, 1932, the sole condition necessary as to the marriage of that person for the grant of a further pension or a married pension to such person was that such marriage took place on or after the 10th day of December, 1932, and before the 5th day of August, 1953, and accordingly, the appropriate further pension or married pension shall, on application being made to the Minister, be payable under the Acts, from such date (not earlier than the date of the passing of this Act) as the Minister may determine, to such person provided he was, on such date, a married man for the purposes of the Acts.</P>
    <P>(3)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorising the payment of a further pension or a married pension to a person who was granted such pension in respect of a period before the 5th day of August, 1953, and whose wife died and who re-married before that date.</P>
    <P>(4)  Subsection (1) and subsection (2) of section 12 of the Act of 1959 shall not be construed as affecting the operation of <i>subsection</i> (2) of this section.</P>
    <P>(5)  Every application for a pension under the relevant provisions of the Acts as amended by this Act shall be made not later than twelve months after the date of the passing of this Act and shall be in such form and contain such particulars as the Minister may require.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having further considered the representations made with regard to the latest date of marriage for persons with pre-truce service I have sought and received <Col N="745" /> the approval of the Government to introduce amending sections which have the effect of bringing the latest date of marriage up to the 5th August 1953, the date of enactment of the Army Pensions Act, 1953, in which the original concession was introduced. The most convenient way of doing it is to repeat the provisions of Sections 39 and 40 of the Act of 1953, substituting the 5th August 1953 for the 10th December, 1932 as the latest date of marriage.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, I feel sure, agree that this extension is highly reasonable.  It enables persons with pre-truce service to qualify for married pensions, and their dependants for allowances, even though the marriage took place 30 years after the time when the wound was received or the disease contracted. Short of having no latest date of marriage at all, which, as I mentioned last week, would cover even death-bed marriages, I do not think that I could reasonably be expected to go any further than I am doing.</P>
    <P>I am providing specifically that certain provision of the Act of 1959 which embodied the general conditions that marriage should have taken place before the date of wound or the date of discharge will not apply to these particular cases.  I am also providing that where a person already had a marriage pension in respect of one marriage and his wife died, he shall not be entitled to a marriage pension in respect of a subsequent marriage.  A person will be able to qualify in respect of a second marriage contracted before the 5th August, 1953, provided that he had not a marriage pension in respect of his previous marriage.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too happy that we are covering the cases I have in mind but I want to thank the Minister and to tell him that we appreciate that he has gone a very big step forward towards improving the conditions in the cases of a very large number of people.  I have some cases in mind, however, and I am not happy that this amendment covers them. There was a case in Galway recently in which a man with a wound pension died and I cannot understand why his <Col N="746" /> widow does not, as far as I can ascertain, qualify.  I am not sure that this amendment would cover that case.  I think the Minister will agree that it is the type of case that the amendment should cover.  The man was married within the time but because he did not claim or did not declare his wife, the question now is whether she is in or out.  I am not happy about the matter.</P>
      <P>I wrote some time age, a week or so ago, to the Secretary of the Department asking for certain information on the matter and I have not yet received a reply.  I have two or three other cases in mind and I do not think that the amendment covers them.  I got the amendment only this morning. It may have been circulated in a White Paper but, if it was, I did not see it and I have not been able to give it the examination that I feel I should have given it.  I do not think that the Minister is in a position to say whether the type of case I have in mind is covered or not.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister and the Government would be anxious to cover cases like these but if we enact this Bill today and they are not covered in it they may be out for all time.  I am anxious to give the Minister all stages of the Bill today but, at the same time, it may be done so hurriedly that we may do something that will not have the effect we intend it to have.  I wonder if the Minister could give any further information on the matter.</P>

      <P>I do not know the particulars of the case which Deputy MacEoin has in mind but as far as we know the 1953 Act worked perfectly and there were no complaints about it except with regard to the latest date of marriage.  That being so, we consider that the best way in which to do what we want to do is to repeat the two relevant sections of the 1953 Act altering the date from the 10th December, 1932, to the 5th August, 1953.  It seems to us that if the Act worked perfectly in respect of these marriages that this amendment should work perfectly also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know the cases Deputy MacEoin has in mind but if we find that if they are not covered in this <Col N="747" /> amendment, we shall have to reconsider the matter.  As far as I know, this Bill covers all cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following new subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) The Minister may nominate a judge of the Circuit Court or a practising barrister of at least ten years' standing to examine the records of the investigation by the Referce of an application to which this section applies and, upon such examination, the judge or barrister, if satisfied that the Referee made an error in setting out his findings in his report on the application, may, <Col N="752" /> with the concurrence of two of the members of the Advisory Committee who assisted the Referee in the investigation, correct the error and the report as so corrected shall be regarded as the report of the Referee on the application.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am accepting, in principle, the amendment which Deputy MacEoin suggests. I thought I had explained to the satisfaction of any reasonable person that, far from interfering with the Referee's decision, I was actually taking steps to implement the findings of the Referee, and this section, as originally drafted, was merely intended to do that.</P>
    <P>These mistakes were discovered and reported to me by the officers of my Department in the normal course of their duties.  It is true that I could have washed my hands at that stage and said the Referee reported in a negative manner in those two cases and there was nothing more to be said.  I thought that would not be fair to the people concerned, and that I should do something to rectify what were obviously clerical errors.  I originally considered doing what Deputy MacEoin suggests, but I decided it was an unnecessarily cumbersome way to rectify clerical errors.  I decided the way proposed in this Bill in the first instance was the best way to deal with the matter. However, if it will make Deputy MacEoin any happier, I am now prepared to do it in the way he suggests.</P>
    <P>The subsection which I propose, differs from the amendment proposed by Deputy MacEoin, in the following respects.  Instead of the words &ldquo;barrister-at-law of at least five years' standing&rdquo; used in Deputy MacEoin's amendment, I am using the expression &ldquo;practising barrister of at least 10 years' standing&rdquo;.  Those are the words used in Section 5 of the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, and are, therefore, more appropriate.  That was the Act which originally set up the Referee.  In any case the qualifications for a man in order to become a Circuit Court judge are that he is a &ldquo;practasing barrister of at least 10 years' standing.&rdquo;  It would not be <Col N="753" /> proper for us to start to equate a Circuit Court judge and a barrister of five years' standing.</P>
    <P>I am using the expression &ldquo;nominate&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;appoint&rdquo; and there is a re-phrasing of the original subsection as a result of the proposed change, but I think the effect of the amendment is what Deputy MacEoin wants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <P>I wish to thank the Minister for accepting my point of view and, being a reasonable type of person&mdash;notwithstanding the suggestion in the Minister's remarks that I am not&mdash;my reasonableness in this matter is intended to save the Minister and his successors from embarrassment. If I were unreasonable, the best thing I could do would be to leave the measure as it stands, and then we would have the Minister where many people would like to have him.  In my sweet reasonableness I am trying to assist the Minister rather than anything else.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave us to understand that the Referee came to a decision but that owing to illness or other reason&mdash;it was a rather mixed situation&mdash;his decision was not properly recorded, by reason of a clerical error, but one is bound to ask oneself how this could happen.  How could this error occur?  Why was the Minister nominating or appointing himself as referee for these two cases?</P>
      <P>By doing so the Minister was creating trouble for himself and for his successors, so long as the Military Service Pensions Act is in operation. If I were unreasonable, I would suggest that not only should he examine these two cases, but every other case where he was satisfied there was an error of judgment in not granting a pension when it should have been granted.  As a matter of fact, the Minister should ask the Government to reconsider the whole question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree the Minister's amendment is better than mine and will achieve the end I had in view.  The only difference is the question of five years' or ten years' standing.  I did not have any particular point of view in setting out five years.  I only intended <Col N="754" /> to make it easier for the Minister.  I shall not move my amendment in view of the Minister's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> As this Bill has been introduced and debated through the various stages in the Seanad before being brought to the Dáil, many Deputies will already have had the opportunity of studying what was said on the general principles of the Bill and its chief provisions.  Its principal purpose is, of course, to provide the necessary legal framework for the establishment and operation of a statutory body which will be responsible for national broadcasting in sound and television.</P>
    <P>It is probably unnecessary for me to go deeply into the history of the existing sound broadcasting service, as many Deputies will no doubt be familiar with the subject.  The existing legislation governing broadcasting, namely, the Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1926, is now some 34 years old.  In Part II of that Act the Oireachtas placed responsibility for the control and operation of broadcasting on the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and since then the broadcasting service has been a branch of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Legally, the Minister is still responsible for its administration and even its day-to-day working in detail.</P>
    <P>Over the years, however, it became clear that a Civil Service form of organisation with the detailed controls which are necessarily inherent in it was not the best form of organisation for a creative medium whose primary function is to provide entertainment, information and enlightenment.  In 1953, a radical reorganisation was carried out whereby Comhairle Radio Éireann was appointed to assist the Minister in running the broadcasting service.  In practice, its operation has since been left to the Comhairle.  However, from a strictly legal point of view the position has not been satisfactory and the time is overdue to put the independence which has been accorded to Radio Éireann on a proper legal footing.</P>
    <P>The necessary steps to make Radio Éireann a statutory corporation would indeed have been taken long ago but that the question as to what form a television service should take and the relationship between such a service <Col N="757" /> and sound broadcasting had to be carefully considered.  If the answers to these questions are obvious now, they were not so a few years ago.  It was, I believe, generally recognised that a public corporation operating both sound and television would provide the ideal kind of set-up but the costs envisaged in establishing and operating a nationwide television system of the kind we had then in mind&mdash;that is, one operated on the basis of producing most of the programmes here and depending upon licence fees, as Radio Éireann does now, for the bulk of its revenue&mdash;were prohibitive.  It must, moreover, be remembered that when the present Government considered the matter in 1957 there was an acute temporary shortage of capital and, although the desirability of having a television system of our own was clear, the necessary capital could not be made available except at the expense of other&mdash;more essential&mdash;services.  It was in these circumstances that the Government decided to consider proposals from private interests to establish a service based on advertising and subsequently set up the Television Commission.  The Commission's terms of reference were to consider the matter on the basis that effective control must be exercisable by a public authority and that there must be no charge on the Exchequer, either on capital or on current account.</P>
    <P>The Commission gave very patient and detailed attention to the whole problem over a period of a year and submitted a Report in May, 1959.  I should like here to pay a fresh tribute to the manner in which it tackled its task, and produced its Report in so short a time.  The Commission was not prepared to recommend any of the proposals put before it for the provision of commercial television.  Indeed, the Report stated that if the necessary capital were available there was little or no doubt that television should, if possible, be provided on the basis of a public service.  The Government accepted this view in principle and the decision appears to have been generally approved by the public.  I have no doubt that it will be accepted in this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" /> Having decided against a privately operated commercial service, the Government had to consider the alternatives of no television for a further period, or the early establishment of some sort of public service organisation which is the form that has been adopted generally throughout Europe. After careful consideration the Government decided that it would be appropriate to go ahead now for a number of reasons.  The setting up of the Television Commission in itself led our people to expect that they would get a service.  The confidence of commercial groups that they could operate television here at a profit provided good reason to believe that with the aid of licence fees and permission to engage in advertising to some extent, a public service could be operated after an initial period without loss.  It was estimated that about 40,000 homes within the State were already receiving the programmes of two outside television organisations and it was considered desirable that, if possible, an Irish service should be made available to them.  The general financial position had also eased somewhat.  Finally, every country in Europe either has television now or is preparing to embark upon it.  While probably no time could be considered as more suitable or more acceptable than another for embarking on heavy capital expenditure on a matter not directly concerned with the provision of bread and butter, the Government came to the conclusion that we would have to flow with the stream and that our people should no longer be deprived of this amenity which is being accepted as a necessity everywhere else.  The Government also decided that the two public broadcasting services&mdash;sound and television&mdash;should be under the control of one statutory Authority on the grounds that the two services must be complementary. To have separate control and operation would dissipate resources which are none too plentiful while there would be no compensating advantage whatever in separate operation.</P>
    <P>The present Bill is intended to implement that decision.  It proposes to set up a statutory body of the kind <Col N="759" /> which has proved so satisfactory in other fields where it has been considered necessary or desirable to have commercial or semi-commercial operations undertaken as a public enterprise. I have no doubt that this kind of organisation will be equally satisfactory for conducting the business of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>A secondary but important purpose of the Bill is to extend my powers for controlling electrical interference with wireless reception.</P>
    <P>In considering the structure of the organisation that should be laid down in the Bill, the Government took the view that the Authority which it is proposed to set up should be quite free to exercise its functions of providing a national service, with power of intervention by the Minister or by the Government confined to a small number of matters in which State interests must be safeguarded.  The Authority will, therefore, have the maximum freedom in the matter of programmes.  It is not proposed that there should be provision for any formal censorship of programmes.  The Authority will be a responsible public body, and, with broadcasting in its hands, we can feel confident that the proper moral standards will be respected in its programmes.  In practice, it will maintain a fairly close liaison with the official Film Censor in regard to filmed material and the necessary arrangements will be made towards that end.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to lay down any specific requirements as regards programme standards, apart from requiring the Authority to ensure that the general tone of programmes will be in conformity with the national aims of restoring the Irish language and preserving and strengthening the national culture.  It will be left to the Authority to see that programmes are of an adequate quality, and that a proper balance between them is maintained.</P>
    <P>The Minister's name inevitably appears in many parts of the Bill because he is transferring most of his functions as regards sound broadcasting to the new Authority.  Many of the provisions <Col N="760" /> are in accordance with what is accepted as routine or straightforward in legislation setting up semi-State corporations here.  Others are substanially as included in television legislation elsewhere.  The Authority's powers to operate broadcasting stations, for example, must be governed by a licence from the Minister because the Minister has to ensure that technical regulations in regard to the use of frequencies and such matters are observed. Copies of the licence will be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas when it has been issued.</P>
    <P>Impartiality in regard to matters of public controversy is provided for in Section 18 and I do not think that there will be any opposition to the provision.</P>
    <P>We are providing for advertising in Section 20.  The acceptance of advertisements is necessary if the service is to have a chance of paying for itself. ultimately.  It is provided that the extent of advertising time and the extent of the whole broadcasting day will be subject to the approval of the Minister.  The Minister has a responsibility to the licence holders who will be paying the fee to him to ensure that they will get value for their money and that the programmes will not be unduly overloaded with advertisements. Advisory Committees or advisers to be appointed by the Minister are provided for in Section 21. I think these are reasonable provisions.</P>
    <P>The finances of the Authority are, of course, all important and these are provided for in Sections 22, 23 and 24.  Section 24 provides that the Authority shall so conduct its affairs as to become self-supporting at the earliest possible date.  During the first 5 years the Authority will receive, apart from its revenue from advertising and the net proceeds of broadcasting licence revenue, non-repayable grants not exceeding a total of £500,000.  These grants are intended to meet the losses which will be incurred on the sound broadcasting service when, for the first time, it will have to pay the cost of collecting licence fees and the costs of other services hitherto provided free by Government Departments, amounting <Col N="761" /> altogether to about £130,000 a year. The Authority will also incur new expenditure on pension contributions and on other items at present provided free.  For capital purposes including, of course, working capital, provision is made for advances up to £2m.  The bulk of that sum is to meet the cost of the provision of the television transmitters and studios but some provision is included to execute improvements of a capital nature in the sound broadcasting service.  To enable the sound broadcasting service to become independent financially, some increase will, I am afriad, be inevitable in the sound licence fee.  This fee is at present among the lowest in Europe.</P>
    <P>Power is being taken in Section 30 for the compulsory acquisition of land but only for sites for transmitters and repeater stations and necessary approach roads.  A particular site on a mountain top may be the only suitable one for a transmitter and the erection of the transmitter there should not be prevented by failure to secure a site in negotiation.  I hope that it will be possible to acquire but the sites needed by negotiation but the compulsory power is needed if negotiation fails in any case.</P>
    <P>Section 31 will enable me to direct the Authority to refrain from broadcasting any particular matter or class of matter.  I should make it clear that this Section is not intended to provide the Minister with a general power of censorship as the whole approach has been to place the minimum of restrictions on the Authority in the matter of programmes.  However, the service to be provided will be a national one, and, in the final analysis, there must be reserved to the Government some means of ultimate control over broadcasts which might be inimical to the national interest.  The power is necessary for use in most exceptional cases and I am sure that no Minister would try to abuse it.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the important matter of controlling interference with the reception of programmes. In provisions included in the Third Schedule, the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, is being amended to give me power to control such interference <Col N="762" /> caused by electrical equipment of all kinds and to ensure the fitting of suppressors on apparatus offered for sale or for hire.  Under regulations to be made, users of offending apparatus will get reasonable time to suppress interference.  It is hoped, however, that in the long run the measures proposed to prevent interference at the source&mdash; that is, before electrical equipment reaches the users&mdash;will have the most fruitful and permanent results.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should touch on the question whether the line standard to be used for television transmission here should be 405 or 625.  This is mainly a technical matter and a complex one at that.  The only decision taken so far is that transmission from the Dublin station will commence on the 405-line standard.  This is necessary for the reason, among others, that the large number of owners of 405-line sets must be catered for even if a different standard were eventually to be adopted generally.  The position is being kept under continuous review and further decisions will be taken in the light of the best technical advice and the practical considerations obtaining at the time.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I am satisfied that it will enable the Broadcasting Authority to carry out effectively the functions assigned to it to establish and maintain a national television and sound broadcasting service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first speech to be made by the Minister in the Dáil since his appointment as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  This is an innovation that a Bill of this kind, a very important Bill, should be introduced in the Seanad by the Government. I understand that the Minister in dealing with the amendments proposed to the Bill acted very reasonably <Col N="763" /> and courteously.  I am perfectly sure he will be reasonable and courteous here also.</P>
      <P>We have not any details in the Bill but as the Minister said it is simply to provide the necessary legal freedom for the establishment and operation of a statutory body to be known as the Broadcasting Authority.  The whole success of the television scheme to be set up in this country will depend on the personnel of that Authority. The personnel will consist of not less than seven and not more than nine. They will be appointed by the Minister. We have not been told in the Bill or in the Minister's statement the qualifications that will be required but I take it that the Minister in his wisdom will select members who will have all the technical knowledge necessary to make this project a success.</P>
      <P>It is always feared that a Minister or a Party Government will be inclined to appoint members to any such body because of their political affiliations. If such a thing is done in this case it will be very serious for the future.  I am confident, at the same time, that the present Minister and I hope the Government&mdash;I suppose the Minister must have the sanction of the Government&mdash;will appoint the members of this Authority without any regard to their political affiliations.  I trust that at least the Authority will not be overweighted with those who may have certain political affiliations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the whole, the terms of the Bill are rather vague.  We have not any details but just the conditions under which the Authority will be appointed and also the officials who will be appointed under the authority.  We shall have a Director who will be appointed by the Minister.  I think he would be the principal officer.  Great care must be exercised in selecting the person for that position.  If the Minister appoints the members of the Authority, and has full confidence that they will carry out all the duties assigned to them, I think it will be the duty of the Authority to select a Director-General, at least with the consent or the sanction of the Minister.  I presume and I hope <Col N="764" /> that when that official comes to be appointed, the Authority will be consulted by the Minister before a final decision is given.</P>
    <P>The auditor and the Advisory Committee will be appointed by the Minister. It is a pity the Minister has so many acts to perform in connection with appointments to the Authority and all the officials who will be associated with that Authority.  Let us hope the right people will be appointed.  If we eventually have a television service for the whole country, let us hope the men who will be appointed will carry out their duties to the satisfaction of all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>Section 31 gives the Minister what I consider to be too much authority. Subsection (1) of Section 31 provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Minister may direct the Authority in writing to refrain from broadcasting any particular class, and or matter of any particular class, and the Authority shall comply with the direction.</P>
    <P>Surely that is rather arbitrary?  Then subsections (2) and (3) of the same section provide:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(2)  The Minister may direct the Authority in writing to allocate broadcasting time for any announcements by or on behalf of any Minister of State in connection with the functions of that Minister of State, and the Authority shall comply with the direction.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Authority may, subject to the consent of the Minister, announce that a direction has been given under this section.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in relation to the British television service whereby, if the Government give a direction to the Television Authority there, they will not have to announce that the direction was given by the responsible Minister.</P>
    <P>With regard to subsection (2) of Section 31, a Minister of State may issue some announcement, or perhaps it would have something to do with making a charge on certain bodies, political bodies or otherwise.  He <Col N="765" /> would get authority from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and yet the body concerned would have no right to reply.  A section such as that gives too much power to the Minister and too little power to the Authority.  It might create a controversy that would not make for the success of the Television Service.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose the present Minister would wish to do anything that would create any such dissension. However, human nature being what it is, certain things may happen that would not be to the satisfaction of the viewers especially when they have no right of reply.  In other words, the Minister has too much control. In fact, reading over the Bill, the Minister comes into every section.</P>
    <P>It is only right that the television service will be under Government control. The Television Commission was set up under terms of reference to consider an Irish television service on the basis that no charge shall fall on the Exchequer either on capital or on current account.  At the same time, they were told that effective control of televised programmes must be exercisable by an Irish public authority.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Report of the Commission which was issued was only a partial report.  A certain portion of it&mdash;I am sure a very large and important portion&mdash;has been kept confidential.  That portion of the Report was not issued to Deputies, to Senators or to the public.  I wonder if at some stage the Minister would give a reason for keeping it confidential or say if Deputies, Senators and the public at any time in the future will be made aware of the contents of that section of the Report?</P>
    <P>There should be no charge on the Exchequer, either on capital or current account.  Evidently the Government and the Minister did not accept the Report and in fact I believe at all the whole Bill has no bearing at all on the findings of the Commission. We have been told that about £2,000,000 will be expended on the establishment of the service.  I believe £1,500,000, perhaps, will be spent in connection with television and the <Col N="766" /> other £500,000 in connection with the improvement of the broadcasting service, Radio Eireann.</P>
    <P>In appointing the Authority, and in order to give public confidence, would it not be advisable if the Minister consulted the Leaders of the Opposition Parties?  He may not agree entirely with the suggestions they may make but it would be very desirable that such an important body as the Authority should have the confidence of the House and, therefore, of the public and the country as a whole. I think that such a suggestion was made somewhere in the Report of the Commission.  I am not sure, but I saw such a suggestion somewhere.</P>
    <P>This television service will be a very expensive luxury.  Possibly one of the reasons why the Television Commission was set up, when it was found essential to set up, when it was found knowing it would be expensive&mdash;was to have an excuse to postpone its establishment. I would not blame the Government for that so much.  The Minister has given the financial position in 1957 as a reason why it was not established then.</P>
    <P>We can imagine, when the television service is working, the numbers of people who will purchase television sets, on the hire-purchase system, of course.  These sets are expensive and the licence will be high&mdash;I presume £4 or £5.  After all we cannot afford many luxuries in this country, at least at the present.  Furthermore, you will have those television sets in perhaps 80 per cent. of the homes of Ireland. If the programmes are of the right kind, educationally and culturally, certainly they will be an advantage to the members of the household.  That is why it is a good thing that the service should be under the control of the State.  The Minister has stated that it is proposed to ensure that the moral standards will be maintained.</P>
    <P>A fact that should not be forgotten is that people are too much inclined to sit around a television set and it interferes with the carrying out of home exercises by children.  Adults, too, will spend a quiet time looking at television programmes and it will make a big change in family life.  In <Col N="767" /> olden times and in the recent past, especially in country places, we had the custom that people visited their neighbours.  There were concerts, storytelling and so on and that was the really human form of entertainment. There will now be a change. I do not know whether it is for the better but I suppose we must move according to the times.  Of course, programmes can be educational and suitable also for the advancement of the study of Irish because, naturally, you will have a certain number of programmes in Irish.  I hope, however, that amongst the members of the Authority there will be no fanatic who thinks that all programmes should be in Irish.  In fact, there should be no kind of fanatic amongst the personnel of that Authority.</P>
    <P>There seemed to be a great urgency about setting up a transmitter station in the Kippure Mountains in County Wicklow and we have seen photographs of the work carried out there. The people of Dublin and the neighbouring counties will have the benefit of the new service a long time before it will be available in other parts of the country.  I can imagine the long wait which we will have down in South Kerry.  I would go so far as to suggest that the service should not be set in motion until all the necessary transmitter stations have been erected. Mind you, several such stations will have to be erected in the approaches to South Kerry and West Cork because, I understand, mountains will interfere with the transmission service.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any reason why I should delay the House further because we can deal with all details on the Committee Stage.  We shall have amendments in connection with various matters.  Let us hope that eventually, as a result of our deliberations and by the action of the Minister and the Government, we shall set up a television service which, even though it will cost money, will be the best available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to join in congratulating the members of the Seanad for, as Deputy <Col N="768" /> Palmer has already pointed out, their a work in connection with this Bill.  In spite of the views of many people in the country, the experiment has proved that when put to work, so to speak, the members of the Seanad can give a good account of themselves.  Whether or not we agree or disagree with the views put forward in the Second Chamber, we must admit that they expressed themselves very clearly on the subject of television.  It is not our function to discuss or draw attention to some of the views expressed in the Seanad.  I suppose it is best to leave whatever comments we might make on them unsaid.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I should like to make a few comments in favour of Radio Éireann.  It had its faults but who or what is without fault in this life? Considering the many disadvantages under which Radio Éireann had to operate, it is fair to say that a good job of work was done.</P>
      <P>We in the Labour Party believe that each member should be entitled to express his views on televisions in so far as it affects the area he tries to represent. Coming from a rural area, I may take a different view on some of the points from that of my colleagues. I should like to draw particular attention to one part of the Minister's statement on page 4 where he states:</P>
      <P>... the Government came to the conclusion that we would have to flow with the stream and that our people should no longer be deprived of this amenity which is being accepted as a necessity everywhere else.</P>
      <P>There I must personally disagree with the Minister.  We must flow with the stream.  In other words, we must live up to the Joneses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his statement, the Minister said there are between 30,000 and 40,000 households, above a line between Dublin and Sligo, which enjoy what the Minister considers &ldquo;flowing with the stream&rdquo;, the benefits of television. If there were not 30,000 or 40,000 enjoying television from outside stations, I wonder would the Government worry about television at the present time?  In relation to this Bill, we <Col N="769" /> cannot forget the division of the country&mdash;a division caused by the fact that so many thousands have television already.  Because they have, we must give them an all-Irish programme of their own rather than leave them in the position of having to line up with the programmes from the north-east of Ireland or across the seas.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the programme to be provided from Kippure is for the benefit of the 30,000 or 40,000 people.  It is for their benefit that we are holding on to the 405 line standard&mdash;the same line as is being operated by the British television authority and by the authority in the 26 Counties.  What are we doing? We are offering to these thousands of people in part of the 26 Counties an additional service, but, of course, they could, as many people are doing at the present time, switch, if they wish, to Radio Éireann for the news and possibly to the B.B.C. or Luxembourg. On the very same line of approach we are adopting here, the 30,000 or 40,000 can switch over to Kippure if it suits them and then go back to their favourite whether it is the service in the Six Counties or across the water.</P>
    <P>I should like to address a few queries to the Minister in relation to this whole matter.  If television is to be successful, we cannot have a halfhearted statement about sponsored programmes.  We shall have to go into the question of sponsored programmes thoroughly, if we hope to make them pay.  Where do we stand at the present time in regard to sponsored programmes?  It is absolutely ridiculous to suggest that we are getting Irish-Ireland programmes from the sponsored programmes.  Do we believe that a manufacturer from Britain or anywhere else who buys time on an Irish television programme, does so for the benefit of the Irish language or Irish culture?  Are we trying to deceive ourselves into believing that we shall benefit from a foreign manufacturer getting into television in Ireland, getting the announcer to speak in Irish and getting everything on the screen in Irish on a programme which is in itself only a replica of the programme from the <Col N="770" /> British stations for which he buys time?</P>
    <P>That is where I cannot possibly agree either with the people outside this Chamber or with the Minister when we are told there will be a wonderful national outlook on the programmes.  There may be.  It would be the wish and desire of any Government in the Twenty-Six Counties to do all they could to foster Irish idealism from the point of view of the language or anything else in connection with television, but we cannot forget the fact that it is the buyer of time on these sponsored programmes&mdash;he is very often a foreign manufacturer&mdash;who will decide and dictate the type of programme on Irish T.V.  That is one of the aspects which some people are inclined to ignore when they speak in favour of television here.</P>
    <P>We must realise also that if we wish to provide a fair type of programme ourselves, we shall have to import material from other countries.  We shall have to import films in order to supplement what we may have locally but what kind of stuff shall we get?  Will it be first-class?  If it is, we shall have to compete for it against the television authorities in Britain who can afford to spend millions of pounds buying programmes.</P>
    <P>I remember how delighted we as youths were in rural Ireland whenever a travelling showman came to visit our area with 20-year old films of Charlie Chaplin.  At that time we had no hope of going to a city to see modern pictures and we thought the travelling show was wonderful.  Is that the type of stuff we shall have on the new television service?  Will we be satisfied with old stuff?  Whether we are or not it is the only hope we have of carrying on the service in order to make a financial success of it, but, if we do that, the 30,000 or 40,000 people who already have television sets will not look at such programmes and will turn to the their entertain-County programmes for their entertainment. Between now and Committee Stage, that is a matter which the Minister should clarify.  It is vitally important <Col N="771" /> for those who are in favour of a television service, though I expect it does not matter much to those who are not in favour of it.</P>
    <P>I give credit to the Minister for saying that he will take action to eliminate interference with reception. That is a very common fault at the present time and action to remedy it is long overdue.  Many Ministers in different Governments promised to take such action but they never did anything. Perhaps the problem is a difficult one but I do not suggest that the Minister will not now do what he says he will.  It is all right talking about interference where 30,000 or 40,000 television set owners are concerned but I should like the Minister to do something about radio reception interference along the south and south-west coast.  Have we to wait for television in order that the Government will step in to prevent that interference?  For myself, I fail to see why more attention is not given to Radio Eireann in order to enable its programmes to be received by people in the South.  At the present time such action would be of far greater importance to them than hearing that television will be made available to people living in a different part of the country.</P>
    <P>When we realise that the charge for Radio Éireann is exorbitant to those people who have sets and must tune in to the BBC or Radio Luxembourg, the seriousness of the situation is quite clear and I urge the Minister to see that they get the benefit of that service before making them contribute to the cost of television.  Surely he will make some attempt to deal with that problem by itself?  While much may be offered by way of employment to artists when Kippure goes into operation, as depicted in a humorous Dublin journal some months ago, I think it is more important that these people I speak of should get the benefit of clear reception from Radio Eireann, a service they are paying for all the time. I direct particular attention to that problem because the Minister referred to it in his speech.</P>
    <P>According to many of those who <Col N="772" /> favour it, television will provide a wonderful new life in rural Ireland. Some people in the Seanad and elsewhere had the impression that people in rural areas would prefer to buy a television set instead of a car, but, as a Deputy from a rural area, I know that approach is absolutely nonsensical. Nevertheless, it is well that the voice of rural Ireland should be heard in regard to how it can be affected by television in the future.  We cannot deceive ourselves.  We shall not make the people any more Irish by having an Irish television unit; we shall not interest them more in the Gaelic language by a half hour's, or an hour's programme; and we shall not benefit Irish agriculture when most of the sponsored time will be taken up by organisations from Britain and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Much good work is being done in many rural areas in building up a brighter social life.  Efforts are being made to encourage dramatic groups and concert parties in order to make life in these areas a little more happy and I must ask if it is suggested that these activities are to be supplanted by a television service, the new system will give us something better in an Irish way of life?  On the contrary, I believe it will be wholly detrimental to the idea of social life in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>We know how the system operates at present.  People go into a little dark room, peer at a little screen and spend a full evening following programmes. We also know how that will affect the children.  They have to do their homework and they will be dodging their parents and their lessons in order to watch television.  Will they be solely interested in the children's programmes? The answer is that we all know the attitude of children, that they are waiting to see Wild West films or murder features.  The Minister may tell us these will not be on Irish television but Irish television will use the 405 line standard and parents, if they do not want the children's programmes, if they are not satisfied with the Irish programmes, will switch on the B.B.C. or I.T.V. and their children will follow suit.  Will that be a benefit in rural Ireland, in Dublin, where <Col N="773" /> unfortunately juvenile delinquency is more prevalent than we would wish, or anywhere else?</P>
    <P>I may be old-fashioned.  I do not know, but I am expressing the views of many people in rural Ireland.  It took Muintir Na Tíre and Macra na Feirme many years to build up their organisations and to bring the various sections of the community together on a common basis, to better social conditions and to provide the amusements so essential in rural areas.  Coming from a rural area, I know that if television is to be successful, it will be a success at the expense of that way of life, though of course it may be said that if the people in these areas have been payings fees for so long without getting a service from Radio Éireann, they ought to be satisfied now.</P>
    <P>It is not for me to go into details of the cost.  Many aspects were discussed in the Seanad, particularly the cost.  I believe the figures given to us by the Minister will prove to be completely insufficient.  I am reminded of another organisation which, we are told, must be self-supporting in a few years.  Reading the Seanad Debates, the word &ldquo;Authority&rdquo; sounded very vague, like a sort of supreme body over everything.  I believe we shall find the Authority will be unable to produce a programme that will pay for itself and the taxpayer in rural Ireland will be called upon to, pay for something he is not asking for.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks about the compulsory acquisition of land for transmitters. This is a case of &ldquo;live horse and get grass&rdquo;.  I am not casting any reflections on the Minister.  My remarks must be viewed in the light of whether or not it is wise that we should have television.  Compulsory powers may sound very attractive, but we are interested only in their use. Apparently compulsory powers were not at the disposal of the Minister in regard to interference or, if they had been, they were never used to deal with interference.  Apparently compulsory powers were not needed for Kippure.  It seems we are giving a service to 30,000 or 40,000 people here, as well as a few thousand more along the south-east coast, and in the years <Col N="774" /> to come, we shall give it to the rest of the community.  I believe that is unsatisfactory.  If we are to go on with a programme, why make it available to a small section at the expense of the majority?  We have not heard from the Minister, either here or in the Seanad, when it may be expected that the so-called benefits of television will be made available to the areas not able to receive Kippure.</P>
    <P>At present television will not help us with the Irish language and sponsored programmes on television will not be in accordance with the pattern of social life in rural Ireland.  Eventually television&mdash;flowing with the stream, as the Minister said&mdash;may bring us to the stage where people can switch on Irish television, get the programme they want and then, as happens at present with radio, switch over to the Six-County or to the British programme.  That will not bring the benefits to this country the Minister would wish.  Taking into account the cost and the so-called benefits that television may offer Ireland and also the disadvantages from the point of view of the people in rural Ireland, we could at present do very well by biding our time and scrutinising more closely the effects and reactions of television in the Six Counties and in Britain before deciding to embark on the provision of a service which may prove detrimental to the children of today, who are the men and women of tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was particularly glad to note from the report of the Commission on Television set up by the Minister that clearly, if they had their way, they would have recommended that a public authority should have been established as the ideal method by which the television service for this country would be supplied.  It was only because of their interpretation of their terms of reference that they came down, in a very qualified way, on the question of allowing a joint authority on which both State and advertising interests would be represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is with this question of the degree of control which the advertising interests have in the Television <Col N="775" /> Authority's activities that I am particularly concerned.  The difficulties of setting up this television service are very great.  There is no doubt about that.  One of the things that cannot be over-emphasised, however, is that while the Television Commission interpreted their terms of reference that the service should not impose any financial burden on the State, in fact, this proposal here does impose the ultimate financial burden on the State, because, as the Commission pointed out, the cost of running this service will be passed on to the consumer and, in fact, will be paid by the people.  It is merely a question of the interpretation of the word &ldquo;State&rdquo;.  One way or another, the consumer will pay for this service.</P>
    <P>They pointed out on page 25 of their First Report, paragraph 47:</P>
    <P>This point that the Irish purchasing public will bear the cost of the advertising programmes is apt to be overlooked, but advertisers on Irish television will pass on their costs to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is particularly desirable.  The cost of a television set is about £70 or £80.  I think the total ultimately hoped for is in the region of 300,000 which means there is a considerable percentage of the public who will pay, by having to use the essential commodities which will be advertised on this television service. They will have to pay additional costs for the articles they use in order to maintain the pool of funds to provide for the advertisements carried on television.</P>
    <P>There will be people who cannot afford a television set and who will be unable to enjoy the television service. They will be the lowest economic and financial group in our community. They will have to pay because, as the Commission say, advertising costs will be passed on to the consumer.  They are the people who are using anything from matches and cigarettes to tea, cocoa, sausages or any kind of food or commodity to be used or consumed which will be advertised on the television service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> That cost will be indirectly borne by people who will not have enough money to buy a television set or to enjoy it.  It seems to me that the consumer and the State will pay for this service, even though the Minister appears to believe that by bringing in the revenue from advertising, he will relieve the State, or the consumer, or the citizen of the cost of this service. That is a complete illusion and the position is not sufficiently understood by the consumer.</P>
    <P>I understand that the total expenditure on advertising in this country in the form of radio, cinema, newspaper and poster advertising is about £7,000,000 annually.  That £7,000,000 is an added tax or additional cost on each article of consumption put forward by the advertiser.  Advertising is one of the absurd taxations which are unavoidably associated with the private enterprise economic system which is costing us so much.  I believe that it should be borne in mind that the advertisers have not got any bottomless purse in which to find the money to pay for the television service and that they will get the money from the consumer in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>I believe that the most equitable way to get money for a public service of this kind is to get it through taxation. Through the activities of the Revenue Commissioners, we can ensure that the burden of taxation will be borne by those most competent to bear it.  This action of the Minister's is merely a device for removing that legitimate taxation from people who can readily bear it and placing it on the shoulders of the consumers and the old age pensioners and the under-privileged groups in our society who can never see television. In that way the Minister will be able to protect the wealthy persons, the taxpayer and the surtax payer, who should be paying more tax than they are paying at the moment.</P>
    <P>The implications of this service are vast and very widespread.  This is probably one of the most important Bills introduced in recent years.  It has three potentials: the educational, the entertainment and the advertising potentials.  One of the by-products of advertising on television must be its <Col N="777" /> serious impact on the cinema industry. Many of the cinemas will have to close down and rural Ireland and the people in rural Ireland will lose one of the few amentities left.  The provincial Press has been hit in Great Britain and it will very likely be affected to a considerable extent in this country.  It will mean that those who can afford to pay £70 or £80 for a television set will do so but they will not pay the 2d. or 3d. per week for their provincial papers.</P>
    <P>The most important question of all is that of the control of the service. The power of television needs no emphasis at all from me.  According to the Commission, which considered the matter, it will become more and more influential as the years go on. When they were considering it, there were only 20,000 sets in the country and now, according to the Minister's statement, there are 40,000 and there will ultimately be 300,000.  The number of viewers using these 300,000 sets will be multiplied enormously so that the supreme control of the programmes going out will be of considerable importance.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that we have that control in this Bill.  As it is at present, with regard to Radio Eireann, we have here in Leinster House some measure of control.  I have heard Deputies asking questions about the operation of Radio Eireann.  They may not have got very satisfactory answers but they give the impression that they have the right to ask questions about the policy of Radio Eireann, discrimination, or the lack of reporting or incorrect reporting.  I want to know whether the Minister intends that we should be given some direct control of this proposed public corporation.  I do not see any such control provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I know well the difficulty of controlling State enterprises, the difficulty of trying to relate day-to-day activities to the procedure of Dáil Questions and the difficulty of controlling the day-to-day management of such a wide enterprise as this will ultimately become.  This is a matter of the most serious importance because of the educational influence of television and the wide opportunities there are for <Col N="778" /> its misuse.  If this company to be established here is allowed to get into the hands of the advertising interests, all our experience tells us that the net result will be seriously deleterious to the best interests of such a service.</P>
    <P>At the present moment there are many critics of Radio Eireann.  I do not listen to it very much but I listen to it more often than I listen to the sponsored programmes from that station.  It is quite clear from listening to Radio Eireann that the quality of programme presented, bad and all as it is, is infinitely better than that presented on the sponsored programmes which is practically 100 per cent. canned music, jazz music or bop music, practically continously, without any attempt at anything creative, or constructive, or informative or educational.  That is something which we have, within our own knowledge, here in Ireland.  One of the sad truths about our society is that one of our favourite stations, outside Radio Éireann, is Radio Luxembourg, which is unparalleled in any society for unadulterated rubbish.  Their sponsored programmes are under the control of advertisers and private enterprise products, the standard being the lowest common denominator.</P>
    <P>The awful danger of depending on advertising interests is recognised again and again in this Report.  Nobody can call the Government, in the present phase of their development, whatever about their past, a socialist Government, or call them in any way advanced or radical in their outlook, but they had to admit they could not entrust this service, even though, apparently, it would not cost them a penny, entirely to advertising bodies. Because of that, they decided to have a mixed type of body, part State and part advertiser.</P>
    <P>My contention is that sufficient control has not yet been written into the Bill in order to make certain that the advertising interests will not, in the end, overrun the interests represented in the Commission set up by the Government, and eventually leave us with a sort of sponsored, or Radio Luxembourg, type of television service in Ireland.  It is all very well to say that one can switch the knob and go <Col N="779" /> over to the B.B.C.  That is true for most of us on the eastern side of the country but I am afraid that with the exception of the odd Sunday afternoon and evening, with the theatre in the evening, and the football matches in the afternoon, most people will turn over to the B.B.C.  That is true of the eastern seaboard.</P>
    <P>It is recognised in the Commission's Report that the B.B.C. picture has fringe reception.  It is defective in many ways and uncertain in some ways.  The new television service, with its five transmitters, can give a first-class picture, and first-class reception, to the whole of Ireland but there is a fair proportion of the country which is not covered by the B.B.C. and never can be.  In fact, if we take the figure of 40,000, and the total potential of 300,000 if we have a service of our own, it would appear that a very considerable number of people will find themselves limited to this service which we are now about to establish. Because of that, we have not got the get-out which they have in Britain: &ldquo;If you do not like I.T.V., switch to the B.B.C.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The I.T.V. have not reached the low level established by the American advertising interests in the disgraceful disclosures during recent months with regard to the racketeering that went on in the American advertising world, particularly in relation to the television service.  If there was an exclusively independent television service in Great Britain with an advertising background, the public would be in great difficulty, because they would not have the opportunity of turning across to the B.B.C. which, in fact, runs a very superior service to the I.T.V., taken all round, and, indeed, a more successful one.  Here, we shall not have that alternative in many cases, so there will be no alternative to the service we shall provide from our five transmitters.</P>
    <P>That could be a good thing in so far as it is possible to provide a service of a very high standard, but the danger I see is that we will be at the mercy of the advertisers, and that the advertisers will do as they have done in other <Col N="780" /> countries where they have absolute control&mdash;reduce the standard to the lowest possible level in order to make the maximum amount of profit&mdash;and the programmes will suffer as a result. The public will have no alternative but to suffer in silence.</P>
    <P>The reason I am so disturbed about that question stems from Section 3 which provides that:</P>
    <P>A member of the Authority who has&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any interest in any company or concern with which the Authority proposes to make any contract, or</P>
    <P>(b)  any interest in any contract which the Authority proposes to make,</P>
    <P>shall disclose to the Authority the fact of the interest and the nature therefore, and shall taken no part in any deliberation or decision of the Authority relating to the contract, and the disclosure shall be recorded in the minutes of the Authority.</P>
    <P>It is obviously completely farcical to suggest that that clause can protect us from undue pressure from any member of the Authority who happens to be coincidentally a member of one or more advertising contractors.  The idea that by standing up and going outside the door when his terms of Contract are disclosed, he would carry no weight with the members of the Authority, is so absurd, on its face, that it is quite remarkable that the Minister should have had the temerity to ask us seriously to entertain it.  It is quite clear that the person with advertising interests will have definite problems and there is at least one person, already closely associated in the minds of the people with this whole concern, who has such interests.</P>
    <P>It is quite wrong for the Minister to appear to defer to the many fears expressed in the Report of the Commission about the dangers in ultimate control by the advertisers of the Television Authority with regard to the type of programme which they will produce.  This section contains no safeguard whatsoever to protect us from finding ourselves running a service for <Col N="781" /> one or two advertising interests who find themselves on the board of this Television Authority.</P>
    <P>We have that position together with the fact that we are not in a position here to control the activities of these people from time to time.  I think we must have some control.  If this section is being retained, we must have control.  If there are abuses&mdash;and there can be functions about which the Minister might not be aware; that is one of the functions of this Assembly that because there are so many of us, it is possible for some of us to know of abuses of which the Minister may be genuinely unaware&mdash;I do not think it is sufficient that the Minister should be mentioned in the Bill as being in control.  I do not think that is sufficient control, unless we get an undertaking from the Minister that he will be amenable to some form of Parliamentary control, preferably, of course, in the form of Parliamentary questions. There is a precedent already established for Radio Éireann.  To the limited extent that it is there, it is a valuable curb on undue use or abuse of the very great powers which this Authority is to be given by this House.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider that section and to alter it so that it will be impossible for anybody associated with advertising contractors, at present or to be, to be at one and the same time members of this governing Authority for the television service. It is only in that way that he can be absolutely certain, or, at least, as nearly certain as is humanly possible, that he can protect the interests of the public on this Authority because, having read the Commission's Report, I am sure the Minister must be impressed by the repeated insistence that the advertising interests could be particularly damaging and particularly dangerous and that we must protect ourselves against them in every possible way.</P>
    <P>It is significant that this Commission, composed of eminently respectable people, no doubt, who certainly could not be considered to be hostile in any was to private enterprise or to advertising interests, keep repeating throughout this grave fear which they <Col N="782" /> have of the danger of the advertising interests taking control and reducing the quality and the standard of the programmes.  Indeed, they end up by recommending that, if possible, it would be preferable that after a time this service should be run by a public board in the ordinary way, if there was the slightest doubt at all about the influence of the advertising interests on the quality of the programmes.</P>
    <P>At paragraph 58, they mention this also, when they say:</P>
    <P>A private organisation, however anxious its individual members may be to provide worthwhile programmes, will, on account of these forces, be primarily interested in reaching the largest possible audience most of the time, and with programmes intended primarily for mass entertainment.  It will therefore be faced with a conflict of interests and motives, namely, whether to try and serve the public interest by treating television as much more than just another medium of mass entertainment, or to endeavour to please its advertisers by attracting maximum audiences and at the same time make greater profits for itself.</P>
    <P>It goes on:</P>
    <P>If the control is not effective, commercial pressure will probably prevail to the detriment of the programme material.</P>
    <P>Anybody with the slightest experience or knowledge of this problem will agree with those findings.  It is impossible to believe that, if accepted, under section (a) here the Minister will protect the community from the advertising interests and will ensure the level of broadcasting service to which we have a right.</P>
    <P>I would put this point to the Minister in regard to the decision to accept the 405 line rather than the 625 Continental line.  At this period, when we are at the beginning of the establishment of a service, with only 40,000 receivers in the country at the moment, would the Minister not consider, in view of the developments which are taking place in television, in view of <Col N="783" /> the possibility and, in fact, the likelihood mentioned in some parts of the Report, that the B.B.C. may decide to go over to the 625 line&mdash;they are in channels 3 and 4&mdash;and the fact that through the 625 line we would be more in contact with Continental viewing, that it would be desirable at this stage to take what would be an unpopular decision?  I am not suggesting that it would not be; it would be. As a television set owner I would hate to have to change to the 625 line.  At the same time, the Minister will very likely be forced to take a decision affecting anything from 100,000 to 300,000 television set owners in the likely development of the 625 line superseding the present 405 line. Would it not be wiser for the Minister to take the decision now, unpopular though it might be, rather than wait until a time when people have acquired these costly sets and when, instead of there being a mere 40,000, there would be 150,000 or 200,000 or more, causing very much greater inconvenience to the public?</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that from the point of view of the manufacturers it is not a bad idea to get people to buy a set which after a year or two will be useless and, taking the public interest into consideration, it is a serious decision which should be pondered by the Minister and with a certain amount of courage.  There is a case for going straight on to the 605 line.  There is a suggestion that the British are going to do that in channels 3 and 4.</P>
    <P>The other interesting thing to me in this retention of the 405 line by the B.B.C. is that I understand the British is the only service to use this line which, of course, gives lower quality reception than any of the higher line types of receivers, and that we are going to have our programmes censored by the B.B.C.  For people who keep talkings as readily as we do about the necessity for establishing our own independent line, about our traditions and all the rest of it, that seems to me to be a rather retrograde decision to take.  However, I am not interested in that side of the question.  I do not <Col N="784" /> accept that introverted, chauvinist narrow-mindedness.  I am interested only in the point that the greater the scope we have for receiving pictures from other Authorities, the better I should like it.  By restricting ourselves to the 405 line, we happen to be restricting ourselves to taking the continental view and we happen to be restricting ourselves to a rather small output of programmes and material.</P>
    <P>Talking about the quality of the Irishness of the programmes there seems to be a tremendous amount of schizophrenia on the part of the Commission in their recommendations because at one place they point out that for the reason that we cannot afford it&mdash;the same old reason&mdash;we cannot afford anything else from health services and an educational service to T.B. eradication&mdash;that we cannot afford to provide our own service, they say the service in the early stages will be necessarily of American or British origin and recorded programmes.  Any of the American programmes I have seen are of an unbelievably low standard.  The type of British programme varies very much and the quality of the B.B.C. is at times remarkably high; I have no experience of the other service but it is envisaged that our service will in the initial stage be composed of 75 per cent. of taped programmes leaving a very small amount of live television broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Various dangers can arise here.  The Commission have pointed out that television is habit-forming, that once people get into the habit of looking at a particular service or programme it is difficult to break them off that habit.  It is very likely that in the initial stages, because of the novelty and the general interest of seeing what success is achieved, a number of people will look at our own service. However, if it is decided to run the service largely on British and American-type taped or recorded programmes, a certain habit of viewing will be formed by the Irish viewer and it will then be difficult to curb that habit.  In these circumstances I do not see how a national outlook, the development of which is recommended in the Commission's Report, can be <Col N="785" /> developed through this Authority&mdash;as the Minister appears to think it can&mdash; after they have established in the Irish people a habit of looking at these British or American canned programmes to a total of 75 per cent. of the whole service.</P>
    <P>It would be much wiser for the Minister to concentrate on putting out a much shorter programme of the type be ultimately wants with the national hallmark on it rather than give the people, as the Minister proposes here, 75 per cent. of canned programmes.  There is a great danger that when the time comes to introduce the slant of a native kind which he wants, the public will not be prepared to take it.  When I say &ldquo;public&rdquo; I mean particularly the advertising interests who will not sponsor any programme which will not sell the maximum amount of the product in which they are interested.</P>
    <P>The protection of the Irish language is mentioned here.  Perhaps the Minister would be able to tell us whether the Chairman or any or all of the members of the Authority, must have a competent knowledge of Irish. I was given to understand that I could not ask a Parliamentary Question because this Bill was before the House.  Therefore, I hope the Minister will be able to tell us whether a competent knowledge of Irish will be demanded from the Chairman or the members of the Authority.  If we follow the precedent set in regard to the other boards and statutory authorities set up, it will be clear none of them will have any knowledge of Irish.  Consequently I doubt if they will be in a sound position to judge the quality of the Irish programmes which will be sent out.</P>
    <P>I understand that in sound broadcasting it is possible for the advertisers who use the Irish language in their advertisements to get better terms and conditions for their advertisements. Occasionally, when waiting for the news, I hear these programmes, but I rarely hear one of them broadcasting in Irish.  Therefore, I doubt if this pious reference here to the need in relation to the language revival movement, to which there is reference in the Commission's Report and about <Col N="786" /> which the Minister expressed some sentiments, will cut any ice with the advertising interests.</P>
    <P>This is completely new ground.  It is a completely new experience in which every country has had to feel its way.  I can appreciate many of the Minister's difficulties but this happens to be a particularly important development. It is possible that many people will not bother to look at the service and that consequently it will not have as big an impact as it could but this legislation is, as is the legislation of most other countries, of an experimental kind.  Because of that I wonder whether the Minister has given consideration to the point made in the Commission's Report that this legislation should lapse at a particular time and that it be submitted for reconsideration by the Oireachtas.  That is a very sensible recommendation and I wonder why the Minister has not included it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In the provisions of this measure the Minister may have devised the best possible system whereby one could run a television service.  Nobody knows that for certain.  Our circumstances are particularly difficult.  We are going in, as we have gone into most things, very much later than anybody else.  We are facing the competition of the established fringe reception from the B.B.C. and U.T.V.  While we have those disadvantages we have the advantage that a considerable number of our people cannot get any service and will therefore be completely new to television. However, on the credit side we have the benefit of the experience of other countries.  We have the shocking reports from the United States of complete control by the advertising interests.  We have the fact that many people believe that the standard and the quality of the similar service provided in Britain, even with the competition of the B.B.C. to keep it up to the mark, are nothing like as high as the B.B.C. standards.</P>
    <P>Because television is experimental, because it is completely untried, because it is a completely new and powerful medium with tremendous possibilities, I suggest to the Minister that he should accept the proposal to allow this legislation to lapse for a <Col N="787" /> time, a fixed number of years, five or seven years, whatever period he thinks desirable, and that the question be resubmitted to the Dáil.  If his provisions here prove themselves to be satisfactory and to be successful then, of course, the Dáil will accept them as they find them.  It will be possible for him and the rest of us to suggest amendments in the light of our experience.  That is a reasonably intelligent suggestion and it is one the Minister should follow.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion that should be written into legislation is that programme advertising time should not take up more than six minutes in the hour or a maximum of ten minutes in the hour.  We should be given some say as to where advertising appears in the programme.  Some of these advertising people are such savages that they would be prepared to put their advertising into the mouth of an Othello or a Hamlet, into the middle of a piano concerto or wherever they think they could sell their stuff.  We ought to protect ourselves against the moronic standards of most of the advertising we know&mdash;the press advertising, the poster advertising and the cinema advertising.   The Minister should lay down&mdash;it is mentioned in the Commission's Report&mdash;the type of intervention the advertising interests will be permitted to make, its length and type of programme they will be permitted to sponsor.</P>
    <P>The Minister is handing over much too much control to this new body, in view of the untried nature of the enterprise.  I should not be as concerned about it if it were completely amenable to this House, if we were permitted to ask questions about it and to criticise it.  I am not interested in the annual Estimate of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, or of whatever Department may be responsible in this case.  This is a problem that must be taken up immediately it arises.  It is not enough to tell us we shall be able to discuss the matter on the annual Estimate.</P>
    <P>The Minister should write into legislation the minimal requirements of the House on the question of the intervention of advertising interests.  Whether it <Col N="788" /> be newspaper advertising, the horrible hoardings which defile the countryside, the dishonesty of their activities in the American stations or the general rubbish that comes from Radio Luxembourg and sponsored programmes, the fact that advertising contractors might possibly be represented on this body is a very serious menace to the undertaking and enterprise.</P>
    <P>Television could be an invaluable asset to the nation, particularly from the point of view of the rural areas which are so isolated and from which people have been fleeing for so long. Tremendous advantages could flow from such a service to the people in rural Ireland.  Some real and positive attempt could be made through this service to help them.  One of the greatest reasons they feel they have to get out is the lack of entertainment. This body, properly operated, could provide an answer to the need for entertainment, instruction and education.</P>
    <P>I welcome the suggestion, and I think it is a good thing that we should now try to establish this service.  I deprecate the fact that I believe that, through Section 8, it will be possible for the advertising interests to inflict their own form of cretinised advertising methods on the unfortunate public and that they will leave us with nothing but the low standard of service they have provided in other countries where they have had the opportunity to do so.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider Section 8 and to make it mandatory on those who have any financial association with an advertising contractor to declare any such interest and thereby disqualify them from sitting on the Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine the Government have been motivated in introducing this Bill by the facts that the Ulster Television service has begun and that they were advised to do so in the Television Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though I have considerable misgivings with regard to this Bill, I really do not think there was any option open to the Government but to do what they did.  I should like to feel that if we are to have a television service it will be on a sound financial footing. <Col N="789" /> Some of the arguments I intend to produce will, I am afraid, show that the financial statement in the majority report of the Television Commission is absolutely and entirely fallacious.</P>
    <P>In doing so, I am not activated by a spirit of destructive criticism.  I am trying to show the House and the Minister and, through him, the Government, that they will face grave financial difficulties as they have estimated the position and as they are putting this Bill to the country.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement, the Minister has not really given us the background of the finances.  One can only go on the Television Report itself which I believe must have greatly influenced the Minister in his decision. In Ulster, they have 100,000 television sets.  The revenue they obtain from that, at about £4 per set, is £400,000 per annum.  The amount they obtain, at the peak period, for advertisements is £80 a minute.  I have a letter here from someone who knows what he is talking about.  The letter must be confidential.  He tells me that Independent Television in Britain can command £1,500 a minute for advertisements but they have an audience of somewhere in the neighbourhood of 10,000,000.</P>
    <P>Ulster can command £80 a minute with an audience of 100,000.  It is reasonable to assume, and I presume the Government have taken it into consideration, that ultimately we can have an audience in this part of the country in the neighbourhood of 300,000.  I think that is the figure the Minister more or less suggested.  I do not know what licence fee will be payable here.  For the sake of the public, I hope it will not be as high as it is in the United Kingdom.  However, suppose it is the same.  It will produce a revenue of about £1,200,000 per annum.  According to the figures in the majority report of the Television Commission, it would seem that we would be comfortably situated financially. Furthermore, if we were enabled to command an advertisement fee, even paralled to that of the Ulster Television area, or perhaps a bit more as we have more receiving sets, we would be very comfortably placed.  But <Col N="790" /> we have no reason to be sure that we are going to have 300,000 sets here. At the present moment we have 30,000 sets.  True those 30,000 sets only cover the areas of reception at the moment which is a line approximately north of Dublin and extending over to the west. We would want to give serious consideration to the implications of the expenses concerned with the establishing of a television service.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that we are to have 30 hours a week of programmes. Nobody has yet said how much live programme we are to have; at least if anybody has, I have not noticed it in the debates that took place in the Seanad or in the Minister's statement to the Dáil, but I do know that to produce one hour of live programme, taking the facts and figures which I have received from parallel television services in other countries, it would cost over £1,000,000&mdash;£1,000,000 annually for one hour of live programme per day.  If we are to spend over £1,000,000 on the hour of live programme we would want to have a very high return from advertisements to create a situation balance and would be in substantial balance and would not be running this concern at a loss. If we can only produce one hour of live programme, as I believe will be the atmost of our ability, the other programmes we shall produce will be secondhand programmes&mdash;I think the technical term in television services is &ldquo;canned&rdquo; programmes&mdash;and we shall be producing programmes which will be replicas of earlier programmes.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Dr. Browne was speaking he stressed the point that if this concern or corporation were handed over to private enterprise it would be entirely in the hands of those who would be profit seeking and that for that purpose they would concentrate on running it as cheaply as possible and the programmes would, of necessity, be very bad programmes.  I am not entirely inclined to agree with that because if any corporation runs a television service they must realise that unless they produce a decent service they will not get listeners or viewers. If they do not get the viewers or listeners they will not get the advertisements <Col N="791" /> and the advertisements are really the main source of revenue for television.  I do not think conditions between sound broadcasting and television are at all comparable.  The expenses connected with television, if one inquires into the matter, as I assume the Minister and his advisers have done, are stupendous.  It would be a mistake for Deputies to think that just by setting up an Authority, by establishing a studio and waving a wand, so to speak, you will bring into existence all the facets necessary for building up a decent and reputable television service.</P>
    <P>I read an article the other day from which I discovered that in one of the smaller studios under the control of the B.B.C. the setting up of the lighting alone cost £50,000.  That gives some idea of the magnitude of the expenditure required.  Those unacquainted with the technique and management of television think that to put a person on the screen one has only to take that person&mdash;or it may be more than one person&mdash;pay the requisite fee and that expenses begin and end there.  It is true to say that to put people properly on the screen, even though they are expert televisers themselves, one requires an enormous staff, a highly trained and technical get that staff, train them and pay them.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if these matters have been fully gone into or if he must decided to introduce a Bill to establish an Authority, give them a Director-General and hope for the best?  These are things that need to be fully considered here.  I should like to see our television service a success; the first month or so of the service will be of paramount importance. There is bound to be a great deal of interest in it, particularly in Britain, our closest neighbour, where there are many viewers and where they will be able to receive our service, subject to some remarks I will have to make on the lines in a few moments.  It is likely that in the opening stages they will view our programmes and if the programmes are <Col N="792" /> good and if our programmes, even though they reflect our Irish culture and the Irish way of life, are acceptable, we shall get the viewers.  If we can get the viewers we can get through.  That is a point that I want to stress.  If we do not get the viewers we shall not get through and shall be running this television service at a considerable loss.</P>
    <P>There is another angle that one must view with considerable apprehension. Speaking on any Bill in the Dáil, particularly a Bill like this, which may cost the country a considerable amount of money, we must consider the other angles and the repercussions it will have on us.  At the moment I am dealing purely with the financial aspect.  It is an unquestionable fact that, not only in the United Kingdom, but also in France, Germany, Italy, and in every country in Europe where there is television, and in the United States, cinemas are closing down wholesale.  We have got to face that inevitable fact here. We must face the fact that we get over £1,000,000 a year in revenue from the cinemas and that we may lose that revenue.  That again imposes a financial obligation on the Exchequer and on the Department of Finance which ultimately will have to have a very big say in this Bill.  That is a fact that should not be lost sight of.</P>
    <P>Another point that must be considered as well is that if we are to have 300,000 sets here&mdash;each set costing £80&mdash;those sets will have to be imported.  They are not manufactured here.  I do not think there is any possibility of manufacturing here such highly technical equipment as television sets.  That is going to throw an onus on our balance of payments to an amount somewhere in the neighbourhood of £8,000,000 or £9,000,000.  All these are things that have to be considered in the wider context of this Bill and the financial set-up relating to it as a whole.</P>
    <P>I cannot help feeling that the recommendation of the Television Commission in regard to private enterprise establishing this service, if at all possible, was worth considering.  It may be that the Minister felt we would not <Col N="793" /> have sufficient control to ensure that a private corporation would be true to our way of life, but at the same time, the Television Commission, which was representative of all shades and sections of opinion, appear to have gone into the matter thoroughly.  The confidential report, for quite obvious reasons, was not issued but we have reason to believe that there were companies willing to operate here.  They were willing to take the risk of running a television service without any charge to the Exchequer whatsoever. In the light of the facts I have been trying to give the House, some of which I believe to be incontrovertible, it is likely that we will lose money.  It is likely that there will be a considerable drain on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Minister, the Government and the Minister's advisers in the Department might consider allowing it to be initiated by private enterprise.  We could have a controlling authority as well.  We could have Governmental control to see that matters were not broadcast which were detrimental to Irish interests.  Be that as it may, they have taken their decision.  I felt it only right to give my views here. I believe it will be a somewhat costly experiment.</P>
    <P>The Government were undoubtedly faced with a very difficult situation with regard to the line standard. Several Deputies referred to that matter here.  It was also rather extensively referred to in the debates in the Seanad.  We are starting up as a new service and if we have any hope of making the service pay, we must increase considerably the number of our sets, which I think is in the neighbourhood of 30,000 or 40,000.  It is assumed to be that but there is no definite knowledge there is that number.  We must increase that number to several hundred thousands, if we hope to make television pay.</P>
    <P>We seem to have an opportunity of striking out on a line for ourselves.  It is true to say that if we do not adopt the 405 line standard, the people who already have sets will be unable to get I.T.V. and the B.B.C., which are the only programmes available to us by virtue of their proximity.  The Commission, I am glad to say, paid particular <Col N="794" /> attention to the fact that rural Ireland should be considered.  Briefly people in the southern half of Ireland at the present moment are unable to get the B.B.C. or I.T.V.  Therefore, it is immaterial to them whether the line standard is 405 or 625.  Would it not be worth a chance to adopt the 625 line standard which is used in every country in Europe, with the exception of France, which is, I think, on 819? With improved techniques over the years, it is quite possible that Eurovision, which was founded in 1956, may be viewable here in the fairly near future.  Those new sets which will be bought in the south cannot get the B.B.C. and I.T.V., but if you give them the 625 line, they will be able to get on that line Irish television.  That seems to be to be a sound argument for striking out on our own.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that the 30,000 or 40,000 existing sets will be thrown into the ditch.  I do not know.  I am not a technical expert on T.V. or television sets, but I am reliably informed by those who are supposed to know that the life of a T.V. set is a short one.  It is only a matter of some half a dozen years or so.  In the ordinary course of events, they would be changing to another type of set.  I do not think we would impose any very great hardship by starting on that line.</P>
    <P>The Television Commission must have consulted experts on this matter. It is apparently possible for us to transmit on both lines.  We can transmit on the 405 and the 625 line standard.  By doing that, it would be an encouragement to people to buy sets on the 405 line standard.  If they did that, they would be doing it with their eyes open if they found afterwards that the 405 set was becoming obsolete, in the possible event of Britain going over to the 625 line standard.  Britain has a habit of changing her mind very often and as far as this country is concerned, I would suggest that the Minister should consider broadcasting in connection with both types of set.</P>
    <P>Now for a word on the Authority. It seems to me that the Authority is the key to the whole situation.  It would be as terrible thing if in regard to an important matter such as that and <Col N="795" /> with so much money in the balance, we were to have an Authority appointed by the Government without prior knowledge of this important subject.  Where we are to find nine men in Ireland who have a sound knowledge of television, I do not know. They certainly should be able to find some.  It is of paramount importance for them to make the appointments. Every consideration should be given and every effort should be made to get people who have some knowledge of this very important and difficult subject.</P>
    <P>Much, of course, depends on the Director-General, who will have the biggest say and the biggest responsibility in the administration of this service, but it is ultimately the Authority who will be the overruling power and who will take the decision.</P>
    <P>I think, it was Deputy Dr. Browne who dealt with the question of Ministerial authority.  When the Minister was speaking in the Seanad, he referred to the success of our semi-State institutions.  He referred to Bord na Móna, Aer lingus and the E.S.B. but he conveniently forgot to mention C.I.E. Curiously enough, one can ask a Parliamentary Question about Bord na Móna, the E.S.B. and Aer Lingus and get an answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, sometimes, but you can ask a Question about C.I.E. and you get no answer. You are told it is a matter of day-to-day administration.  I am not in favour of State control.  I think everyone in the House knows that but I feel if we are to spend big sums of public money, as undoubtedly we shall, it will be poor consolation to members of Dáil Éireann, and to the public as a whole, if we come in here and ask a question relative to the affairs of this Authority on some point we believe to be of vital interest and of vital necessity, to be told that it is a matter of day-to-day administration and that the Minister concerned has no authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is mentioned pretty frequently in this Bill.  In fact, he <Col N="796" /> comes into practically every section, and I should like him to make a categorical statement, when replying, as to whether Deputies will be dealing with a semi-State body such as the E.S.B., Board na Móna, or Aer Lingues, or whether the answers they get will be the same as in the case of C.I.E.  If the latter is to be the case, it will be a regrettable state of affairs in relation to a Bill such as this.</P>
    <P>I am not quite happy about Section 12 which deals with appointments.  In television services outside this country, there are Irish people who are experts, people who have served largely in the offices of the B.B.C., who would probably be prepare to come back to their own country and give it the benefit of their experience.  It is quite obvious that the Authority will have to call on the advice of outside experts because we have not those people here at present.  We do command expert personnel in sound broadcasting but we shall require other experts for television.  The point I want to make is that many Irishmen working abroad, commanding good salaries, would probably be prepared to come back and work at home, because, in the final analysis, everybody likes his own country if he can get a living in it. Does this Bill, as it is drafted, give security to these people?  In other words, can someone who is an expert in television come back to employment here and be assured that he will have full safeguards with regard to service and pension rights?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of points of importance, and one of supreme importance, which I feel must be discussed on the Second Reading of this Bill.  The first has to do with the types of association, the type of authority, to run the whole service and there I am completely in favour of what the Bill intends.  I have the feeling that Deputy Dr. Browne has mis-read the Commission's Report; at least he has misunderstood what they wrote.  Undoubtedly they speak of a service based on private enterprise.  I am referring to page 23, paragraph 61, where they set out three possible ways in which it would be possible to establish a television service in this country and they opt for the second of these, <Col N="797" /> private enterprises financed mainly by revenue from advertisements.</P>
      <P>They were led to that conclusion by their terms of reference which were discussed during the debate on the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs last year, and which were accepted as being narrowly restrictive.  They were asked to investigate the establishment of a television service on the basis that on charge should fall on the Exchequer.  The excuse was made that there was no State capital available at the time, which was as lame an excuse as was the authority behind the particular terms of reference. However, they did conclude that it should not be a public service financed from licence fees and advertisements, with no Exchequer expenses, nor a public service financed by licene fees and public funds.  They rule these more or less out and they came down in the end on the one proposal that was possible within their terms of reference.</P>
      <P>They said the third one involved submitting information to the Commission on a confidential basis and, therefore, they left the matter over and decided on private enterprise, financed mainly by revenue from advertisements, but, in that connection, they pointed out there would be a great deal of trouble in resorting to advertisements, Of course, a private enterprise authority would seek to make as much money as it could from advertisements.  They were completely against that and pointed out the undesirable results that might follow from that angle, but, as now indicated in the Bill, advertising will be under the control of the Authority and that will reduce the danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think this will be any great success but I feel that, experimental as it is, it must be tried on the basis of as Authority as suggested in the Bill. However, that does not mean I am in favour of the set-up of the Authority and of the special powers given to the Minister.  It is completely outside the realm of consideration that a service of this type should be handed over to private enterprise and that a private body should be allowed to rale in as much as it could from advertising, but <Col N="798" /> advertising under the control of a public authority, even in this type of legislation, is an entirely different matter.</P>
    <P>I would be all in favour of public control but that does not necessarily mean this type of body.  When I say that, I must not be taken as accepting what the Minister said in the Seanad when winding up the discussion on this matter, that our State-sponsored bodies had, on the whole, been successful. As examples he mentioned three of them: the E.S.B., Bord na Móna and Aer Lingus.  It was unfortunate for him that in the year in which he was speaking, the E.S.B., for the first time, had gone into the red and had indicated through the mouth of its chairman that it was likely to be in the red for a second year.  It was also unfortunate in that year that Aer Lingus, judged entirely by its operating expenses, had gone into the red and, of course, it must be remembered that Aer Lingues is free in respect of certain services provided by the State, that is, the airports and their maintenance. and I doubt very much if Aer Lingus will ever be able to make an attempt to repay the capital put at its disposal in its formative years.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna, of course, hit a record low in the year in which the Minister was speaking.  I think it was a race between themselves and Aer Linte as to which would produce the worse loss in a particular year.  The loss that was estimated for the first year's working of Aer Linte was £900,000 and I gather that that estimate has certainly been fulfilled.  One did not feel any great surprise that Bord na Móna, particularly in the year that was in it, might get into the red but that they should go into the red to the extent of £900,000 and confess that it may take many years before they get on a proper footing was something surprising.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Esmonde said, the Minister sheared away from C.I.E. C.I.E. are supposed to make their concern pay in a couple of years but the progress, or lack of progress, made in the last year, and particularly the increaseing losses incurred since the package deal with regard to goods was established by the C.I.E. authorities, does <Col N="799" /> not bode well for the future of that concern.  That is the matter that causes most anxiety in connection with this legislation.  I know that Minister will reply at the end that such matters will be dealt with by the Authority&mdash;that once the Authority is established they will be responsible for making changes in policy and that they will have to measure their expenditure by whatever revenue they find it possible to secure.</P>
    <P>The Minister is bringing in legislation having in it the suggestion that it is the duty of the Authority:</P>
    <P>so to conduct its affairs as to secure that its revenue becomes at the earliest possible date, and thereafter continues, at least sufficient&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to meet all sums properly chargeable to current account, and</P>
    <P>(b)  to make suitable provision with respect to capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>That could not be written into a piece of legislation if it were seriously meant unless there were at least something approaching a realistic estimate of the costs that will be imposed on the Authority and the revenue they will derive.</P>
    <P>I want to go back to the Commission's Report.  The Commission did say that they thought that, on foot of licensing fees and advertising revenue, the Authority could meet in its third year of operation what they regarded as likely expenditure and which they set out in page 19 of the Report.  They estimate that &ldquo;managerial, technical and other fixed charges&rdquo; will be about £300,000.  They refer to that also in page 16 where they say that expenditure &ldquo;would be of the order of £300,000 a year.&rdquo;  I myself felt, and I think I said it to the Minister on his Estimate, that some of the items are capable of more exact finding than that given here &ldquo;of the order of £300,000 a year.&rdquo;  Let us take it that that is an estimate made by the members of the Commission with information supplied to them.</P>
    <P>Now let me pass to the other side of the account.  They say that the total licence revenue would be £360,000. which would roughly balance&mdash;there <Col N="800" /> would be a little bit in hand&mdash;the managerial, technical and other fixed charges.  That it is based on a £3 licence and on the basis that there might be 120,000 sets in the country at the end of the three-year period.  From that £360,000 they subtract the cost of collection, which they put at about 12 per cent. leaving a figure of £330,000. The figure of £4 for a licence is in the air.  If one takes a £4 licence, takes 120,000 sets and makes the same subtraction for the cost of collection, that £330,000 would rise by about £110,000. Roughly £440,000 would be derived from licences and £300,000 would be paid for managerial, technical and other fixed charges.  But that is only if the number of sets had risen to 120,000 at the end of three years.  On that basis the Authority would start with about £100,000 per annum in hand.</P>
    <P>The other two things that have to be balanced are cost of programmes as against advertising revenue.  The Commission thought that programmes might cost £350,000 and that advertising revenue would bring in about the same, so that there is about a balance achieved.  But surely the Minister must have some estimate given to him by his Department as to how the revenue for advertisements will be secured, what will be the charges per minute, how many advertisers he thinks there will be and what will be the number of viewers?  It is on the number of viewers that the advertising can be made attractive to those who want to advertise.  There are calculations one can make, but again there are many floating items.</P>
    <P>In page 17 of the Report and the next couple of pages, the Commission based their figures on this: that they thought the number of programme hours of the Television Authority would probably be around 30 a week, of which 25 per cent. would be &ldquo;live programmes&rdquo; and the balance would be of &ldquo;filmed or tape-recorded material&rdquo;.  At 30 hours a week&mdash;and one quarter of that would be live&mdash;it would mean that the Irish people, whatever the expenditure will be, will have about an hour a day of live show and three hours a day of what <Col N="801" /> is called &ldquo;filmed and tape-recorded material&rdquo;.  In the 30 hours a week my calculation is that that runs to something short of 1,600 hours in the year.</P>
    <P>One has to find out then what the programmes will cost and how much per minute will bring in the sum required to meet the expenditure on programmes.  Taking the Commission's figures of £350,000, let me start off with this.  How is £350,000 to be raised if we want to have 30 hours per week or four hours per day?  That depends on how much time of the four hours will be devoted to advertising. Suppose one took five minutes per hour or 20 minutes per day of the four hours.  That would mean that this £350,000 could be raised by advertisers who would subscribe £50 for a minute's advertising.</P>
    <P>Fifty pounds is a large sum for a minute's advertising.  It is not like a poster.  The Commission say there is about £3,000,000 spent in the country on advertising through posters, the cinema and other forms.  But the poster would not be so expensive; it would not cost anything like the equivalent of £50 a minute.  Advertising is put on between the showing of pictures in the cinemas.  I do not know what that costs, but there must be some idea.  An estimate could be arrived at from the cinema people as to what is paid for advertising per minute.  Fifty pounds a minute, I suggest, is a big sum.  Of course, my figures can be messed around because if, instead of having five minutes per hour of the television, one has ten minutes per hour, then £25 will meet the situation.</P>
    <P>But that is only on the basis that £350,000 has to be met as the charge for originating the programme.  Again it is easy to make a calculation.  Thirty hours a week, less than 1,600 hours per year, are to bring in £350,000 by programmes costing roughly £220 per hour.  I turn again to the Minority Report in this matter.  I find there a statement which has not been contradicted and to which I drew attention previously.  In paragraph 22, page 64, of the Minority Report, they say:</P>
    <P>A consideration of the costing for Irish programmes...proposed by <Col N="802" /> three applicant groups for the Irish Television concession who are wholly or a partly engaged in British commercial television at this point is revealing.  Their proposed programme costs ranged from just under £140 per hour to £190 per hour (maximum).</P>
    <P>On a basis of £220 per hour, the figure is £350,000.  But the Minority Report goes on to say that the cost of the B.B.C. programmes per hour was £1,538 in 1956-57: it was £1,730 for sixty minutes in 1958 and it has increased considerably since then.  They say that B.B.C. expenditure on programmes is about nine times the amount which it is proposed to spend on Irish television programmes.  The costs of the Independent Television programmes are not comparable but the Commission ends up by saying that £800 to £1,000 per hour would be a conservative estimate.  I am told that the cost of Independent Television programmes are now considerably higher than the B.B.C. costs and would be about £3,000 per hour.</P>
    <P>Have we any great expectations that on the basis of £50 a minute, advertising would bring in £350,000?  Suppose that figure rises to £1,200 per minute, it means that the figure of £350,000 would become £3,200,000.  A tremendous increase in the advertising revenue would be necessary before that figure could be reached, and of course, it depends on a number of variables. There may be more than five minutes in the hour for advertising.  That may go to ten minutes in the hour.  Advertisers may believe that they will get a good return from 100,000 viewers and they may be prepared to pay more than £50 a minute.  It is a considerable sum to ask people to pay in this country where the number of viewers will be limited.</P>
    <P>According to the Commission's Report, there were about 20,000 sets in this country in May, 1958.  The number is now substantially higher. The Commission took various estimates for the purposes of their Report and their most conservative estimate was that in the third year there would be approximately 120,000 sets.  Suppose there are 120,000 sets.  There would <Col N="803" /> be more than one viewer to a set but what will be the value to advertisers of 120,000 sets with a showing time of four hours, of which only one hour would be a live show and three hours would be recorded or filmed material? Those are the calculations that the business man will make as to whether he will permit himself the luxury of advertising on the Irish television service.</P>
    <P>This is a question of supreme importance because it is vital to know whether we are establishing another C.I.E. or whether we are establishing a body that will pay for itself.  The estimates vary very widely indeed.  Why the Commission accepted the estimate that the originating programmes would cost only about £220 an hour when they had before them the evidence of what they cost the B.B.C. and Independent Television, I do not know. Possibly the Minister has before him additional information and confidential matter sent to him by the Commission. which is not available to us, but if he has, he should throw some light on the matter.  As things go, I see no hope whatever of this Authority paying its way.  I do not see that there will be any attraction, with the limited number of viewers, to business people to advertiseat the rate required to meet the heavy cost of producing the programmes.</P>
    <P>I admit that there will be live shows which will probably cost more to produce than recorded shows.  I admit also that it is quite likely that the Irish live show will cost less to produce than the same type produced by the British services because they probably go in for more decoration and illumination. It is within that framework that the Minister ought to give us the important information we have not got.  It ought to be possible at this stage, before we establish this Authority, to know if they are being put in a reasonable position to carry out the duty imposed on them under Section 24 that they must, within the earliest possible time, secure that their revenue will meet expenditure.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister mean by the &ldquo;earliest possible time&rdquo;?  Is it to be a never-never affair, and will we <Col N="804" /> have to continue making subventions in support of the service until we got into the habit of regarding it as a type of social service that must be carried, not by those to whom the television services gives entertainment, but by the general taxpayer?  It is only within that framework that one can view such matters as are spoken of here.</P>
    <P>There has to be great attention paid to the Irish language.  In paragraph 17 of the Report, it is stated that the Authority has to bear constantly in mind the national aim of restoring the Irish language and of providing for the national culture.  That is a very laudable objective, but put it before the advertiser and he is going to ask how much of our 30 hours per week will be devoted to the restoring of the Irish language.  You will then see what demand or space you will see when the advertiser sees that a considerable amount of our time is to be devoted to Irish or to promoting the restoration of the language.</P>
    <P>The Authority are prohibited from accepting an advertisement of a religious or political nature or one relating to an industrial dispute and are also told that they should have regard to special conditions for advertisers in the Irish language.  Preferential rates are to be given where the advertisement is wholly or substantially in Irish.  What is to be the preferential rate in favour of those who come within the scope of paragraph (b) of subsection 5 of Section 20?  That differential must mount up the extra charges to be imposed on those who do not advertise in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>These are all things that have to be considered.  When I hear so much serious talk about the effect that Irish television will have on Irish life and our disability to realise how much our fundamental way of life may be changed by television, I begin to wonder if we are serious about this matter at all.  I do not think our national culture or any of these fundamental points will be very seriously harmed by 30 hours a week, one of which only will be live material, and the other periods, say, 21 or 22 hours, <Col N="805" /> will be imported material for television which will already have been passed and scrutinised by foreign viewers. How this would have a beneficial effect on our Irish culture, our religion and our fundamental attitude, I fail to see.</P>
    <P>There is a third important matter with regard to the Authority and how it is to conduct itself.  There will be many views on this matter, but, so far as I am concerned, it was found out to a conclusion many years ago when we first thought of establishing the Electricity Supply Board.  There were prolonged debates in this House, and they were good debates, on what the composition of that Board was likely to be, on what powers it should be given, and whether it should be open to a day-to-day inquiry with regard to its procedure, or whether it was only for matters of general policy that the Minister would have to answer.  The general conclusion reached was that we could not have an authority if it ning a service like electricity if it were to be subject to day-to-day inquiry about charges made in different areas or complaints made by consumers.  A compromise was arrived at and it was a pretty good one.</P>
    <P>The compromise arrived at was nearly the same as we have in this Bill but it was not entirely followed.  There was a compromise between those who thought the Shannon Board should be under detailed scrutiny by way of Parliamentary Question every day Dáil Éireann met, and those who thought it must be trusted within a period of a financial year and then brought to book at the end of that year for anything that was wrong.  The compromise established was that the Board's accounts should be made up by their own staff, first of all, and then investigated by a duly qualified outside auditor appointed by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, and that the fees and expenses of that body of auditors would be paid by the Electricity Supply Board itself.  An addition was made which did not satisfy those who wanted a day-to-day examination that, while in view of the fact that it was a new <Col N="806" /> service it was right that it should be given some time to grow, it should be kept under scrutiny at the end of each year.  The arrangement was made and it was publicly announced&mdash;it was backed by guarantees given in this House&mdash;and the Minister, when he was appointing the auditors, made it clear that the accounts of the Board would be scrutinised in the most exacting way.</P>
    <P>It was also here by public pledge established that if there was anything during the year which caused any sort of public disquiet, the Minister who was in charge would take note of it and would ask the outside auditors to report and that whatever power of investigation he had he would apply to investigate anything which needed public inquiry during the year.  They would report to the Minister on that matter and again it was established&mdash; the same phrase occurs here&mdash;that it would be the responsibility of the Minister to see that the outside auditor in investigating the accounts would be apprised of anything which had come to the notice of the Minister as causing any sort of public disquiet.  It was for the Minister to direct the auditors not as to what they were to find but as to what they should inquire into.</P>
    <P>A public pledge was given that if after that, in relation to the report or the accounts, both to be read together, there was any substantial body of opinion in this House that desired a debate on the matter, a day or two would be set aside for that purpose.  I think the Minister should give the same pledge now with regard to this Authourity in that way and I would then agree that the best way for that would be not to have a day-to-day inquiry but to have it at the end of the year and the Authority would be subject to an inquisition by a body of auditors who would not be their own auditors but whom they would have to pay, auditors who would be appointed by the Minister to make that inquisition into anything which had caused disquiet during the year.  After they reported, if there was any substantial number of people, not a majority of the House, but a <Col N="807" /> substantial number, demanding a debate, a debate would be given.</P>
    <P>The result has been that there never has been a debate in Dáil Éireann on anything to do with the accounts of the E.S.B., or their reports, because the accounts are presented in the most detailed way and the outside auditors have directed their attention to those things that had caused certain questions amongst the public.  The Report obviously met with the satisfaction of the Ministry for the time.  If that is not done, then I think we would have to go back to this other plan.  A compromise would have to be found as between the type of thing established under Section 25 and inquisition by way of Parliamentary Question.</P>
    <P>May I say at once that I realise tht there is a difference between a body like the Broadcasting Authority and the E.S.B.  The E.S.B. has to give the same service to everybody.  There is no variation in its performance from week to week, whereas it is variety we are looking for so far as this Authority is concerned, and there are many points on which the whole matter cannot go according to a prearranged plan lasting for 12 months. There must be variations from day to day.  Questions will be asked about the programmes and about certain people who appear on the television service whose performances were not up to what is considered right by, say, a number of people in Parliament here.  The Television Authority is more vulnerable to day-to-day inquiry than C.I.E. or the E.S.B.  As I say, it impacts in different ways at different times on the public and, therefore, there is greater reason to have some inquisition of a day-to-day type.</P>
    <P>There is one matter I want to speak on in this connection.  The Commission have pointed out that all this will be very costly on the Irish people.  It is not the immediate impact from licensing which is very costly&mdash;I think it is £3 or £4, which is not terribly heavy&mdash; but on page 19, paragraph 47, the Commission say:</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that, irrespective of what form Irish television may take, the costs involved <Col N="808" /> will in the ultimate result have to be borne by the Irish people.  These costs will be very heavy.  The capital cost of the television system (£1-£1¼ million) will be a relatively small part of the total costs involved.  At an average cost of, say, £80 per set&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and that is about the price&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;100,000 receiving sets will cost some £8,000,000.</P>
    <P>Taking that figure of £8,000,000, if we get to 200,000 sets on which the Commission base their estimate, it will mean more than £16,000,000.  In addition, that paragraph says:</P>
    <P>The maintenance and replacement costs of receiving sets will represent a substantial sum each year.  In addition, viewers may expect to be charged a licence fee, and the Irish purchasing public will bear the cost of advertising programmes.  This last point is apt to be overlooked, but advertisers on Irish television will pass on their costs to the consumer.</P>
    <P>Again, we get back to the costs of advertising.  Supposing we have only 200,000 sets and the £16,000,000 that is to be spent on them, with the cost of maintenance of those sets, which, I saw recently, is quite a substantial sum, bear in mind that the cost of advertising will be reflected in the cost of the goods advertised.  All advertising has to be charged upon the public.  When one thinks of all that must we not be given the answer to the question: What are we to get in return?&mdash;30 hours per week, one hour live show and the rest imported, tinned material. For that, these costs will put upon people, who are willing to bear them, but, in any event, they are a new drain upon the resources of people, on the moneys they get for the services they render to the community and it is a serious matter.  All that has to be considered in this connection.</P>
    <P>More serious still and more dismaying is that we are being asked to do all that, without being given the slightest hint by the Minister, either in his speech in the Seanad or here, of what the advertising costs will be, what this is all based on, and if he has considered the cost of the originating programmes in this country.  That may <Col N="809" /> amount to a very much larger sum than the Commission suggest in their Report.</P>
    <P>In connection with the Authority and their accounts and audits, this has to be borne in mind: apart altogether from the costs of the sets and everything else, there will be a good deal of money spent in connection with programmes. How are these programmes to be arranged?  Somebody will have to make contracts for them.  There will definitely be a commission paid on contracts.  Has the Minister yet arranged, with regard to those contracts, who is to get the control of them and who is to get the very valuable commissions that are bound to arise from them, will that be a matter that will be referred to in the accounts and audits as they are produced at the end of each year and in regard to the auditor whom the Minister sends in and asks to make a report, first of all, with regard to the various costs of the service themselves and also with regard to how the Authority is conduction itself, will the Minister guarantee in this House&mdash;it is a thing which should be guaranteed&mdash;that one of the points specially to be regarded and to be taken up in any report presented to the House will be the recipients of all this&mdash;not so much the members of the Authority, not who the Director is, not what his salary is, but how the spread of money is being arranged and whether it is being channelled into certain hands and, if so, into what hands is it being channelled and why are people being selected for this lucrative business instead of others?</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of commenting briefly on the principles of the Bill.  It is proposed to set up a Broadcasting Authority and to provide an Irish television service.  I wonder if the Government have really sought an answer to one question, namely, whether in present economic circumstances expenditure on a television service is necessary?  When one takes into consideration the record of the Government over the past 28 years, their extravagant and wild spending, one is not surprised that, at a time when there is a record unemployment problem unsolved, a record drain from rural <Col N="810" /> Ireland in emigration, a cost of living unprecendented in height, old age pensioners, widows, orphans, blind and disabled persons put to the pin of their collars to eke out an existence, these problems fade into pale insignificance compared with the necessity to provide the rich with a television service.</P>
      <P>I am not opposed to the Bill but I feel a Deputy is entitled to offer criticism of any legisaltion passing through the House.  For that reason, a broad, honest expression of opinion on a Bill of this kind is very necessary. The ordinary person in the country can read in the paper or hear on the radio the amount of the time of this House and of Seanad Eireann that is occupied on the question of the provision of a television service for the well-off sections of the community.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan has mentioned the number of television sets already in the country.  I see in parts of the city increasing numbers of television aerials.  I have not spent a great length of time viewing television because I do not mix with the class of people in my constituency who have television sets.  The people I know are very lucky to have radios.  The people I represent are more concerned with work and with an improvement in their standard of living than they are with television.</P>
      <P>I suppose that if the whole world is advancing, it cannot be expected that this country should remain at the tailend. Modern conditions present luxuries and I suppose we have to be in the queue for them.  There are very few people in this country who can afford to pay £80 to £100 for a television set.  At least, the people for whom I claim to speak in this House cannot.  In that case, are we not legislating for a very limited section of the community?  This is a Bill to serve those who want to enter into hire purchase agreements and to sink themselves in debt for television sets or is it to provide a pleasure and pastime for people who are anxious to spend their time viewing television?</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister and his advisers have gone sufficintly deeply into this matter.  On the appointed day, when this Bill becomes law, are they ready to move into action and to provide the programmes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="811" /> If the proposed television service is to be anything like Radio Éireann, I ask the Minister to drop the matter because Radio Éireann is not alone disgusting but it provides probably the most useless broadcasting service that any broadcasting authority in the would could put on the air.  Does the Minister really know, or are he and his Department living in the clouds, that the moment the news is over, every voice in the country unites in saying: &ldquo;Turn it off.  Get Radio Luxembourg, A.F.N., the B.B.C. Light programme&rdquo;?  I have yet to go into a house in rural Ireland where Radio Éireann is being listened to, apart from a Sunday when a match in Croke Park or a provincial town is being broadcast or the news.</P>
    <P>It is reaching the stage where, particularly because of political intervention in news items and through sheer disgust, the great majority of our people are even refusing to listen to the news items on Radio Éireann. Many of the programmes over Radio Éireann are now becoming politically hurtful and abusive.  I do not know if this is the right occasion to raise it but if we are faced with a television problem similar to that of the radio service it is about time we had a showdown on the matter.  Radio Éireann as it is administered today is most unsatisfactory and is used entirely to further the interests of a political Party.  I challenge the Minister on this.</P>
    <P>We have a great deal of evidence in this connection.  News items broadcast over Radio Éireann afford a typical example.  I had occasion to write to the Director of Broadcasting because I was refused information in this House concerning the broadcast of news items.  If we cannot table a question in this House to inquire into the details of certain television programmes, I submit we are heading for a state of affairs in which this House will be voting millions of pounds for a service in relation to which we cannot ask a single question. The reason I resent the present activities of Radio Éireann is the political tinge attached to everything that is carried on there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we may under the Bill.  Does any Deputy remember any news programme in which the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Childers, was not mentioned?  If any Deputy listens carefully to the reports that come from Radio Éireann each evening he will hear that &ldquo;Radio Éireann regret to announce the death which occurred today of So-and-So who died at his residence, such-and-such a place&rdquo;; they go on to say he was a member of such-and-such a company of the I.R.A., that he was associated with the fight for freedom and that his funeral will take place after 11 o'clock Mass to such and such a cemetery. There are a number of members on this side of the House who were never mentioned because they were on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>I make special reference to the announcement of the death of Senator Baxter, to the announcement of the death of Senator John O'Leary and the recent announcement of the death of Deputy Joseph Hughes.  That was the last item mentioned.  On a day when we heard three times the broadcast of news items in relation to difficulties in Algeria, the announcement of the death of Deputy Hughes came only once over Radio Éireann.  There was no such thing as an announcement of funeral arrangements, but when the brother of the chairman of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Mr. Considine, died there were full details given over Radio Éireann of the funeral arrangements.  That is why Deputies who are concerned about the manner in which the taxpayers' money is spent must protest against money being used in this manner and against Radio Éireann being used for sheer political purposes.  If the television Authority is to be used in the same way it will be used to build up Fianna Fáil and to build up those who believe in Fianna Fáil.</P>

    <P>In regard to the programmes over Radio Eireann the vast majority of our people know and speak the English language and when they hear the English language being spoken they <Col N="813" /> know what is going on, but they do not know what is going on when they hear Irish over Radio Éireann.  It is all right to have a programme in Irish broadcast over Radio Éireann but to be stuffing it down the necks of the listeners, five and six times between 5 o'clock and 11.30 at night, is too much for them.  That is why the younger people will tell you every tune that is played on Radio Luxembourg.  They will tell you the times when Bing Crosby's records will be played.  They will tune in on Sunday night to hear the Top Twenty but you will never hear Radio Éireann except in a really patriotic house, and they are very few. Radio Éireann is silent so far as many people are concerned.  The reason they pay licences to have wireless sets is to hear the B.B.C., A.F.N. and Radio Luxembourg, but their period of listening in to Radio Éireann is very limited.</P>
    <P>Somebody recently gave a review of a book on Arthur Griffith; I think the writer's name was McGuinness.  Only yesterday I sent a letter to the Director of Broadcasting to get a copy of that script, which I hope I shall get.  I am sure it was edited by somebody in Radio Éireann when Radio Éireann was used to attack certain people on this side of the House.</P>

If he intends to introduce a television service based on the same principle, I ask him in the name of the taxpayers to drop the matter.  I warn him that even if a political broadcasting authority should be appointed, we shall not have, please God, a Fianna Fáil Government for ever.

      <Col N="816" /> In the event of political appointments, such as we have seen and experienced in recent years to similar authorities, to the Authority proposed to be set up under this Bill, I hope and trust some Government will look upon it as their duty to dispense with the services of political hacks and to put in, instead, the best men with the experience and the technical and practical knowledge of the work that must be performed in order efficiently to discharge their duties in connection with the code of broadcasting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell the House what type of programme it is proposed to make available on the proposed Irish television service?  Deputy McGilligan tells us the time available will be not alone extremely costly but very limited.  Are we to have on our television the same type of tripe as we see from the British television service?  If we are to have only an hour, approximately, available on our television service and if the balance is to be in the nature of films or imported television shows already shown elsewhere, what method of censorship will there be?</P>
      <P>I presume the board will carry out the censoring.  If we adopt the same pattern as the British television service, God help the young people of this country who will be looking at it. Programmes were put on the British television service which brought disgust to any decent person, programmes which were unfit for children.  We have reached the stage here now where few country children retire early to bed as they did in the days when we were all going to school and when we had to pop into bed between 6 and 7 p.m. You will find children up now in country houses as well as in the cities at 10 and 10.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the adults sit down to view television, anybody with a family knows that unless there is very stern control, the children will be very unwilling if somebody says: &ldquo;To bed with the children.&rdquo;  In most cases, they will sit with the adults and view the programmes. The control and discipline <Col N="817" /> of children has seriously relaxed&mdash; no blame to the Government, naturally enough, for that.  Like television, that phenomenon is a product of the age in which we live.</P>
    <P>If we subject our children to some of the imported television shows that have already been shown on television in Britain, will there not be an outcry? For example, will we witness some of the television shows that were lapped up by the British people such as when prostitutes were interviewed on television?</P>

I am sure that an opportunity will arise in the course of the Estimate, when the Bill is passed and the Authority set up, to go into the matter. Therefore it is no harm for the Minister to be forewarned that the stream which he has now successfully evaded may have to be crossed when the time comes.  As we cannot mention the proposed type of programmes to be shown on television, I want to refer to the fact that in this Bill we are told that the Authority will have full power to appoint staff.</P>

As soon as the Authority is set up, the staff will be appointed and the Authority will then get busy in the service and elsewhere to recruit the right type of staff. Naturally enough, membership of Fianna Fáil will qualify them for any position of trust or responsibility under that Authority.

    <P>The Bill says that we must advocate Irish games, Irish language and Irish pastimes.  I submit that rugby, soccer, tennis and the good old game of cricket are as good Irish pastimes as ever Gaelic football or hurling was. <Col N="823" /> You have as good Irishmen on the playing pitches in those other games. You have as good sportsmen looking on at those matches.

      <P>I should like to know from the Minister, in view of the few hours we have, wheter he has any information at his disposal about the cost of advertising because, when it comes to advertising on television, the keen firms who will be advertising will not put money into a five or ten minutes' programme which will be taken up with the Irish language because that will not be a good medium for the quick sale of their goods no matter what they may be anxious to sell.  If there is to be any music attached to the advertising of the goods by the advertisers, they will expect something more attractive and more catchy than &ldquo;The Walls of Limerick&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Bridge of Athlone.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Can the Minister give us any idea as to the cost per unit to advertisers in the proposed service?  It can reach £50 per minute.  It may be something in the region of £25 per minute but we can safely assume that it will be between £20 and £40 per minute for the advertising. That will be expensive advertising for any Irish industrialist or any Irish merchant who advertises his products or his goods on Irish television. He will look for the easiest, the quickest and the most attractive means to bring home to the viewers the attractiveness of the goods he is advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you are to advertise your goods, or whatever you have to sell, by <Col N="825" /> poster, it means that you can have a very extensive poster made available pasted up on every railway station, with the permission of C.I.E., and outside every cinema and convenient to every town hall.  It may be costly but advertising on television will last from two to five minutes.  The poster may be there for two or three months and may have a better effect on pushing forward the commodity that is being advertised over television.</P>
    <P>I can see something in the far distant future in so far as industries using television are concerned.  It can be used in order to rake in money.  Certain people connected with the Television Authority can go direct to company directors and manufacturers and say: &ldquo;We gave you loans; we gave you grants; we gave you money; we built up your industry; we gave you quotas; we gave you export licences; we permitted you certain export facilities. Now in return you must advertise with us or you will not get the facilities desired.&rdquo;  No man can tell me as the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Taoiseach, said that that will not be done because it will be done.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Language Revival: Replacement of Compulsory Methods&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That in view of the failure of the use of compulsion in regard to the language revival to appreciably further the objective of making the Irish language the spoken language of the people, and of the apparent growing disquiet and dissatisfaction among responsible authorities and among parents and pupils alike about compulsory methods, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Government should seek by means of a public referendum to ascertain whether a majority of the people would favour the replacement of compulsory methods, where used in the attempted revival of the language, by voluntary schemes for its encouragement.&mdash;(Deputies Dr. Browne and McQuillan.)</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The time remaining for debate on this motion is two hours and forty-five minutes.  The time remaining to the member in possession, Deputy Dr. Browne, is 25 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this motion and placing some doubt on the question of compulsion, I hope I have made it clear that I do not think compulsion is the sole reason the language revival has failed.  I do not want to put the entire blame on the compulsory methods being used and I have tried to show that there are historical reasons, economic reasons and reasons over which no Government have any control at all, which are also responsible.  The experience in Wales has been similar to our own.  There has been a progressive decline in the <Col N="827" /> number of speakers of Welsh from 49.9 per cent.&mdash;nearly 50 per cent.&mdash; speaking Welsh in 1901 to 28.9 per cent. in 1951.</P>
      <P>I say the main reason we are concerned with the compulsory methods used is that unlike the great historical, economic and financial developments of our society there is the factor that compulsion is reversible.  It does not, like so many of these, appear to be irremediable in that regard.  For that reason we appeal to the Minister to consider the particular points arising out of compulsion.</P>
      <P>To me compulsion is repugnant in its very nature.  It is particularly so in some matters, though it might be said that it is necessary to have compulsory education and various other forms of compulsion in a society such as ours is today.  That is true but in things like politics, in religion, and in a matter like the language there are difficulties which do not seem to respond to attempts to compel people to believe in any particular ideology, creed or language.  The history of the world over the last 2,000 years has shown that people resent any imposition of any of these particular things and that they tend to react very violently against them.</P>
      <P>What the Government does not seem to be aware of is that for the last 40 years there has been one of the most intelligently carried out and comprehensive passive resistance movements on the part of the people.  While the several Governments have passed legislation concerning the compulsory relearning of the language, the people have simply refused to learn it and the political leaders who, over the years, have tried to impose compulsion have ignored the fact that they cannot impose it without the consent of the governed.  At any rate it appears to me that they did not have this consent in relation to the question of the imposition of compulsion.  If one is to judge by results I think this certainly can be said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it might be said that we learn English compulsorily I think I gave the reasons last week why people do learn <Col N="828" /> English.  There are economic reasons for doing so&mdash;the reason that one starves if one does not, that it gives to some of our unfortunate people an opportunity to get out of the country and earn a living, and to get away from appalling home conditions.  The former Taoiseach, now President de Valera, emphasised that point when he said that if one found oneself in an Irish-speaking area, and was hungry, one would soon pick up the words &ldquo;im&rdquo; and &ldquo;bainne&rdquo;, or whatever they might be, his point being that only when the economic necessity is so rigidly imposed does one tend to respond and learn whatever language is in question, be it German in AlsaceLorraine, or Irish under British rule, or the various other languages that have been compulsorily imposed from time to time.  Therefore, it can be established that compulsion by a Government was not sufficient because there were limits beyond which Governments could not go.</P>
    <P>The degree of compulsion required to impose a language upon a people is so widely beyond the bounds of what is permitted in a modern democratic society that it simply is as impossible to impose a language on a people as it is, outside a totalitarian society, to impose a religion or a political ideology. So, while it may be of some comfort to the Minister, or whoever is in charge, to believe they did not apply enough compulsion, I would be completely against them applying any more and, from the purely physical point of trying to impose a language on a people, they would have to go very much further than they did.  The fact that they left things like the radio, and particularly the newspapers and commercial life of the country, outside these compulsory measures meant that they left out one of the most potent factors in our society which militated against the language ever being revived.</P>
    <P>I hope it will not be controverted that there is this compulsion.  Sometimes one gets the fantastic argument advanced that there is no compulsion but I am sure it will be accepted that there is compulsion in relation to infants. In relation to primary schools the children have to learn the language. <Col N="829" /> There is compulsion in the examinations that are taken and I think this is probably the most undesirable feature of the whole series of compulsory methods used because, if a child fails in Irish, it fails in all other subjects.  If even that were removed a serious source of grievance would be put to rights by Irish taking its own place as an ordinary subject in examinations&mdash;that is, if it is decided to retain Irish as a subject in the schools, voluntarily or compulsorily.</P>
    <P>There are various points of view which people have as regards the serious state of the language at the moment, one question being whether or not it would be wise to concentrate on educating a <i>corps d'elite</i> of the few who would be glad to learn the language voluntarily or, as has been tried over the past 40 years, to spread the thing so thinly that it is imperceptible. There is a case for teaching the language in places like Scoil Lorcán and Coláiste Mhuire where parents send their children to learn the language, the language which is spoken in their homes, which is the major factor in the whole problem of trying to learn a language.  It seems to me that the compulsory methods used merely serve as irritants.  They are too limited to be of any real value and they simply cannot be permitted to be of an extent to be really successful in restoring the language.</P>
    <P>The whole decision seems to have stemmed from the National Programme Conference decision in 1926 and the evidence given by Professor Dr. Corcoran.  On that, the policy for the schools was established.  He believed it was possible to restore the language through the schools exclusively. Apparently, he was a very reputable authority on this subject, and upon his evidence was broadly based the policy of both Governments that the language could be restored through the schools.  I have suggested that there is considerable disquiet&mdash;I do not think I need labour the point&mdash;in the primary schools.  The language is effectively essential for the teacher and the pupil in the secondary schools.  It is essential, too, in the vocational <Col N="830" /> schools&mdash;certainly for the teachers. They have to have the Ceárd Teastas and effectively they have to know the language, be prepared to teach it, write it and, in certain circumstance, to teach different subjects through the language.</P>
    <P>The dissatisfaction to which I referred can be readily demonstrated. The evidence is in various sources.  I should like to deal with them very briefly.  There is the Rev. Dr. O'Doherty, a psychiatrist and expert on child education, who has suggested in an article in <i>Studies</i> that eight out of every 50 children&mdash;and that is not counting the imbecile or backward children, of which there are always a certain number in most classes&mdash;or nearly 16 per cent. of the children are incapable, because of their low I.Q., of learning a second language.  It is recognised that a very high percentage of our people are unable to learn a language at all.  These are people who outwardly are perfectly normal.  In no way have they the appearance of mental defectives or backward children, but because of their low I.Q. they are simply unable to assimilate a second language.  These children, in addition to the other children, are subjected to this forceable education in regard to compulsory Irish.  He deprecated this attempt to teach these children Irish.</P>
    <P>Another authority is Senator Professor Hayes who, in the course of a remarkably frank speech&mdash;and, I thought, courageous speech in the light of the general circumstances&mdash; said in the Seanad, at column 1468 of Volume 48 of the Seanad Debates:</P>
    <P>I am examining my own conscience on this matter because I was largely responsible for the beginning myself....  I think we have been almost a complete failure because certainly we have not succeeded in increasing the love for Irish among our adult population.... We expected too much from the schools and we have expected too much from the teachers, and we have left too much to do to the teachers.  It was true in 1922, and it is still more true <Col N="831" /> today that the schools are not as important as we thought they were.</P>
    <P>Then there is the comment from Senator Kissane on the other side, whose general fear was expressed in the statement:</P>
    <P>I am afraid that when we started out to teach the Irish language in the schools we expected too much in too little time&mdash;that we were in too much of a hurry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Column 1462, Vol. 48, of the Seanad Debates.  We had then the statement, as reported at Col. 1455, Vol. 48, of the late Senator Baxter, again a man who had a lot to do with the formation of our language policy at that time:</P>
      <P>The decision commanding the great body of national teachers to show proficiency in the language within a limited period was, I think, an error of the first magnitude....</P>
      <P>There is a statement in an article in <i>Studies</i> for Summer, 1956, by Professor Breathnach of University College, Cork, in which he described the apparatus built up for compulsory Irish.  He says:</P>
      <P>It can scarcely be denied that the machine designed to mass produce speakers of Irish has proved to be a lethal contrivance.</P>
      <P>This is a professor of Irish language and literature at University College, Cork.</P>
      <P>There is also the evidence in the Report of the Council of Education. In paragraph 207 of the Majority Report it is admitted:</P>
      <P>To object that less Irish is heard now than was 30 years ago may possibly be correct...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They do concede that there is a genuine case for suggesting that the language revival movement has, to a considerable extent, failed.  There is also in that document the evidence contained in the report of the I.N.T.O. who, I am <Col N="832" /> sure, cannot be said to be prejudiced against the language.  They state:</P>
    <P>The great bulk of evidence supports the view that a smooth and easy educative process imposing comparatively little strain on the child, and making his life in school a happy one, is extremely difficult in a language other than his home language, even with the brighter pupils, and next to impossible with those of average or slow mentality.</P>
    <P>That, of course, subscribes to the view put forward by Rev. Dr. O'Doherty.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the parents is also reflected in this Report of the Council of Education.  At page 302 of the Minority Report there is this statement:</P>
    <P>There is, however, a constant theme running through all the replies which points to the fact that parents generally are opposed to a method for the Irish revival which would tend to lower the educational standard of the children, according to their values.  Infant teachers have stated that it is a common practice for parents to ask that infant children be provided with English primers so that they may be given in the home, instruction in English reading denied to them in the school.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that whether it is the educational authorities, the Deputies and the Senators of the various political Parties reflecting the viewpoints of the people throughout the country, there is serious unrest on this question.  It has nothing to do with the old mentality&mdash;the West British attitude that anything Irish was objectionable.  It has nothing to do with that.  It is evinced by people, many of whom speak the language fluently, who went to the trouble themselves of learning the language and who are most anxious that it should not die because it is the beautiful thing that it is.  But they do say that present policies are not being effective and, in fact, are seriously impeding any revival.  That is all evidence advanced from various sources as to the failure of present policies.  There is the evidence of figures showing that in the 1936/46 <Col N="833" /> census, the Irish language in the FíorGhaeltacht declined by 14.8 per cent. and in Munster, it declined by 20 per cent. in the same period.</P>
    <P>All that has been caused by the apparent discrimination by the Government, by the fact that it could not insist on the cinemas showing exclusively Irish films, by the fact that the newspapers are printed mainly in English.  It is a fact that one of the most devoted adherents of the language had control over the operation of three Irish newspapers, but in none of them did he insist on putting his views through the medium of Irish. He was too good a businessman for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the policies of the newspapers do not arise on this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be an element of cynicism in regard to the implementation of this policy of compulsory Irish which has alienated the people from that policy.  They see that children, civil servants and others, can be forced to do something, but that the Government cannot insist that the newspapers print their papers in Irish. The radio probably makes the greatest contribution to the language revival, but I do not think I would be wrong in saying that the Irish programmes are probably the least listened to.  In the Seanad, Senator McGuire said that he had 60,000 letters and only one of them was written in Irish.  Surely that is proof that the language is not used to any great extent.  It was stated today that in the case of only two of the people in State-sponsored bodies was Irish insisted upon and I believe that there is no insistence on Irish with regard to our new development of television.</P>
      <P>The best example is ourselves.  If those of us who can speak Irish did speak Irish only in this House, I wonder how many Deputies or Senators would understand us.  That is a fact which has influenced a number of people in their belief that we pass laws for others which we do not apply to ourselves.  That has added to the factors which have militated against the language revival.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> It seems to me that, in the face of the evidence of these figures, the evidence of public and political opinion, the evidence of expert educationists, the evidence of linguists of various kinds, those who continue with these methods must be treated as the people who mean to destroy the language.  It is clear from these facts that they are getting rid of the language and ending any possibility of retaining that amount of the language we have at present.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude with a quotation from Thomas Davis, as I know he will be quoted by speakers from the opposite side of the House.  In one of the most remarkable prophecies, he foretold this: &ldquo;If an attempt was made to introduce Irish through the national schools or the courts of law into the eastern side of the island, it would certainly fail and the reaction would be to extinguish it altogether.&rdquo; I have never heard anything proved to be so accurate as that statement.  All we want, in introducing this motion, is that this matter be put to the public and let them decide it.  We may be wrong in our evaluation of the situation and it is something that we ought to trust to the wisdom of the public.</P>

I was not fortunate enough to get an opportunity to learn it, although I was almost two months in Tintown.  While I was there, I learned it but then I was shifted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not prejudiced against it because I do not know it, but I see things from a different angle. I recognise that the language is one thing that we ought to preserve, although O'Connell said he could not care less if we lost the language.  He said it would be much better if we all spoke the one language.  I do agree, however, that we should preserve <Col N="835" /> English.  We should not be prejudiced against the English language because it is the language of our former oppressors and of those who still possess Northern Ireland.  It is the language of the United States and it is the language of the people in England, the new abode of our emigrants.  I am sure that the Irish population of England will continue to grow and it is important therefore that we should preserve the English language more than the Irish language.</P>
    <P>As far as the working class people are concerned, their primary interest is in earning a livelihood.  From the school leaving age of 14, it is impossible for those people to have any education, whether Irish or English.  I know from personal experience that these children cannot write a single letter.  They would not be certain of many of the words.  I know from my own experience, because I do not know Irish myself, that they cannot even read a simple address, if asked to do so.  Many of the corporation dwellings are named in Irish only, and if I get a letter with an Irish address, I ask some of my own children to read it and they cannot.  I have tested them and whatever little they do know of Irish, a short time after they leave school, they have forgotten.  They cannot write a simple letter in English because they are unable to spell English words, and they are faced then with having to earn their livelihoods and if they have no trade, they are handicapped.  If they go to England to get a job they are handicapped.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think that while it might suit some people to know the Irish language as well as English, and while it might help some people because a knowledge of Irish is a condition of certain forms of employment, it certainly does not suit the working class people who will continue to leave school at the age of 14 years. For that reason, I do not think there should be compulsion.  People should learn the language for the love of it.  I do not believe it helps the language to compel people to learn it, because as soon as people are no longer under <Col N="836" /> compulsion, they cease to bother about it.</P>
    <P>A knowledge of the language should be encouraged, but it should be voluntary, and there should be some kind of honours or some kind of inducements.  I do not agree that there should be compulsion, and I certainly do not agree that it should be a means of jobbery.  While I have no objection to a minimum of Irish for the purpose of getting certain forms of employment, I do not agree with it as a condition of promotion to positions of responsibility, because that could easily mean that control could pass into the hands of mediocrities.</P>
    <P>The fact that you have a knowledge of Irish does not give you any superior intelligence or ability.  Lots of people could learn the language if they had nothing to do but learn it, and if they had some one to maintain them and keep them grinding away at it, but that is not evidence of intelligence. One of the serious objections I had was with regard to the Vote for the Department of Defence last year, when the question arose that promotion would go to the soldiers on the basis of their knowledge of the language.  That kind of thing could endanger the country.  It is not a matter of the language you know, or if you do not know any language.  You could have superior ability, even if you were an illiterate, and you do not need a knowledge of Irish in a soldier's profession.</P>
    <P>One can read in history from time to time that the most superior person might be a Yank in one war, a Frenchman in the next war, and there was an African who was very tough, but a very capable soldier, and once there was an actual savage.  I am pointing out the danger of going too far in this business of making a knowledge of the Irish language a condition of promotion.</P>
    <P>To get back to the motion, it may be argued that it denotes an Irishman if he knows the language, but that argument does not appeal to me, and I am very well acquainted with the history of the country.  The funny thing is that I read nothing else.  If I read a history of Ireland this week, I read another one next week, and <Col N="837" /> another one the following week.  I devour them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>One gets mixed up if one reads only one history but if one reads more, one gets all sides of the case.  We all spoke the language when a handful of foreigners landed at Wexford and we all fell flat on our faces. It did not induce unity or strength. The extraordinary thing is that in part of our history the majority of those who helped the British were actually Irish speakers in the Pale, so the language certainly does not induce patriotism.  When we read of Hugh O'Neill's victories, we find that on the other side with General Bagnall were Shane O'Neill's nephews.  That goes to show that the language is no evidence of patriotism.</P>
      <P>In '98, there were very few people who knew the language and those who knew it kept out of the fighting. People who spoke only English were the actual patriots of the period, so it is not evidence of patriotism and a knowledge of Irish certainly gives no monopoly of patriotism.  If we had to fight tomorrow, there would be many people in the front row who had only a knowledge of English.  That was the case in the Tan war as well as in 1916, and in every other war.</P>
      <P>I object to compulsion for the poorer classes and I object to them coming out of school illiterate, with a knowledge of neither language.  Irish should be a subject for secondary schools or for higher education.  There should be a minimum of Irish spoken but there certainly should not be compulsion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Over and above all, in this debate, we should make up our minds to be tolerant of all the views that have been expressed and that will be expressed by the time the debate closes.  Intolerance on the part of several people in this country has done more harm to the cause of the revival of the Irish language than those who are 100 per cent. opposed to it.  If a Deputy expresses a view on the question <Col N="838" /> of the Irish language, it should be accepted that he is sincere.</P>
      <P>It will be noticed that Deputy Dr. Browne does not advocate that a referendum be held to decide whether or not we want the Irish language.  He wants a referendum to decide merely by what method we should go about the revival.  Unfortunately, in recent times especially, critics of the methods employed in teaching the Irish language in recent years have been accused of being anti-Irish, not in the patriotic or national sense, but in regard to the language.  I do not think that such is the case.  If a consensus of opinion in this House were to be taken on the question of whether or not the Irish language should be revived the vast majority of the members of the House would vote in favour of the revival. Some Deputies might have different motives from others.  By and large, the vast majority of the House would agree that the Irish language should be revived, while differing as to the methods that should be employed.</P>
      <P>I do not think the motion is unreasonable in what it asks.  As a matter of fact, the motion is conservative in that it brings to the notice of the Government and the country the fact that the methods employed for the last 40 years have not been signally successful.  Ministers usually rely on statistics but I do not believe that the Minister can produce statistics to show that any appreciable improvement has been effected in the position in regard to the Irish language for the last 40 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, many people&mdash;in my opinion, intolerant people&mdash;will argue that there is no compulsion as far as the Irish language is concerned.  Some of us may not have used the best phraseology in talking on this subject and if I were to talk about the language being shoved down the throats of the children, grave exception might be taken to such criticism.  That is understandable but, despite that, it must be admitted that there is compulsion.  There is compulsion in the fact that, as Deputy Dr. Browne has said, a student does not pass an examination in the national or secondary schools unless he gets at <Col N="839" /> least a pass mark in the Irish language. Some people may consider that that is desirable.  I do not, although I am in favour of the revival of the Irish language.  One cannot obtain a post&mdash; a minor post, note well&mdash;in the Civil Service without qualifying in Irish but it is significant that even though the revival in this intensified form started about 38 years ago, even now posts are given to people of 40 to 55 years of age in respect of which it is not required that they should have two words of Irish.  However, that is not my criticism to-night.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that if there is compulsion in relation to the Irish language, equally there is compulsion in regard to English, mathematics, history, geography, commerce, science and other subjects.  Presumably there is compulsion inasmuch as students must choose a certain number of subjects but the Irish language should not be regarded in the same way as we would regard algebra, science, commerce or any of the other subjects, with the possible exception of English. We want to have the Irish language revived, not for commercial purposes, but because it is our own language, because it was the language of our people for thousands of years, because we believe, and rightly believe, that by having the Irish language our traditional culture can be preserved. The Irish language should not be classified with other subjects when the question of compulsion is under discussion.</P>
    <P>We are told that we should love the language.  I agree.  I do not believe that a love of the language can be fostered by telling children that they must pass in Irish in order to pass an examination.  It is pathetic and tragic that children who are brilliant in other subjects should fail the Intermediate Certificate Examination or the Leaving Certificate Examination because of their failure, by two marks, to secure a pass in Irish.  I heard of such a case yesterday morning.  The girl in question had intended to make her career in Ireland but could not afford to remain at school for another 12 months in order to take the examination a <Col N="840" /> second time.  She now has a good job in England and is useful to the British. But for the fact that she failed by two marks in Irish, she could be useful to Ireland in the city of Dublin.  That is one of the things that make people resentful of the methods employed to revive the Irish language and that is why I support the idea advocated by Deputy Dr. Browne tonight that other methods should be adopted.</P>
    <P>Even if the Minister can produce statistics as to the number who pass examinations in Irish and so on, I shall not be impressed in the slightest.  A child's school period covers about eight or nine years.  About five successive groups have passed out of school in the last 40 years, having been subjected to what we like to describe as the compulsory method of teaching Irish.  Where has it got us?  I am 40 years of age and I do not see any appreciable improvement in Wexford town.  With the exception of a few national teachers and some very enthusiastic persons, not many people in Wexford say, &ldquo;Dia is Muire dhuit&rdquo; to me.  Does anybody see any improvement in the city of Dublin in regard to the speaking of Irish?  Does anybody hear many bus drivers of 35 years of age asking a school boy or girl for the fare in the Irish language?  Such a man would have been at school when the revivalist movement was at its height but it has done nothing for him.</P>
    <P>One does not hear many men speaking Irish at football matches.  I am speaking of the part of the country that I know&mdash;the East and the midlands. I am sure Irish is heard in the West but in very restricted areas there. Suppose Roscommon and Mayo were playing a football match in Castlebar, would one hear much Irish being spoken?  I do not think so.  One does not hear Irish being spoken in the publichouses, at dances or, indeed, one does not hear a lot of it at some céilidhthe.  I say these things not by way of criticism of the Irish language or of those who support the methods now used but merely to demonstrate that there has been no obvious improvement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;than there is in many towns and cities in the Twenty-Six Counties.  There is no compulsion &mdash;I hate to use the word&mdash;in Belfast, or in the Six Counties.  I do not say that the methods they employ are correct, either.  I do not say that they encourage the language as they should. The fact remains that, despite all that has been said about the language, despite all the money that has been spent on the language, despite the preference given to the Irish language, there has been no great improvement.</P>
      <P>As one who comes from the East, again I say that we are very critical of and annoyed about the preference given to those who were fortunate enough to be born in the Gaeltacht, where the Irish language is the vernacular. If there is a prejudice against the Irish language part of it is due to the preference given to students from the Gaeltacht who have the Irish language from birth.  By an accident of birth, they have the language which entitles them, as a result of Government policy, to preference over those born in the Galltacht, particularly preference as I have pointed out on previous occasions, in the matter of entry to the teaching profession.  That is one of the reasons I believe there is a prejudice&mdash;I do not say I entertain that prejudice 100 per cent.&mdash;amongst the ordinary people who do not have the advantage of those born in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Minister go back over the years and tell us what has been the population of the Gaeltacht every five years since 1922?  Has there been any increase in the population of Irish speakers in the area known as the Fíor-Ghaeltacht or has the population of Irish speakers declined or increased in the Breac-Ghaeltacht? Of course the situation has changed and it is not easy for a Minister, a Government or anybody connected with the language to ensure the people in the Gaeltacht would speak Irish exclusively in view of the fact that <Col N="842" /> the cinemas produce English-speaking films, that the greater portion of radio programmes is in Irish and that modern books are mostly in the English language as well.  I know it is a tremendous task.  I am not trying to make arguments; I am trying to point out the facts and, as far as my information goes, the facts are that the Gaeltacht is not improving nor is the population of Irish speakers increasing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin made a significant point.  He said he did not have the advantage of some of the younger people who had the Irish language taught to them in school, but he learned Irish at Tintown.  There was no compulsion in Tintown.  The camp commandant did not make Deputy Sherwin learn the language.  Apropos of that there were many people interned in the Curragh for various reasons during the war years, men whom we all knew.  Some of them were between 20 and 30 years of age and some were older; when they went into the Curragh they did not know a word of Irish but some of them I know are now fluent speakers, because it was a voluntary effort.  Some of them in this House knew very little Irish but when they went into the Curragh during the war they became fluent speakers.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable but true that if one asks young children, say, from seven to 12 years of age if they like the Irish language the vast majority will say: &ldquo;No, I do not.&rdquo;  It is not that they are violently against it but they have no real love of the language.  Those children are of far too tender years to turn them against the language and if we are to revive it it should be confined to the secondary schools. Children do not begin to learn French, Latin or any other of the foreign languages until they have entered secondary school.  Then they have an appreciation of what the language can do for them.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to talk to Irish children between seven and 14 years about our Irish heritage and culture, to tell them we can only save the soul of the nation if we preserve the Irish language.  You <Col N="843" /> could talk till doomsday and they would not understand.  They would begin to realise that at 14 but the damage is then done.  They are asked to use their vocal chords in making sounds that to them do not mean much.  Take, for instance, the sentence: &ldquo;I want a piece of bread.&rdquo;  If the teacher asks them to say: &ldquo;Tá arán ag teastáil uaim&rdquo; it means nothing to them.  Therefore, I suggest that if the method that is now employed is to be retained it should be confined to children entering secondary school from 12 to 14 years onwards.  That may not include everybody but that is where the motion comes in.</P>
    <P>This proposed referendum will show an overwhelming decision by the people in favour of what Deputy Dr. Browne advocates here.  If you told young children they must play hurling, Gaelic football or rugby they would not take to it as they do.  If they were told they must play it in a certain way they certainly would not.  There is intolerance among certain people about the language and it is a very dangerous thing.  You dare not speak ungrammatical Irish in the presence of these people.  You will have overzealous Irish speakers who, if you put one word astray, will correct you.  If the Minister wants to have Irish spoken in the schools let the children use any sort of grammar they choose. Let them speak the worst Irish as long as they are speaking the language.  The voluntary effort, in conjunction with what I have just said, is preferable in any attempt to revive the language.</P>
    <P>It has often been stated that when we were forbidden to use the Irish language there was more enthusiasm for it.  The Gaelic League, to which great credit is due, was a great revival movement and was responsible for the fact that there are Deputies here of 50, 60 and 70 years of age who are fluent speakers of Irish.  The Government should give more encouragement to associations like Gael Linn who seem to have the right idea as regards the promotion of the language.  They are doing great work through films, books and entertainment, which is the ideal method of reviving the language.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="844" /> The Minister may oppose this motion but it is not necessary to have a referendum to do what Deputy Dr. Browne suggests.  When he suggests that, he merely wants to convey to the Minister&mdash;at least that is my impression&mdash;what the mind of the ordinary people is in relation to the language revival.  The Minister can do this with a stroke of the pen: leave Irish as a subject, by all means, but do not let the method be as rigid as it had been for the last 30 or 40 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the terms of the motion.  I think a referendum would not be helpful. The motion in general is running away from what I regard as the fundamental point of view, that is, whether or not the people of Ireland honestly desire to revive the Irish language.</P>
      <P>The expressions of opinion voiced here so far to-night seem to have endeavoured to reconcile what I would regard as the irreconcilables.  As Deputy Corish said, and I think quite rightly, there is a feeling generally amongst the majority in this House that the Deputies would want a revival of Irish.  On the other hand, the view was expressed that if a referendum were held the results would show a majority against compulsory measures in the schools.  If you genuinely want to revive Irish as the spoken language you must accept a degree of compulsion just as if you want to educate your children in Mathematics, Physics or English or anything else you must accept some degree of compulsion.  You must ensure that if you hold examinations certain standards will be set and that the students who sit for the examinations will either pass or fail on certain standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the question this House will have to decide for itself some day is whether or not we honestly believe that Irish can be revived as the spoken language.  I am not an Irish speaker.  Any Irish I know was learned long after I left school.  I learned it by voluntary means, as is suggested in the latter part of this motion.  Honestly, however, I do not believe that any voluntary means, of <Col N="845" /> themselves, will now revive Irish as the spoken language, as I understand that term.  We must accept some degree of compulsion.  If you do not accept that Irish must be taught compulsorily, even if it is only after the primary school stage, there is not hope whatever that Irish will ever become the spoken language.</P>
    <P>I quite agree with the motion where it says that the methods adopted up to now have failed to achieve the ideal of the leaders of the various national movements up to 1922.  We should not forget that the Irish spoken in those days, the Irish learned in prison camps and elsewhere and the Irish learned in voluntary societies such as the Gaelic League, was largely because of a period of tremendous national emotionalism and upswing that could not possibly hope to survive.  Any efforts that hoped to continue on that tremendous upswing of nationalism were bound to fail.</P>
    <P>The spirit of such a time does not last for ever.  It rises and flourishes and the people who are part of it achieve a remarkable objective because they are impelled by that spirit of emotionalism and nationalism. The next generation inevitably suffers a reaction.  Other methods must be adopted besides relying on that enthusiastic patriotism and emotionalism because the cause of such emotionalism is bound to die or languish. Therefore, those who desire Irish to be spoken to any extent must accept some degree of compulsion and some degree of jurisdiction and direction from the State.  To consider that it can be done by voluntary means or by patriotic desire is to turn away from the problem.</P>
    <P>The fundamental language is the language of the home.  The language of the home is the language through which the young child, at least, should be taught at school.  I do not agree with those who say that the child cannot learn a second language.  My experience as a parent is that even the youngest child has a remarkable capacity for absorbing two and possibly three languages.  It is amazing what the young mind can absorb.  It is thereafter that the confusion starts. <Col N="846" /> It is essential, for that reason, that the child's younger years are confined to learning the school subjects through the medium of the home language. Possibly, from ten years of age onwards, a child could or should learn Irish as a subject and then when it comes to secondary or higher education it should be possible to teach the pupil through Irish.  Therefore, I am not constrained to support the terms of the motion.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given an indication that he feels that the time has come (1) when a general stocktaking is more than due on what we have not achieved, with the best wish in the world, and (2) perhaps to re-think some of the ideas and ideals on which the Irish language movement was founded.  One very encouraging development in recent years has been the establishment of schools such as Scoil na Leanbh in Ring and Scoil Ide in Foynes, County Limerick.  More such schools could be established. Every year, these schools receive more applications from potential pupils than they can take.  That is an indication that amongst the secondary standards and upwards there is a desire to learn the language by voluntary means.</P>
    <P>If we concentrate on building more such schools and making it possible not so much for the fairly well-to-do or the well-to-do to attend them, or those who aspire to be or actually are teachers, but the ordinary man's son or daughter, it would be a very worthwhile objective indeed.  In the early years, in the infant and early primary school years, I am bound to advocate, from my experience not as a psychologist or a psychiatrist but just as a parent, that the language of the home be the language in which the child should be taught.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne concluded his contribution with a quotation from Thomas Davis with a rather depressing outlook on the possibility of introducing the teaching of Irish into the schools in the Eastern part of the country.  What he did not say was that that quotation was written one hundred years ago and he did not complete the quotation.  I cannot complete it but</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="847" /> I think in the Essay it went on to this effect: &ldquo;But, in one hundred years' time, I could envisage Irish being taught everywhere in the country,&rdquo; which makes quite a different proposition of the statement in the Essay.</P>
    <P>Here is where I stand as regards the Irish language.  I believe that every Irish child should be taught to speak Irish.  I would ask those who have argued along that line but against compulsion how can a child learn to love a language unless it knows some of the language and how can it know some of the language unless to some extent the teaching of it is essential?</P>
    <P>The motion is so worded as to indicate an anxiety on the part of the sponsors in regard to what they consider to be the failure of past and present methods to achieve the objective of making Irish the spoken language of the people.  This implicit acceptance by the sponsors of the motion distinguishes them from those others who habitually use the word &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;comsory&rdquo; in relation to Irish as catch cries, catch cries from that section of our people who never accepted the idea of restoring the Irish language&mdash; indeed, who possibly never accepted the idea of an independent nation&mdash; that section who are opposed to Irish and call for the abolition of compulsory Irish.  I believe that if they were shown in their true colours it would be seen that what they are calling for is the abandonment of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Part of their campaign against the Irish language is to befog the issue, confusing compulsory teaching of Irish with compulsory teaching of other subjects through Irish.  I think I should state the position about compulsion and the teaching through Irish of other subjects.  Outside of the Gaeltacht, in the national schools, for many years it has been the policy of the Department of Education to have the children in the infant classes and the first classes brought as rapidly as possible to a knowledge of Irish so that the work in those classes could be done through Irish.</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary to say, for <Col N="848" /> those who do not know the working of a school, that the work done in the infant class and in the first class does not involve the teaching of specific subjects except a little informal arithmetic and if the manager of the school wishes, the teaching of English, but the type of work done is not the teaching of subjects.  The work done in those infant classes is merely to familiarise the children with school.  In the higher classes of the national schools, the medium of instruction in the various subjects is left to the teacher, that is, of course, except the teaching of Irish, which is done through Irish and the teaching of English which must be done through English.</P>
    <P>That is the extent of compulsory teaching through Irish.  There is no teaching of other subjects in a formal way through Irish, except where the teacher selects Irish as a medium of instruction.  There is, I know, a widespread idea that Irish is a compulsory medium in the primary schools but that idea is absurd.  To a great extent, I think it might be due to the imaginings of people who have not been able to ascertain the facts. In regard to secondary schools, they are independent institutions and I suppose the best evidence that they are not compelled to teach through Irish is the fact that the majority of them do not teach other subjects through Irish.  In vocational schools, the medium of instruction in any particular subject is a matter for the local vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>While the teaching of subjects through Irish is not compulsory, such teaching is available and I believe this should be so.  Moreover, it is the policy of the Department, where the circumstances are propitious, to encourage more teaching through the medium of Irish.  In fact, there is an established system of encouraging teaching through the medium of Irish under suitable conditions.  The idea of teaching through the medium of Irish in suitable conditions is that when the teacher is capable of doing so, and the pupils can benefit by being so taught, teaching through Irish is regarded as a good method of improving their <Col N="849" /> fluency.  It is calculated also to give a respect for the language as an instrument of intellectual communication.</P>
    <P>While, therefore, there is no compulsion to teach through Irish&mdash;and I should like to repeat that&mdash;I would say that it may have happened on occasion, through an excess of zeal, combined with a lack of due prudence, that an attempt was made to teach children through Irish when, because the teacher was not fully capable of doing so, and because the children could not benefit from doing so, the children did not adequately benefit from the instruction.  If there were such cases, they were instances of enthusiasm which more or less defeated their own purpose and the purpose, I should like to say again, was the attainment of extra fluency by those who already have enough Irish to benefit from instruction through Irish.</P>
    <P>My own view, which I have stated publicly on several occasions recently, is that no effort should be spared to achieve a situation in which the children have a good degree of fluency in Irish.  The best judge of our method to achieve this fluency is, in my opinion, the good teacher.  Among the steps I have taken recently has been the issuing this week of a revised circular on inspection.  Heretofore, a teacher's Irish work was examined in compartments&mdash;written Irish and oral Irish.  In future, the inspector will judge the teacher's Irish teaching as a whole and in making his assessment, will be asked to pay special regard to the teacher's efforts to achieve fluency in the children.  That is the position of teaching through Irish.</P>
    <P>As far as my Department is concerned, it is to be done as an assistance to promoting oral fluency, to be carried out where the teacher is capable of doing so and where the children can benefit.  The teaching of Irish itself as a subject should be essential&mdash;it has to be essential&mdash;and if this is what people mean when they label it &ldquo;compulsory&rdquo;, that is fair enough.  It is compulsory in that sense.  But if they attach the implication that other subjects are not compulsory, then that is not fair.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="850" /> Irish is not the only subject on which the Department of Education insists in the schools.  Arithmetic, English, history, geography and singing are compulsory in the primary schools.  Mathematics, history and at least three other subjects are compulsory in the secondary school curriculum up to Intermediate stage. Attendance at school is compulsory up to 14 years of age.  There seems to be no objection to compulsion in these matters.  In fact, the last proposal put before the House by the sponsors of this motion was to compel parents to keep their children at school up to 15 years of age, so it would almost seem that compulsion is still all right, except when it is associated with Irish.</P>
    <P>That seems to bring me to a crossroads with other people who are interested in Irish.  I think they must regard Irish as not important enough to be compulsory.  They must regard Irish as not being useful enough to be made essential in the schools.  In my view Irish children have a right to a knowledge of Irish even if it had no utility value whatever.  According to this utility test, one could say that history has no utility value but I doubt if there is any nation in the world which would have their history as an optional subject in the schools. I should like to say on this that I am not prepared to stand over reducing Irish to a hobby subject.</P>
    <P>I think children must have Irish and if they have to have any education it has to be essential.  The main argument used by the sponsors of the motion is based on the assumption that the movement to revive the language has failed.  Admittedly, it has not attained what was thought possible in the golden days of 40 years ago but I think that anyone who has eyes to see will acknowledge that great progress has been made since then.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish asked for statistics. This type of achievement is not measureable by statistics I think.  I should like to give an instance of advance.  I know that the I.N.T.O. will not feel it a breach of confidence if I tell the House that a recent conference in my Department between <Col N="851" /> the Executive of the I.N.T.O. and officers of my Department was carried out, I understand, completely through the medium of Irish.  Conferences between the I.N.T.O. and my officials are not a matter of murmuring sweet nothings to one another.  They are hard-hitting, wide ranging debates. They have to be sharp, alert and the reaction has to be quick.  If these people did not find Irish a natural medium, they would have broken away from it in the heat of the moment or during the stress of argument.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that that position is a far cry from the position in 1922.  It is an advance.  At that time the teachers had no Irish and neither had the officials of my Department. When you consider that the average teaching life is 45 years we could not expect the teaching body to be 100 per cent. fully qualified in Irish, yet.  We should not be impatient to see results because if you work it out according to the life span of teachers and new ones coming in to service, we should not, to use an aeronautical term, expect the movement to have the momentum to lift it off the ground until 1965.</P>

      <P>While I am on this idea of the prolonged policy going back more than 40 years in the Irish language, I think I suspect the same idea is in Dr. Browne's last speech. Speaking as reported at Column 547, Volume 179 of the Official Report he said:</P>
      <P>I do not believe that it is possible to revive the language in our present circumstances as the vernacular of the people.  I think the only thing that can be done is, possibly, to preserve it and perhaps extend it gradually in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He subconsciously feels that this movement will expand.  The only difference is that I am prepared to do it <Col N="852" /> now but he is leaving it to the next generation&mdash;the future.</P>
    <P>Since Deputy McQuillan did interrupt, we must remember that there have been a lot of difficulties since 1922, not the least of those difficulties being the continuous barrage of criticism levelled against the work done in the schools and also the banshee wails of defeatism which arise so often.  To those guilty of this kind of obstruction I appeal to desist from this particular form of discouragement and give the teachers a chance to do the work.</P>

      <P>Let me put it this way. You say you teach Irish in the schools and that is the reason why they do not talk Irish and that if Irish is not taught in the schools they will speak it.  I cannot follow that argument at all.  They cannot speak the language without being taught it.  It is time for Irishmen to be a bit more vigorous about their national aims.  We cannot continue for ever saying that somebody must do it.  It is the duty of each individual to do it.</P>

Though certain great advances <Col N="854" /> have been made, there is, I know, no room for complacency about the question of the Irish language.  The problem of the moment, as Deputy Russell said, is the appraisal of what has been done so far and how we can improve on that and on the methods.</P>
      <P>There is a Commission sitting at present studying these methods and we hope to have a report in a couple of months.  In the meantime, I have a special advisory committee in my Department and we have initiated between the Department and the Irish National Teachers' Organisation consultations with a view to improving the present methods and finding new ways towards accelerating progress.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 77 together.</P>

    <P>The total productive area held by the Forestry Division of my Department for forestry purposes in the Woodford district is 3,349 acres, of which a total of 3,005 acres has been planted to date.  Of the balance not yet planted, only two small separate plots in Derrylahan townland, comprising in all about 12 acres, are considered to be of arable quality.  They were included in lands transferred from the Land Commission many years <Col N="728" /> ago and form an integral part of the property.  For many years they were let to a former estate employee.  When the need for this arrangement ceased it was decided to plant them but they were let in the ordinary way for a further period pending arrangements for planting.</P>
    <P>It would not be practicable to dispose of them.</P>
