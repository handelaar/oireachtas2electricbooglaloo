      <P>The question of the desirability or otherwise of limiting by regulation the amount of fluorine in food in this country is under consideration by the Food Advisory Committee at present.</P>
      <P>I should say that while some countries have limited by regulation the amount of fluorine which may be present in certain foods, there is no uniformity on the question.  For example, the British Fluorine in Food Regulations, 1959, prescribe limits as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether, having regard to the fact that county managers are proposing new scales for dispensary <Col N="1011" /> doctors and county surgeons, he will initiate discussions with representatives of the county physicians with a view to revising their scales also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the revision of salary scales for officers of health authorities is a matter for those authorities in the first instance and it would not be proper for me to initiate discussions with representatives of the county physicians regarding this matter, but there is nothing to prevent a county physician from discussing the revision of his own salary with his own health authority.  Similarly, since this is a matter which affects them in common I would say that two or more county physicians might likewise discuss it in joint meeting with representatives of their respective health authorities.  It is, of course, also within the competence of county physicians as a class to form themselves into a body and, having got the necessary Order from the Minister for Industry and Commerce under Section 6 of the Trade Union Act, 1941, to appoint representatives to discuss salary and conditions with the appropriate representatives of the health authorities as a whole.</P>
      <P>I would be prepared to consider sympathetically any proposals resulting from meetings such as I have described and to sanction such proposals provided they have the consent of the health authority concerned and provided they are reasonable and are in conformity with one another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say that if any county physician, entitled under the terms of his appointment to conduct a private general practice, were prepared to abandon his right to such practice and accept whole-time appointment from the health authority in the sense that county surgeons are whole-time, I, as Minister for Health, would welcome the change and would be prepared to approve an appropriate adjustment in salary proposed to me by the health authority.  Such adjustment could, of course, in such circumstances apply only from a future date, but this would not preclude adjustment of salary in the interim period on the <Col N="1012" /> basis of his present conditions with retrospective effect to 1st August last, which is the date from which other salary adjustments in the local service have been proposed.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will indicate the social welfare benefit or benefits involved and furnish me with particulars of the nature of the complaints I will have full enquiries made in the matter.</P>
      <P>I should, however, say that, if the question refers to the payment of disability benefit, I am satisfied that benefit is being paid regularly and promptly.</P>
      <P>There are 13 cases in this area where disability benefit is paid at fortnightly intervals and 2 cases at monthly intervals. This arrangement is of long standing.  It may be that in some cases weekly payments would now be more acceptable and if the complaints have been made for this reason it can be arranged to make weekly payments on request from the claimants concerned.</P>

    <P>The bulk of the tax shown as outstanding represents protective assessments and cases under appeal or inquiry.  The tax assessed remains as tax outstanding until the amount is either paid or discharged or written-off as irrecoverable.  Of the total of £13,219,826 outstanding at the 1st June, 1960, on foot of Income Tax, Sur-tax and Corporation Profits Tax it is estimated that only £3,500,000 will eventually be established to be payable.</P>
    <P>*Note: Particulars of Income Tax outstanding are compiled as at the 1st June each year, and the corresponding dates for Income Tax outstanding are, therefore 1st June, 1959 and 1st June, 1960, respectively.</P>

      <P>No agreement has been made under Article 43 of the <Col N="1018" /> Charter of the United Nations concerning the armed forces provided by Ireland in the Congo.</P>
      <P>I should perhaps explain that Article 43 of the Charter has not been implemented because of the failure of the Security Council to agree on its implementation.  The Deputy will be aware that this part of the Charter provided for a Military Staff Committee, which, under Article 47, would &ldquo;advise and assist the Security Council on all questions relating to the Security Council's military requirements for the maintenance of international peace and security, the employment and command of forces placed at its disposal, the regulation of armaments and possible disarmament.&rdquo;  This Committee met in February, 1946, and produced a report in April, 1947, containing certain recommendations on the armed forces to be placed at the disposal of the United Nations under Chapter VII of the Charter.  The report was not, however, approved by the Security Council due to a divergence of opinion among the permanent members.</P>
      <P>The Irish contingent in the Congo has been made available to the United Nations, in conformity with our own legislation, in answer to a request addressed to the Government by the Secretary-General under the Security Council resolution of 14th July which authorised the Secretary-General &ldquo;to take the necessary steps, in consultation with the Government of the Republic of the Congo, to provide the Government with such military assistance as may be necessary, until, through the efforts of the Congolese Government with the technical assistance of the United Nations, the National Security Forces may be able in the opinion of the Government to meet fully their tasks.&rdquo;  This request and the circumstances in which it was addressed to the Government were, of course, explained in the debates which took place in Dáil Éireann on 20th July in connection with the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1960.</P>

      <P>Statistics of prosecutions for traffic offences are compiled on an annual basis up to 30th September of each year and are included in the annual Crime Reports of the Commissioner, Garda Síochána, which are laid on the Table of both Houses. They include the number of prosecutions and convictions for driving or attempting to drive while drunk but not the number of sentences of imprisonment, and the latter figure could now be ascertained only by means of an elaborate and expensive inquiry.</P>
      <P>The figures for the year ending 30th September, 1960, will not be available for some time yet&mdash;probably a few months.  The figures for the years ending 30th September, 1958, and 1959 are as follows: 1958&mdash;Number proceeded against, 349; Number convicted, 244.  1959&mdash;Number proceeded against, 479; Number convicted, 316.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be administratively possible for the Minister to ask the Garda to prepare for his information a return showing the total number of prosecutions under the Road Traffic Acts not only in the case <Col N="1023" /> of the driver charged with being in control of a mechanically propelled vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating drink but also a supplementary record of those cases where the Garda believe that while the driver was not technically under the influence of drink, the consumption of drink by the driver had contributed to the occurrence of the accident?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that would be an unreasonable request to make to the Garda.  It would require a tremendous amount of research and it is very doubtful if they could give accurate information on such a subject. For instance, if the court has somebody brought before it on a charge of drunken driving and he is found guilty, that ends the matter as far as the Garda is concerned, and it is not their business to find out how much drink the individual took before the charge was brought.  I do not believe they could even find that out if they tried.  With regard to the other information, it might be possible with a tremendous amount of research to get it but, as I mentioned in reply to the question, we can only give statistics for the actual convictions because we are sure they have taken place.  I do not think it would be reasonable to ask the Garda to deal with the other matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting there should be a retrospective inquiry.  I quite agree that would be virtually impossible.  But would the Minister consider asking the Commissioner hereafter to require Garda who are conducting proceedings as a result of road accidents to give, for the Minister's confidential information, if necessary, their view as to whether the consumption of alcoholic drink by the driver had or had not contributed to the accident, leaving questions of convictions and statistical record to the verdict of the court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>A decision to prohibit the importation of fireworks, except for properly organised displays, was taken by the Minister for Justice towards the end of the year 1948, after the country had experienced some <Col N="1025" /> three years of unrestricted importation. The decision was taken as a result of a growing and wellfounded volume of complaint about the misuse of fireworks.  They were let off in the streets, in buses and in crowded buildings such as theatres.  They were even pushed through letter-boxes to explode in people's hallways.  I have no doubt that if they were allowed in indiscriminately now, we should have the same position all over again.  I do not propose to alter the present rule but I am bringing to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners the suggestion in the question that fireworks are being brought in illegally.</P>

      <P>In November, 1959, and on a number of subsequent occasions, representatives of mines in the Arigna coalfield were invited to formulate jointly a project under the Technical Assistance Scheme to investigate the utilisation of lower grade <Col N="1028" /> coals in the Arigna coalfield.  Examination of this proposal in consultation with the mine owners made it clear that the investigation could most usefully be undertaken in conjunction with the programme of exploration of the Arigna coalfield at present being carried out by the Geological Survey of the Department of Industry and Commerce as part of a Technical Assistance Scheme.  The first step, which is now in progress, is to establish the extent and quantity of coal deposits falling within potentially usable specifications. The best lines of investigation into (a) combustion and (b) cleaning are being explored in the meantime and some progress is being made, but until the necessary information about the extent and quality of the deposits is available full scale technical investigations cannot be launched.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state on what grounds he has now approved as having been validly made the appointment of rate collectors purported to have been made at the meeting of the South Tipperary County Council on the 7th June last; and whether in view of the charge <Col N="1037" /> made by a member that by forcible and unlawful detention he was prevented from attending the meeting, and the Minister's assurance given in the Dáil on the 14th June that he would not make a decision until the full facts had been made known to him, he will state what the full facts are, the source from which the information has been obtained, and why he has taken a decision in the matter before the charge of forcible and unlawful detention has been disposed of by the Courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have approved the appointments of the three rate collectors made by the Tipperary (S.R.) Council at their meeting of the 7th June, 1960, on the grounds that the appointments were validly made by resolution of the Council.</P>
      <P>In regard to the alleged prevention of a member of the Council from attending the Council meeting of the 7th June the facts are that two persons are charged with conspiracy to effect an unlawful purpose in that connection. None of the three persons appointed by the Council at the meeting in question is charged with any offence.</P>
      <P>I took the decision to approve the appointments in view of the fact that they had been validly made, that the collection of the rates in the districts in question had become a matter of urgency and that there were no adequate grounds for refusing to sanction the appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that at least one of the appointments made on the 7th June was made by the casting vote of the chairman and in the circumstances in which, as the Minister says himself, a charge is brought against certain persons that one member of the county council was prevented from being present does the Minister think that public decorum would not dictate that the county council even of that time, assuming that no local election had taken place in the meantime, would almost be required by public interest to review <Col N="1038" /> the circumstances in the light of the charge made and to rescind the motion of appointment, or any or all of the appointments, made on the 7th for the purpose of examining the situation? Further, does the Minister deny that had the old council continued they would have had power to reconsider the matter, to rescind the motion made on the 7th and, if necessary, to review the matter again and to make other appointments, if necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to the council is this, irrespective of whether it is the previous council or the recently elected council.  Having made the appointments on the 7th June and having forwarded those proposals to me after their resolution, they or their successors were not empowered thereafter to rescind that motion.  Therefore, it remained for me to do one of two things: either to refuse to sanction or to sanction. Accepting the position that the decision was valid on the 7th, in so far as the resolution submitted to me was concerned, I then had the situation that.  I either sanctioned those proposals or rejected them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of the submission of the proposal the county manager who was charged with the duty in regard to all proposed appointees certified to my Department that all reasonable steps were taken&mdash;this was by letter of the 1st of July&mdash;to ascertain that the applicants for the three posts possessed the qualifications as to character, age and education and were otherwise suitable.  That was an indication&mdash;it is the normal indication in all such cases as these&mdash;submitted on the 1st July to my Department.  At a later date in the month of August, a further letter was received inquiring whether or not we were proceeding with these appointments, again from the local authority and the manager who did not in any way retract or withdraw his certification as to the steps he had taken in June as to the character, age, qualifications and other attributes of eligibility of these candidates.  Nothing in the reports that I have received since then indicates that, in any way, any one of the three <Col N="1039" /> proposed candidates is unfitted for the posts to which they have now been appointed.</P>
    <P>That being the position up to the moment, I was then placed in the situation that in fact these candidates have certain rights in this matter and they could by way of mandamus proceedings bring the Minister for Local Government to the point where he had to make a decision.  That naturally, as the House may be aware, did not arise, but what did arise was that the position was there to be rejected or accepted.  The facts are that the proposition was validly made by the council on the 7th June, the three persons proposed to be appointed had in no way been shown to be unfit for the positions and I, therefore, sanctioned those three appointments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise, while considering the protection of himself and the manager&mdash; from a certain point of view&mdash;the position in which he is putting this Dáil? He is telling us here in reply to this question or in reply to just the one point that I shall dwell on, that if on an occasion upon which a county council is making an appointment one, two or more members of the council are forcibly and illegally prevented from being present&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is telling the Dáil in the face of certain circumstances that because a vote was taken on the 7th June, that the circumstances that people were forcibly prevented from attending there does not matter and that on any future occasion upon which appointments are being made by a public body such as the county council, kidnapping may go on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and he now indicates that the appointment is valid and that a Government Department <Col N="1040" /> will stand over the validity of the appointment.  That is the question I put to the Minister that overrides any of the additional questions that require to be put in this matter.  Again I ask him to say positively that a county council making an appointment in a <i>bona fide</i> way and finding out afterwards that members of its body were forcibly and illegally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is telling the Dáil to its face that in circumstances in which a person was forcibly removed or otherwise prevented from being there when the council cast its vote, the council are prevented from reviewing that matter in all the circumstances of the time and he says that as a Minister discharging his public duties to everybody, he would be liable to losses of one kind or another if he did not say that these men were legally appointed and if he did not give them rights.  I submit to the Minister that he is telling us something which this Dáil cannot accept.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister a question?  The Minister explained his attitude in regard to the allegation of kidnapping and forcible detention.  He said it was no concern of the members who made the selection of the rate collectors.  I should like to ask him what his attitude would be if there was an allegation made, and it was subsequently proved, that all but the quorum necessary to make the selection were forcibly detained by kidnapping?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>When the latter situation arises, if it should happen while I am still in the responsible position in which I am now, I shall try to deal with it to the best of my ability.  In the meantime should I not indicate to the House that what Deputy Corish has understood me to say is not what I answered in reply to the question? General Mulcahy has given the House to understand, or it is being held by the House, while a case is still untried <Col N="1041" /> in regard to alleged kidnapping, that it is already a fact that the kidnapping did take place.  I submit that the whole question is <i>sub judice</i> and is not subject to discussion in this House.  Over and above that let me again say explicitly that I am dealing with the situation as I find it&mdash;that the decision of the council was validly made on the 7th June&mdash;and further, in regard to the three proposed appointees, the three appointees of today, I am presuming, as is the law of the land, that they are innocent of any complicity in the case now before the court.  I think I am right in presuming them to be innocent until they are proved guilty of some offence and it is on that basis I have regarded them as suitable and as such have appointed them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not now saying that, having made these appointments on the 7th June and then having seen or received reports that have been presented in the court, the county council had no power, assembling itself again, to rescind the making of these appointments for the purpose of waiting until the circumstances and the facts were known and made clear?  Is the Minister not now saying this: That the county council in South Tipperary after the 7th June, having heard allegations about something that happened that prevented a member from being there, is by present law, as he reads it, prevented from meeting, reviewing the matter and rescinding that resolution?  Is it not a fact that there was a rescinding of the resolution although it was by a subsequently elected county council?  But the county council is a continuing body and what he is saying is, apart from the elections, that the county council as it existed on the 7th June had no legal power of reviewing this decision in spite of information that is being brought forward.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister is it not a howling public scandal that the Minister for Local Government, having given his word in this House that he would keep the question <Col N="1042" /> of sanction under review until he was satisfied as to whether there had been any improper kidnapping or detention of the member concerned, when two men are before the courts charged with that very crime to which he referred when he gave the undertaking and when the matter is in the process of investigation, has intervened to give his sanction before these two men have been called on to answer to the court for the very offence he said he would keep under consideration and withhold sanction until it had been clarified?

I am quite satisfied that all the associated facts in regard to this matter are known to me as well as they can be known to anybody and none of the people concerned in these appointments has proved himself by reason of any association with the matter to be in any way unfit.</P>

    <Title>Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Bill, 1959&mdash;Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Before subsection (2) to insert the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;( )  A health authority shall not be required to add fluorine to a water supply unless and until a supply of pure water not containing fluorine shall be readily available at no extra cost to all persons residing in the area supplied with the water to which it is proposed to add fluorine.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the House adjourned consideration of this amendment last week I had pointed out that in countries where fluoridation of public water supplies had been introduced it was found necessary for several food processing firms to instal de-fluoridation equipment and I asked the Minister if he had considered this matter and if he would give us figures as to the cost of de-fluoridation and the capital cost of installing the necessary equipment.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not replied to that aspect of the matter which is so relevant to this amendment.  I now wish to return to a very basic principle in relation to the right of the people not to have enforced medication, and I feel if the Minister wishes to provide fluoridated water for one section of the community, nobody would object to his so doing if at the same time he would ensure for those who did not wish to take fluoride in their water supplies a supply of water free of that substance or with an amount of fluoride far below the amount he proposes to add under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it pertinent to this question for the House to consider how the City of New York treated this matter of fluoridation of water supply.  I have <Col N="1050" /> a report which deals with the position of the City of New York Department of Water Supply, Gas and Electricity, dated April, 1956.  It begins:</P>
    <P>Under the City Charter, the Commissioner of the Department of Water Supply, Gas and Electricity is charged with the responsibility of maintaining the purity and wholesomeness of the city water supply. The matter of purity has a direct bearing on the people, and involves the determination and evaluation of the tolerance of suspect, hazardous or toxic substances which may, in some manner, gain access to the water supply.  Fluoride is a toxic substance.</P>
    <P>The department has extensive laboratories staffed by reputable scientists and competent sanitary engineers, with a massive library in which is contained over five thousand references on the subject of the fluorides alone.  We have continued to study and evaluate the effect of toxic substances as related to water supply.  The matter of fluorides has been under our scrutiny for over 20 years.</P>
    <P>The addition of fluorides to the water supplies is not coupled with the concern of maintaining or improving the quality of the water or making it safe.  No one has suggested that dental caries is a waterborne disease or that water is a cause of dental decay.  No satisfactory reason has ever been advanced to show why everyone in a community must be compelled to risk life-long extraordinary exposure to the toxic action of fluorides, particularly when safer, more effective and more economical ways of administering fluorides for caries reduction in children's teeth have been pointed out and are available.</P>
    <P>Again, I must emphasise that the main point of my amendment is to ensure that here we do not compel anybody to involve himself or those under his care in the lifelong consumption of the toxic substance of fluoride.  No matter what the cost may be of providing a supply of water without fluoride, I feel if we are going to take <Col N="1051" /> away from the people something they have at the moment, we should provide them with a reasonable alternative which will be safe.  I feel quite sure that the majority of the people will not give a hoot whether the supply of water they get is fluoridated or not, but there will be individuals&mdash;and I believe a considerable number&mdash;who will take a very strong exception to fluoridation on medical and moral grounds.  I believe we will be taking a most retrograde step if we impose on all the people who have piped water the necessity to consume fluoride.</P>
    <P>The New York City Commissioner went on:</P>
    <P>Our concern is primarily with the safety of the water supplies for each and every individual of our entire population of 8,000,000 people throughout the city.</P>
    <P>I, as well, feel that we are obliged to ensure that there is a safe water supply for each and every individual in this country, and we can only do that by the adoption of this amendment. If you believe that, you must accept my amendment no matter what the cost, you must ensure that the rights of the individual are maintained by giving each one the supply of water he requires.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is prepared to give grants for the sinking of wells, or to allow each local authority to permit the erection of a pump in every garden, then I think that would meet my amendment.  I am not asking that there be a supply of pure water everywhere, but that such a supply will be easily and readily available, at no extra cost, to every individual who does not want to consume water which has been artificially fluoridated.  All the amendment seeks is a reasonable alternative&mdash;that people who do not wish to consume fluoridated water be, at least, provided with flasks of water or beakers of it provided at their hall doors.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested on this amendment that it was quite clear it was not seriously intended.  It is quite seriously intended.  It is well known <Col N="1052" /> that 50 per cent. of the farms in this country now have a piped water supply, free of artificial fluoride content. By this Bill the Minister seeks to take that away from them&mdash;a facility which our modern civilisation has given them&mdash;a supply of water free from this toxic substance.  As far as the Almighty has had any hand in it, I believe our natural water in this country contains a very small percentage of fluoride&mdash;infinitesimal by comparison with the one part fluoride to one million parts water which the Minister seeks to impose.</P>
    <P>The amount of fluoride sought to be added by the Bill looks very small, but even the experts who are in favour of fluoridation agree that it may have a cumulative effect, building up in the system over the years.  I think the necessity for a supply of water without artificially added fluoride is emphasised by the experience of several water authorities in America whose cases I cited last week.  Several authorities have rejected fluoride, having had it for some time, because they found it was having a corrosive effect on the pipes and that the building up of the fluoride at some points in the gridwork meant an uneven distribution of fluoride.</P>
    <P>I would refer again to the report of the New York Committee on the matter.  It points out:</P>
    <P>The problem of managing the control of dosage of fluoride chemical to obtain uniformity throughout a grid-work of more than 5,000 miles of pipe and tunnels involving different sources and pressure gradients as in the New York system is formidable.  None of those who have made statements to the contrary have ever had the experience nor do they possess knowledge of what the exact result would be.  Our concern and responsibility in the department is to provide the people of our City with a dependable supply of the purest and safest water possible.  No one can guarantee similar safety to all the people in the City of New York under a programme using the water supply as a fluoride vehicle.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> Unfortunately, the forum on the subject of fluoridation is not as open as it should be even among professions. There has been too much of emotion, blind following and lack of objective thinking by too many people on both sides of the question.</P>
    <P>The people of the City of New York are entitled to know the risks they are being asked to assume before endorsing a programme involving so many questions yet unanswered.</P>
    <P>If those of us who are opposed to this Bill need any authority, a statement of that kind coming from a body which has spent 20 years in research on fluorine is sufficient authority for us.  The New York Committee said that their concern and responsibility was to provide a dependable supply of water.  Our concern and responsibility in this Oireachtas should be to provide the people of our country with a dependable supply of the purest and safest water possible.</P>
    <P>If it be that there is a body of opinion that we have a right to use our present piped supply of water for the purpose of providing fluorine, I would urge that they should at least provide those who want it with a supply of water which would not have been tampered with.  We have at the moment a relatively dependable and safe supply of piped water for 50 per cent. of our people.  We ought to maintain that for those who want it no matter what the advantages may be in relation to the intake of fluorine through water supplies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister does not propose saying anything, I just want to be very brief on this amendment.  I appreciate the difficulties which the Minister envisaged of putting an amendment of this sort into effect.  I would ask him to treat the idea contained in the amendment as a serious matter.  The Minister has had his way as far as this Bill goes by having the Bill carried through the Second Stage and having certain amendments on Committee Stage defeated so as to ensure that the Bill will be mandatory in character when <Col N="1054" /> the regulations under it have been made by him.  Having had his way on that point, I would ask him at this stage to give very serious and sympathetic consideration to the many people throughout this city and the country as a whole who feel deeply on this subject, who feel that they should not be forced by Ministerial decree to drink fluoridated water.  If the Minister does not see his way to accept this amendment either in the letter or in the spirit, I would ask him to give very serious consideration to some alternative means of meeting the point of view which has been put forward by Deputy Ryan on this amendment.</P>
      <P>There are various aspects from which this can be considered.  The Minister, probably, has thought of some of them himself.  I should like to know, for example, is it possible once fluorine has been added to a water supply to extract it by any process. There is a large number of food and drink manufacturers who will be affected by this provision who may prefer to give the public their commodities without the addition of fluorine to the water used in their manufacture.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell the House, and to use this amendment as the occasion, whether or not it is possible for such manufacturers&mdash;beer manufacturers, for example; there are various kinds that the Minister will think of himself&mdash;to treat the water in such a manner as to extract the fluoride from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the Minister's intention, I take it, to ensure that every article of diet, everything that is eaten and drunk, in this city, should contain fluorine but that, possibly, will be the effect of carrying this legislation to its logical conclusion as a result of the mandatory manner in which it is being dealt with.  I would ask the Minister to let the House have some information as to whether or not it is possible to extract fluorine once it has been added.  If it is not possible, I would again ask the Minister, in the spirit of the amendment moved by Deputy Ryan, will he consider making provision <Col N="1055" /> so that manufacturers who make food or drink for sale to the public out of water to which fluorine has been added will put some type of label on their product so that the public may know that it contains in part, be it big or small, fluoridated water as against water which has not had fluorine added to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If any evidence is needed to condemn this Bill surely it is the Minister's manner of treating this House.  He is informing us he is introducing a Bill to fluoridate the public water supply.  At the same time he cannot give us any indication, so that we can judge the merits or demerits of the Bill, as to the cost of taking fluorine out of the water.  As I have pointed out, of the other countries which have introduced fluoridation some of them have kept it on but most of those which introduced it rejected it later on because they found the cost of de-fluoridation was prohibitive. There are several food processing firms in this country who are providing very useful employment here in supplying goods for the home market, in the first instance, and secondly, for the export market.  It is most important that we should encourage these industries.  There are certain States in America which prescribe the fluorine content of foodstuffs and some of our foods which have been processed here with fluoridated water supplies will be in jeopardy and may not be allowed into the Amercian market.  If they are on the American market already they may be excluded and if they are not on it they have very little hope of getting on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister obviously does not give a hoot as to the difficulties of these manufacturers.  It may well be that if his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has any objection to it another Bill will be introduced here and we will be asked to pay the cost of providing the machinery for de-fluoridation.  It is appalling that the public health department <Col N="1057" /> of this State should have such a poor brief for the Minister that he is not able to give the cost to the House.  It is either that or the Minister knows the cost and does not want to give it. The figures given by the Minister already as to the annual cost of fluoridation in Dublin are entirely wrong. He based the figures on the population of Dublin city but the Dublin Corporation water supply also supplies Dún Laoghaire and Dublin county and, when all that is added, you will find the bill will be considerably more.  No serious consideration has been given by the Minister (a) to the cost of fluoridation and (b) to the cost of defluoridation.</P>
    <P>If there is any person who wants to have a drink of water without fluorine he ought to be able to defluoridate the water.  Obviously, it would be an uneconomic proposition for the individual to do it, but the Minister is imposing that obligation on him.  There are many religious sects which have very strong objection to this form of mass medication, but we do not need to rely upon any particular religious sect to find authority for the natural law.  The natural law provides that a man has a right and an absolute right to the integrity of his person.  It is a right which may be qualified only in one way and that is when that man's physical condition is a danger to the rest of the community. A bad tooth is not a danger to the rest of the community.  You could live all your life with a person who had a mouthful of mouldy teeth and you would not catch a bad tooth from him.  If there is even one person in our State who objects to mass medication, we believe he has a natural right to the integrity of his person.</P>
    <P>The Minister has accused me of misquoting a high authority on moral law.  It was the Minister, in the first instance, who challenged us on this side of the House to produce any authority for our arguments regarding the ethical objections to fluorine.  It is no answer for him to accuse myself or anybody else of trotting out these misquotations of what the late Holy Father said.  However, it is the Minister who asked for it and he will get it. <Col N="1058" /> In the course of an address to the First International Congress of Histopathology of the Nervous System His Holiness Pope Plus XII pointed out:</P>
    <P>In so far as, in the cases mentioned, the moral justification of the intervention is based on the mandate of the public authority, and, therefore, from the subordination of the individual to the community, of the individual good to the social good, it rests on a mistaken application of the principle. It must be pointed out that man, as a person, in the final reckoning, does not exist for the use of society; on the contrary, the community exists for man.</P>
    <P>The community is the great medium ordained by nature and by God to regulate the exchanges by which mutual needs are met, to help each one to develop his personality according to his individual social capacity.  The community, considered as a whole, is not a physical unity which subsists in itself.  Its individual members are not integrating parts of it.  The physical organism of living beings, of plants, animals, or men, possesses as a whole a unity which subsists in itself.  Each of the members, for example, the hand, the foot, the heart, the eye, is an integrant part, destined by its whole being to be a part of one complete organism.  Outside the organism it has not, of its own nature, any meaning, any purpose: its being is wholly absorbed in the complete organism with which it is linked.</P>
    <P>A quite different state of affairs obtains in the moral community and in each organism of a purely moral character.  The whole has not here a unity which subsists in itself, but a simple unity of purpose and of action.  In the community, the individuals are only collaborators and instruments for the realisation of the ends of the community.</P>
    <P>What follows with regard to the physical organism?  The master, the person who uses this organism, which possesses a subsisting unity, can dispose directly and immediately <Col N="1059" /> of the integrant parts, the members and the organs, within the framework of their natural finality.  Likewise he can intervene, when and as far as the well-being of the whole demands, to paralyse, destroy, mutilate, separate its members.  In contrast, however, when the whole does not possess a unity of finality and of action, its head, that is to say in the present case, the public authority, retains without doubt a direct authority and the right to impose its demands on the activity of the parts, but in no case can it dispose directly of its physical being.  Moreover, every direct injury attempted against its essential being by public authority, is a departure from that sphere of activity which rightly belongs to it.</P>
    <P>Now medical intervention, of which We are treating here, affects immediately and directly the physical being, either of the whole or of the individual organs of the human organism.  But in virtue of the principle which We have just stated, in this domain, the public authority has no right; it cannot pass it on, therefore, to investigators and doctors.</P>
    <P>Likewise, I say it cannot pass it on to any local authority officials.  We have no right to subject any person to medication where it is not necessary to prevent a communicable disease.  No matter what views anybody else may have in the matter, there are plenty of people who believe in the integrity of the individual and, even though what the Minister has suggested may be of some advantage in delaying the onset of dental caries for a couple of years, that advantage does not justify this House, does not justify any society, in so destroying the integrity of the individual as to subject him to mass medication.</P>
    <P>The Minister has deliberately remained silent on this amendment despite our having emphasised the vital necessity for it.  The Minister ridicules the idea of the amendment because he says it would cost too much to put it into effect.  Our answer is that we have given the people a <Col N="1060" /> pure water supply at considerable cost and that money should not be just thrown away in favour of the very doubtful advantage the Minister has to offer, particularly when that doubtful advantage is coupled with very significant dangers.  The dangers have been pointed out by experts throughout the length and breadth of the world.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the Minister will do if, within a few years of compulsory fluoridation of water supplies, we find ourselves faced with 300 people suffering from serious diseases because of that fluoridation.  Suppose a hospital in the State were to plead with the Minister for the provision, free of cost, of water which contained no artificial fluorine in the interests of some of their patients, I wonder would the Minister be prepared to provide that pure water?  I feel that he would, in conscience, be bound to do so.</P>
    <P>Certain tests carried out in America and elsewhere have proved that certain people are allergic to fluorine.  The number may only be one in 100,000. The number of people who die from the dreadful scourge of polio is one in 100,000.  Yet society is rightly concerned about the number of deaths from polio.  The number who are left physically incapacitated in some degree as a result of polio is one in 10,000.  Yet we spend considerable sums of money and effort in encouraging people to take the necessary precautions against polio.  But we do not compel them to do so although polio is a disease which any one of us might catch.</P>
    <P>These are matters that ought to give us to think.  What right have we to say to hundreds of thousands of people that they must expose themselves to the risk of some toxicity as a result of fluoridated public water supplies and that we will not allow them any readily available supply of water without artificial fluorine?  I believe it is very wrong that we should do that.  Even though the cost might be considerable I believe that, in conscience, pure water should be made available to those who prefer <Col N="1061" /> pure water.  Taking the calculation one in 100,000 the number affected in our community will be 30; 30 people will die as a result of fluorine poisoning. On the calculation that one in 10,000 will suffer some physical damage, the number affected will be 300.  In our community those are frightening statistics.  It might be any one of us here who will suffer.</P>
    <P>Have we any right to say to people that they must take fluoridated water? I do not believe we have that right.  If the Dáil and the Seanad approve this provision, I sincerely hope the President will refer the matter to the Courts for decision.  It is a very, very vital matter and one which deserves far more serious consideration than I believe it has been given.  Whatever the rest of the world may do, we are taking a backward step when we fail to appreciate the rights of individuals in a matter of this kind.  I urge the Minister to consider ways and means by which pure water, without artificial fluorine, may be made available to the community. If it only means a dozen depots in Dublin, then I hold those depots should be available.  It may mean inconvenience but, if people want pure water, they will put up with the inconvenience.</P>
    <P>In the United States there have been movements of population from areas in which water is fluoridated to areas in which it is not.  We could not have the same mobility of population here. It would be an intolerable burden to compel people to leave the city of Dublin and go to live on the top of the Dublin mountains in order to get fluorine-free water.  At the moment we have water which does not contain any artificial fluorine.  I do not believe we have any right to take that away unless we are prepared to make readily available an alternative source of pure water.  That is why we are pressing this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> To add to the section the following subsections:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  Before making regulations under this section, the Minister shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  cause to be made&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  a survey of the incidence of dental caries in a representative sample of pupils attending full-time day schools in the functional area or functional areas of the health authority or health authorities to whom the regulations relate, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  an analysis or series of analyses of the quantities of fluorine and such other constituents as the Minister may determine in the water supplied by sanitary authorities through pipes to the public in the functional area or functional areas of the health authority or health authorities to whom the regulations relate, and</P>
    <P>(b)  cause to be presented to each House of the Oireachtas a report on the survey and analysis or analyses so made,</P>
    <P>and such report, in relation to the survey, shall include particulars of the procedure adopted in making it and the numbers, classified by age and otherwise, of the pupils to whom it relates but shall not include any information in respect of any indentifiable pupil.</P>
    <P>(5)  Any information in relation to dental caries in individuals which is obtained in the course of a survey under subsection (4) of this section shall be treated in a confidential manner.</P>
    <P>(6)  Nothing in subsection (4) of this section shall be construed as imposing an obligation on any person to submit himself or any person for whom he is responsible to examination or as requiring the controlling authority of any school to afford facilities for the making of a survey under that subsection, and accordingly where, in the case of any such survey, information regarding the pupils attending one or more of <Col N="1063" /> the full-time day schools in the area or areas concerned is for any reason not available, the survey shall be made by reference to the pupils attending the other full-time day schools in the area or areas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The additional subsections which this amendment proposes to insert will have a twofold object: first, to establish before the regulations introducing fluoridation are made, the exact position regarding the incidence of dental caries in children and adolescents attending whole-time day schools and, secondly, to ascertain by analysis the fluorine content and the other constituents of the public water supplies it is proposed to fluoridate.  It had been intended to have these surveys carried out and analyses made under the provisions of Section 6 as originally introduced, but that section is permissive.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Section is to make it mandatory on the Minister to demonstrate the grave problem which dental caries represents to the communities concerned and, at the same time, to demonstrate by analysis what has been found as a result&mdash;I repeat it again&mdash;of 70 years' investigation&mdash;to be one of the primary factors in making the teeth of certain sections of the community more liable to the onset of this disease than they otherwise might be.</P>
    <P>I have said that research has been carried out over a period of 70 years, and I commented upon that fact when I was speaking here on the 27th October, referring to the plea which Deputy Manley had made that he would like to have the very fullest information about this problem.  I said:</P>
    <P>Deputy Manley went on to say that we ought to be fully acquainted with the subject.  This is a complex scientific subject; it is a problem which is widespread and on which there has been a great deal of scientific research.  It is not something that has been suggested here for the first time nor has it been developed merely over the last 15 years.  I shall show in due course that this problem has been the subject of numerous and close investigations <Col N="1064" /> for almost three-quarters of a century; but it is only in the past 15 years that the results of these investigations, experiments and researches have come to be applied in a controlled way.  Therefore, this is a subject which it would be quite impossible for an assembly such as this, which is not composed of scientific or professional men&mdash;and much more so, a county council or urban district council or a health authority which again is not composed of persons who have a specialised knowledge of this matter &mdash; to become thoroughly acquainted with, as Deputy Manley said he wished to be.</P>
    <P>I am repeating that statement to the House because I have already shown, speaking on this day week the extent to which those opposing this Bill can distort and misrepresent the truth.  On that occasion I had particularly in mind Deputy Ryan's statement about the president of the United States not drinking fluoridated water.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;how Deputy Ryan&mdash;I shall not say deliberately-misled the House but somebody fed him this canard about the President of the United States and he, like a number of other innocent people, had fallen for it.  He said that President Eisenhower was not allowed to drink fluoridated water and, during the debate on the last amendment, we heard Deputy Ryan describe the terrible things which happen to people who do drink fluoridated water.  Since he has relied upon the alleged prohibition imposed upon President Eisenhower in relation to fluoridated water by his physician, I propose to put on the records of the House what the President's own physician has to <Col N="1066" /> say on this matter.  I am doing so, not because of anything that was said during the course of the debate on Second Reading, but in rebuttal of some of the statements which were made by Deputy Ryan when speaking on the last amendment.</P>
      <P>This is a statement which was issued from the White House, in a letter from President Eisenhower's personal physician, Dr. Howard Mac C. Snyder, to Dr. Charlotte Brown, Director of Health, New Canaan, Connecticut, dated April 9th.  It reads:</P>
      <P>Dear Dr. Brown, I have never seen a case of illness which could be attributed to fluoridation of a community's water supply.  I have no reason not to endorse a health policy that is advocated by the American Medical Association and the United States Public Health Service Sincerely yours, Howard Mac C. Snyder.</P>
      <P>So, whatever the Water Commissioner, if that is his title, of New York City had to say about the proposal to fluoridate that city's water supply, in that connection he was speaking as a layman.  I understand he is not a doctor.</P>

This is not the Literary and <Col N="1067" /> Historical Society.  We cannot deal with this and make petty debating points.  It is quite true that the World Health Organisation in relation to the Report of the Expert Committee on the proposal to fluoridate water had the usual caveat which appears in every one of its publications saying that the Organisation as a whole did not necessarily accept responsibility for the Report, but the Organisation as a whole embraces every State in the world.</P>
      <P>What the Governing Committee of the Organisation did was to appoint an Expert Committee and, having considered their Report, to publish that Report on its responsibility as making a general recommendation in relation to this problem.  The authority for its publication is stated on the first page of the Report, if my recollection is correct.  I want to come back to the statement made by the President's personal physician.</P>

I am quite prepared to accept his statement, which he has already put on record in the Committee discussion, with regard to the President of the United States, but my point of order is that it is not relevant to the discussion on every amendment.  Surely, it is not relevant for the Minister to use every amendment put down to this Bill for the purpose of replying to points raised on the Second Reading discussion of the Bill?

We believe it to be a very sensible amendment for the Minister to introduce, and I am very glad he has done so.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall wait for the Minister to finish.  I would prefer his whole ear.  If the Minister has something urgent to discuss with the Parliamentary Secretary I have no objection to waiting.  I am sorry that in speaking to this amendment the Minister did not refer to the fact that there had been a blunder made by him or his Department in preparing the White Paper published with this Bill. The Minister will recall that paragraph 39 of the Consultative Council's Report recommended that these statistics should be compiled and the surveys made before any public water supply was fluoridated.  That was a definite recommendation made by the Consultative Council.</P>
      <P>The Minister published a White Paper claiming that the contents of Section 6 of the Bill were deliberately put into the Bill for the purpose of complying with that recommendation of the Consultative Council.  Paragraph 39 of the Council's Report reads as follows:</P>
      <P>Before any public water supply is fluoridated, the Council considers that steps should be taken to assess the incidence of dental caries in children resident in the area served by that water supply.  The Council also considers that, subsequent to fluoridation, steps should be taken to permit a proper evaluation of the results.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 4 of the White Paper, which deals with Section 6 of the Bill, says:</P>
      <P>It is particularly with a view to implementing the recommendation in Paragraph 39, cited above, of the Consultative Council's Report that provision is being made by Section 6 of the Bill for a survey of dental caries.  These surveys will be carried out by Health Authorities as and when required by the Minister for Health and should be of considerable value in enabling statistical material on the benefits of fluoridation to be prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, it is quite clear from the White Paper that the surveys and statistics which the Minister contemplated <Col N="1070" /> in Section 6 of the Bill were to be carried out and compiled after the water had been fluoridated, whereas Paragraph 39 of the Council's Report gave a definite recommendation to the Minister that these surveys should be made and the statistics compiled before any water was fluoridated.</P>
    <P>The amendment which the Minister is now introducing is an amendment which does comply with the recommendation of the Consultative Council's Report and I would have thought that the Minister would simply get up here, move the amendment, and say he is moving it to comply with Paragraph 39 of the Council's Report, and recommend it to the House on that basis.  Certainly, I am prepared to accept it on that basis as a worthwhile amendment and I am glad the Minister introduced it.</P>
    <P>There are one or two small points in connection with it which I should like the Minister to clarify.  In subsection (5) the Minister in his amendment provides that:</P>
    <P>Any information in relation to dental caries in individuals which is obtained in the course of a survey under subsection (4) of this section shall be treated in a confidential manner.</P>
    <P>I think that is right, that it must be treated in a confidential manner.  However, I should like the Minister's assurance that the phrase &ldquo;confidential manner&rdquo; will be interpreted in a very strict sense because provision is made in subsection (4) (b) that a report of any survey made will be made available to each House of the Oireachtas.  I take it that it is implicit in subsection (5) that no details of individual cases which in any way could be identified would be contained in a report under subsection (4) (b)? I am sure that is the Minister's intention and I simply want to get it from him for record purposes in connection with the future interpretation of this section when it goes into the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the Minister's amendment does not go half far enough as far as his examination is concerned.  The Minister is concerned with the survey and reports of dental caries and with a series of analyses of the quantities of fluorine in water but he makes no provision for any examination of the general health of the people in an area.  His examination is confined to pupils attending full time day schools and I think this clearly proves what we are arguing in regard to this Bill, that fluoridated water is of no benefit whatever to adults.  Before the Minister is to act on this survey, the survey ought to be complete and should examine the general health condition of a complete community and decide on the balance whether or not, in view of the general health of the community, it is a justifable risk to take to expose the larger section of the community to a toxic substance, fluoridated water, when the only beneficial effect is to postpone the onset of dental caries for a couple of years in relation to pupils attending full time day schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure what is to happen if the majority of the schools or the majority of parents object to this examination.  It would appear then that decisions might be taken by the Minister arising out of an investigation of one school in an area which might <Col N="1072" /> have 20 schools because subsection (6) provides that where one or more schools refuse to have this examination the survey shall be made by reference to the pupils attending other full-time day schools in the area or the areas. It is well known that incomplete statistics can tell greater lies than no statistics at all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only an apprentice to the Minister.  I can never be as well qualified as he is and I am not accepting the title that he seeks to bestow on me.  The fact is that we could have in one school, or in a number of schools, children who would have particular dietary habits whereas, in the schools which refuse to have this examination, there could be children with totally different dietary habits. The result would be that your statistics would be distorted in relation to the amount of dental caries.  It is known for instance that the Eskimos, eating only the diet which their ancestors have consumed for years, have no dental caries, but as soon as they allow themselves to be contaminated by civilisation, by modern eating habits, dental caries have set in rather rapidly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order&mdash;the real question at issue in this amendment is not whether a survey shall be made or not.  Section 6 as it stands provides that such a survey may be made and what this amendment does propose is that before any regulations are made the survey must be carried out.  Deputy Ryan is now going far beyond that specific question. He is discussing the Eskimos, he has been referring to statistical errors and, in general, he has been traversing all the ground he has gone over so often in the House.</P>

      <P>The only difference between the Eskimos and President <Col N="1073" /> Eisenhower is that there are several Eskimos and only one President Eisenhower and, if one individual's state of health is relevant, it is surely relevant for me to point out that in certain communities there are different reports in regard to dental caries.  I am pointing out that the survey for which the Minister seeks power would be utterly unreliable unless all the schools and all the children will be submitted to investigation.</P>

Now, we might get somewhere in relation to the remainder of the Bill if the Minister is still in the same penitent state of mind.  We shall discuss the point the Minister wants to discuss, whether or not it should be mandatory on him to carry out these investigations first.  I say it does not matter a hoot whether <Col N="1074" /> he does or not because there is provision in the amendment he is making that if the reports provide statistics that indicate that it is not necessary to fluoridate the water, the Minister may still go ahead and do it.  He is not bound in any way by this report so that it seems ludicrous that he should bother making it in the first case.  The fact that he has rejected a wealth of expert opinion from all over the world shows that he is capable of ignoring any report made as a result of the survey he seeks to have made here.  The result is worthless unless it is a complete survey.</P>

Now he is putting in a mandatory clause which is worthless. The money which he wants to spend on carrying out this limited survey would be better spent on educating the people in ordinary hygiene.  It is wrong to make this clause mandatory.  If it were a permissive clause I would hope that we would not waste money and time in getting reports which would be abortive or useless.

If that be the intention, it is certainly not the result of his amendment.  The amendment is to put the House into possession of certain information which is not in dispute, that is that the intake of fluorine will delay dental caries.  I say that the Minister's amendment is worthless.  It is a waste of time and money to have a survey carried out, the sole result of which will be to put the House into possession of information about dental caries but which will not give the House any information as to the result of the intake of fluorine on the people.

      <P>On the section, I wish to continue the remarks which I was making because it is very important that the tactics adopted by Deputy Ryan and those associated with him in opposing this Bill should be disposed of I was dealing with Deputy Ryan's statement, which has been repeated, that the President of the United States was forbidden by his doctor to drink fluoridated water. The President himself denied that and Said that he did drink Washington fluoridated water which he found as good as any other.  Later the President's own personal physician wrote a letter to a colleague stating that he had never seen a case of illness which could be attributed to the fluoridation of a public water-supply.  I hope that we shall not hear from Deputy Ryan any further reiteration of the falsehoods which he has used in this House.</P>

      <P>In this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> there is an example of the manner in which this unscrupulous campaign has been conducted by certain persons.  On October 27th last, speaking on the Second Stage of the Bill, I said this:</P>
      <P>Deputy Manley went on to say that we ought to be fully acquainted with the subject.  This is a complex scientific subject; it is a problem which is widespread and on which there has been a great deal of scientific research.  It is not something that has been suggested here for the first time nor has it been developed merely over the last 15 years.  I shall show in due course that this problem has been the subject of numerous and close investigations for almost three-quarters of a century; but it is only in the past 15 years that the results of these investigations, experiments and researches have come to be applied in a controlled way.</P>
      <P>In this morning's <i>Independent</i> there appeared a letter issued on behalf of the Pure Water Association which operated with a pickaxe upon the true content of the passage I quoted.  The signatories to the letter stated, with interpolated brackets, that the artificial fluoridation of public water supplies is not something which has not been suggested here for the first time. You notice how my words have been doctored.  They have not been fluoridated, but something has been added to them which suggests something different from what I did say.  They have interpolated the words &ldquo;artificial fluoridation of water supplies&rdquo;.  There is not a word in the passage I have read to the House about the artificial fluoridation of water supplies.</P>

I said that though the matter had been closely investigated for almost three-quarters <Col N="1079" /> of a century, it was only in the past fifteen years that the results had come to be applied in a controlled way.  Quite clearly the vital words in that statement of mine&mdash;that it had been under investigation but that it was only within fifteen years that the results had been applied in a controlled way&mdash;were twisted by these people.  The gentlemen of the Pure Water Association, in order conveniently to doctor my statement, have cut out the vital words.</P>
      <P>I have shown how they misled Deputy Ryan in relation to the advice given to President Elsenhower by his personal physician.  I now show how they take words out of their context, how they truncate statements in order to try to convince other people of the falsehood of which they themselves are guilty by suppression and suggestion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan, again to-day as he did on the last occasion, spoke about the civic authorities in America who, having decided to fluoridate their water, afterwards reversed that decision, and he occupied the time of this House at great length last Wednesday by reciting some 76 municipalities in America who had decided to cease fluoridating their water supplies.</P>

      <P>Artificially.  That was a remarkable list.  You know, it is worth studying.  Subjects such as this must be discussed in an assembly like this where people have time to discuss them without heat, and when authorities are cited they must be authoritative.  We find that in that list the municipalities&mdash;I am not discussing their size or their importance but their responsibility&mdash;had been adopting fluoridation one week and abandoning it the next.  Whether it was the adoption of the measure or its abandonment in less than a week that was the worst I do not know.  What I do say is that the fact that a municipality&mdash;I am dignifying some of these bodies when I apply that title to them; I am enhancing their status far beyond what in fact it is&mdash;which can in one week adopt what Deputy Ryan and <Col N="1080" /> those associated with him think a very momentous and, according to them, injurious procedure, should the following week abandon it, certainly shows a degree of irresponsibility which renders any action of theirs worthless as evidence for or against the fluoridation process.</P>
      <P>This is a process the effects of which will be fully tested after a period of years when we have manifested in this country, as there has been manifested everywhere else where it has been tried, a marked decline in the incidence of dental caries.  That decline does not take place overnight.  I am not saying that fluoridation will have the same sort of effect as an antibiotic drug would have but it is a preventive process which, if applied, will over the years show a marked decline in the incidence of dental caries.  That is an established scientific fact.  Not even Deputy Ryan has ventured to deny that.  On the contrary, he has admitted that it at least retards dental decay.</P>

      <P>We do not say that it will do it universally but Deputy Ryan says it will not prevent dental decay but it will delay it.  He has been compelled to make that admission because of the facts which have been proven wherever this process has been adopted, that is to say, that over the years there has been a reduction in the incidence of dental caries in every community where the process is in use. That is what he has been compelled to admit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is a document issued by the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare. It is entitled &ldquo;Fluoridation.&rdquo; It contains a statement, by the Secretary of State for Health, Education and Welfare, Arthur S. Flemming.  Referring to the fact that there had been&mdash; and I am not denying it&mdash;some decline in the rate at which American public authorities were adopting the fluoridation process and in some instances, indeed, as Deputy Ryan has said, were abandoning it, the Secretary of State for Health, Education and Welfare said:</P>
      <P>Intensive research over a quarter of a century shows conclusively that water containing a proper amount of fluoride reduces dental decay by about 65 per cent.</P>
      <P>(2)  Equally conclusive research has demonstrated that controlled fluoridation is completely safe, causing no bodily harm.</P>
      <P>Having pointed out both these facts, the Secretary of State&mdash;President Eisenhower's Secretary of State&mdash;said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have inquired into why, in the light of all these factors, the extension of fluoridation has been lagging in the last two years.  I have come to the conclusion that it amounts <Col N="1082" /> basically to this: the opponents of fluoridation are a militant minority; the proponents of fluoridation, as is so frequently the case with proponents of new health measures, are an unmilitant majority.</P>
    <P>Then the Secretary of the American Medical Association is quoted by Secretary Flemming, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In addition to the sincere opposition which merits respect, there is the usual hue and cry from those who take every opportunity to discredit medical science and legitimate public health progress.  We find in the antifluoridation camp the anti-vaccinationists, the anti-vivi-sectionists, the cults and quacks of all descriptions, in short, everyone who has a grudge against legitimate scientific progress.</P>
    <P>It is these people, operating upon these volatile and irresponsible American communities whom Deputy Ryan cited to us, who have succeeded in the United States of America in slowing down the adoption of fluoridation.</P>
    <P>To consider another aspect of this long and apparently impressive list which Deputy Ryan cited to us, consider some of the communities that he asks this Dáil to be influenced by. Take Knoxville, Iowa,: in a referendum there were 868 against fluoridation and 356 for.  In Genesco, Illinois, there were 988 against and 422 for.  In Greensboro there were 5,545 against and 4,326 for.  In Wichita Falls, Texas, there were 1,800 against and 1,400 for.  In Rhinelander, Wisconsin, there were 1,500 against and 1,117 for.  He quoted 76 communities and in that list it would appear that the largest number of people who voted at a referendum on this question was in San Diego&mdash;and there 46,000 voted against and 41,000 for fluoridation.</P>
    <P>Having read that list of 76 obscure and, in some instances, minute communities, Deputy Ryan told the House that 60 million American people were against fluoridation.  I am perfectly certain that he quoted those that he thought were most impressive, and this enormous, terrifying opposition of 60 million people was based upon what? Upon 868 in Knoxville, 988 in <Col N="1083" /> Genesco, 5,545 in Greensboro, and 1,550 in Rhinelander and, to throw it in for good measure, 46,000 in San Diego.  The Deputy will have to multiply a long time before he makes 60 million out of that.  As against that tawdry list of little communities you have the official pronouncement of the Secretary of Health in the United States of America.  Does he count for nothing?  He at any rate represents the whole of America, and not Knoxville with its 868 or Genesco with its 988.  If we are going to have this matter discussed let it be discussed on an intelligent basis.</P>
    <P>The reason I am asking the Dáil to give the Minister for Health, whoever he may be, powers to make it mandatory upon local authorities to fluoridate the water if the Minister makes a regulation which is applicable to their area, is to prevent the sort of thing that has happened in America where, as Secretary of Health Flemming has stated: &ldquo;...there is the usual hue and cry from those who take every opportunity to discredit medical science and legitimate public health progress.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under the Section as now amended the position will be this: that the Minister for Health, if he proposes to make a regulation, will have a survey carried out in a representative sample of day schools, which permit such a survey to be made of the pupils, in order to ascertain in that administrative area what is the incidence of dental caries.  There will also be made an analysis of the public water supply of that district and then, with full information as to the manner in which the survey was made, the numbers classified by age and otherwise of the pupils to whom it relates, the Minister will make a regulation, if he thinks he is justified in doing so, and the regulation will be laid upon the Table of the House.  If the proposal that the water supply in Dublin city and county, embracing three-quarters of a million people, should be fluoridated meets with any opposition, those who oppose it like Deputy Ryan and others can put down a motion to have the regulation annulled and we can have the <Col N="1084" /> matter discussed here in a rational and reasonable way and not in the manner in which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Half of his contribution was devoted to castigating the Association responsible for the letter; the other half of his contribution was devoted to condemning as irresponsible a number of communities in America.  I do not believe that what the communities in America did falls within the Minister's jurisdiction to describe as responsible or irresponsible.  I merely wish to dissociate myself completely from what I believe to be the unfair remarks made by the Minister in connection with the Pure Water Association.  I do not accuse the Minister of being deliberately unfair.  He thinks he has been wronged by being misquoted and feels strongly about it.  I want to dissociate myself from the Minister's remarks.

On the section itself, it is obvious, even at this stage, that the Minister has avoided completely the biggest problem of all.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, this Bill has already been considered by the Seanad and amended in a number of minor respects.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a comprehensive measure which repeals and re-enacts, with a number of important amendments, all the existing Rent Restrictions Acts.  It represents the outcome of the Government's consideration of the recommendations in the Conroy Commission's Report, presented in 1952, in the light of the economic and other changes which have taken place since that Commission examined the rent control problem.  These changes have been such as to make some of the major proposals in the report inappropriate in present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Commission were considering the problem, the Korean crisis was at its height and there was considerable instability of economic conditions.  In that context the Commission considered that not only was it necessary to continue the existing controls but that control should be extended to the houses built since 1941, to houses built hereafter and to all furnished lettings.  Since that time, however, economic conditions have markedly improved, the scarcity of housing accommodation has been virtually overcome, living standards generally are better than they have ever been and reasonable stability of <Col N="1086" /> economic conditions has been attained.</P>
    <P>In 1957 the Capital Investment Advisory Committee in a Majority Report recommended that the Rent Restrictions Act should be repealed over a period of 10 years.  A Minority Report, signed by two of the members, disagreed with the conclusions in the Majority Report.</P>
    <P>After prolonged consideration of the conflicting views on the problem, the Government came to the conclusion that the existing situation was such that it would be contrary to the public interest to extend further the present controls and that, on the contrary, what was needed was such a relaxation of controls as could be effected without causing hardship to tenants. The Government did not, therefore, accept either the Conroy Commission's proposals for an extension of control or the Capital Investment Advisory Committee's recommendation for the abolition of rent control over a period of 10 years.</P>
    <P>In reaching a decision the Government were influenced by the necessity for reaching a balance between the requirements of a progressive economy and the need to see that justice was done to tenants, many of whom are among the poorer sections of the community.  Moreover, the Government felt that no satisfactory solution of this many-sided problem could be achieved unless it were to be regarded by the people generally as being fair and reasonable.  The Government believe that the compromise proposals which are put forward in this Bill merit this description and can be said to be not only in the general national interest&mdash;in that they will help to maintain the nation's stock of houses in good repair&mdash;but also in the long-term interests of tenants in that they will help to increase the supply of rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the actual provisions of the Bill, these fall under three main headings.  First, certain relaxations of control are proposed.  Secondly, an up-to-date and easily ascertainable basic rent is being provided for virtually all property now tenanted. <Col N="1087" /> Finally, in order to compensate landlords for the increased costs of repair, it is proposed to increase the rents being paid on 1st February, 1960 (less rates, where the landlord pays them) by 12½ per cent. where the landlord is liable for whole or part of the repairs.</P>
    <P>The relaxations in the scope of control which are effected by Section, 3 of the Bill have all been designed so that no sitting tenant will be disturbed. Accordingly, only future tenants will be affected by the proposed decontrol of owner-occupied houses, irrespective of valuation, by the decontrol of houses exceeding £30 rateable valuation in Dublin (£25 elsewhere) on the landlord securing vacant possession, by the decontrol of separate and self-contained flats constructed after the passing of the Act or by the decontrol of certain dwellings let with substantial amounts of land.  It will be observed that decontrol on owner-occupation or on vacant possession exceeding a specified rateable valuation will only apply to a future letting of the house in question; any future letting of a room or a flat (other than a newly constructed self-contained flat) in a decontrolled house will still be subject to control.</P>
    <P>Those purely business premises which are controlled at present, i.e. those let on less than yearly tenancies, are also being decontrolled but the tenants affected are being given immediate rights to protection under Part III of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, if they have not got these rights already.  It is hoped that, in particular, the freeing from control of newly-constructed self-contained flats will result in a large number of conversions of the large houses in city areas which have become uneconomic for occupation as single dwelling-houses. If this expectation proves to be justified, the shortage of rented accommodation will be relieved substantially in the areas where the shortage is greatest. The Government are anxious to encourage such a development and repair and reconstruction grants will be available for these conversion operations.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Sections 7, 8 and 9, which deal with the fixing of new <Col N="1088" /> basic rents for the property remaining under control, are expressed, of necessity, in rather technical language, but their broad object is clear.  A new basic rent will be fixed for every controlled dwelling which was let on 1st February, 1960, or within three years before that date.  This is the effect of Section 7 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The new basic rent will be the actual rent being paid on 1st February last, less rates, where the landlord pays them.  If, for example, the rent being paid by a tenant on 1st February was 15s.  and the rates, payable by the landlord, amounted to 5s. weekly, the new basic rent will be 10s.; if in such a case the rates were paid directly by the tenant, the new basic rent will be 15s.  There will be a few cases in which property not let on 1st February, 1960, will still be subject to control; these will be, in the main, fresh lettings of rooms or flats, other than newly-constructed self-contained flats.  Provision is made in Section 9 of the Bill for the Court to determine the basic rent of such lettings by reference to the rents of comparable dwellings whose rents are related to the level of rents prevailing in 1941.</P>
    <P>It is necessary also to make provision for the odd case where the rents actually being paid on 1st February, 1960, happened to be unreasonably high or unreasonably low.  Subsections (1) and (2) of Section 8 of the Bill allow such basic rents to be revised by the Court where, broadly speaking, the basic rents are more than 12½ per cent. above or below what the Court would otherwise fix.  In addition to satisfying the Court on this aspect of the matter, a landlord who desires to have the basic rent increased must also satisfy the Court that the amount of the rent actually being paid on 1st February was affected by special circumstances, for example, where the landlord had let the dwelling at an abnormally low rent to a relative of his or for charitable reasons.  If the dwelling concerned has been under control since 1915 then the Court will have regard to the rents of comparable dwellings of this kind in determining whether the rent is 12½ per cent. too low and not to the higher 1941 level <Col N="1089" /> of rent applicable to the premises brought under control for the first time, or recontrolled, in 1944.  Where the application for the revision of the basic rent is made by a tenant, the Court, in determining whether the basic rent was more than 12½ per cent. too high, will take as its criterion the basic rents of comparable dwellings controlled on the 1941 level of rents, that is, unless the dwelling concerned has been under control since 1915 and has a rateable valuation not exceeding £10.</P>
    <P>As I have said, these provisions are somewhat complicated, but it must be emphasised that they will have to be operated only in the exceptional case where the actual rent being paid on 1st February, 1960, was excessively high or excessively low.  It is reasonable to assume that virtually all controlled property is rented at levels which approximate closely to the lawful rents under the present law.  Accordingly subsections (1) and (2) of Section 8 will not be often invoked and their provisions may be expected to have a comparatively short life because any tenant or landlord who neglects to have a basic rent revised within a reasonable time is bound to have a difficult task in convincing the Court that the rent actually being paid on the 1st February, 1960, was unreasonable.</P>
    <P>In general, these rent-fixing provisions will import a desirable certainty into the rent restrictions code and thus remedy one of its most serious defects, namely, that the basic rent is unknown in most cases and that accordingly unless the tenant agrees, the landlord cannot increase the rent to obtain a permitted increase unless he is prepared to incur the expense of having the Court determine it.  This situation is being completely altered by the Bill.</P>
    <P>At this point I should like to mention that it is intended to move two amendments to Section 7 on Committee Stage. The first amendment will propose to alter the date by reference to which basic rents are to be determined from 1st February, 1960, to a date approximating to the passing of the Bill.  It is clearly desirable that this date should <Col N="1090" /> be as up-to-date as possible.  The second amendment which I will move will be to give effect to an agreement reached on 6th October, 1960, between the, Dublin Artisans' Dwellings Company and the Association representing the Company's tenants, following negotiations under the chairmanship of Deputy Briscoe.  The agreed rents will be deemed to be basic rents for the purposes of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The third main object of the Bill is to allow an increase of 12½ per cent. in the basic rents of controlled dwellings to compensate landlords who are liable for repairs for the increase in the cost of repairs.  The need for such an increase will, I think, be generally conceded.  The Conroy Commission found that the cost of repairs had increased five times between 1914 and 1950, when they were considering the matter, and that these costs had doubled between 1941 and 1950.  Since 1950 these costs have increased by a further 40 per cent.  The Commission recommended that landlords who were liable for all repairs should be entitled to an increase of 25 per cent. on current net rents and that landlords who were liable for part repairs should receive an increase of 12½ per cent.</P>
    <P>The Commission made it clear that, in their opinion, these increases would not quite restore the 1914 return of landlords of the older category of controlled houses, who are in the majority, although it would improve somewhat the return received in 1941 from the minority of premises brought under control in, 1944.  Landlords of the older controlled premises have been receiving, since 1926, rents which are 30 per cent. above the 1914 rents in cases where the landlord is liable for all repairs, and 25 per cent. above the 1914 rent where the landlord is liable for part repairs.  The only increases permitted by the Acts to the landlord of these premises are for any outlay of the landlord on rates&mdash;from which the landlord does not benefit personally&mdash;or for any outlay of his on structural alterations, improvements or certain exceptional repairs.  Landlords of the property which was brought under control for the first time, or recontrolled in 1944, have received no increase to compensate for the increase <Col N="1091" /> in the cost of ordinary repairs since then and are entitled to increase the rent only in respect of their outlay on rates and on structural alterations, improvements or exceptional repairs.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances the Government decided to allow a 12½ per cent. increase in basic rents.  Where, however, landlords have already obtained considerable increases of rent by virtue of expenditure on exceptional repairs, the Government considered that it would be unfair not to modify the application of the 12½ per cent. increase.  Accordingly, subsection (4) of Section 10 provides that the 12½ per cent. increase will not apply to any portion of the basic rent which is attributable to a lawful addition obtained by a landlord under the present Acts for expenditure on exceptional repairs with the aid of repair and reconstruction grants, and that the increase will not apply at all to such a landlord who has not received these grants.  In the matter of increasing rent the Government have therefore shown the same concern to avoid hardship to tenants as in the matter of relaxing the scope of the present controls.</P>
    <P>These are the three main objects of the Bill but, as indicated in the explanatory memorandum, the Bill contains a large number of modifications of the present law, some of which are minor and technical but others of which raise important issues.  In the main, these other modifications of the present law are based on recommendations of the Conroy Commission and they are, perhaps more appropriate for discussion on the Committee Stage though I shall endeavour to deal with any points arising out of them if any Deputy should require clarification of them now.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to thank the Conroy Commission and the Capital Investment Advisory Committee for their assistance in the consideration of this difficult problem.  In neither case did the Government find it possible to accept fully the recommendations put forward, but this was because, in the case of the Conroy Report, circumstances had altered <Col N="1092" /> radically since the Commission reported and, in the case of the Majority Report of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee, the Government were unable to reconcile the recommendation for complete decontrol within ten years with their obligation to ensure that justice is done to the poorer sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The Reports prepared by both bodies have made it possible for the varying views on this matter to be brought to the notice of the public and of the Government and they will, I think, contribute to a general realisation that no completely acceptable solution is possible.  The solution propounded by the Government and proposed in this Bill is not, and does not pretend to be, completely acceptable to all concerned, but the Government believe that it will be regarded as a fair compromise between the conflicting interests involved which at the same time will promote the best interests of the community generally. I trust the Bill will commend itself to the House on this basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the manner in which he has introduced this Bill and the trouble he has taken to explain its provisions.  This Bill, indeed any Rent Restrictions Bill that I have read, is an extremely complicated document.  It is very difficult to read and, when one has succeeded in reading it, it is extremely difficult to understand.  In that respect it does not differ very greatly from the 1946 Act.  May I make one suggestion? Possibly it may be by way of criticism, though it is not intended in that sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary's officials that, on the occasion of the introduction of any Bill of this sort, the Department of Justice should follow the precedent which they themselves established some years ago in connection with the Statute of Limitations when they included very full explanatory marginal notes showing what alterations were being made in the law, as proposed, and the law as heretofore existing.  That would be very helpful to Deputies, particularly to those who are not lawyers or auctioneers, who, possibly, are more <Col N="1093" /> accustomed to dealing with Rent Restrictions Acts.  If marginal notes were compiled in such a way as to distinguish between new legislation and existing legislation, it would be very helpful.  I know it is not always possible to do that but, as I said, it was done by the Department of Justice some years ago in connection with another Act.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that the problem which this or any Government faces in relation to the question of rent control is a very difficult one.  While these Acts are referred to as Rent Restrictions Acts I think it is only right we should bear in mind that they are more than that.  They deal not only with the question of control of rents but also with the question of control of possession.</P>
    <P>The problem facing the Legislature in connection with any such Bill as this is how to be fair to the landlords and, at the same time, how to prevent anything in the nature of exploitation of tenants.  That problem is aggravated by the fact that you have, possibly, as many different types of landlords and tenants as you have human beings.  You have the good, bad and indifferent landlord and you have the good, bad and indifferent tenant.  If we could classify all landlords as grabbers and exploiters who want to squeeze the last penny out of their tenants, then the Legislature would know the type of legislation necessary to deal with that type of landlord.  On the other hand, if we could classify all tenants as &ldquo;welshers&rdquo; who wanted to avoid paying a just rent, another type of legislation would be necessary.  But the fact of the matter is that you cannot classify either landlords or tenants in that way.</P>
    <P>If you tried to get any classification of landlords, I imagine you could divide them into three principal groups.  First, you have the slum or tenement landlord.  Second, you have the person who is landlord of one or two houses only and who, because of financial or family circumstances, finds it necessary to arrange the letting or leasing of his house, either as an entity <Col N="1094" /> or in apartments.  In the third category you have what I would describe as the estate landlord.  By that I mean the company which goes into the estate business of letting property or building houses and letting them at a profit. In that category also is the landlord who has inherited property and wants to maintain it.  Very often he is a person who will have his estate properly managed by a competent firm of estate managers and who has a very high regard for his obligations as a landlord and whose concern very often is more with regard to the type of tenant than the amount of rent he will get.</P>
    <P>Landlords can make a fairly good argument, and this was put up by the bodies referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary.  An argument can be made, and has been made, for total decontrol; but quite, clearly this House could not accept that.  It would be quite impossible, without creating chaos or a social revolution, to take the step from absolute or fairly full control to total decontrol.  The Government are right and the Conroy Commission were right when they recommended that control of some sort would have to be continued.</P>
    <P>As far as I see the position, I think it was implicit in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement&mdash;in any event, I hope it was&mdash;that this Bill should not be regarded as a final Bill, that it should not be regarded as the last word on rent legislation.  In this matter the Legislature must move gradually, step by step.  This Bill must be regarded simply as one step in the path on which the Legislature has set its feet.</P>
    <P>With regard to rent restriction and control of premises generally, landlords, no matter in which of the three categories I have mentioned they fall, can argue that the rent they are able to get is artifically pinned down and that the restrictions on control amounts to a definite limitation of their ownership. I feel that, of the two, landlords probably regard the restriction on possession as the greater hardship on them.  Certainly there is no doubt that the right to retain possession is a very valuable right from the tenant's point of view.  There are arguments which can be made for the landlords, and <Col N="1095" /> certainly there are arguments which can be made for the tenants.</P>
    <P>It was said in the discussion on this Bill in the Seanad&mdash;and I believe it to be true&mdash;that, having regard to the general history of landlordism in this country, the natural sympathy of an Irish Legislature would be with the tenants and that it would normally favour the tenant.  In that connection it is significant to note that of the three major proposals or alterations contained in this Bill, two of them are what I would describe as landlord's proposals.  They are proposals favouring the landlords as against the tenants. The third proposal, which the Parliamentary Secretary described as a more easily ascertainable basic rent, is probably as much in favour of one group as the other.</P>
    <P>Again, looking at the matter from the tenants' point of view, I think it is true to say that, by and large, the tenants of controlled premises are very often, by reason of their financial circumstances, among the very weakest section of the community.  I said earlier that just as you will have good, bad and indifferent landlords, you will have good, bad and indifferent tenants; but by and large my experience is&mdash;and I think it will be the experience of other Deputies in the House&mdash;tenants are prepared to pay a fair rent and they expect when they do so that they will have at least reasonable security of tenure.  I believe they are entitled to that.  The tenant of a controlled premises is, one might say, always a person who, because of his inability to purchase out his home, at least open to exploitation in conditions of scarcity.</P>
    <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out this is based largely on the recommendations of the Conroy Commission. The Parliamentary Secretary has outlined the three principal alterations which are proposed in this Bill, firstly to effect certain relaxations in the scope of control, secondly to deal with the question of existing basic rent and to bring in a new method of ascertaining it and, thirdly, to increase the rents of controlled premises where the landlords are liable for repairs. The relaxations which are envisaged <Col N="1096" /> or set out in the Bill are the removal of control from owner-occupied houses, from houses in Dublin with a P.L.V. of £30 or more and £25, I think, elsewhere, where the landlord gets vacant possession and, of course, the removal of control from business premises.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has dealt with the new method which is suggested for arriving at the basic rent and has pointed out, in so far as the third principal provision or principal alteration in the Bill is concerned, that it is to increase the rents of controlled premises by 12½ per cent. where the landlord is liable for repairs either in whole or in part.  I want to say quite clearly that I object to the provisions in Section 10 which will result in this 12½ per cent. increase to tenants of controlled premises.  I believe, and my Party believes, that there should not, in fact, be any increase by legislative action on the rents of what for want of a better word I shall call sitting tenants, tenants already afforded protection by the Rent Restriction Acts in force up to date and who are actually now in occupation of their tenancies.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to note that the 12½ per cent. increase which is to be allowed by Section 10 applies not only in cases where the landlord is liable for all repairs but even in cases where he is liable only for part repairs.  That is a particularly dangerous step for the Parliamentary Secretary to take at least until there is some very definite definition of what part repairs means. Remember that the qualification under this Bill for the 12½ per cent. increase is not the doing of repairs by the landlord; it is merely the liability of the landlord to do them whether the repairs are done or not.</P>
    <P>The 12½ per cent., as I understand the position&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary will correct me, no doubt, if I am wrong&mdash;is to compensate landlords for the increase in the cost of repairs as between the date of the passing of the 1946 Act and the introduction of this Bill.  If that is so&mdash;and I believe I am right in my interpretation&mdash;it would seem that if the Government want to compensate landlords who are <Col N="1097" /> responsible for repairs at least there should be some condition that any landlord who qualifies for this increase which is related to repairs should have carried out repairs, but as the Bill stands, as I read it, if a landlord is liable for partial repairs no matter how small and whether or not he has done any repairs, he will get by act of this Legislature if it passes this Bill in its present form a bonus of 12½ per cent. simply because of that liability.</P>
    <P>I think it is unreal to shut our eyes to the fact that over the last ten or 15 years since the last Rent Act was introduced, and a decade before that, many houses that were controlled by Rent Acts have changed hands.  Landlords bought premises knowing that they were controlled; tenants went into tenancies in these premises in the knowledge that there was legislation passed by the Oireachtas which gave them certain rights and now if the Government decision in this matter is allowed to stand in this House, we are going to say to these tenants: &ldquo;No matter what rights you had under the law up to this, no matter what agreements you entered into with your landlord, no matter what knowledge the landlord had of his obligations under the law as it stands, we are going to alter that and tell you to pay your landlord a 12½ per cent. increase and you will have to do that whether the landlord wants it or not.&rdquo; That is what Section 10 amounts to.</P>
    <P>I think it right to point this out and it should be taken into account by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Deputies in regard to this section of the Bill.  It is right to remember that all sorts of people will be affected by this provision and the people who will be affected in the main will be the very weakest section of the community, the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans, the blind pensioners and the people already existing on miserable pittances each week. They are going to be told by the Legislature that they must pay a 12½ per cent. increase on the rent under the new Bill.  What provision is there in the Bill, or what provision have the Government in mind, to compensate <Col N="1098" /> these people for the burden that we, as the Legislature, are going to impose on them?  What provision can the Parliamentary Secretary indicate for compensation that they will get?  This will increase the cost of living on every tenant of a controlled dwelling.</P>
    <P>A few days ago I asked the Taoiseach by Parliamentary Question what steps the Government intended to take to reduce the cost of living and I think it is relevant to this discussion to refer to the reply given by the Tánaiste on behalf of the Taoiseach on the 3rd November:</P>
    <P>The consumer price index has been stable over the past few years.  The latest index number, that for mid-August last, was no higher than for mid-August, 1958.  There is now reasonable basis for believing that the forces making for general price inflation have been checked.  The Government consider that no circumstances exist to require the reintroduction of any general system of price restriction and that the competition which is now effective may be relied on to keep all prices at the lowest practicable level.</P>
    <P>Earlier this month the Tánaiste said in this House that there was basis for believing that the forces making for general price inflation had been checked and at the same time the Government of which he is a member was deliberately introducing legislation to bring about, by positive Government action, an increase in the cost of living on every tenant of a controlled dwelling in the country.</P>
    <P>For those reasons we object to that proposal.  It might be reasonably argued, and can certainly be argued to some extent, that the same objections do not apply or that some of them do not apply, in the case of new tenancies of controlled premises but I think that they do all apply in the case of what I have described as sitting tenants.  I think that in the case of new tenancies it should be possible, and would be possible to have a provision whereby a rent could be fixed by mutual agreement, or, in default of agreement, there should be some type of fair rent tribunal or fair rent court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1099" /> I am aware of the fact that the Conroy Commission rejected the idea of any kind of a fair rent court.  However, I do not believe that it would be unworkable.  I believe that a tribunal of that sort, to which landlords and tenants could have resort, would be in a position to fix a rent having regard to the general economic and social conditions, cost of building and so on. For that reason I believe that it would be worth while in the case of a new tenancy to have some such provision.</P>
    <P>There are a few other matters to which I want to refer.  Some of them would probably be committee matters but I want to accept the invitation of the Parliamentary Secretary to refer to them now because I think it might be possible to get some further information regarding them.  I would like to say generally in relation to this Bill that it is one which sets out to repeal the entire of the 1946 Act.  I do not know what views other Deputies may have but I feel very strongly that in a Bill which is repealing the entire of another Act we should just do that and be content to do it.  Throughout this Bill we refer to the various sections and parts of the 1946 Act to such an extent as to make some sections practically unreadable.  We are doing it by reference to the Act which, by this Bill, we are trying to repeal in its entirety.</P>
    <P>I should like to give the Parliamentary Secretary an example of what I have in mind.  Section 9, subsection (2), of the Bill states:</P>
    <P>The basic rent of a controlled dwelling to which this section applies shall be determined by the Court and shall be a rent of such amount as the Court considers reasonable having regard as far as possible to the basic rents of controlled dwellings, being dwellings to which Chapter 2 of Part II of the Act of 1946 applied, which are comparable in regard to location, accommodation, amenities, state of repairs and rateable valuation.</P>
    <P>It would be much simpler to set out in this Bill what were the dwellings to which Chapter 2 of Part II of the 1946 Act applies instead of forcing landlords and tenants and their respective <Col N="1100" /> lawyers to preserve the 1946 Act which is now being repealed in order to try to understand what this present Bill means.</P>
    <P>If you look again at Section 10 of this Bill, subsection (4), you will see that it says:</P>
    <P>(a) in the case of a dwelling with respect to which there has been, during a relevant period, an excessive expenditure such as is referred to in paragraph (g) of subsection (2) of Section 11 or paragraph (e) of subsection (2) of Section 17 of the Act of 1946.</P>
    <P>That is very difficult to read and it seems to me that it might be, if not easier to read, at least less difficult to understand if we had not got these references back to this Act which is now going to be repealed in full.</P>
    <P>In regard to Section 7 of the Bill, I think what is intended is clear enough but I am merely referring to this matter so that the Parliamentary Secretary can look into it between now and the Committee Stage.  Paragraph (b) of Section 7 refers to the basic rent of certain controlled dwellings and says:</P>
    <P>A controlled dwelling in respect of which evidence is forthcoming of both of the following facts&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  that it was not so held on the first day of February, 1960,</P>
    <P>(ii)  that it was last so held on a date (in this section also referred to as the relevant date) not being more than three years before the first day of February, 1960.</P>
    <P>I think that means any date between the 1st February, 1957, and the 1st February, 1960, but it would make the section much clearer if we said that.</P>
    <P>As it reads now it says:</P>
    <P>being not more than three years before the 1st day of February, 1960.</P>
    <P>I have forgotten the equivalent section in the 1946 Act but there was some such phrase as that used in that Act and I have a distinct recollection <Col N="1101" /> of hearing it argued in Court, and, indeed, I argued it in Court myself, that the particular wording of the section did enable you to go back to the 1st February, 1957, in this case and not further back than that, but it did not put any limitation on coming forward from that date.  It is obvious that it is intended to take the period between 1st February, 1957, and 1st February, 1960.  If you were going into court under this section in the year 1965, I think it is arguable that under that section you are entitled to have regard to a rent, say, on 1st February, 1961, because that is not further back than three years before 1st February, 1960.  It is not an easy point to be clear in explaining, but I think the Parliamentary Secretary probably sees what I am getting at.  I think it is clearly intended to be between two dates but there is a ceiling put on the furthest back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If application to the court is being made in 1965, it might not be so held on 1st February, 1960, but would be so held on 2nd February, 1961.  It may be perfectly all right but I think it is a point which might be looked into.</P>
      <P>The next point to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention is in relation to Section 8 of the Bill. I should like, first of all, to make it clear that what I am saying in relation to this section is subject to some of the remarks I made in relation to Section 10.  Assuming that Section 10 remains unaltered, I think the Minister should have another look at Section 8, paragraph 2 of subsection (1).  This is the section which deals with the case the Parliamentary Secretary referred to in introducing the Bill where you have, for some reason, either a basic rent or a rent which falls short of or exceeds the basic rent and an application is made to the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the difference is one-eighth up or down on the basic rent, the court may fix what is referred to as a notional rent.  There was a similar provision in the 1946 Act in Section 15, but in <Col N="1102" /> so far as the landlord is concerned, there is a very definite alteration in the character of the section as between the 1946 Act and the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Under the 1946 Act, it was possible to go into the court in such a case as is envisaged here and make an application and if you could show that the rent, from the landlord's viewpoint, was fixed too low, you were able to get it remedied in, court.  Under this section of this Bill, you can go into the court but the landlord is now also required to show special circumstances. I do not see the reason for that.  I do not see why, if the rent which has been ascertained is too low and if a landlord is entitled to go into court, he should be deprived of remedying a rent, if it is too low.</P>
    <P>I know from my own profession in dealing with a number of those cases &mdash;other Deputies in other capacities will have come across the same thing &mdash;that very often you will find landlords whom I might describe as good and decent landlords, who, because they did not want to interfere with the tenant or because they were ignorant of their rights, did not increase their rents.  Many of them did not increase their rents even when there were rate increases.  I do not know to what extent a simple fact like that&mdash;that a landlord did not know his rights or that he felt some sympathy with the tenant&mdash;will be regarded as special circumstances for the purpose of this section.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that in these circumstances a landlord should be required to prove special circumstances in court and I can see very great difficulties with the interpretation of the section of the Bill, because I think you will have a whole new mass of case law to establish what are and what are not regarded as special circumstances.  I do not really believe that, by and large, tenants will be affected if that provision requiring the landlord to prove special circumstances is left out of the Bill, because very often the type of landlord who did not increase his rent is the very person who would be affected by this provision and probably he will not take advantage of it, in any event.</P>
    <P>There is another point also&mdash;I <Col N="1103" /> would describe it as a landlord's point &mdash;which arises in relation to Section 9.  This section deals with various matters which the Court will have regard to when they are considering the basic rent, where the application is brought under this section.  I do not know whether the Minister feels it is necessary to do anything by way of amendment but I would ask him to consider it.  Subsection (2) of Section 9 provides:</P>
    <P>The basic rent of a controlled dwelling to which this section applies shall be determined by the Court and shall be a rent of such amount as the Court considers reasonable having regard as far as possible to the basic rents of controlled dwellings, being dwellings to which Chapter 2 of Part II of the Act of 1946 applied, which are comparable in regard to location, accommodation, amenities, state of repair and ratable valuation.</P>
    <P>It does not oblige the court to have regard to additions which have been made to the rent by reason of exceptional repairs or money spent on improvements to the premises.  It may be that having regard to the state of repair of the premises would cover that.  I do not believe it would, however, because you may have two sets of premises&mdash;one of which is only in the same state of repair as the other by reason of having money spent on it.</P>
    <P>This can arise in cases where the second premises are of more recent erection or possibly are in a more sheltered part of the country.  I am not at all sure the phrase in the section that the court would have regard to the state of repair would cover that point. I think it is possible that, quite inadvertently, the court might be put in a position, as a result of this section as it stands, of depriving the owner of the premises of rights he already has or is intended to have under the 1946 Act and of which, I am quite sure, Section 9 does not intend to deprive him.  I would ask the Minister to look into that point.</P>
    <P>The Bill does, I think, effectively <Col N="1104" /> and with the assistance of the amendment in the Seanad, remedy the position of the families of contractual tenants where a notice to quit was served after the death of a contractual tenant who died intestate.  Where the notice was served before a grant was extracted, it did operate to end the tenancy and the person then in possession had not got the protection afforded to statutory tenants under the 1946 Act.  The provisions in Section 31 of the Bill certainly seem to cover that case.</P>
    <P>There is a point I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to consider again in relation to Section 46.  This is the section which relates to the recovery of a deposit made as security for the payment of rent.  The section is a new one.  It provides that where the tenancy of a controlled dwelling having terminated, possession of the dwelling is surrendered and a deposit made as security for the payment of the rent stands not repaid and, thirdly, that the person to whom the rent was last paid is not the person with whom the deposit was made, the deposit shall be deemed, for the purposes of the recovery thereof, to have been made with the person to whom the rent was last paid.</P>
    <P>I can see a number of difficulties arising for house purchasers under this provision.  A tenant who has made a deposit on the commencement of his tenancy as a security for rent might continue to be a tenant for eight, nine or ten years after.  Meanwhile, the ownership of the premises has changed hands.  The Bill does not oblige the tenant to do anything about it or disclose the position to his new landlord. We say that in those circumstances, the new landlord, because he is the new person in receipt of the rent, is going to be deemed the person who got the deposit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Parliamentary Secretary probably knows that very often the reply to the requisition on title is not to the vendor's knowledge.  While I appreciate the reasons for it&mdash;it is to protect the tenant who has parted with his money &mdash;I do think it would be no undue hardship on the tenant to provide that, where a tenant has paid a deposit to a landlord and where the ownership of the premises changes hands and a new landlord comes into being, if he is to exercise his rights under this Act, he should have the obligation of informing the new landlord within, say, a period of one month or two months that he has, in fact, made a deposit to the landlord's predecessor in title.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In some cases, he will not, if there is the same rent collector; but in very many cases, there will be a change of rent collector. The kind of case I have in mind is this.  Very often the landlord himself goes round collecting the rents.  I think it would be worth considering incorporating some such provision in the Bill.  It would not be any hardship on the tenant to have it there and it would be fair to the landlord.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to Section 50, which roughly corresponds with Section 55 of the last Act, why the power of the Minister to nominate a particular district justice to deal with rent cases is being omitted.  The Parliamentary Secretary will recollect that under the 1946 Act it is open to the Minister for Justice to nominate a particular district justice to deal with all Rent Act cases.  That authority is now being omitted here and I should like to know the reason for it.  Was it that the Minister felt that it had not worked out well?  On the face of it, it would seem to me that there are definite advantages in having the work dealt with in a specialist manner by the designation of a particular district justice to deal with the various cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> Generally speaking, I do not regard this Bill&mdash;and I think it would be a mistake so to regard it&mdash;as the final word in rent restrictions legislation. There are many features in this Bill that are welcome.  As the Parliamentary Secretary put it, it is in many respects a compromise Bill.  It is the kind of situation in which a compromise Bill is necessary because the two extremes are full control, on the one hand, or full decontrol, on the other. In the present situation, it is not possible to take action in favour of either of those extremes.</P>
    <P>I have many quarrels and other Deputies will have greater quarrels with certain sections of the Bill but by and large, it is a compromise Bill. There is good in it as well as matters about which Deputies will have complaints. I do not believe the Bill will satisfy either landlords or tenants but I cannot see any rent code which either this or any other Government may adopt having that result, in any event.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. I welcome this Bill, which brings about very many necessary improvements. The title of the Bill is &ldquo;Rent Restrictions Act, 1960&rdquo;.  Therefore, the idea of restriction is inherent in the Bill.  Deputy O'Higgins spoke as if it were designed to bring about a further increase in the cost of living. As I listened to him, I could not quite appreciate his attitude when he changed from the defence of the tenant to the defence of the landlord. All his criticisms had been levelled mainly at restrictions against the landlord and protection of the tenant. The protective clause in this Bill to ensure that a tenant who has paid a deposit will have that deposit honoured by the new landlord seems to upset him.  I cannot see any difficulty in a member of the legal profession finding out if there is any liability on the tenant, in the case of a transfer of ownership, as is done in the case of rates or other charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill because, as a layman and not as one who has experience of the matter in the legal sense, I see great reliefs and, indeed, <Col N="1107" /> the greatest of all reliefs for the tenants. This measure will remove a considerable amount of litigation from the courts.  Those of us in public life who are not professional men sometimes feel very sorry for a tenant who either goes to court or is brought to court for something that is not quite clear under other Acts, and particularly the 1946 Act.  The dispute may be about £5 or £10 a year in rent, and one side or the other is ultimately faced with costs of anything from £50 to a couple of hundred pounds.  To a great extent this Bill will put an end to those proceedings and the tenants, in time, will know their position and their circumstances.</P>
    <P>When he was introducing the Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary said it was not to be looked on as being of a permanent nature and he envisages that, at the end of 10 years, another situation will have been created.  The restrictions appertaining to this type of property became necessary when building ceased, and houses became so scarce that rapacious landlords could fix rents in accordance with need and not in accordance with what was right and just.  That began during the first World War and, until such time as a sufficient number of houses are available for our people and until such time as there is competition amongst the landlords to get tenants, it will be necessary to have the strongest possible control&mdash;in equity and within reason.  I am not prepared to argue the legal aspects of this matter.  I only know what I believe is the sense of it, and I believe that after reasoned discussions, if loopholes are found which should be closed, agreement can be reached on Committee Stage if it is shown that any section or subsection merits change.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand Deputy O'Higgins' suggestion that, on the one hand, this Bill will bring about an increase in rents and add to the cost of living.  On the other hand, he wants fair play for the landlord.  So does everyone else, but it appears to me that he does not understand that there are different kinds of repairs.  In certain <Col N="1108" /> circumstances the landlord can spend money on a house with a view to selling it, perhaps at a later period or at the immediate period, and put all the cost of that improvement&mdash;which may not be essential at all and may not be necessary&mdash;on the back of the tenant, with the result that the tenant will pay and the landlord will get a better price for the sale of his improved house.  I do not think Deputy O'Higgins appreciates that position at all.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there can be a definite need for the improvement or the keeping up of certain standards, if you like, of a house owned by a landlord, Where certain improvements are made within the house itself for the benefit of the tenant, there should be some consideration and a reasonable understanding of the percentage of the increase that should go on to the tenant.</P>
    <P>As I say, to me the main feature of this Bill is that it will bring about a great improvement in that long drawn-out legal battles and the establishment of precedents in connection with a particular house in a particular terrace in a particular district will no longer be necessary.  I imagine that when we hear discussions on the Bill there will be no objection to it on the part of those of us who are not lawyers.  Those difficulties have been going on year after year without any regular approach being made to the problem.</P>
    <P>I want, therefore, to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the lucid manner in which he dealt with the Bill in introducing it.  The need for the Bill is obvious.  I know of certain specific cases where it will be a God-send in ending long frictions and disputes, and it will bring about a better relationship between landlord and tenant than hitherto existed.  The limits of the rights of the landlord are as clearly defined as they can be and the limits of the rights of the tenants are equally so defined.  I believe that when this Bill becomes an Act and is enforced, we shall find a great deal less of this vicious litigation, to the better understanding and relationship between landlord and tenant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>Either he has not studied the main implications of the Bill or he is slightly out of touch with those of his constituents who are ordinary working-class tenants.  The first impression those of us who are not lawyers get is that the Bill is an intricate and complex measure and certainly, if I needed any confirmation of that original impression, I received it from the speech made here by Deputy O'Higgins, who is a lawyer. He intimated and forecast that, as the Bill stands, not alone will it be argued here but also in Court and there will be further unlimited litigation in respect of many parts of it.</P>
      <P>I am not competent to deal with intricate legal points of law.  However, the Labour Party propose to apply some horse sense to the measure as it passes through the House.  As the Parliamentary Secretary said, it is largely a Bill that can best be dealt with in Committee.  On the Committee Stage, we propose to tease out the many vexed questions we feel have arisen in this regard.</P>
      <P>I want to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary and the officers of his Department on the Explanatory Memorandum.  It is an admirable document and has been of great assistance to those of us who are not lawyers.</P>
      <P>In indicating that we do not propose at this stage to go into any great detail we should say that there are three or four salient points in the Bill that struck us as worthy of comment on this Stage.  First of all, there is the imposing title.  Deputy Briscoe referred to it as a Rent Restrictions Bill. We also think the imposing title is a complete misnomer.  The Bill might more appropriately be described as the landlords' Bill.  We see little or nothing in it for the tenant but quite a lot for the landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the provision regarding the <Col N="1110" /> changing of the poor law valuation from £60 to £30 in relation to Dublin and £40 to £25 in relation to other parts of the country for the control of rents.  Premises that are now subject to rent control are privately-owned unfurnished dwellings with an original valuation not exceeding £60 in Dublin and £40 elsewhere.  It is proposed to change that to £30 in Dublin and £25 elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I was hoping the Parliamentary Secretary would give us an indication of the number of houses which would be decontrolled by that section.  I have no opinion.  I do not know whether the number is large or small but this House is entitled to some indication of the number of houses whose rents will be decontrolled as a result of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>Then why put it into the Bill?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary serious that there will be none?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>How could I estimate that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary cannot estimate it, I cannot. I thought he might be in a position to obtain some information which a Deputy cannot obtain.  I have in mind some problems that might be created in that regard.  Such a provision presupposes that in places such as Dublin and Cork there are houses freely available for letting for people who arrive in these centres in the ordinary course of transfer, as far as their business is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A whole host of white-collar workers, civil servants, C.I.E. personnel, E.S.B. personnel and other such people are transferred, on promotion or otherwise, from a rural centre or to Cork or Dublin.  At the moment, it is very difficult for them to get accommodation at any reasonable rent.  I feel that the restrictions being removed by this section will make the <Col N="1111" /> problem of such individuals more difficult still.  Because of that, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary how many tenancies will be affected by this provision.  Perhaps, between now and the next Stage, he will be able to give us some indication in that regard.</P>
    <P>The second point that strikes us is that houses which under this Bill will still be kept under rent control can, if the owner occupies them for a specified period, immediately be relieved from all rent control.  I want the House to realise the seriousness of that provision.  Some controls are being removed.  Even in respect of dwellings which will still be controlled, if at any subsequent date the owner occupies such dwelling, even for a day, the house is subsequently released from control.  There is nothing in the Bill which would compel the owner to take up a <i>bona fide</i> residence in the house.  As far as I can see, it is quite open to him to carry out the strategy of getting the tenant out, of going in for a month, a week or a night, and then saying: &ldquo;I occupied that house and having occupied that house it is my house.  I occupied it; I lived there; I slept there.&rdquo;  Having done that, under the terms of this Bill, that house is subsequently, for all future lettings, removed from rent control.</P>
    <P>I would seriously ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have another look at that point.  The implications are very grave indeed.  I have no doubt he would not wish such an abuse to be perpetrated.  If he feels my interpretation of that section is correct, I would ask him to have another look at it and see if it can be tightened up.</P>
    <P>The next point that causes us particular worry is the provision which enables a landlord who is responsible for whole or partial maintenance of a dwelling to increase the basic rent by 12½ per cent.  In many ways this is really the most serious implication in the Bill.  It justifies my contention that it should be called a landlords' Bill.  This is obviously a bonus of 2/6d. in the £ to the landlord who is <Col N="1112" /> liable for repairs either <i>in toto</i> or in part.  He need not do them.  So long as it is in the terms of letting that he is liable for any part of the repairs to the house&mdash;he may be liable only for the maintenance of the bell or the knocker or a chimney or for keeping the washers on the taps&mdash;under the Bill he is entitled to increase the basic rent by 12½ per cent.</P>
    <P>My interpretation of the basic rent in the context of that section is the new rent, the consolidated up-to-date rent on 1st February or the date the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned. That provision will hit practically every tenant at the moment, whether or not his house is controlled.  When this Bill is enacted the landlord will immediately increase his rent by 12½ per cent.  There is nothing in the Bill to compel him to carry out the repairs for which he is liable.  He can say: &ldquo;I am liable for repairs.  Because of my liability in that respect, the Dáil decided I may increase the rent by 12½ per cent.  Of course, I shall not carry out the repairs.&rdquo;  I hope my reading of the Bill does not mean that the position is as open as all that, but I can see nothing which compels the landlord&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole code is full of provisions to insist that the landlord will carry out repairs which he should carry out.  There are several different provisions.  I refer to the rent restrictions code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, it will be possible for us to elicit all that information during the later Stages of this Bill.  In the main, I should like to make this comment on it.  It is stated in the explanatory memorandum, and the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned it in his introductory remarks, that he and the Government had the report of the Conroy Commission and the report of the Capital Investment Advisory Commission before them when considering the drafting of this Bill.  We should bear in mind that the Conroy Commission was set up specifically to consider, and charged specifically with considering, whether or not it was expedient to consider extending or restricting the Rent Restriction Acts of 1946 and 1949. Secondly, it was charged with considering whether it would be desirable to control rents of furnished dwellings. It was a committee set up specifically to inquire into these matters and report back to the Government.  It sat for two years and invited all interested parties to put their cases and to give evidence.  Eventually, after two years, the Commission presented what could be regarded as a unanimous report. The main recommendation was as outlined in the memorandum:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1114" /> (a) the present controls should be retained on dwellings and control should be extended so as to apply to all dwellings, whether let furnished or unfurnished and whether now in existence or to be built hereafter;</P>
    <P>They recommended complete extension of the controls as existing at that time and as they still exist.  The other main recommendation was:</P>
    <P>(b) in order to meet the increase in the cost of repairs, landlords of existing controlled premises who are responsible for all repairs should be entitled to increase the present net rents by 25 per cent.&mdash;the increase to be 12½ per cent. where the landlord is responsible for only part repairs.</P>
    <P>Having considered these points, the Government have seen fit to reject out of hand the main recommendation which was that not alone should rent control be continued as it was but further extended to all dwellings, whether dwellings which existed at that time or built subsequently.  That was rejected by the Government in the Bill and the second recommendation regarding an allowance for increases in rent for certain repairs was accepted in part, giving an increase of 12½ per cent. where the landlord is liable for part repairs.</P>
    <P>We have the second report to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred, the report of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee.  As we all know, that committee was not set up specifically to inquire into the housing problem or rents.  It was set up to inquire into and report on capital and investment generally, but it is true that in their second report there was a majority report which favoured the gradual removal of rent restrictions entirely&mdash;a majority report by six members of the committee, with two members bringing in a quite contrary report in that respect.  I think it was Lieutenant General Costello and Mr. Ruaidhri Roberts who signed the minority report.</P>
    <P>However, there eventually emerged the situation in which the Government <Col N="1115" /> were faced with two recommendations. One was from the Conroy Commission which was specifically charged with the task of examining the whole position of rent control and they brought in a recommendation which was rejected by the Government. On the other hand, the Capital Investment Advisory Committee, which was not specifically charged with such an investigation at all, brought in a majority report favouring the gradual abandonment of rent control.  We find that the Conroy Commission recommendation is rejected and that of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee accepted.</P>
    <P>Because of that, I am justified in saying&mdash;and indeed anything I have heard from the Parliamentary Secretary and from other speakers fortifies me in saying&mdash;that this is simply the thin edge of the wedge and in fact is the first instalment by way of legislation of implementation of the recommendation of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee that there should be gradual abandonment of rent control over the next 10 years.  It has been said that this is not the end of rent restrictions.  I am quite sure that it is not and that it is, as I say, simply a first instalment in that regard.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have mentioned, I want to indicate the opposition of the Labour Party to this measure, particularly in view of the fact that it is definite that there will be immediate rent increases, immediate bonuses to the landlords on the scale of 2/6d. in the £ in respect of dwellings that would still remain controlled, so far as rent is concerned; that it will throw impositions on practically every working class family which has a house from a private landlord; that it will throw impositions on the unemployed man and the man on a disability pension, on the old age pensioner and on the widow. Chiefly because of these reasons, and others which I have mentioned, we want to indicate our opposition to the Bill and we propose to deal with other matters on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say at the outset that I am strongly opposed to this Bill.  The result of this measure <Col N="1116" /> which the Government are asking us to enact will be a considerable increase in the rents of all tenants, an increase which, in my view, is not justified. There will be an increase in the rents of all the small businesses throughout the country.  In the future, where a premises becomes decontrolled, a greatly increased rent will have to be paid by future tenants and the security of tenure which is at present created by the Rent Restrictions Act will be taken away from the tenants of premises which, in the future, will be decontrolled.</P>
      <P>It is our task in this Legislature to strike a balance between the legitimate rights of landlords and the legitimate rights of tenants and, in my opinion, the balance in this Bill has been weighted heavily against tenants.  This Bill, it has been pointed out, goes directly contrary to the recommendations of an expert committee which reported eight years ago.  It goes against the experience which has resulted in the partial repeal of Rent Acts in England.  It is contrary to the experience which we had in this country when an attempt was made 34 years ago to bring about a measure of decontrol, an attempt which had to be given up.</P>
      <P>The background to this Bill has been stated by the Parliamentary Secretary in the Seanad as follows:</P>
      <P>The whole background to the Bill is that there is now an adequate supply of houses grant-aided which are available at very attractive terms.</P>
      <P>It is a fundamental defect in approach, in my opinion, that the Government have dealt with this Bill and this whole problem on the basis that there is now an adequate supply of houses grant-aided which are available at very attractive terms.  The way in which we must approach this whole problem is on the basis, not of whether there is an adequate supply of houses, but whether there is an adequate supply of houses suitable for letting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that a person can now build a house with the assistance of loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts on attractive terms. It may be that the pressure in respect of houses for persons of that class has <Col N="1117" /> now eased and that persons can, without too much difficulty, get grants and loans to erect houses, but we are dealing with a whole class of people who cannot, for one reason or another, mainly economic, perhaps social, purchase their own house and what we are concerned with are literally the thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of cases of persons, who cannot for one reason or another, purchase their own houses.</P>
    <P>What is relevant in the consideration of this problem is the number of houses suitable for letting.  I think the Government have too easily taken upon themselves the task of bringing in a measure of decontrol based on the proposition that, since the Conroy Commission reported, a great number of houses have been built by local authorities and by private persons.</P>
    <P>The commission which inquired into this problem has been regarded as a most expert commission and it has got the proper amount of praise from the Government and from other places for the report that it brought in.  This commission was fully alive to the number of premises that were being built at that time, the plans of the Government that were in operation at that time with regard to the future of publicly assisted erection of buildings.  This is the view of the Commission, at page 18, paragraph 63:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Whilst we recognise that the Rent Acts have had a deterrent effect on the investor who might otherwise have been inclined to put his money into new houses for letting, at most the Acts have only been a contributory factor in the present housing shortage.  In so far as they are a contributory factor this is due, in our opinion, to the fact that the Rent Acts operate to prevent any capital appreciation of investment in house property and make it difficult to realise capital so invested rather than to the restrictions which these Acts impose on the yield from the investment.  The development during the present century of a taste by the small investor for dealing in industrial investments, with their attractiveness of greater mobility and speedier realisation, <Col N="1118" /> has tended to divert from investment in house property money which in pre-1914 days would have been so invested.  The inflation which since 1942 has taken place in the values of uncontrolled houses, and even of controlled houses where vacant possession has been obtained, has made more noticeable this change in investors' tastes. Whenever an owner can get clear possession of a house, whether controlled or uncontrolled, he almost invariably puts it up for sale, thereby reducing the number of houses available for letting.</P>
    <P>The view of this commission was that the provisions of the Rent Acts and the prospect of future legislation would not affect the number of houses suitable for letting which would come on the market and the unanimous view contained in this report was that control brought about by the previous legislation should be continued.</P>
    <P>One of the worst features of this Bill is the decontrol of business premises.  The Parliamentary Secretary said, in answer to a query posed by Deputy Casey, that there would be no decontrol brought about by this Bill.  Every small business premises held under a tenancy of year to year or less will be decontrolled.  It is true that the tenants will be given rights under the Landlord and Tenant Act to apply for a new lease and I may say here, in parenthesis, in answer to what appeared to be the main point made by Deputy Briscoe, when he said one of the good features of this Bill was that the number of applications to the court would be reduced, one of the results of this Bill will be that thousands of tenants in small business premises will have to apply to the court, in default of agreement, to have their rights regulated under the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I misunderstood the query.  I am taking the Bill as a whole.  The Bill as a whole will introduce decontrol of all the small huckster shops in the city of Dublin and throughout the country.  All the small people who are trying to make a living out of a small shop and who are on a weekly tenancy, whose rents are controlled and whose rights to retain possession are controlled, will lose those rights.  I do not see any justification for that, nor has any argument been put up for doing that.  I intend to put down an amendment to see what the views of the Government are on it.</P>
      <P>I know the sort of theoretical argument will be made that the Rent Acts were never meant for business premises.  The fact is that for the past 30 years or so, business premises have been subject to control.  It is part of our social fabric that the ordinary small man who rents a small business on a weekly tenancy gets rights under the Rent Restrictions Act. I do not know of any argument, except a purely theoretical one not based on commonsense or on the facts of the situation or on the rights of the tenant, which would justify the taking away of control in respect of these people.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of this Bill which I regard as particularly reprehensible is the fact that dwellings which will be converted into self-contained flats in future will be decontrolled.  The Parliamentary Secretary in the Seanad said that this was one of the aspects the Government were most fond of.  I should like to refer this House to the way the Conroy Commission dealt with the problem of the conversion of houses into self-contained flats.  At page 53 of the report, the commission said:</P>
      <P>Special provisions were made for determining the Basic Rents of these flats with the object of providing a rather generous return to persons who carried out conversion of this kind.</P>
      <P>The commission goes on to show that landlords who converted their houses into self-contained flats got a rather generous return on their capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> At page 22 the commission states:</P>
    <P>It would be a departure from the precedent created by the 1946 Act if such flats were not to be controlled. The policy underlining the decision of the Oireachtas in 1946 to control self-contained flats created after 1941, notwithstanding that houses erected after that date were to be free from control, was based on the view that the conversion of houses into self-contained flats provided opportunities for exacting extortionate rents from persons obliged to avail themselves of accommodation of that kind.</P>
    <P>It was the view of the Oireachtas in 1946 that the 1946 Act gave what the Commission called a generous return to persons who converted them into self-contained flats.  As Deputies know there was a special provision in the 1946 Act for a lawful addition for landlords who converted their premises into self-contained flats and the commission points out that the view of the Oireachtas then was that the conversion into self-contained flats, if decontrolled, would mean that extortionate rents would be demanded.  Has that situation been changed since 1946 or since 1952?  It has not been changed by the fact that a number of houses on the periphery of this city have been built under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts or that a number of houses have been built by the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>What this decontrol involves is the decontrol of old houses in the city which will be converted into self-contained flats.  At the present time if a landlord thinks that he will get what the commission refers to as a generous return on his investment and if he does not avail himself of that under the provisions of the present Act, and he does it as a result of the passing of this Bill, it will only be because he will see an opportunity of getting what the commission referred to as extortionate rents.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary in the debate in the Seanad said: &ldquo;Why should a tenant go into a house and pay an extortionate rent?&rdquo;  The <Col N="1121" /> answer is that many tenants have no alternative.  Anybody conversant with the general effect of decontrolling premises or anybody conversant with conditions in this city where landlords think they can get away with not charging a controlled rent, will know that the amount that tenants have to pay in many circumstances is extortionate.</P>
    <P>I want to say in all seriousness to the Government that they should consider the proposal we are making, that is the setting up of a fair rent tribunal. They have the votes and no doubt this Bill will go through as it is, but we would in all earnestness suggest that some machinery would be established by which a tenant could apply to a court and say: &ldquo;An unfair rent is being asked from me.&rdquo;  There should be some overall jurisdiction in either the courts or a rent tribunal to see that unfair rents would not be asked. It should be possible to devise a formula which could be put into this Bill by which either a rent tribunal or the courts would say: &ldquo;In all the circumstances of this case, we think the landlord is asking an unfair rent.&rdquo;  I would strongly urge upon the Government to adopt such a safeguard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What did your expert commission say about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I remember&mdash;I speak subject to correction and I certainly shall look it up&mdash;the view was that a rent tribunal then would not be effective, but that did not close the door on it.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would look it up?  My recollection of the report of what the Parliamentary Secretary refers to as my expert commission is that they said that at that time they did not think a rent tribunal would be a good idea, but that it was something which could be considered in the Department.  Of course the reason for that was that the whole proposals were completely different from what the Government are now doing.  The Government are not now following the recommendations of the commission and are not controlling all premises. They are doing something <Col N="1122" /> which is contrary to the whole scheme proposed in that report.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said something to-day, and he said it earlier in the Seanad, which caused me a considerable amount of surprise.  If his view&mdash;and I presume it is the view of the Government&mdash;is as he said, I would welcome the statement, but I would ask him hurriedly to bring in an amendment to give effect to it.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware it is proposed in this Bill to decontrol a house which &ldquo;at the passing of this Act is occupied by the owner thereof for the purposes of his own residence, or thereafter becomes so occupied.&rdquo; It also proposes to decontrol a house of which the landlord comes into possession after the passing of this Bill if the Poor Law Valuation is over £30.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that while that decontrol would operate, if there was subsequently a letting made in the house that letting would be controlled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Of a room or a flat in the decontrolled house.  With all respect to the Parliamentary Secretary and his advisers, it is my humble view that a court would interpret that in a completely opposite sense.  If that is the contention of the Government I would ask that an amendment be brought in to make more specific this point; otherwise there certainly would be what Deputy Briscoe wants to avoid, a certain amount of litigation in this matter.  What does the Bill say?  Section 3 says: &ldquo;(1) Subject to subsection (2) of this section, this Act applies to every dwelling.&rdquo;  Then it goes on to say: &ldquo;(2) this Act does not apply to&mdash;&rdquo; and then paragraph (e) provides: &ldquo;a house which at the passing of this Act is occupied by the owner thereof ....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I apprehend that the court seeing this Section and interpreting it in a reasonable manner will say: &ldquo;This Act does not apply to this house.&rdquo; How then can it be said that a letting made in the house will be subject to the Act?  There may be legal arguments the other way but I must say that after giving it a certain amount <Col N="1123" /> of consideration it seems to me to be abundantly clear that at any rate there is danger the court will say: &ldquo;This Act does not apply to this house and certainly will not apply to a letting in it.&rdquo;  In fact, there is judicial authority in the form of a decision in the High Court for the view that in respect of premises above a certain Poor Law Valuation and decontrolled any letting made in it is not controlled.</P>
    <P>My view may be incorrect.  The Parliamentary Secretary's view may be the correct one but there is certainly considerable doubt and I would respectfully suggest that an amendment to make the matter clear would be desirable.  If I am correct and if the Bill as it stands is as I interpret it, I should like to make clear to Deputies what is involved.  Take tenements in Mountjoy Square or certain flats on the Rathmines Road or in Baggot Street as an example.  A number of these houses have a poor law valuation over £30.  If my view of this Bill is correct and if the landlord can get his tenants out, he will be able to re-let these premises, re-let the tenement houses in Mountjoy Square, at uncontrolled rents.  I certainly do not think it is desirable, and if that is not the intention of the Government I suggest an amendment be brought in to clear up the matter.</P>
    <P>I have said I object most strongly to this Bill.  One of the grounds of my objection is the proposed increase in rent on existing tenants.  Whether or not the landlord carries out repairs, he will get an increase of 12 per cent.</P>

      <P>I am not quite certain that would be the best way, but I am quite certain that the intention of the Government should be clearer than it is here.  I was dealing with the proposed increase of 12½ per cent. whether or not the landlord does the repairs.  I do not think that is justified.  Reference has been made to the position of the poorest people in our community&mdash;the old age pensioners, the widows, and the blind. They will have their rents increased whether or not the landlord does repairs.</P>
      <P>Reference was made in the course of the debate to the fact that the tenant has his remedies.  There are remedies in the Bill.  If the premises are not in reasonable repair a tenant can make an application to the court. Let me repeat that the tenant must go to the court.  He can have his rent reduced, or, in certain circumstances, he can get a lump sum to have the premises put in proper repair.  How many tenants know their rights?  How many old age pensioners will have their rents increased by this 12½ per cent. and will not know that they can go to the court?  They certainly will not bother going to the court; they will accept it as one of the inevitable hardships we put on them. I do not think we should have this automatic increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We appreciate the hardships imposed on landlords who are faced with the problem of keeping premises in proper repair.  We think that the way to deal with the problem is to give landlords a reasonable return if <Col N="1126" /> they put premises into proper repair. That was the scheme in the 1946 Act. Landlords got a handsome return on their investment if they carried out exceptional repairs on their premises.</P>
    <P>I want to refer once more to the view that one of the advantages of this Bill is that it will make the position of landlord and tenant more or less lawyer-free, if I may coin a phrase. I ask Deputies who believe that to have a look at Section 10, subsection (4), paragraph (a).  I think it is worthwhile reading the subsection to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsection reads as follows:</P>
      <P>In the case of a dwelling with respect to which there has been, during a relevant period, an excess of expenditure such as is referred to in paragraph (g) of subsection (2) of section 11 or paragraph (e) of subsection (2) of section 17 of the Act of 1946, paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of this section shall not apply in relation to the dwelling except in a case in which a relevant grant was made in respect of repairs by reference to which the excess of expenditure occurred, and, in any such case, in the calculation of the lawful addition under the said paragraph (b), the basic rent shall be reduced by the portion thereof which is attributable to the addition under the said paragraph (g) or the said paragraph (e) (as the case may be).</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Perfectly clear? There is a famous decision in the Law of Equity known as the &ldquo;Rule in Shelley's case&rdquo;.  It is a complicated legal decision and a famous judge once said: &ldquo;It is one thing to put the rule in Shelley's case into a nutshell, but it is another thing to keep it there.&rdquo;  It is one thing to grasp what this subsection means, but it is another thing to keep the meaning in one's mind.  I think I know what it means and, for the benefit of Deputies, I shall tell <Col N="1127" /> them what I think the subsection means.</P>
      <P>As Deputies know, under the Housing Acts grants are given mainly to landlords to carry out repairs.  As Deputies are also aware, if exceptional repairs are carried out landlords are entitled to get an increase in rent&mdash;an increase under the old Act under Section 11 (2) (g) or Section 17 (2) (b) as the case may be.  It was provided&mdash; very wisely provided&mdash;that, if a landlord availed himself of grants under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, he would not be entitled to take the benefit of the grant which the public authority would give him; the tenant was entitled to get the benefit of these grants.  But if a landlord carried out and did exceptional repairs, and got assistance from the local authority for doing that, he could then put up the tenants' rents.  That was perfectly reasonable.  Do you know what is hidden away in that subsection? What is hidden is a repeal of that in certain circumstances and I shall put down an amendment to this subsection to try to find out how a change in that position is justified.</P>
      <P>As I interpret this section, subparagraph (b) of subsection (2) is that which provides that in the case of a landlord liable for the whole or part of the repairs to a dwelling, a sum equal to 12½ per cent. of the basic rent is to be a lawful addition.  The subsection I have been referring to reads as follows:</P>
      <P>In the case of a dwelling with respect to which there has been, during a relevant period, an excess of expenditure such as is referred to in paragraph (g) of subsection (2) of Section 11 or paragraph (e) of subsection (2) of Section 17 of the Act of 1946, paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of this section shall not apply in relation to the dwelling...</P>
      <P>May I stop there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a landlord has availed himself of the lawful additions to which he is entitled under the previous Act, on putting the premises into a reasonable state of repair by expenditure on exceptional repairs, then it is provided <Col N="1128" /> that that landlord is entitled to get a 12½ per cent. increase.  That is perfectly reasonable because the whole purpose of the 12½ per cent. increase is to make up to a landlord the cost of carrying out repairs.  Now, what this subsection says is that if, in fact, before this Bill is passed he has already put the premises into repair and got an increase in his rent for so doing, then he is not entitled to a 12½ per cent. increase. Again, I think that is reasonable but what this subsection goes on to do is to make exceptions.  It states:</P>
    <P>...except in a case in which a relevant grant was made in respect of repairs by reference to which the excess of expenditure occurred, and, in any such case, in the calculation of the lawful addition under the said paragraph (b), the basic rent shall be reduced by the portion thereof which is attributable to the addition under the said paragraph (g) or the said paragraph (e) (as the case may be).</P>
    <P>He is not entitled to the whole 12½ per cent. increase but, if he gets a grant, he is still entitled to increase his rent if he has spent money on exceptional repairs.  This is what the situation will be.</P>

I say the Government should give better reasons for this provision.  I should like to explain how it is going to work. Take two houses side by side, two different landlords, with tenants in controlled premises.  One landlord does exceptional repairs; he slates the house, puts on new down-pipes and points the house, and he does not get any grant for doing that.  He does not get any increase in his rent.</P>

      <P>Very handsome. Take the next door dwelling house where the landlord carries out repairs and he does not get any increase because the tenant is entitled to get the benefit of the housing grant but, under this section, we are going to increase that tenant's rent, so that you have two houses side by side, one house with the rent not increased, and the other with an increase because a grant was obtained.  I think that is a subsection that should be amended and I intend to table an amendment to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision in this Bill for preserving the rights of tenants who are in premises which are not in <Col N="1130" /> proper repair, and an application can be made to the court to reduce the rent under Section 15.  That right was there under the 1946 Act.  There is a provision under the 1946 Act by which a landlord can apply to the courts for an order to have a lump sum spent on the premises if they are not in reasonable repair.</P>

      <P>Sorry, the tenant, not the landlord, but this Bill proposes to amend what was Section 48 in the 1946 Act by adding a new sub-clause which provides that an order may not be made, that is to say, an order directing the landlord to carry out repairs or to give a sum of money to the tenant for the purpose of carrying out repairs.  Such an order will not be made if, having regard to the age, condition, character and situation of the premises, the cost of putting them into good and tenantable repair would involve an expenditure which would be excessive, having regard to the value of the dwelling or the rent which a tenant might reasonably be expected to pay, or a dwelling could not be put into good and reasonable repair except by being rebuilt or structurally altered too substantially.  These words are taken from the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.  At present they are being subjected to judicial interpretation by the Supreme Court and I do not think it is a good idea to put them into this section of the Bill.  I can see the object of it.  The object is not to make a landlord do something which would be completely uneconomic, which would be completely stupid to require him to do, but I think the protection provided already in that matter is a discretionary one.  The Act says the court &ldquo;may&rdquo; make an order, and the court then exercises its discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect if these clauses are inserted, a situation will result of which I have only recently had experience, where premises have got into a bad state of repair, where rain is pouring in, where the landlord is doing nothing, and where the tenant has a right to ask for something to be done about the premises, but the landlord can <Col N="1131" /> say, under this provision, that in order to put these premises into reasonable repair the expenditure would be excessive, would be out of all proportion, and he can get away with it. I do not think we should pass a Bill to deal with that.  I think we should leave it to the courts to interpret in a fair way.  I think we should leave it on a basis where discretion may be applied.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is one which should be left in.  There is another aspect of this Bill, a technical aspect, but I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to investigate it.  It concerns the position arising on the death of a tenant, which, as Deputy O'Higgins pointed out, has been very rightly dealt with by the section, but I do not think it has gone <Col N="1132" /> far enough.  As Deputies are aware, the line of decisions in this country and in England on this matter have resulted in the fact that if a tenant dies intestate and if the landlord can serve notice to quit which expires before letters of administration are taken out, the Rent Acts do not apply and the landlord is entitled to get possession.  That was an anomalous and unreasonable interpretation of the Act and certainly not what was intended. Therefore, it is right it should be remedied.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw attention to a decision reported in the current number of <i>The Irish Jurist.</i>  It is a case called Deans v. Kelly decided in Wicklow by the Circuit Court judge. On appeal to the Supreme Court it was decided if a tenant dies intestate and his administrator is in possession of controlled premises as administrator, he is not entitled to the benefit of the Act.  I would ask that this matter be gone into and a further amendment be made in this subsection. It is a very recent decision which has further refined the law on this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This subsection deals with the case of intestacy and deals with the tenancy of a non-statutory tenant which is terminated before administration or where the administrator is not in occupation. It has to go further.  It has to deal also with the position of administrators who are in occupation, because they, as a result of this decision, are not controlled by the Rent Acts.  I would suggest, too, that this particular part of the Act should also deal with the position of tenants who die testate and who appointed executors, because the situation there is also confused and it could also work hardship on tenants.  If an executor is out of possession and if he has taken out a grant of probate, he may not get the benefit of the Act if he has not distributed the deceased's assets and the landlord may be able to obtain possession.  What we have got to do is to get as much uniformity in the law as possible.  I welcome the fact that an attempt has been made to alter the law in this regard and rectify the position that has arisen, but I think care should be taken that more <Col N="1133" /> loopholes are not left and that the whole position arising on the death of a tenant should be carefully gone into.</P>
    <P>These are just a couple of minor matters to which I want to make reference. It has been provided under the previous Act that it is not permissible to assign a statutory tenancy, but it has been decided it can be sublet. There is a distinction there which I do not think is a correct one.  If we have decided correctly not be assigned, tory tenancy should not be assigned, I do not think it should be permitted to be sublet also.</P>
    <P>There is just one other minor matter, that is, the position in some of these sections dealing with applications to the court.  There is a section, to be welcomed, which gives power to the court to grant second stays in the event of an order for possession being made and a stay of execution being placed on it.  Under the present system, if such an order is made and a tenant makes one slight slip in failing to pay his rent on the appointed time or fails to comply with complete accuracy with the terms of the stay, the stay is automatically removed and the tenant is without redress.  I think it advisable that the power to grant second stays should be given to the courts, which is provided for in Section 33, but reference is made to an application to the court.  I would suggest it be made clearer that the application can be by notice of motion or whatever way it is intended.  A number of Acts get into the Statute Book in which it is stated an application can be made to the court in certain circumstances.  What frequently happens is that no rules of court are made and no procedure is set out for such applications, and they have very frequently to be brought by an extensive and long drawn-out substantive action.  This sort of thing should as far as possible be avoided.</P>
    <P>I should also like to agree with Deputy O'Higgins when he suggests that reference to the earlier Act should, if possible, be done away with.  It is, I can see, an attractive way to draft legislation.  It makes it, <Col N="1134" /> perhaps, easy to draft, but it makes it much more difficult to interpret. What we should aim at is as simple a code as possible&mdash;a code which is very clear and easily understood and which will not discriminate.  I would suggest that the references to the 1946 Act should be deleted and in their stead, it should be made clear what is intended.</P>
    <P>These are matters of detail which can be gone into on Committee Stage, but on the question of the substance of this Bill, I think the Government have worked on a fundamentally wrong premise in believing that there will not be extortionate rents arising from decontrol.  They have worked on a fundamentally wrong premise in saying that landlords, whether or not they do repair, are to get a 12½ per cent. increase.  This Bill will work hardship on the very weakest sections of the community as well as others&mdash; the section of the community it should be our concern to protect.  For that reason, we shall vote against this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill requires the mind of a lawyer.  There is so much in it that, unless you spent a long time studying it, you could not make head or tail of it.  I imagine that the person it is proposed to affect, the man-in-the-street, will hardly be aware of its contents. In my opinion, all this business should be simplified and presented in such a way that the people it affects can understand it.  When this Bill is passed, I do not think the people will know their rights.  Hundreds of simple people come to me asking what they will do.  There have been discussions here about unscrupulous landlords. Most people are unscrupulous if they can get away with it, but there are certainly unscrupulous landlords, especially new landlords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a house is sold, the new landlord specialises in trying to get rid of the tenants.  People have told me of cases where they refused to take the rent.  I asked the Minister for Justice on a previous occasion to do something about this and he said he would keep it in mind when introducing the next Rent Restrictions Bill.  The practice is that they do not ask for <Col N="1135" /> rent.  They wait for four or five months and in various ways try to get the tenant out, informing them, at the same time, that they will not take action for recovery of rent, if they get out peaceably.  That is one means of getting rid of tenants.  Those people are psychologists.  They know that poor persons cannot save money and after five or six months, hand out five or six months' rent.  Knowing he owes rent and fearing and not understanding the courts and not wanting to have anything to do with them, the tenant gets out.</P>
    <P>I know of cases of that sort and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he has anything in the Bill to compel landlords to accept rent.  Is there any penalty where rent is refused?  That is a form of blackmail that is commonly practised.  I have experience of a person actually paying rent for three years and never getting a receipt.  This person was, with two others, in a dwelling that was bought and the landlord managed to get rid of the other two, but this man continued on and sent the rent by post for three years.  It is a battle between the two.  Is it fair that people should be open to this form of blackmail?  The Parliamentary Secretary should keep an eye on this practice of refusing to accept rent.</P>
    <P>Another case that came to my notice over the past few months was a letting as caretaker, a bogus method.  I know a case in Dublin where the tenants were let two rooms, one of which was a stone floor basement and the other a room on an upper floor.  They were charged 18/- for the two rooms, but, mark you, they were made tenants of the stone floor basement and caretakers of the better room.  When the tenants went to court to have the rent reduced, they got the reduction&mdash; 50 per cent.&mdash;but the landlord went to court and asked for possession, on the ground that they were the caretakers of the better room and the Justice made the required order.  Therefore the person was liable for full rent of 18/- for the stone floor basement. This is another way in which landlords can get around the law and I should like the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1136" /> to define &ldquo;caretaker&rdquo; in the Bill so that we shall not have this practice in future.</P>
    <P>As regards the 12½ per cent. increase for repairs, because of the operations of local bodies, landlords in the main are doing well.  Any family of three and upwards is housed by the local authority and landlords can re-let at double the rent and charge key money of £10 to £20.  They do not need this increase and, for the Parliamentary Secretary's information, in many cases no receipt is given for the key money.  You pay it or you do not get the premises.  What answer has the landlord to that?  I know dozens of cases of people paying out from £10 to £20 and getting no receipt. This is one means by which the unscrupulous can beat the tenant and there are many others.  The Minister should make this Bill comprehensive, so as to protect the tenant against this kind of roguery.</P>
    <P>I have little more to say because I am not a lawyer but I know the tenants' grievances and I want the Minister to know that it is too easy to threaten tenants or to blackmail them because they do not like going to court or even to a solicitor.  The Parliamentary Secretary should try to protect the tenant, and, in my opinion, Bills such as this should be simplified so that the people can read about their rights in the Press.  They know as much about the present Bill as they knew about the previous ones when they were introduced, but the landlords will know all about it because they are clever people.  In many cases, they are solicitors themselves or they have agents as solicitors and they get their solicitors to blackmail or threaten the tenants by putting their demands in legal language.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider all these points regarding unscrupulous landlords and to see that tenants are protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as has already been remarked, is the latest of a series of complicated legislation, and right from the time of the first World War, when attempts were made to control rents and tenants' interests <Col N="1137" /> on houses up to the present day, there has been a problem.  This Bill comes in a kind of a recurring pattern.  If my memory serves me, it was after the first World War when restrictions were first brought in that efforts were made in the 1920's towards decontrol and the trend went the other way. During the last war, enforcement of control by the 1944 Order was necessary.</P>
      <P>I remember&mdash;and I think other Deputies also remember&mdash;the atmosphere in which we discussed the 1946 Bill here.  I think it was in 1945 or early in 1946.  At that time, there were two conflicting approaches: one was the approach that we all had, in the hope of peace, towards more freedom after war-time restrictions, and the other was the approach to protection of tenants' interests, tenants who had no other protection.  In the atmosphere of post-war expansion and inflation, it seemed to the House that it was all the more necessary to maintain the restrictions.  The result was that the 1946 Act appeared as a rational consolidation, as far as possible, of the rent restrictions code up to that time and a very real effort was made to bring certainty into the law in the matter of basic definition and basic procedures.  There was, for instance, the definition of &ldquo;controlled premises&rdquo;, the definition of &ldquo;basic rent&rdquo;, &ldquo;permitted increases&rdquo; and so on.  These were worked out in considerable detail first by the Department and were then subject to considerable and very careful examination in the House, particularly on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was hoped that when the Bill went forth at that time, it would bring such regularity into the law as would at least avoid further litigation and I think one of the great hopes which the Legislature had at the time was that many cases that had been going to the courts in a steady stream before that would cease to go there and that rights could be determined without incessant litigation.  In those days, I think it was a regular feature in Dublin Circuit Court at any rate, to find cases under this Act appearing so regularly that <Col N="1138" /> time was specially allocated for them. Those were the motives and the purposes in bringing in the Act.  Anybody who studies the 1916 Act will see that it consolidated the law and improved the law and one would have thought that it brought certainty.</P>
    <P>However, it is inevitable that where you have legislation of this kind you will have contention.  The 1946 Act gave rise to a very substantial number of applications and to a certain amount of litigation.  I do not think, therefore, that it is realistic to hope that this Bill will operate as a measure to settle the law for all time and minimise applications to the courts.  By its very terms, it seems to me that we can expect a continuance of applications to the courts and I therefore feel that Deputies who approach it from the point of view that it will bring certainty into the law are over-optimistic.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, provided there is expedition and reasonableness as to costs, I think there is no fairer way of having such matters decided in the best interests of the parties contesting them and of the community as a whole than that the courts should deal with them.  I think there should be a limit to the desire here to keep everything out of the courts and to keep everything simple.  What we should try to do is to give the courts a code which they can administer upon terms which they can decide in the most equitable way as between the parties concerned.  That should be our aim rather than straight-forward simplicity. You will not be able, in the historical circumstances of this matter, to get straight-forward simplicity.</P>
    <P>Before going into the details of this legislation at all we ought to address ourselves, in Committee Stage, to try to provide a consistent code so that the courts will be able to operate quickly and with minimum costs to litigants and with maximum certainty for them.  That requires that these provisions should be set forth in a methodical way with reference to previous legislation.  At this point I, as one who, in other days had a little experience of those matters, join in the plea to the Parliamentary Secretary that the point made first by Deputy O'Higgins in relation to references <Col N="1139" /> to the 1946 Act is worth considering.</P>
    <P>It is simple and direct and, even from the lawyers' point of view, sometimes useful to have direct references like that.  There are advantages in having such references back but there are also disadvantages and, in the case of a complicated code like this, these disadvantages clearly outweigh the advantages.  Even if you repeal the Act and try to have a completely new Act, there are a number of decisions under the 1946 Act, and Acts before that, which conceivably can be brought to bear on the discussion of that provision.  I think it would be neater and more helpful to lawyers advising clients and contesting cases in the courts, and to the layman who may have some idea of understanding this for himself, if the provisions referred to here were redrafted.  I know that it will mean more drudgery and more drafting and that the Bill itself will be longer.  As against that you have the disadvantages of legislation by reference, which, I think, have been discussed here on more than one occasion.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, I think Deputy O'Higgins had quite a point when he said that it is bad enough to legislate by reference when referring to live legislation but that legislating by reference to repealed legislation makes for maximum difficulty.  All of us who had experience in the courts have had experience of the unexpected interpretations that can occur from the juxtaposition of sections out of different Acts in the one code or sometimes in the one Act.  The possibility of these unforeseen interpretations can never be completely killed in an Act itself but you will minimise unforeseen interpretations in any code if you can achieve the ideal&mdash;have one Act, have it all in one Act and abolish all anterior Acts.  If you succeed in doing that, you will have nothing more to deal with than the one live Act and whatever residuary decisions there are in important cases.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, that very procedure has the advantage that it lends more weight to the Act as against authority. If you manage to get everything <Col N="1140" /> within the confines of one Act, you automatically minimise by relation to that Act all decisions made under previous legislation, even though they relate to the same form of words.  If you keep these Acts alive even by implication, even by reference back, you have the rather contradictory and difficult position for the lawyer and for the judge that you have an Act which is ostensibly repealed but which is sufficiently alive in the legal sense that it is interpretable as an Act by virtue of the reference.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have said that at some length and perhaps Deputy O'Higgins referred to it more concisely.  Deputy Costello has also referred to it.  I certainly feel that whatever emerges from this discussion should be a neat job and that it will do what it purposes to do.  I would go so far as to suggest that if the Parliamentary Secretary and the draftsman find it too difficult to do precisely what we have asked for in the first instance, they should at least extract the referred sections as such and improve them in a Schedule to this Bill, thereby doing an equally neat job.  It would simply mean referring, say, this section to the Schedule and re-enacting for that purpose in the Schedule, even if only for the purpose of the 1946 Act, these sections referred to.</P>
    <P>Some such device as that seems to me to be indicated.  In saying these things, I do not want to take from the complimentary things that have been said by other speakers and I expect the Parliamentary Secretary will take such suggestions as I have made in the constructive spirit in which they are offered.  There is no doubt this Bill itself is best discussed in detail on Committee Stage.  It is a Committee Stage Bill and for a thorough discussion on it later, we would need to take in with us the 1946 Act in order to see where we start and to make the relevant comparisons. A detailed discussion of that nature is out of place on the Second Stage.</P>
    <P>We can, on this Stage, however, revert to some of the broader problems arising from this Bill.  One is struck, <Col N="1141" /> when examining the Bill, by the very similarity of some of its problems with the existing code.  That is altogether understandable.  The Parliamentary Secretary has told us about the Conroy Commission and about the changed circumstances and the changed trends since then.  Circumstances do change but I would point out that there has been for 40 years a continuing code of legislation that has crystallised itself in certain directions and we are obviously not in a position to cast it aside and completely to revolutionise the situation as it is.</P>
    <P>Somebody spoke about control and decontrol.  This problem cannot be solved in that way.  Anybody who looks at the realities of the situation must realise there must be some control.  To my mind a certain element of control in these matters will be required, of necessity, for as long as I can foresee, for as long as we have the system of tenanted property&mdash;of people renting accommodation from others.  Straightaway, of course, you have the development of public authority housing which is quite a different field, but there is a very substantial area where the relationship as between the landlord and the tenant &mdash;in the sense of an individual renting property from another individual or a body corporate which is not a State body&mdash;will continue.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, I think every Deputy here who stops to think will realise that control of some sort must be kept.  What is the basis of that control to be?  When I ask that question, I am asking precisely the question we examined so very thoroughly in this House in 1946, and I am asking a question in relation to which the basic facts are still the same as they were in 1946&mdash;the necessity for protecting the tenant in the relatively disadvantageous position he is <i>vis-a-vis</i> the landlord.</P>
    <P>Therefore, nobody is going to apologise for the continuation here of the general code enshrined in the 1946 Act.  Naturally, as has been pointed out, times are changing, trends are different.  Basic rents, lawful additions and so forth come under review, but basically the situation is the same and <Col N="1142" /> basically the question is: was the scheme we decided upon in the 1946 Act a reasonable one and a good one? Should it be tossed aside and replaced completely by something absolutely new or should it be allowed to continue, though in a new guise?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Minister and his Department have come to the conclusion that it is the latter course that must be adopted and I think those of us who look at the thing intently will agree.  On the other hand, in the pattern of the changing times and circumstances, there are areas of decontrol and there are points where an adjustment of equity is called for in present circumstances.  There is hardly a Deputy who cannot tell stories of hard cases of tenants and their difficulties but it is true also to say that there is hardly a Deputy who has not had argued to him the other point of view.</P>
    <P>But, for the Parliamentary Secretary, and for us now, one problem looms foremost, that is, the maintenance of property in a tenantable state.  The result of our legislation to date in certain respects has been that landlords have not been as assiduous in the maintenance of property and in repairing property as one might expect, having regard to the fact that it is their own property.  When they are asked why, in their own interest, they did not keep their property in repair, why they let it deteriorate, the answer is it would not pay them to bring it into repair, that, on balance, the most economical thing was to take out of it what was left and let it ride for as long as it would.</P>
    <P>That is a social problem, one vitally affecting the tenant, and though all of us will be disturbed by the provisions of Section 10, nevertheless we shall find on that section material for fruitful and, I hope, constructive thinking. I wonder if Deputy M.J. O'Higgins has adverted to the interesting situation where if repairs are not done, the tenant has certain remedies?  I think that in this matter we have a problem which should not be discussed merely from the viewpoint that it is a benefit for the landlord.  We have to consider also what is the best thing in the long <Col N="1143" /> run for the tenant.  I hope that this Bill, like the 1946 Bill, will be approached in this House in a constructive spirit.</P>

      <P>When speaking on this matter on the last day, I emphasised that the Fine Gael Party had already announced it was part of their policy to introduce legislation to permit tenant occupiers to purchase out their ground rents.  The fact that this motion is moved by the Labour Party indicates that that is the outlook of the Labour Party in regard to the problem of ground rent.  It may be argued by the present holders of ground rents that to abolish ground rents would do them serious injury and deprive them of certain property rights which they have.  The same can be said of any means by which people held private property in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my contention that this matter of ground rents is being discussed in this country for the past 70 years.  As far back as the year 1889, there was a committee on town holdings which considered this matter.  Any people who have bought ground rents, certainly in our lifetime, have done so at their own peril.  Any person who now or in future years buys ground rents is doing so in the full knowledge that two political Parties in this State are pledged to abolish this feudal property right of ground rents.  They do so at their own peril.  They have <Col N="1144" /> no right to expect that in another generation, ten years, twenty years or less, they can expect to get as compensation the price which they are paying on what is now a monopoly market.</P>
    <P>It is a monopoly market because only those with large amounts of money can purchase ground rents at the highly competitive prices now offered.  The ordinary individual paying ground rent has an extremely remote hope of ever purchasing that ground rent.  It is almost invariably the practice that it is purchased by some person or other who has thousands of pounds or hundreds of thousands of pounds at his back.  The number of cases in which an individual ground rent is sold are few and far between.  If they are sold at all, more often than not they are sold to the occupier.  It is because it is a monopoly market, a market reserved for those with vast sums of money, that anything up to 15 or 18 years purchase is paid for a ground rent. The tenants are unable to compete at that level.  That is why this motion deserves support.</P>
    <P>The intention behind it is that the tenant occupier who has purchased a substantial interest in the property should be allowed to get rid of this vexatious private tax which is imposed on him because some people think it more important to maintain a feudal aristocracy in the twentieth century than to give moral justice to the small man.  I believe it is far more important to encourage people to purchase their own houses.  It is far more important that people should get a sense of ownership over what they are paying for.  That is what this motion endeavours to achieve.</P>
    <P>In his remarks moving this motion, Deputy Larkin referred to the fact that a great number of our citizens purchased their houses under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts scheme which allows them to collect loans from local authorities or are buying by means of building societies or through an insurance company. People who own property on the outskirts of our cities and towns would <Col N="1145" /> not have made the colossal profits they made in ground rents or in the sale of land in recent years were it not for the fact that Oireachtas Éireann introduced many Acts which enabled people on limited means to purchase their houses.</P>
    <P>These people acquired great wealth. They acquired a system of personal property for themselves because of the social legislation passed by the Parliament of Ireland.  I think they have no right to expect that we would tolerate a situation in which socially desirable legislation is going to pass profits into the pockets of private people.  That is what happened under our various Housing Acts and various schemes, public and private, which have been in operation for the past 30 or 40 years enabling people to purchase houses.</P>
    <P>It is argued by the people who are in favour of maintaining this feudal system that it is nothing to get heated about; that the rents are very small in any event.  In relation to the outgoings which any property owner has, a levy of £12 or £15 per annum, which is an average rent for newly-built houses, is small but I do not think that is an answer.  It is a privately-imposed tax on what is substantially the property of another and on that account I think it unfair.</P>
    <P>The usually imposed ground rent on houses built in the past five years for a plot of land 50 × 60 is about £15 per annum.  Over a period of 999 years that would amount to approximately £15,000.  To my mind it is farcical that any person by an accident of history should have, because of social legislation, that profit put into his lap.  I cannot see it is unfair or unethical on the part of those opposed to ground rents to say that is a gross and exorbitant profit and one that should not be continued.</P>
    <P>It is also argued that the cost of acquiring ground rents is prohibitive and that people would not acquire them.  I do not think that is so.  The very few houses available at the present moment without a ground rent have imposed on them an additional £150 to £200 over and above the <Col N="1146" /> actual cost of the building.  This is supposed to be compensation to the owner of the land because they cannot earn a ground rent.</P>
    <P>It is argued by those who do not believe that ground rents should be abolished that you would discourage people from buying their own houses if they had to pay that extra £150 to £200.  Let this be appreciated: if we no longer allow people to charge ground rent on land, then the earning capacity of the land no longer exists and, therefore, there is no longer any justification for imposing a fine of £200 to substitute for a rent which, by law, could not exist.  I believe that if we were to pass a law prohibiting the creation of any new ground rents, this notional fine of £200 on a plot of land would no longer exist and it is certain that those who own land in areas where there is a demand for houses would be quite willing to sell their land at the open market price without any consideration for ground rent.</P>
    <P>It is purely theoretical objection to argue that the abolition of ground rents would increase the initial cost of house purchase.  At the moment it is not theoretical because land can earn ground rent.  If a man has plot A, he can charge £15 per annum on it, and plot B exactly beside plot A under the existing legal position, can also earn a rent of £15.  If a rent is not charged on it, the landlord charges an extra £150 or £200 fine to compensate for the loss of rent.  Abolish the right to charge rent at all and the landlords could no longer get any compensation for a profit which the law would not entitle them to earn, in any event.</P>
    <P>It is also argued by those who favour the continuation of the ground rent system that long leases on estates preserve the amenities of the estates, because the landlord retains certain control whereby he can prevent undesirable development.  If it is a residential area, he can prevent the erection of shops and factories.  It is argued that if the ground rent system is abolished, control goes with it.  I do not agree.  I think our local authorities <Col N="1147" /> superintend the development of different areas adequately.  I do not believe that we need any more legislation to give local authorities control over the type of dwelling or building that can be erected, or the manner in which it can be used.  We all know that local authorities have power at the moment to prevent the owner of a private house from converting his drawingroom into a shop.</P>
    <P>There are ample powers under our legislation as it exists.  I believe local authorities have the power to superintend the development of estates and areas, and, even if they have not the detailed power which landlords have, there is no reason whatsoever why we should not confer that power on them and preserve the one advantage the ground rent system has&mdash;the advantage whereby some independent and impartial person can control the general development of an estate.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what investment in ground rent produces.  Does it produce any new wealth?  Is it a productive investment?  Is it the kind of investment which is nationally desirable because it produces new resources and new wealth?  I do not think any person can seriously suggest that it is. I believe investment in ground rent is a deadweight investment which will produce nothing new.  It does not produce houses: it does not produce goods: it does not produce services. It is extraordinary that no accurate statistical assessment has been made of the amount of money tied up in this country in unproductive investment in ground rents.  I venture to say the figure runs into hundreds of millions of pounds, producing no wealth and serving no useful purpose whatsoever. I have a feeling that if we were to abolish ground rents, we would release for productive purposes a colossal amount of wealth which is invested in this system of private tax levies.  That would be socially desirable, and for that reason I believe the motion deserves support.</P>
    <P>It is suggested, too, by some people, that to abolish ground rents by one stroke of the pen would be unfair to <Col N="1148" /> certain charities and trusts.  To use that argument is to use the old argument: &ldquo;Don't hit me now with a baby in my arms.&rdquo;  I do not think society can be held up to ransom because certain charities or trusts may have money invested in ground rents.  A red light of warning has already been flashed in this House on other occasions when a substantial and representative number have gone into the Division Lobby and voted against ground rents.  If the bell was not heard tolling in the past, I am glad this motion allows it to be tolled once again.</P>

I would ask the House seriously to consider the matters I have mentioned and to allow it to go on record that this Dáil, at the opening of the 6th decade in this century, is opposed to the maintenance of a feudal system which imposes a private tax on private property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>To regard this question of rents purely as a remnant of the feudal system is to express a complete misapprehension of all the most important factors of the case.  I am surprised Deputy Ryan does not appear to understand the way in which a building site is developed and the way that development is financed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A builder may buy a site which he intends to develop for building.  He has, first of all, to pay the purchase price for the land itself, and then develop it by putting in roads, pathways, lighting, drainage and other services. He can then begin to let it as sites and erect his buildings and he usually charges a small capital sum for the site.  In each case, he charges for the erection of the house and he charges a rent.  When the entire building estate has been fully developed and the houses sold and occupied, the builder then proceeds to sell the ground rent.  Insurance companies are frequent purchasers of ground rents of <Col N="1149" /> this nature, which they buy as an investment, and the return which the builder receives from them is enough to compensate him for his costs of acquisition and development and to leave him a profit.</P>
    <P>From what Deputy Ryan said this evening, anyone who makes a profit from the development of a building estate should be ashamed of himself as having done something anti-social. It is a fantastic idea that everyone should work at cost for the good of the community, without making a profit for himself.  I should have thought that even Deputy Ryan would appreciate that.  It is essential for a builder and for everyone else to make a profit.  It is essential even for a solicitor to make a profit and it is very desirable that he should do so, if he wishes to stay in business at all.</P>
    <P>If rents were to be abolished, no new rents could be created and anyone developing a building site would have to charge more as a capital sum for each house.  This would inevitably increase the initial cost of the house to the purchaser.  It would increase the amount of the deposit which he would have to pay.  It would increase the stamp duty which he would have to pay on the conveyance to him and it would increase the amount of money he would have to raise by way of mortgage, with increased stamp duty on that as well.  The result would be that the initial cost to each purchaser of a freehold house would be considerably greater than the initial cost of a leasehold house.  It would have to be.  It is no use for Deputy Ryan to shake his head.  One cannot get around the actual facts.</P>
    <P>The builder has got to get his money from somewhere.  If he can get it by creating a rent which is really no burden whatsoever to a tenant he is doing a very good day's work not only for himself but for the prospective purchaser as well.  Deputy Ryan admitted that the load of the average ground rent is very light.  If this is a fact, as I believe it to be and as Deputy Ryan believes it to be, I cannot see any reason for the introduction of this motion, except as a vote-catching measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Larkin can do so either.  A ground rent is a very light load.  It does not bear heavily on any section of the community.  Its incidence substantially reduces the initial cost of the purchase price of the house.  I challenge anyone to deny it.  If ground rents are abolished the initial cost of a new house will substantially be increased. Why anybody should regard that as desirable, I do not know.  According to Deputy Ryan, it is Fine Gael policy to wipe out ground rents altogether. I understand now from gestures from the front bench of the Opposition that as usual Deputy Ryan is wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>It is awfully nice of Fine Gael to propose to introduce legislation to permit them to do something which they are not forbidden to do at the moment.  If what you mean is to enable them, by giving them grants to do it, that is an entirely different matter.  What Deputy Ryan went on to say, as a natural corollary, <Col N="1152" /> was that the creation of new ground rents should be made impossible.  I gather from him that that is Fine Gael policy also.  Now, I understand from Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, who is shaking his head, that as usual Deputy Ryan is misquoting Fine Gael policy. This does lead to a considerable confusion. Deputy Ryan always insists he is speaking for Fine Gael and almost invariably he has to be chastened by his own front bench.  I sympathise with both of them.</P>
      <P>The control of estates by landlords is a matter very much in the interests of the tenants.  I should be surprised if Deputy Ryan has not received complaints, as has any other solicitor and Teachta Dála, from a tenant in a building estate that his neighbour down the road is doing something to which he objects.  He will say:&ldquo;I have applied to the local authority and they say they cannot stop him from doing that.&rdquo;  They cannot stop him from keeping hens or pigs in his back garden.  So long as he is not creating a danger to public health the local authority cannot do it.</P>
      <P>Most estate-owners and estate developers insert provisions to protect all the tenants against the misuse of premises by any one of them.  The maddening thing about tenants is that they always like restrictions on neighbours but are very resentful about restrictions on themselves.  We have to be realistic about this.  If the restrictions contained in the covenants of a normal lease were entirely abolished it would give rise to much greater discontent than could possibly be compensated for by a mere lack of a payment of £10 per year ground rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impression has been given this evening that this is purely a relic of the feudal system, that the unfortunate tenant is the honest working-man who is being ground down by a perfectly appalling, ruthless landlord who charges rent to him just for the sheer greed of it and inserts restrictive covenants in his lease just for the fun of being oppressive.  Deputy Ryan knows that is absolute nonsense and, if he does not, I hope he will discover it before too long.  In actual fact, these restrictive covenants are put there for <Col N="1153" /> a very good purpose&mdash;for the protection of the entire community.  They are not unduly restrictive; they tend to keep up the general standard of a locality and to make it uniform, which is good.</P>
    <P>When it can be established that these covenants are not unduly restrictive and when it is established and admitted that the load of ground rent is a very small proportion of the outgoings on any average house, I can see no reason for the introduction of this motion unless it be purely as a vote-catching measure.</P>

      <P>This motion was described by Deputy Booth as a vote-catching motion.  I hope it does catch votes because I think the purpose behind it should be passed into legislation.  The motion is not one such as Deputy Booth suggested. It is a motion in simple terms to give the right to owners of dwellings and business premises in cities, towns and villages to purchase on equitable terms ground rents to which their houses might be subjected.  Deputy Booth seems to think that such a change in the law is unnecessary.  He seems to think that there is nothing now to prevent the tenant of any such premises from purchasing the rent to which his house might be subjected. Well, frequently there is one thing which prevents it and that is the fact that the ground landlord will not sell. At the moment the law is such that he cannot be compelled to do so, even if he were offered a capital sum which would yield the entire amount of the ground rent involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Booth thinks there is no difficulty about that.  I am surprised that a Deputy for the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown constituency should so speak in this House.  Deputy Booth may not be aware that most of the premises in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire are subjected to quite heavy ground rents.  There is scarcely a house in Dún Laoghaire Borough which is held freehold by the tenant. In fact, the greater number of the houses on the Dún Laoghaire seaboard are held by people who are not living in this country.  Deputy Booth <Col N="1155" /> thinks: &ldquo;That is all right, let them put up with it.&rdquo;  I wonder what would Deputy Booth's constituents think of that point of view?  The proposal here is merely to give those people the right, if they wish to exercise it, to purchase the freehold of their property.  Nothing very much is asked for in a motion of this kind.</P>
    <P>From time to time, we have had to change the landlord and tenant law in this country and the one criticism I would express is that we have been far too conservative and far too slow to adopt changes which are already the law elsewhere.  In Britain, which some people might regard as being the paragon of all virtues, this right is already established.  In Great Britain a person who is subjected to a ground rent can, if he desires to exercise the right, purchase the freehold.  What is so difficult about that?  There are already powers which can be exercised under the Town Planning Acts, and other Acts, to prevent or restrict the unwelcome development of house property.  Those rights are quite adequate.  If they are found to be inadequate then additional power can be given to local authorities.</P>
    <P>I dispute the right of the owner of some old estate, such as some of the estates that we have in this city and in the borough, to lay down a code of conduct for house owners.  I do not think they have the knowledge to do it and, if there is to be a code laid down as to the manner in which people should use their own property, I would much prefer that it should be laid down by local authorities elected by the people and not by somebody whom we never see.  Deputy Booth made the point that if lessees of houses were given the right to purchase out the freehold you would have some fearful unsocial development of house property.  That is the sort of speech which used to be made by representatives of the British years ago in relation to our people when they said: &ldquo;If you give the people of Ireland self-government they will not be able to govern themselves.&rdquo;  That is utter nonsense.  Most of the people who live here and who seek to buy their own houses value their own property very <Col N="1156" /> much.  They would be the first people to ensure that the way they use or run their own property will give pleasure to themselves and generally will be a joy and pleasure to their neighbours.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any reasonable objection to the proposals contained in this motion, that a person who desires to purchase out a charge on his property, such as a ground rent, should have the right to do it, provided he is willing to pay the necessary fair and proper sum either defined by agreement between the two parties concerned or by somebody else.  Provided he is prepared to put up the money to purchase, he certainly should have the right to do so. Deputy Ryan gave examples of the way in which these rents become a burden on people and I suppose all of us could give similar examples.  I do not know precisely what definition the proposers of this motion wish to attach to the term &ldquo;ground rent&rdquo;, but I have in mind the type of case where you have, for instance, a building lease granted by some owner of property who leases his land to another and who puts that tenant under a covenant to build thereon a house of a certain value.  The owner of that land is not developing it; the lessee is and the lessee has to spend his own money in building a house upon that land.  It may cost £2,500 or £3,000. When he has the house built, the owner of the land reserves to himself a rent out of it.  The owner of the land has had his property developed, a house built upon it and he has technically the freehold reversion in a capitalised piece of property which did not cost him a penny.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, all that the proposers of this motion ask is that the person who built that house and developed that land, laid out his money, toiled and put his savings into building the house, when he had it done, if he felt that it was good business for him to secure what he had done by taking in the freehold reversion, should then have the right to purchase out any land attached to the property.  If he is fortunate enough to have the money over, why should he not be allowed to exercise that right and to purchase the ground rent?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" /> It is not suggested in this motion that ground rents should be abolished. In other times, in other circumstances, it may be that such a view could be ventilated.  I agree with this much of what Deputy Booth said that obviously the right to reserve a rent on property can be a social amenity.  It can help to ease the development of certain properties and it can to some extent ease the lot of a person buying a leasehold interest.  Nobody seeks to abolish or destroy such a right.  All that is proposed here is that the lessee should have the right to purchase on equitable terms, that is, fair terms, terms fair not only to himself but also to the person whose interest he seeks to purchase, the ground landlord.</P>
    <P>I would regard this as an eminently reasonable proposal.  If it is a vote-catching proposal, I hope it catches sufficient votes to enable a majority in this or in some other House to bring about the necessary changes in the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in the House when various Rent Bills were introduced.  I was present in 1924-25 when the Town Tenant Bill was introduced. At that time, as Deputy Booth's colleagues know, tenants had no protection.  Those of Deputy Booth's colleagues who have not the Dublin and the City outlook will agree that ground rents have been a bone of contention in their areas.  In many cases the absentee landlord who is the owner of the land at the present time is the descendant of a person who was granted the land for services rendered to another Government.  The absentee landlord never contributed one shilling in order to put a slate on a roof, while he derives rent from the property.  In many cases, there are clauses in the lease giving the landlord the option to dispose of property that never cost him one shilling, without consulting the tenant in occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of legislation introduced in 1924-25, some protection was given. Under Part V of the Landlord and Tenant Act, the owner could not evict an existing tenant.  There was a provision for an increase in the ground rent, but the tenant was given rights he had not had before.  Prior to the <Col N="1158" /> introduction of that legislation, the tenant was at the mercy of the absentee landlord.</P>
    <P>The demand for the right to purchase ground rents is greater now than it was in 1924-25.  There are trade unions representing the people.  There is a very large section of the community who have purchased their own houses under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act and who are very anxious to become the sole owners.</P>
    <P>I have had the experience where without any great difficulty, a landlord was induced to sell his ground rent at the expiration of 10 or 15 years to the tenant.  However, in the North Wicklow area, there is a landlord of a big estate to whom a man paid a considerable sum for a very small piece of land for the purpose of erecting a bungalow.  After some years, when he decided to erect a garage beside the bungalow, he got notice from a solicitor acting for the landlord that he had broken a covenant of the lease which provided that he was not to erect anything without the permission of the landlord and would have to pay a further sum to the landlord to obtain permission to erect the garage. We are not concerned only with ground rents but with clauses that may be entered in leases.  Deputy Larkin has pointed out that in some cases permission must be obtained from the landlord before the tenant takes in a tenant.  A tenant may try to improve the house and his predecessors may have spent their savings in maintaining it, whereas the landlord may not have contributed anything but merely exacted the ground rent.</P>
    <P>I am certain that the majority of the members of Deputy Booth's Party who represent rural areas, and even those who represent city areas, recognise that the case we make is a just case.  We are concerned with the various clauses that may be inserted in leases submitted to tenants at a time when they have no alternative. The only protection that tenants have at the present time is the Landlord and Tenant Act.</P>
    <P>In 1946, the Labour Party moved a motion recommending compulsory acquisition of ground rents.  That was <Col N="1159" /> defeated.  What various Governments have been nervous of is the cost to the State.  Personally I do not think it would cost the State anything if the arrangements that have been made in one portion of my constituency were adopted, where the tenant continues to pay for ten or fifteen years and then automatically becomes the owner of the ground.</P>
    <P>I admit that this is a complex question. We may have to set up a commission of inquiry to consider the arguments for or against.  The owners of land residing in Ireland would be given an opportunity to put their case before the Commission.  There is a great demand for some action in this connection.  There are those who are purchasing their houses from a landlord or under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  In my constituency where a number of workingmen's houses were put up for sale an arrangement was made whereby the tenants in occupation would be able to complete purchase.  These men started to improve their properties and became good citizens.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth's case is that if the builders are not allowed to get away with the £10 a year for a very small portion of land it may interfere with building schemes.  However, in some countries where there is no ground rent more houses are being built than we are building here.  I do not want to go into constitutional matters but I am sure the majority of Fianna Fáil members agree with the principle&mdash; that a man should be the owner not alone of his house but of the land on which the house is erected.</P>
    <P>I trust we shall be more successful with this motion than we were with motions Nos. 24, 25 and 46 which have been debated here.  It must be recognised that, for instance, in the midlands there are absentee landlords who are deriving benefit from ground rents and, according to reports which I think the Minister must have, there are some very severe clauses in the leases.  We have advanced so much in the last 30 or 40 years that I do not believe that any judge of our courts would stand for some of the <Col N="1160" /> clauses, which are against the interests of the people.</P>
    <P>We must recognise, whatever Deputy Booth says, that it is unreasonable for a builder having got his money in the form of a grant from the Government and from the Corporation and his money for the house to expect also to get a ground rent of £10 a year on the houses he has built.  I support this motion and appeal to the Minister to accept the principle involved in it thus giving some security and contentment to the people whom we all wish to serve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to speak at length on this motion.  I rise only to try in a small way to expose the gross hypocrisy of the Fine Gael Party when they support this motion. I agree with the underlying principle of the motion as I am sure do most of the Deputies on this side of the House.  I think it is a good idea. Deputy Larkin, the mover of the motion, however, flatters the Fianna Fáil Government when he states that &ldquo;in the opinion of Dáil Éireann the Government should without delay&mdash;&lsquo;without delay&rsquo; are the operative words&mdash;introduce proposals for legislation.&rdquo; There was a Coalition Government there for three and a half years and there was no attempt whatever, as far as we know, by notice of motion or representations by the Labour Members of that Coalition Government to have the legislation enacted which they now suggest a Fianna Fáil Government can bring in without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although, as far as I know from discussion, most of the Fianna Fáil Deputies agree with this motion I do not think that by passing the motion the difficulties will be solved.  This whole question is full of complexities. I happen to know a little about ground rents and I do know that when people put down a motion here that ground rents can be bought out for 15 years' purchase they do not seem to realise what is involved.  We must divide houses into different categories: there is private housing, or post-1939 housing; there are business dwellings which are in an entirely different category; and then there is the property <Col N="1161" /> in the towns and villages of rural Ireland where absentee landlords derive an income while they live in the South of France.</P>
    <P>While I for one would only be delighted if the developers of land for housing could get 15 years' purchase I should like to relate my own personal experience.  Within the last two years I sold some ground rents myself; I got nine and threequarters years' purchase and was very thankful to get it.  When we got back into power the financial situation greatly improved.  Last month for 46 houses the ground rents of which were £10 10s.  I got ten and a quarter years' purchase.  I spent some months trying to get that ten and a quarter years' purchase.</P>
    <P>If anyone suggested that 15 years' purchase would buy out the ground rents of private housing the developers of land would be very happy indeed. When dealing specifically with private housing the Minister should deal with it alone and enact legislation whereby tenants&mdash;I have in mind purchasers through the S.D.A., a building society, or an insurance company&mdash;could buy out an agreed number of years' purchase. There was grave criticism of the Dublin County Council at one stage because they would not give S.D.A. loans if the ground rents were more than £10.  That was, of course, a form of control, but there was a good deal of sense in it.</P>
    <P>A property was sold in Limerick the other day consisting of four and a half acres.  Certain developments were envisaged. The head rent was £100 per annum.  The purchasers had to pay some absentee landlord 45 years' purchase to buy out that £100 per year head rent so that they could proceed with development.  The principle of this motion is worthy of every support.</P>

We have had two Coalitions in the twentieth century and ground rents were apparently quite valid during those unfortunate periods in the history of this State.  Let us be consistent. I have no criticism of the Labour Party.  At least they have stuck to their guns down through the years.  As Deputy Everett said, in 1924, 1925 and in 1946 the Labour Party moved a motion on this matter. But Deputy Everett forgot to say that he was Minister for Justice and remained strangely silent.

      <P>While I am on that point, and while the Leader of the Labour Party is present, I should like to point out&mdash;I want to correlate my remarks, before I am ruled out of order&mdash;that the Labour Party has committed itself never again to take part in a Coalition Government&mdash;a most commendable attitude to adopt and one inspired obviously as a result of their unhappy experiences in the past.  Now we have the Fine Gael Party saying they will abolish ground rents if returned to office.  The leader of the Labour Party has a responsibility to the people to make one simple statement here to allay the anxiety of his followers throughout the country.

      <P>Mr. Tully asked the Minister for Justice if it is the Government's intention to introduce proposals for legislation in the near future with a view to giving leaseholders an opportunity of buying out their ground rents at reasonable terms, such as a 10 to 15 years' purchase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Frequently one hears the argument advanced that, whilst we have obtained political freedom, we have not yet obtained our economic freedom.  The fact that it is necessary after 40 years of political freedom to table this motion is clear proof of the truth of the argument that economically we are not free.  We in Fine Gael believe there is a very strong moral case for this motion.  It does not, as some previous speakers have suggested, ask for the abolition of ground rents.  Instead, it calls on the Government to introduce legislation to provide for the purchase of ground rents on equitable terms.  Ground rents have been referred to as a feudal legacy and they are, in fact, a penal tax on the ownership of property.  At this stage in our development it is surely outrageous that one can spend £1,500 or £2,000 buying a house and not own the land on which it is built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most ground rents in the city of Dublin are a legacy of our conquest. Many of them are paid to the Earl of this, or the Lord of that.  It is worth noting that even this week one estate <Col N="1165" /> which is owned by a member of the British aristocracy, an absentee landlord, is endeavouring to claim a ground rent on land reclaimed by Dublin Corporation at Sandymount. Under some archaic legislation it would appear he has that right.  Indeed, many ground landlords are the titled descendants of planters who obtained grants of land in this country in return for services rendered to a foreign monarch.  Recently I came across a case of ground rent being paid in respect of an entire town in Leinster, one of our leading county towns; all of that rent, amounting to many thousands of pounds, is paid to no less a person than the Earl of Essex who does not live in this country. Beyond the fact that the Earl of Essex was a fancy man for the Virgin Queen, I am not aware of what right his descendants have to collect rents from anyone in this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It might have been at one time but that day is gone.  We in Fine Gael believe in the encouragement of home ownership and in developing a property-owning democracy. As Deputy Ryan said last week, we have one of the smallest ratios of individuals owning their own homes than any other country in Europe. That is a state of affairs which we should endeavour to rectify because it is very desirable to encourage the independent owner, who not only has to face up to the question of ground rent but is also penalised in many other ways, notably by Schedule A tax, which is another archaic reminder of a bygone age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also involved in this is the question of equity, of providing equitable compensation for <i>bona-fide</i> holders of ground rents as investments.  Some ground rents are held by trust funds and, in fact, one of our leading Irish assurance companies is buying an increasing number of ground rents in Dublin city.  This is not a threat but I think it should be pointed out to those who are buying ground rents that the time will come when they will be compelled to enable leaseholders to purchase <Col N="1166" /> them out on equitable terms.  Of course the question can be asked what type of method is to be provided to enable a leaseholder to purchase his ground rent.  The answer to that is to be found in the fact that many years ago the British Government introduced a scheme of land purchase in this country which has enabled our small farmers to purchase their farms on equitable terms by land annuities. A similar mechanism could enable a leaseholder to buy up the ground rent on his property but I want to put forward a case which I do not think has been developed so far.  If, for financial reasons, the Government are unable to introduce a means of purchasing existing ground rents, there is surely a very strong case to be made for prohibiting the creation of new ground rents at fantastically high rates.  I make no apology for relating my entire arguments to the city of Dublin.  Despite what Deputy Corry had to say last week, the problem in Dublin is sufficiently grave to warrant particular mention and there is surely a case to be made for preventing speculators, many of them not nationals of this country, from exploiting the development of suburban areas by Dublin Corporation.  At present the position is that if the local authority develops a new area by providing drainage, sewerage or road works, it is an unearned increment falling into the lap of the landowner.  It is a gift of Heaven for him, but surely that unearned increment should accrue to the benefit of society as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently Dublin Corporation put into effect a drainage scheme in North County Dublin at a <Col N="1167" /> cost of upwards of £1 million which opened up a vast area for development. There is, therefore, an incremental value attached to the land in that area, but the landowner has done nothing whatever to warrant the vast profit which accrues to him as a result of that scheme.  I say that profit should equitably accrue to society as a whole and, if the Government are not prepared to introduce a scheme for the purchase of existing ground rents, they should at least, by means of a capital levy or some other means, endeavour to restrict new ground rents at fantastically high rents.</P>
      <P>I repeat that they are very high. The average £1,500 or £1,700 house which qualifies for a small dwelling loan is subject to a ground rent of £12 to £15 a year.  The 50-year-old, four-bedroomed, red-brick house in the Dublin suburbs&mdash;the older type, pre-war house&mdash;in most cases is subject to an average ground rent of £5 or £6.  Newly-built houses are subject to much higher ground rents. That is a most undesirable state of affairs.  Because this city is expanding because there is a great need for increased housing development, is that any reason why a landowner should be in a position to exploit the need of the public for housing development? He has no moral right at all.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made here of the desirable work being done by builders who, in return for the reasonable profit they earn, are developing housing areas in this city.  Nobody is complaining about the building contractor who earns a reasonable rate of profit on the capital he invests in this development; but we are objecting to the land speculator&mdash;the developer, not the builder&mdash;because frequently the builder who erects half a dozen or a dozen houses &ldquo;on spec&rdquo; is not in fact the holder of the ground rents. More frequently, in fact, are the ground rents held by a speculator of the &ldquo;spiv&rdquo; type, whom none of us wants to see encouraged in this State.</P>

      <P>I can make my own case.  Deputy Booth has already spoken and I have no intention of carrying on a debate here on the basis of question and answer.  It is a fact that these landowners of whom I am speaking have contributed very little indeed to the development of their property.  It might not be so bad if, say, the original owner of the land, a farmer or market gardener operating in our suburban areas, was in fact the person who benefited from this development, but very frequently the profit accrues to a speculator who has taken the land some years back from its original owner and who places himself in the position of being able to capitalise on this development by the local authority.</P>

    <P>Deputy Everett referred to the motion moved in this House on 13th and 15th February, 1946.  That motion arose out of a question put down by the late Deputy Davin to which the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Boland, gave a negative reply. The motion we are discussing here this evening is identical with that motion discussed in 1946.  It was debated here for quite a considerable time. Amongst the Deputies who took part in the debate were Deputy Norton, Deputy Dillon and Deputy McGilligan. All these Deputies advocated the abolition of ground rents in one form or another.  The motion was put to a vote and lost by 40 votes to <Col N="1169" /> 21.  In other words, of the 138 members of the House at that time, 61 participated in the division, representing about 44 per cent. of the House. This showed the lack of interest in the question.  Of the Labour Deputies who participated in that division, only six voted.  Only six members of Fine Gael voted.  The remainder of the votes were made up of members of Clann na Talmhan and Independents.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make a debating point out of this.  I want to state the facts, and the facts are as follows. Within a short period of years afterwards, Deputy Norton became a member of a Government&mdash;and a very responsible member of that Government because he assumed the office of Tánaiste.  Deputy Corish became a member of that Government later and Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Dillon were also members of it.  I must presume that because of the interest they showed in that particular debate, they did at some time or other raise the question of ground rents within their own Government.  Whether they did so or not, I have no information. However, I think some action was taken.  The matter must have been considered at some level because the Bill which eventually became the 1958 Act was introduced here by the then Minister for Justice, but it did not become law before the dissolution.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>On September 5th an agreement was reached between the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce that on the estimated yield of native wheat this year 300,000 tons would be available for use in the flour industry. On that basis millers were advised to increase the percentage of grist from 70 to 80 and an increased price of 5/9d. per sack for bakers' flour and 7/9d. per sack for household flour was suggested.  Although people felt that this was an essential foodstuff they had no great objection to the increase because, even if the wheat used would be more expensive, it was native wheat and they would like to support native industry and production.  They did not express too much opposition to the increase.</P>
      <P>The justification for that increase was that instead of using 70 per cent. native wheat as was originally proposed, the percentage was to be increased to 80 and thus ten per cent. less imported wheat would be used. Imported wheat was, of course, much cheaper and therefore something had to be found to cover the increase in the price.  The Minister agreed and increased the prices of bakers' and household flour.  That was all right as far as it went, but on November 2nd as a result of a Question and Supplementary Questions, to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, it was brought out that, irrespective of the yield of millable native wheat from the harvest, that increase in the price of flour was to be maintained.  That was news to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I felt that if we were not able to get the required amount of millable wheat in the normal way, flour prices would go back to where they had been or would go even lower if more imported wheat had to be used in the grist.  I wanted to follow that up and put further questions.  The Ceann Comhairle said that it was an argument, and not questions, we were raising.  To some extent, I suppose, that was right but to have the matter clarified I put a direct question to the Minister asking, as far as I remember, when we might expect a reduction in the price of <Col N="1171" /> flour due to the reduced percentage of native wheat in the millers' grist.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that, irrespective of the quantity of wheat available from the 1960 home crop, the price of flour would be maintained and an agreement to that effect had been made between himself and the Minister for Agriculture and that imported wheat would be taken and issued to the millers as Irish wheat.  I do not think that is quite playing the game with the general public.  I remember becoming a little bit heated in following up the question and the Minister said that if we wanted cheap bread or flour we could use imported wheat.  I think there is nothing in that argument; it is only a catch-cry.  Every man, woman and child in the country is anxious to see every possible grain of Irish wheat used in Irish flour and I do not think the Minister gained anything by that suggestion.  That was a cheap way of saying it.  Nobody wants to import more wheat.  When we had wheat at 85/- a barrel, the price of flour was half the price it is today.  It was the policy of the Government to remove the subsidy.  I am not going into that debate again as it has been debated several times already in the House and there is no point in going further but the fact remains that when the farmers received 85/- a barrel for wheat the price of flour was half what it is today.</P>
    <P>Native wheat has come to stay because it is the policy of the previous Government and of the present Government to have native wheat used. We have driers and corn stores and silos built to handle and hold it from season to season.  There is no question of anybody suggesting any opposition to that policy or saying that we should not use Irish wheat as much as possible in Irish flour.  I am sure that Irish wheat will be developed so as to be suitable for bakers' and household flour and we may then see 100 per cent.  Irish wheat used and I think the people will agree to that. They did not object even though the price was terribly high, putting flour and bread into the class of luxury <Col N="1172" /> goods nowadays.  There was not much outcry because the people felt that our own people were getting the benefit.</P>
    <P>Last July, the Minister for Agriculture announced that there would be a levy of 4/6d. a barrel on wheat.  That levy was imposed and we all know it was put on to cover the disposal of surplus wheat as it was expected that the full yield of wheat would not be consumed as in flour&mdash;it could, of course, be consumed in other things&mdash; and that the surplus would be covered by that levy.  For the past year also there has been a tax of £2 per ton on imported wheat and that tax, I think, is still to the Government's credit because it was hardly used last year&mdash; I think all the wheat was millable and the farmers and the millers made full use of it.  This year that import duty is liable to be increased to £6 or £8 per ton and, as a result, that increase in the price of foreign wheat will be put on to the price of bread and flour which will be considerably increased in price.</P>
    <P>I have heard arguments here before that when the standard of living rises the consumption of flour and bread goes down as people use other foodstuffs. This is what I call a purchase tax, the first one we have had.  Only the other day the Commission submitted its report and I feel this is the first purchase tax imposed by the present Government.  Who is going to be hit by it?  If we say that when the standard of living goes up the consumption of bread goes down therefore the family costs of the man with the lower standard of living will be added to in greater proportion than those of his well-off neighbour.  Who is going to be hard hit but the ordinary man with the lower standard of living, the ordinary working man, the man on the dole and the old age pensioner because bread is their main staff of life?</P>
    <P>I feel that if the Minister has any case at all, the burden should not be placed directly on those who cannot bear it.  That is what the Government are at present doing.  If the burden were carried by the Exchequer, it would be scaled equally well over the whole community&mdash;it would be borne by the man with £7,000 a year <Col N="1173" /> as well as by the man with 30/- a week.  In this case, we are putting the burden where it presses hardest, on the poorest section of the community.</P>
    <P>When this Question was being asked, we had the old slogan used against us that the Opposition were trying to depress the price of wheat. People use such slogans only when they know they have a bad case.  If they have a good case, there is no necessity to use those propaganda slogans.  Nobody is out to depress the price of wheat.</P>
    <P>The barley harvest and a good share of the wheat harvest is in for the past three months.  The stores are chock-full of barley and wheat and the Government have not made any attempt to handle the barley and wheat crop this year.  A Question was asked in the House this evening about the imports of offals and the granting of licences for these imports and the Minister said that he had given a licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government made any attempt to handle the wheat crop, the price of flour would not have to carry any increase whatever. We are importing offals while our unmillable wheat could have been used for the past two months for the production of white pollard.  It could also have been used in a mixture with maize.  Bulk maize and ground maize are being sold without any addition of Irish wheat or barley, while the stores are bursting at the seams at the moment with both wheat and barley.  The Government have made no attempt whatever to handle this year's crop and I challenge them to deny that.  Then they are suggesting that the Opposition are depressing the price of wheat.  Who are doing that but the Government themselves who have not done what they should have done for the past two months?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too far away <Col N="1174" /> from it.  I feel that this levy of 4/6 a sack on the price of flour will be used to subsidise the export of some of this year's wheat crop in the months to come.  That is the reason they are not handling the crop now.  Instead of using it, they are importing offals, when Irish wheat could have been used in the supplying of offals.  It comes to this, that the Government's justification for the increase was that they were increasing the grist in the mixture of Irish flour from 70 per cent. to 80 per cent.  We are not now in that position and I am informed that the mixture will only be 25, or 35 or 40 per cent. of Irish wheat.  Do the Government intend to continue this purchase tax on bread which was put on on 5th September?  The estimate then was that we would have a reasonable result from this year's harvest. Now the estimate is the other way round and it seems that we shall not have half the amount of Irish wheat to use.</P>
      <P>When the Government increased the price first, there was good justification for the expectation that a large proportion of Irish wheat would be used in the grist.  Now there is good justification for the price of flour being reduced to at least the figure at which it stood, if not to a lower figure.  That, to the ordinary man in the trade, would mean 8/- or 9/- a sack because this increase means an increase in the price of household flour of 8/- or 9/- a sack.  I think the Government should reconsider this matter.  There is no justification for the increase.  I do not want to bring any heat into it but the Government should reconsider it and give the people the benefit they should get from the reduction in the percentage of Irish wheat in the grist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Crotty has developed his argument this evening as if he had never heard my reply to his original question.  I have been taken on the Adjournment on a previous occasion and much of what I said then would apply to what I have to say to-night in connection with the price of wheat.  On the Deputy's own argument, which started on the premise that the growing of wheat is <Col N="1175" /> good national policy, we are agreed. It was accepted by the Government which he supported and in which he held a minor Ministry.  Wheat represents a cash crop for the farmers, bringing them several million pounds a year.  That addition to their income adds to the spending power of the farmers who, in turn, start economic activity in other spheres.</P>
      <P>In all the circumstances, we can accept that the necessity to grow native wheat and to use as much as possible of it in the grist for the production of flour is good national policy and common case.  It is accepted that imported wheat is cheaper for a variety of reasons.  In the great wheat-producing countries, climatic conditions are better; the vast tracts of land on which wheat is grown make for more economic production in many cases; and there is also the over-production in these countries which they can sell easily. It will be readily understood that wheat can be imported into this country at a much cheaper price than that at which it can be produced by our farmers.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, the necessity still, in order to make Irish flour and Irish bread more palatable, to add a proportion of imported wheat to the grist, irrespective of how much Irish wheat is millable.  I hope, with Deputy Crotty, the time will come when the necessity for introducing a proportion of foreign wheat into the grist will disappear.</P>
      <P>It has been the policy in the past few years&mdash;and it is so stated in the <i>Programme for Economic Development</i>&mdash;that the mills will take 300,000 tons of native wheat, to be used in the grist.  On the present basis of consumption, that would represent 78 per cent. of the grist, the balance being made up of imported wheat.  It was not possible in 1958-59 to reach that proportion, by reason of the extremely bad harvest we experienced and through greater introduction of foreign wheat, it was possible to reduce the price of bread somewhat, though not as much as the Government had hoped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1176" /> It could have been reduced somewhat more, were it not that the Government thought the farmers were entitled to a little compensation for losses they incurred.  The year 1959 was a comparatively dry year and there were 221,204 tons of native wheat used in the grist in 1959/60. That represented 57½ per cent. of the grist.  There was, as a result, an increase in the price of bread over the 1958-59 prices.  It represented, in fact, a return to the pre-1958-59 price.</P>
    <P>This year on the basis of sowings and on the yield expected at the appropriate time, it was agreed the millers would in fact take 300,000 tons of native wheat for milling.  On the basis of the consumption of bread and flour during the past year, that would have represented 78 per cent. of native wheat in the grist.  As a result of the increase, there would be a correspondingly high cost on the millers in respect of the purchase of Irish wheat and that was represented in the increase of price Deputy Crotty quoted&mdash;5s. 9d. for bakers' flour and 7s. 9d. for what he called shop flour.</P>
    <P>This year turned out to be an unduly wet year, notwithstanding which more than 300,000 tons of wheat were cut and threshed and presented to the mills.  Unfortunately, by reason of the unduly wet year, it was found that much of that wheat was not suitable for milling and the millers and the Government were faced with the prospect of reducing the price to the farmers or creating an arrangement whereby the farmers would not suffer by reason of the bad year.  Such an arrangement was come to, and as a result, it has been arranged with the millers that 300,000 tons of such native wheat as is available from the harvest, whether millable or unsuitable for milling, will be purchased by the millers at the guaranteed millable wheat price. Any proportion found to be unsuitable for milling will be exchanged later without price adjustment, for a like quantity of foreign wheat.  There is a 4s. 6d. levy, but that is for any surplus over and above the 300,000 tons the millers use.</P>
    <P>The £2 tax on imported wheat was abolished more than 12 months ago.  In <Col N="1177" /> the circumstances of the arrangement I have just outlined, the millers' grist will contain 300,000 tons of wheat for which the guaranteed native prices have been paid by the millers.  This represents, in the main, a subvention for the farmers.  Were it not for the arrangement, the farmers would get the guaranteed millable price for only whatever proportion of their grain would have been suitable for milling and would, consequently, have suffered a very severe loss.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Crotty suggested, I shall not make any political capital out of it.  I should say, however, that it is true that if we wanted to have a cheap type of bread, we could get it without using any native wheat.  If we wanted to assist the farmers in the circumstances of this year in avoiding what would be catastrophic losses, some arrangement such as has been reached had to be devised.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Deputies have been bewailing the plight of the farmers here over the past couple of weeks. They objected to this arrangement whereby losses otherwise suffered by the farmers can be obviated at great cost to the Exchequer.  They cannot have it both ways&mdash;bewailing the plight of the farmers, on the one hand and the arrangement whereby the farmers get the guaranteed price for all their wheat, on the other.</P>
    <P>The alternative was subsidisation of bread and flour.  As I said here before, subsidies were introduced in 1947 as a temporary measure.  They were so accepted in the House at that time. To subsidise flour and bread for the benefit only of the deserving section of the community&mdash;the worst off&mdash; has been found impossible.  In practice, subsidies must be applied generally. Subsidised bread would, therefore, <Col N="1178" /> have been available to all sections of the community, including the better off sections.  Under the Coalition Government, an effort was made to see if the subsidies could be devised so as to benefit the poorer classes, but two recommendations from the committee set up for that purpose clearly indicated that it was impracticable to do so.  Therefore, subsidies as such will not benefit only the poorer sections but also people who can afford to pay higher prices.  As well as that, there were complaints from many quarters of subsidised bread being fed to greyhounds.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing that as a point against subsidisation.  Subsidies would have to be of a general nature and would not, therefore, as I have already pointed out, benefit only the poorer people.  It is true, as the Deputy says, that as the standard of living advances in many countries, there is a likelihood of less bread being consumed because people can afford to buy alternative foods.</P>
    <P>To sum up, farmers are receiving the guaranteed price for the 300,000 tons or more of native wheat taken in to the mills.  The arrangement whereby the mills will receive the quantity of imported wheat which is equal to the proportion of wheat from the farmers found to be unmillable is a great relief to the farmers, and in this year's circumstances, it was something to which the farmers were entitled.  We cannot have it both ways.  We have to come to the assistance of the farmers in circumstances like these and I do not think the Deputy objects to our doing that.</P>

During the past ten years 648 experiments have been carried out at the Department's Institutions and at numerous centres throughout the country in collaboration with County Committees of Agriculture. From these investigations the results of which are published annually in the Journal of the Department of Agriculture, the suitability of 4 varieties (Atle, Atson, Progress and Karn II) for cultivation in this country has been established.  One of these varieties (Atle) is so widely grown that it occupies about 90 per cent. of the total <Col N="1045" /> wheat acreage.  Certified seed of Atle, Atson, Progress and Karn II is produced under the Department's Seed Certification Scheme and is available to farmers through commercial channels. These varieties are among those given the highest rating in respect of milling and baking qualities in the Classification of Home Grown Wheat Varieties issued by the National Association of British and Irish Millers.  With the object of producing improved wheat varieties for our conditions the Department has an extensive wheat breeding programme under way and a number of promising new hybrids are being tested at present. For some years past the Department of Agriculture has co-operated with the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards and more recently with An Foras Talúntais in a programme for evaluating the milling and baking qualities of home grown wheats.</P>
      <P>In addition the Plant Breeding Department of University College, Dublin has been engaged in wheat breeding for over 30 years.
