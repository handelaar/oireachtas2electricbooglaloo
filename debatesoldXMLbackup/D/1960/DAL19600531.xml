      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the Attorney General is permitted to carry on a private practice in addition to discharging his public office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General is at liberty to engage in such private practice as may be compatible with the full and proper discharge of the duties of his office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that it is very difficult, if not impossible, for the Attorney General to discharge competently his public functions at the same time as he is running a private practice?  Does the Taoiseach not agree that the Attorney General's very costly and gross mishandling of the Singer case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question which the Deputy relevantly asked, it was the practice, until 1948, to require the Attorney General not to engage in private practice but the Government of that day, of which I think the Deputy was a member, decided to reverse that practice and to require the Attorney General to engage in private practice.  That decision was again reversed in 1951, when Mr. de Valera resumed office as Taoiseach, but again in 1954 it was reversed and the practice established in 1954 still persists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Taoiseach's contention that he must, as Taoiseach, be bound by the precedents of other Governments in this regard?  Secondly, would the Taoiseach not agree that the case has been amply proven now, whatever about the precedents?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it fair to remark in justification of the decision taken by the Government in 1948, of which the Deputy was a member, and of that taken by the subsequent Government of which Deputy J.A. Costello was the head in 1954, that the judges of the Courts have frequently expressed the view that it is desirable that the Attorney General should occasionally appear before them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has seen a report that the London agents of the Powerscourt Estate have stated that negotiations for the sale of the Estate are in progress and that while it may not be sold for some months it might be sold next week; and whether in the light of that information he has requested or will request the present <Col N="294" /> owners of the Estate to make it a condition of sale that the amenities previously enjoyed by the general public will be preserved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a newspaper report on the lines referred to.</P>
      <P>I have not requested the owners of the Powerscourt Estate to insert in the conditions of the proposed sale of the property the condition suggested by the Deputy, and I would refer him generally to the third paragraph of my reply to Questions in this House on 10th instant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach going to handle this matter in the same way as his Government handles everything, that is, to do nothing about it until it is too late to do anything?</P>

      <P>Further arising out of the Taoiseach's reply, would the Taoiseach not consider that where a sensible precedent is laid down it would be wise to follow that precedent, especially having regard to his high regard for precedent, indicated in his last reply to Deputy Dr. Browne? He should have regard to the precedent laid down by Deputy Costello and approach the vendor in the interests of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if the wife of an insured worker or of a person self-employed whose income is under £800 per annum is entitled to free treatment ante- and post-natal from a doctor on the panel of the local authority and to free hospital treatment in an approved local authority hospital whether or not she possesses a medical card; what procedure is adopted for an applicant for such treatment; if he is is aware that many qualified persons have been charged fees by a doctor on the local authority panel and, also, in certain instances have had to pay hospital charges; and whether such persons are entitled to recover such payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative, subject to the qualification that, where the patient is confined in hospital, maintenance and treatment is provided free of charge only in a public ward whether in a local authority hospital or in a voluntary hospital with which the local authority has made an arrangement.</P>
      <P>In order to establish entitlement to these services, an expectant mother should apply to her local health authority either direct or through a doctor who has entered into an agreement with the health authority to provide maternity medical care for eligible women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware that many qualified persons have been charged fees by a doctor on the local authority panel. Such doctors are precluded by the terms of their agreements from demanding or accepting fees for maternity care provided for eligible patients whom they have accepted for treatment under the scheme.  Every <Col N="299" /> expectant mother who wishes to obtain the services of a doctor under the scheme, should attend a doctor chosen by her from the local authority panel and should inform him that she wishes to become his patient, under the scheme.  She should apply for the service on the appropriate form, form MCA, obtainable either from the doctor or the health authority.  On this form she will state the grounds on which she claims entitlement to the service.  Briefly these grounds are:</P>
    <P>(a)  that she is a person currently or until recently insured under the Social Welfare Acts or is a dependant of such a person; or</P>
    <P>(b)  that the family income is less than £800; or</P>
    <P>(c)  that she derives her livelihood wholly or mainly from farming, the rateable valuation of the farm not exceeding £50, or is a dependant of such a person; or</P>
    <P>(d)  that she is a person who, in the opinion of the health authority, would be unable without undue hardship to provide the service for herself.</P>
    <P>These categories include, of course, persons who hold, or are covered by, medical cards.</P>
    <P>On receipt of the application form, the local authority will decide whether or not she is eligible for the service and will notify her of its decision.</P>
    <P>If the doctor accepts her as his patient, and if she is deemed eligible for the service by the health authority, the doctor cannot demand or accept any fee from her.  Women seeking maternity services under the Health Acts should, therefore, in order to avoid misunderstandings, submit the completed application form, which gives the grounds for her entitlement to the service, to the doctor before forwarding it to the local authority and should obtain his endorsement on it that he is prepared to accept her as his patient.  If the doctor is willing to accept her but the health authority does not regard her as eligible, the doctor can charge for his services.  If the Deputy is aware of cases in which <Col N="300" /> doctors on the panel demanded or accepted fees from women entitled to the service whom they had accepted for treatment, he should report the matter to the local authority concerned who, I am confident, will investigate the matter fully and take appropriate action.</P>
    <P>As regards the position where an eligible patient is confined in hospital, I have already explained that entirely free maintenance and treatment is provided only in public ward accommodation. Where the patient elects for semi-private or private accommodation she becomes liable for payment of part of the cost of her maintenance in hospital, but is not liable for any payment to the doctor who has accepted her as his patient under the Health Authority Scheme.  The question of the recovery of sums paid for services which should properly have been provided free of charge is, of course, a matter between the patient and the doctor in the first instance. Any reported case of wrongful charging would be investigated fully by the health authority, who have power to warn the doctor, or fine him, or to terminate their agreement with him.</P>

Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to make any alteration in the provisions for the suspension or abatement of pensions granted to the resigned and dismissed members of the Royal Irish Constabulary where the pensioners are re-employed in the public service.</P>

The approved procedure requires persons who will have turf available for delivery to the station over bog roads requiring repairs to make application in the first instance to the Supervisor at the generating station.</P>
      <P>I have already approved, this year, a number of grants in the vicinity of Caherciveen station.  Other applications in respect of this area are under examination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had no indication of a widespread scarcity of skilled tradesmen in the building industry though there may be temporary difficulties in some areas due to fluctuations in the volume of building activity.  The present development work at Shannon has, I understand, led to heavy demands on local labour and consequently caused a local shortage of skilled labour.  This is a normal consequence of an increase in building activity in a particular area which requires a period of adjustment to be resolved.  It is a fundamental objective of a trade union to foster the full employment of its members, and it can be assumed that it takes all steps necessary to advise prospective employers of the availability of workers.  I do not see that any intervention is required on my part.</P>

The arrangement for the delivery of telegrams of this kind after normal hours in Dublin is an exceptional one which is not publicised, as there is, in strictness, no obligation to effect delivery of any telegram outside normal hours.

      <P>We have a provision in this Bill against which I spoke very strongly and I think it necessary that public attention should again be drawn to it.  It is that section of the Bill which does away with the verification of bottles for the sale of stout and beer. It was said by the Minister for Justice and by the Minister for Lands, when dealing with this section, that they were doing away with the four weights and measures inspectors in the glass factories because it was an unnecessary expenditure and the Minister sought to put a halo around his head because he was going to save over £4,000.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, and I have indicated that I appreciate it.  It is important that the public should be made aware that bottles may possibly go on the market now which are under measure by reason of the section in the Bill which does away with the verification of bottles.  The only way in which the bottles can be checked is by the weights and measures inspectors in the factories. The Minister for Lands suggested slightingly that it was a waste of time to be checking empty bottles coming off the machines but the alternative is that the weights and measures inspectors must go around the country checking whether or not the bottles which have been put on the market are correct.  It is quite apparent that in the result it will cost far more than the £4,000 which it is alleged is being saved under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> The cost of the system which is being done away with is 6/- per annum per publican in the country or a cost, as I pointed out, of one-seven-thousandth part of the price of a bottle of stout per drinker per annum. That is what the Minister is saving and what he is substituting is inspection by weights and measures inspectors of bottles in public houses. Alternatively, the weights and measures inspectors will have to purchase a number of sample bottles from publicans at the cost of about 10d. a bottle and take the bottles to their laboratories to check.  It must be apparent to anybody who bothers to think about it that the system which the Minister is proposing is wasteful and unnecessary and that it is undesirable to remove what is a very cheap form of insurance, a charge of one-seven-thousandth part of the price of a bottle of stout per consumer per annum. That is what the Minister is doing away with and I hope that in another place this amendment of the law will be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>It is significant that other countries which have not got the system we have here are crying out for it and it is not unlikely that in neighbouring states, verification of bottles at the point of manufacture will be introduced.  We are doing away with that.  It was suggested by the Minister that since the manufacturers would still be required to put a mark on the bottle, it would ensure the bottle would contain the measure stated on it.  In the factory, nobody knows whether the bottle is of the right size or not until it comes off the mould and now, instead of the bottles being checked at the point of manufacture, they will have to be checked from Ballyfermot to Ballydehob.  It is quite possible that some 10,000 bottles per day could be distributed and people could be getting short measure, all because of an alleged saving of £4,000.</P>
    <P>This is really the dream of the bureaucrat for years&mdash;doing away with something which arose by accident. It was not intended in the Dáil in the 1920s that the measures should be checked by weights and measures <Col N="336" /> inspectors but subsequently an interpretation of the law said that bottles came within the ambit of the Act and needed to be verified.  I believe it is a very cheap form of insurance and I believe the price we are paying is worth-while.  I sincerely hope that before it is too late the Minister will withdraw this amendment of the law.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the same amendment which is most unfair. Within the framework of the law, as it is intended to amend it, in so far as I can read it no prosecution will lie against a manufacturer of bottles of short measure but the prosecution will be against the innocent publican.  It may be that I am wrong and I should like to be assured if the prosecution will lie against the manufacturer.  I do not believe that the manufacturers of bottles in this country would deliberately put bottles of short measure on the market.  There would be no profit to the manufacturers in doing that because it costs as much to make 16 bottles to the gallon as 17 to the gallon, but there is the possibility that bottles of short measure may get on the market.  If a publican innocently buys one, the prosecution should not lie against him and it appears that it would be no defence to him to say that he bought the bottle in the ordinary course of trade.  On that account, I should like to see this matter changed before it is too late.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The only comment I should like to make at this late stage is that before this Bill is put into operation, the Minister should examine the situation in relation to Sunday evening opening.  If the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary went to the trouble of getting a Gallup Poll as to the most suitable opening hours on Sunday he would discover that the public, the trade and everybody else concerned would be unanimously in favour of 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Sunday in preference to 5 p.m. to 9 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to know what the Government's intention is with regard to bringing this Bill into operation, whether it will remain with the Minister to appoint a certain day or whether there will be a day in the distant future settled upon in order to achieve the change-over with a certain ease; in other words whether the situation will be the normal one where the Bill, having passed through the Seanad and having been signed by the President, automatically becomes law or whether, after the Bill is signed by the President, a date will be fixed on which the Bill will come into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I want to urge the Minister to consider the penalty clauses again.  On fresh examination of them I think that while, in dealing in a certain way with the licensed trade, they might be an adequate preventive, they might in another way lead to abuses.  I would much prefer to see a situation in which people might drink and break the law rather than that anybody should be in a position to purchase freedom for himself to do so.  The temptation is there if the penalty is high and it is something that might be examined.  I am not suggesting for one moment that the police would be susceptible but there is always in every community somebody who might and somebody who might be able to have an overbearing influence.  Accordingly, where a <Col N="338" /> penalty is too high its preventive objective should be considered side by side with the real danger that exists, even if that danger is only an isolated one.</P>
    <P>I should like, thirdly, to join with Deputy Belton in calling for the review of the afternoon and evening opening of licensed premises.  I do not at all approve of the hours of 5 p.m. to 9 p.m.  I know certain difficulties will obtain in relation to sports fixtures at that time but both from the point of view of the publican's family and families some members of which would be attending public houses, the whole of the afternoon free would be very desirable.</P>
    <P>If there is to be an opening session in the evening on Sunday it should begin after the ordinary mealtime and after the ordinary times of religious services held throughout the country, and I would suggest the hours of 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. or 7.30 to 10 p.m. on a Sunday evening would be more suitable.  Fixing the hours at from five to nine is just taking a chop off the afternoon and taking another chop off the effective entertainment time in the evening and in the end not giving full value to anybody.  It is a matter that should be considered.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I should like some further consideration to be given by the Government to this question of the £200 attaching to the application of a six-day licence owner to the Revenue Commissioners for a full licence.  If the Government, for some peculiar reason, cannot see their way either to remove or reduce that ceiling considerably, then it should be spread over a period or attached by way of an annual sum to the annual licence fee.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to say any more on this matter; there will be another time and another place when I propose&mdash; and I hereby give notice&mdash;to deal with the Minister's assertions that allegations which I made in the House were not substantiated.  Permit me to say at this stage in reply that any allegations I made in this House were fully substantiated and were withdrawn in Court at the request of the Attorney General without giving the district <Col N="339" /> justice an opportunity of deciding whether a <i>prima facie</i> case had been established or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been opposed to these penalty clauses on the publicans because, human nature being what it is, it is unwise to give anybody the power to wield that stick, because I have seen it abused in County Dublin by certain members of the Gardaí.  It is too much power to give to any man who is not fairminded and capable of doing his duty impartially.  We can be thankful that 99.9 per cent of our force are impartial but we must have regard to the remaining small percentage.  It would be too bad if a decent man, for no good reason, were to be hounded down because of the penalty clauses.  It would mean that if there were a few prosecutions against him, whether he was a married man or not, he would have to close up.  I believe the existing law is sufficiently effective to deal with that situation without taking a licence from anyone.</P>
      <P>In regard to the amendment dealing with restaurants, it would be utterly impossible for any publican to conform to it without spending a good deal of money.  Public houses in other countries have these facilities and while I welcome the amendment in principle the publican, even if he has a considerable amount of money at his disposal, may not have the opportunity, due to the construction of his premises, to open another room for this trade even at a seaside place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wish to ask the Minister as this stage whether he has given or intends to give further <Col N="340" /> consideration to two sections of citizens to whom the general provisions of this Bill will cause inconvenience and even hardship.  First of all, I refer to those employed in public houses who, as a result of the Bill being forced through this Dáil by the Minister, will undoubtedly have their social and domestic conditions worsened.  In certain parts of the country, and in the city of Dublin, they will be able, through strong trade union organisation, to protect their actual working conditions to some extent, but their social and domestic conditions must inevitably be worsened by the deliberate action of the Minister, the Government and the majority of this House.</P>
      <P>Family life will, in my opinion, be very seriously disrupted as a result of this Bill coming into operation.  The Minister expressed fond, but I am afraid, illusory hopes in this House in regard to the laws relating to the sale of intoxicating liquor which have been so widely abused and so widely ignored in the past.  The Minister should look again at what he has done in regard to the extension of the drinking hours, particularly the official extension of drinking hours on Sunday evenings.</P>
      <P>It is expected that road traffic legislation will come before the Dáil in the future.  Having regard to the evidence from many countries in the world of deaths and accidents to people through road accidents as a result of indulgence in intoxicating liquor, the Minister, between the enactment of this legislation and the passing of road traffic legislation, should re-examine the provisions of this Bill.  I should like to conclude by saying to the Minister&mdash;I want to be sincere in this &mdash;that in this matter he is not his own master.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill contains most comprehensive legislation.  Unfortunately, it is like most other Bills passed in this House, legislation by reference.  The Minister very kindly, for the guidance of Deputies, when introducing the Bill, circulated an explanatory memorandum explaining the contents of the Bill.  Later, when the Bill passed its Committee Stage, a second explanatory memorandum was circulated explaining in detail the amendments made on Committee Stage.  If the Bill passes through the Oireachtas, is signed by the President and comes slap-bang into force, what will the impact be on the publicans and on the public?</P>
      <P>I want to make this suggestion to the Minister: he should ensure that every publican in the State receives a pamphlet explaining the opening and closing hours contained in this new legislation.  The public who frequent licensed premises should have an opportunity of knowing the hours by some method of display.  In the ordinary course, most people will shake their heads, laugh and say: &ldquo;Well, they will very soon find out.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That would be grand if it were ordinary legislation with ordinary penalties, but here we have a very severe penalty for a second offence, namely, endorsement.  I do not disagree with it.  We have endorsement for a second offence.  Therefore, there is an onus on the State to bring to the notice of all publicans the actual hours of trading under this legislation so that they may not come into court and plead ignorance if prosecuted for offences in relation to breaches of the licensing laws.  I think the pamphlets should be circulated through the Gardaí to all members of the licensed trade before the Bill is signed by the President.</P>

      <P>That is what I am afraid of.  I am afraid that the publicans <Col N="342" /> will not have an opportunity of knowing the actual hours with which they must comply.  If it were made known by way of the pamphlets through the Gardaí, we would be in a position to enforce the legislation from the moment of its enactment. Solicitors who practise in the district courts know the usual rag-tag and bobtail defence that is put up. <i>Ignorantia legis neminem excusat</i>, ignorance of the law excuses no man. It is often very mitigating.  It would be a very good thing if the Minister could see his way to issue such a pamphlet as I suggest.  It could be circulated at very little cost through the Garda to all the publicans in the Garda sub-districts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be publicans who are not members of that body.  I appreciate it is a wise suggestion, but, unfortunately, there are publicans who, in fact, are not members of the Licensed Vintners Association.  It would cost them some money to circulate these pamphlets, whereas the Minister has a method whereby he can distribute the pamphlets very cheaply.</P>
      <P>There is only one other matter to which I would like to refer.  I do not know whether it is in the Bill or out of the Bill.  I refer to the question of bars in hotels.  I think that by some section it is in the Bill or may be in the Bill, but according to another section we have no such thing as bars in hotels.  It might be no harm if the Minister took a note of this.  That is a very bad thing.  I can never see any reason for not having public bars in hotels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy P.J. Burke talked about the dishonest Civic Guards; he said that they were less than one per cent of the whole.  But there is also the dishonest waiter who does not have to display his measure in the presence of his customer.  In fairness to waiters, I must say that the dishonest waiter is very rare, but there is always the black sheep; and there is always the temptation, when measures do not have <Col N="343" /> to be displayed, to tilt it against the customer.  There is an old saying that when you go to church, you should see the clergyman; I think when you go in for a drink you should always see the bottle.  We shall not be able to do that if there is no public bar.</P>

      <P>I am sorely tempted to follow some of the arguments raised here today, many of them irrelevant.  In the main, the matters discussed today were already discussed in detail on earlier Stages of this Bill.  During the course of the discussion I gave adequate answers, in my opinion, to practically every point raised.  Despite that, these points have been raised here again today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to when the Bill will become effective, I should imagine it will come <Col N="344" /> into operation in the normal way that any Bill passed by this House becomes effective.  There has to be a period of something like five days between the passing of the Bill and the signing of it by the President.  Presumably the same pattern will be followed in this instance.</P>
    <P>I believe the Bill makes a fair attempt to deal with the very difficult problem of the hours of opening for the sale of intoxicating liquor.  I believe the Bill has been improved in its passage through the House.  I believe too, it will prove to be a good measure but, in that regard, only time will tell.  Licensing legislation here, as elsewhere, needs to be adapted to changing circumstances.  I am hopeful that we have made a fair attempt at settling the question of stabilised general hours of opening for some time to come.</P>
    <P>Whether the Bill proves to be a good measure or a bad measure, one thing is certain; nobody can accuse this House, the Government, or myself, of having acted hastily and without full consideration of all the issues involved. When the Bill was introduced it was accompanied by an explanatory memorandum in, as Deputy O'Donnell said, non-legal language.  We went out of our way to ensure that the explanatory memorandum would be written in language easily understood by the ordinary man in the street.  The memorandum was used to a considerable extent by Deputies in the course of the debate, but not to the extent I should have liked to have seen it used.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage we issued a second explanatory memorandum. When we arrived at the Report Stage we issued a third.  From that point of view I am satisfied that in relation to the Intoxicating Liquor Bill every Deputy was as well informed as he could be on any measure piloted through this House.  There was obviously a general appreciation of the issues involved.  Controversial matters were debated fully, perhaps sometimes to the point of being over argued.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to one matter on which every Deputy who took part in the debate spoke <Col N="345" /> so that it seemed as if all Deputies were speaking with one voice.  I refer to the necessity for a uniform, impartial enforcement of the licensing laws and for their strict observance by the licensed trade and the public alike. I want to assure the House and, through the House, the general public outside, that the Government and I, as Minister for Justice, are determined that laws made in this House will be enforced.</P>
    <P>Since the Report Stage, I have attended a conference consisting of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, his senior headquarters officers and the chief superintendents in charge of the various divisions throughout the country.  I addressed that conference in Garda Headquarters and I intimated to the conference what the Government's intentions were, what the intentions of this House were, and what the intentions of every Party practically, with one or two dissentient voices, in the House were, namely, the strict enforcement of this law fairly and impartially.  I impressed upon them the desirability of intimating to licensees throughout the country the urgent necessity, even at this stage, of taking note of the fact that this law will be strictly enforced.  I am satisfied that those to whom I was speaking understood the position in relation to the attitude of the Government and the House.  What I say now should be taken as a warning to the licensed trade, a warning they would be well advised to heed, to start putting their houses in order forthwith.</P>
    <P>It would not, I think, be practicable to adopt Deputy O'Donnell's suggestion.  It would be just as useful to send out a document of that kind in relation to every Bill passed in this House.  As far as members of the licensed trade are concerned, I am satisfied they are well informed with regard to this Bill.  I have met a number of members of the licensed vintners' organisation.  They are a well organised body of people, well able to make their case.  They also understood the case I made to them, and they are fully aware what the <Col N="346" /> penalties will be in respect of failure to carry out the law in this case.</P>
    <P>I think the House will agree with me that it is desirable that a law of this kind should be enforced.  If we can enforce this law, I have no doubt whatever that we shall be able to enforce many other laws not now receiving the respect they should.  If we can initially ensure that the law, in respect of the licensed trade, is carried out, we shall be well on the road to ensuring that our laws, generally, will be respected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably in the heat and excitement of political and economic affairs we tend to overlook the fact that fundamental to all our activities is the problem of the education and the moulding of the minds of our people.  I have the feeling that there is in the Department of Education and among educationists in this country rather too much complacency.  I feel that unless and until we make a break-through in educational matters we shall not bring about in economic, social and political affairs the revolution which I believe to be so very necessary.  When I was much younger we did make a break-through in educational matters by developing the vocational education system.  That was a completely Irish system, a product of Irish minds which arose out of Irish circumstances.  It is the only part of our educational system at present which we have not inherited from those who ruled us before we got our freedom. I think it is worth having a look at it if we want to find a pattern which might be applied to our educational system in general.</P>
      <P>Our greatest weakness, as far as education is concerned, is that it is one of the main contributors to snobbery, and one of our difficulties in re-organising our social and economic affairs is that very snobbery.  Unfortunately, it arises because of the fact that our primary education is open to all and is well distributed throughout the length and breadth of the country. But what we are pleased to call secondary education is not available to all our children.  Out of every seven children only one goes to a secondary school and out of every twenty children only one goes to a vocational school.  I have not available to me at the moment statistics showing the numbers that attend Universities but you will find that the figure becomes more and more frightening as we progress up the scale of educational activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A certain amount of pride has been taken in the increased amounts available for education and certain people have felt we are making considerable progress by reason of the increased Votes which this House has given to education over the years, but I wonder <Col N="350" /> whether if we subtracted from them the increases in the salaries to teachers, the increases in the cost of building and in the cost of maintenance, we would find that, compared with other countries, we have made little or no progress and that the percentage increase in the Vote, related to improved services in education, is infinitesimally small.  I believe that is a most unfortunate situation.</P>
    <P>We have had a tendency in other activities to regard as capital expenditure items which, in days of yore, were regarded as current expenditure, and in relation to education, I think we have not properly capitalised the value of a better educated youth, of a youth with a broader education in cultural subjects, and of a youth with a better education in the scientific and technical subjects which are playing a greater part in our economic life and which, as time goes on, if we are to improve at all, must play an even greater part.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that our Governments in general have been rather parsimonious in relation to what we have offered our children by way of educational facilities and I believe there is a great future for this country if only we can properly appreciate that we must have a radical improvement in the educational facilities we offer them.  I can say that we of Fine Gael are determined to bring this about, even though we know it will cost a great deal of money.  We believe it is sensible to invest more in the education of our children so that if they spend their lives in this country, they will give a return for that investment.</P>
    <P>There are particular aspects in relation to schooling in Dublin to which I should like to refer.  One relates to the times at which schools are open.  I am particularly concerned about infant schools and I believe any steps which can be taken to have one continuous session for infant schools should be introduced because, if you have children of the ages of five, six, seven, and eight years going to school, it is almost essential in a busy city like Dublin, each road having so many vehicles moving at fast speeds, that the mothers must go <Col N="351" /> to the schools to collect their children coming home and must bring them to the schools in the morning.  To my mind, it is very unfair both to the children, to the mothers, and to the fathers, that children should have four journeys daily to and from schools in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately that is what is happening and, where you have the father of a household coming home to a midday meal, it is particularly difficult for the mother to go to the school and bring her children back home, over a journey of perhaps a mile or a mile and a half, have a meal on the table and then bring the children back to school again.  It cannot be done without danger to the health of the children, on the one hand, and without grave inconvenience and worry to the parents, on the other. I appreciate that the matter of hours is left to school managers and to teachers, but I feel that the matter is so important that, in the infant and junior schools, there should be one fixed session so as to ensure that there will be only one trip to and from the schools in the course of a day.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to snobbery, and I am sorry that regulations about uniforms are still maintained in so many schools.  I appreciate that these regulations apply in the main to secondary schools, which are outside the direct control of the Department of Education, but, as the Minister knows full well, one can, by negotiation, persuasion and by utterance in this House, bring about an improvement.  Goodness knows, secondary education costs enough, and there are many parents depriving themselves not only of luxuries but of necessaries in order to provide their children with secondary education.  If, in addition to the burden of school fees and of providing books and other equipment, schools change their uniforms from time to time and compel parents to purchase the changed uniforms, an additional and unfair burden is imposed on the parents.</P>
    <P>I certainly would like to see steps being taken to ensure the removal, from the backs of parents, of the <Col N="352" /> burden of useless uniforms.  I say useless, because no girl with any sense of self-respect or pride would wear them outside school walls, and the idea of parents being told to go to a particular shop and purchase a uniform and fittings from that shop, and no other, to my mind, is a carry back to a day which we in this country should long since have left behind.  I hope there will be an improvement in that regard.</P>
    <P>We have constitutional guarantees for free primary education.  Yet, we find in the Estimates only a token sum of £5,000 for school books for children in primary schools.  Where there are a large number of children in a family, and school books are changed from year to year, a considerable burden is imposed on the parents.  Indeed, the life of a school book in the hands of any young child is very limited, so that, in the ordinary course of events, where a number of children use the same text books in a family, these books have to be replaced every few years.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that the books of children who have passed qualifying examinations are available.  The percentage of such books is exceedingly small and I think it is about time we faced that fact.  The cost of school books is increasing all the time and I believe the Department should allocate a much greater sum for the provision of these text books.  If that were done, the Department would not be so ready to change continually the text books, and if the State had to bear the cost, it might have a little more regard to the cost of replacing text books which are so frequently and with so little reason changed.</P>
    <P>I hope this year we shall not have the complaints we have had for so long concerning slowness in the publication of the results of the Intermediate and Leaving Certificate examinations.  It is no excuse whatsoever for any Minister to say that by reason of the large number of candidates presenting themselves for examination, and by reason of the intricate system of examining the results, it is not possible to bring out the results any earlier.  In many cases, a child's career may well be <Col N="353" /> ruined by reason of examination results not being available soon enough and I think that as soon as a child has completed the Intermediate or Leaving Certificate examination, it should be possible to get the final result within a matter of two months at the outside. That should be done in order to allow the parents, the teachers and children themselves to decide their future and I believe that, whatever the extra cost involved, it would be well worth while and would be only fair to the children and the parents.</P>
    <P>In an age of scientific and technical advancement, the amount of money we are spending on scientific and technical education is appallingly low.  The fact that there are not much larger capital grants for secondary school laboratories shows a very narrow mind indeed.  If we do not train our children at the right time, at a time when we could train them at relatively small cost, we shall be the losers in the long run.  One of the difficulties experienced in our Universities is that our scientific and technical students in their first year are in many cases only picking up what they ought to have learned in the laboratories and science rooms of secondary schools.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which is just as important as and, in fact, more important than other very important schemes which have got recognition, such as the scheme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and the assistance being given to industries to set up factories.  Capital investment in education at the proper time and at the proper level is just as important in this country as investment in these other sideshows and unless and until capital is invested in education, the country will be the loser.</P>
    <P>I deliberately did not make reference earlier to the position of the Irish language in the schools, because I would love to see the day when Dáil Éireann would discuss the Estimate for the Department of Education without reference to the Irish language. Unfortunately, the Irish language has bedevilled our whole educational outlook and unfortunately the outlook of the Department of Education is: Irish first and everything <Col N="354" /> else secondary.  That has done untold damage to the language which I love and respect and which I was fortunate to be taught in school.  I am one of the very few people who have any facility in using it.</P>
    <P>I and people in my profession have had advantages that are not available to others.  In my profession, before I could qualify, it was necessary to display a knowledge of Irish, which meant that for a period of four years after leaving the secondary school, I had to have an oral and written knowledge of Irish.  Notwithstanding that, in my profession&mdash;the solicitors' profession&mdash;there are perhaps less than one per cent. who can speak Irish. The reason is that they have not an opportunity from day to day of speaking or writing Irish.  Until that situation comes about, all the work being done in the schools will be completely lost.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why the effort in the schools is being lost is that Irish is taught according to rules and regulations. I feel that we shall not revive Irish as a spoken language until we burn every grammar that was ever published in Irish, from Gramadach an Mhicléinn, or whatever is now on the course; I suppose that has gone long since.  I know many people who have a fear of speaking Irish lest they break the rules of grammar.  Indeed, I know of one person who has confidence in speaking Irish only when he is somewhat under the influence of alcohol, in which case he is no longer concerned with the rules of grammar, and it flows out of him quite fluently and naturally.</P>

      <P>The Irish or the alcohol?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish.  The alcohol flows freely into him.  It is the dread of making mistakes in grammar which discourages so many people from using Irish and the fact that Irish has been taught according to rules of grammar has created considerable hostility in the minds of people who otherwise would be quite friendly disposed towards the language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken to a number of experienced <Col N="355" /> educationists recently.  They have informed me that they believe there is an increasing amount of hostility towards Irish amongst the younger generation.  The reason is not difficult to find.  The school-going children today are the children of the first generation who were subjected to the system of compulsory Irish which we have come to deplore.  Parents of 30 to 50 years of age, whose children are now at school, were subjected to the present system when they were at school and they came to abhor the language.  Now, their children, when they experience any difficulty in relation to the language, get a sympathetic pat on the head from parents who have gone through the same mill and are told: &ldquo;Do not worry, child.  It will not be long until you leave school and you can forget all about it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I must say I supported the idea of having oral Irish in the Leaving Certificate examination, but it is only now that one is hearing about the reaction to that examination this year. Three headmasters of secondary schools have told me that the result of it was that in the case of children who formerly had a certain degree of hostility towards the written language but who were prepared to speak it in the schoolyard and outside the school, now that they are compelled to go through an oral examination, that hostility had extended to oral Irish also.  That may be a passing phase because of a certain fear that developed in relation to the Irish test. I should prefer to see oral Irish being tested by the general ability of the school or class rather than by marks awarded to individual pupils.  I should like to see the school as such judged by the facility of the children of that school in speaking Irish.  If we are to continue or to introduce any system which creates more fear or more worry in the minds of pupils in relation to the Irish language, we shall defeat the ends which we are supposed to have in mind.</P>
    <P>I join with others in denouncing one of the most contemptible and damaging remarks that have been made in relation to the Irish language for years <Col N="356" />&mdash;the remarks of the Minister for Defence recently in Mallow.  He spoke about those who wanted to see a change in the system of fostering Irish as Castle hacks and descendants of those who enslaved the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a matter, I take it, for the Minister for Defence, and not for the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister for Education might take the Minister for Defence in hands and improve his outlook. That is the purpose of the Department of Education.  If those who pretend to love the language treat as hostile and as enemies of the language those who believe that the present methods adopted to achieve the revival are bad, they will attend the requiem of the language which they pretend to love.</P>
      <P>It has been said by a distinguished member of the Seanad, Senator Hayes, who was Ceann Comhairle of this House for 10 years and who, in his day as Minister for Education, was mainly responsible for introducing the present system as we know it, that he realised that the present system had not succeeded.  He compared the situation with that of a person having a sick relative or friend who was not responding to a particular course of treatment.  If you loved that friend or relative, you would ask the doctor to change the course of treatment and if the doctor was not prepared to do it, you would change the doctor.  Those who pretend to love the language insist on the treatment being continued, although the language is dying for want of the supply of healthy life which should be going into it and which would be going into it if it were a language the people loved and respected and not, as it is at this moment, a language which people have come to fear, to abhor and to hold in disrespect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While speaking on this subject there is another aspect of the educational system which I think needs to be remedied, the large number of students who are taking the classics, Latin and Greek.  I am not opposed to the <Col N="357" /> classics in any way but I believe in our day and age when there are so many demands on the time and on the minds of our children and when the opportunities for using the classics are so very small that we should not have so many students as we at present have taking Latin.  There are few taking Greek but I should like to see the number taking Latin cut by about 95 per cent. because it is not true to say that it is desirable that all students should take Latin because of the large number of vocations we have.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to have Latin taught to all students of secondary schools because as many as five per cent. or ten per cent. may join some religious order.  In other countries, where vocations are just as numerous as they are here, there is not this emphasis on Latin and I should like to see the Department step in, if necessary, to remedy that situation by reducing the marks allocated to the classical languages and increasing the marks for modern Continental languages.</P>
    <P>If this country is to widen its horizons, it must do so in all directions and it must be able to see the world other than through the eyes of Britain, but so long as our people are confined to a knowledge of the English language, the Irish language and Latin, they will not be able to look out except through very confined windows.  When we are concerned about expanding our markets abroad, it is also desirable that our businessmen going abroad negotiating with and talking to foreigners in Continental Europe and elsewhere should be able to speak to these people in their own languages.  I understand from businessmen that it is particularly difficult to find combined in the one person a good speaking knowledge of a Continental language, on the one hand, and good commercial experience, on the other.</P>
    <P>It is not a narrow-minded approach on my part; it is not because I do not appreciate the great value of a classical training but because one must put in the balance the advantages which the majority of students can obtain from the education available to them.  Therefore, <Col N="358" /> I think we must radically overhaul our system of teaching modern languages.  The main overhaul required here is of course to create an educational system under which there will be a smooth flow of pupils right up through the whole system.  At present the system is completely disjointed. We have the national school based on the parish.  The child does its Primary Certificate examination at the age of 12 and must remain there for two more years.  It is a waste of time for that child and the child distracts other pupils during those two years in the primary school or else the child leaves the primary school and the parents pay for him or her in the secondary schools, in the main provided&mdash;very fortunately for us&mdash;by religious orders who by reason of the fact of being religious orders, can run those schools for less than if they were run by laymen.</P>
    <P>We have, first of all, that damping down of the social consciousness of the child at the age of between 12 and 14 when well-to-do children are taken out of the primary school and sent to a higher level.  There you have one of the seeds of Irish snobbery sown at a very dangerous and impressionable age.  Some pupils are sent, not to fee-paid secondary schools but to vocational schools, and there they are left for as long as their parents can afford to do without earnings these children might be able to bring in.  They are in a separate social class.  Passing to the secondary school, the students come to the final year and again unless a student is lucky enough to get a scholarship, his chances of higher education depend entirely on the means his parents have.  It depends not only on the ability of the parent to pay the fee but also on whether or not the parents can withstand the hardship of being without the earnings which these young children might bring in if they were out making money.</P>
    <P>We shall have to overhaul this to provide a natural flow from one unit of the system to another.  I believe there is a great future ahead for this country and that benefits will flow from an alteration in the system, if it can be introduced.  I do not see why, <Col N="359" /> if we face the matter bravely, it could not be done.  I think the Commission on Emigration in which at one time we placed great hopes has been a great disappointment.  Many of the recommendations of the Commission on Primary Education were excellent but very few of them have been implemented. For instance, the recommendation that there should be local councils of education throughout the country was very sensible but the only type of local council of education we have is the vocational education committee. If we expanded that idea we would bring about an improved flow of pupils and more opportunities between the schools.</P>
    <P>At present students in vocational schools in the main&mdash;with one exception in Dublin, I think&mdash;are not trained to Leaving Certificate, with the result that those who go to vocational schools, so far as higher education is concerned, enter a <i>cul de sac</i>, even though they might be the most brilliant students of the generation. They stay in vocational schools and that is as far as they go.  If we can make our schools what they ought to be&mdash;great institutions of social democracy in which the highest degree of education is available to the poorest of the poor&mdash;we shall make a contribution to the country which at present cannot be accurately assessed but which in the benefits it will confer on the country is worth the price we may now have to pay to attain it.</P>
    <P>I suppose that in most Governments the Department of Education is probably regarded as the cinderella Department and there is no great political excitement to be got out of providing improved educational facilities.  But it would be very exciting and very beneficial if we overhauled our educational system and provided for our children the education they ought to get in a land which still prides itself on the title it once had&mdash;the island of Saints and Scholars.  We know our weaknesses; we cannot all be saints but we could be scholars if only we were prepared to pay the price.  I believe that the parents of young Ireland would be prepared to pay the price so long as it <Col N="360" /> was evenly spread and on that account I hope the day is not far distant when the Department of Education will take its courage in its hands and bring about some of these necessary improvements.</P>

      <P>I intervene in this debate to make a simple request to the Minister. Some time ago, a deputation, of which I was a member, from the Governing Body of University College, Galway, waited on the Minister.  We asked him to make immediate provision for the building needs of University College, Galway, in the light of a report he had received from a committee which was established to inquire into that matter.  While we got no assurance on that day from the Minister, we were led to believe he would do something for University College, Galway.</P>
      <P>The needs of that College are very modest in comparison with the other constituent colleges, particularly University College, Dublin.  I hope when the Minister is replying to this debate, he will indicate to what extent he hopes to provide assistance for University College, Galway.  He might also indicate if he will allow us to go ahead with the building programme that has been planned, or if we can continue with a scheme which is at present in operation there.</P>
      <P>That is all I want to say on this Estimate, although I was sorely tempted to reply to the statements made by Deputy Ryan.  A short time ago, he made reference to &ldquo;compulsory Irish&rdquo;. It is an extraordinary state of affairs to hear a Deputy decrying compulsory Irish, as I gather he did, and advocating, at the same time, modern continental languages.  While I might agree with him with regard to Latin and the so-called dead languages, it is an extraordinary state of affairs for a Deputy to deprecate the use of the Irish language&mdash;our native language&mdash;and advocate the use of continental languages.  It reminds me of people in the country who rush to join a German circle or a French circle but of whom we never hear as joining an Irish circle.  Anything but Irish!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> What is compulsory about Irish? Is the situation not the same with regard to arithmetic, history and geography?  All these subjects are compulsory.  You have to teach them in the national and secondary schools.  You have to have a grammar to teach languages, and you have to have a text-book to teach arithmetic. What is wrong about that?  If you are to teach any subject, there must be some element of compulsion. Children will not learn on their own. I hate all this talk about Irish being compulsory, especially from people who will not pause and examine the situation and ask themselves what are they talking about.  There is a lot of claptrap about the Irish language.  We know where it is coming from and the sources are suspect.  I was surprised to hear a Deputy sitting behind Deputy Mulcahy speaking of compulsory Irish and speaking against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to the last speaker and to Deputy Ryan, I think the misconception which Deputy Carty appears to be labouring under is common amongst people who resent criticism of the policy for the revival of the Irish language.  I thought Deputy Ryan was very clear, and I think he said he was against the method, not the language.  In fact, he appeared to be very much in favour of the revival of the language. I think what he was trying to find out was whether the Minister shared his belief&mdash;and it is a very common and widely-held belief&mdash;about what has become known as compulsory Irish. That has been explained <i>ad nauseam</i> by other speakers time and again. The policy pursued for 40 years in relation to what has become known as compulsory Irish has practically driven the language out of existence. Certainly, it has driven it off the streets, out of the cinemas, buses, churches, out of the Dáil, and out of any public place, and in the Breac-Ghaeltacht and the Galltacht&mdash;and for other reasons in the Gaeltacht&mdash;it is rapidly dying out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is perfectly reasonable for a Deputy who is attached to the language and would like to see it revived, to ask a new Minister for Education to <Col N="362" /> give his views on the whole matter and to ask him whether he shares his own concern about the obvious, gradual and progressive extinction of the Irish language as a spoken language.  However, I am sure the Deputy will deal with the matter, but I think it is unfair of those who believe in compulsory Irish&mdash;and they have the right, if they want to&mdash;to misrepresent Deputies who have examined the whole question.</P>
    <P>Over the years, I have dealt at great length and in detail with this Estimate. I do not propose to do that any more, certainly not in the foreseeable future, for the reason that I think it would be an act of supererogation on my part because there has been no appreciable change since the time I went into a detailed examination and analysis of the whole problem of the Department of Education and its policy in relation to the education of the children of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister happens to have the advantage&mdash;I suppose it could be called an advantage&mdash;of following one of the most colourless and inert Ministers for Education we have probably ever had.  After the years of colourlessness and inertia of the previous Minister, he could, by making some infinitesimal progressive submission or proposal, quite readily and easily have outshone the Minister who went before him, Deputy Lynch.</P>
    <P>If it were possible to act in another way, an obverse way, a complete reversal, the Minister appears to me to have done that.  He is faced in that Department, with the exception of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture, with what is probably the most important Department in the State. On the success of the policy of the Minister's Department ultimately depends the whole prosperity of agriculture and industry, and the wellbeing of our whole society.  In my view, in his opening statement, the Minister made no real attempt, no significant attempt, to deal with the many and great problems that still lie to him after the activities of successive Ministers over the years.</P>
    <P>For many reasons I was not able <Col N="363" /> to listen to the debate but I read all the speeches made by the different Deputies and I heard Deputy Ryan today.  To me one of the few useful contributions appears to be that of Deputy Ryan.  I wish he had gone on a little and developed his point&mdash;it may seem a small one, but it is a matter of large significance&mdash;in relation to the snobbery in schools.  Our whole educational system is a class system in so far as it is a system for the higher echelons.  All the Irish public schools and Universities are practically closed to the middle-income group families and certainly virtually closed to the lower income group families.</P>
    <P>We are perpetuating a system of education here which will make certain that persons will remain close to their origins and in the same class throughout their lives and that the same will be true of their children.  The carpenter's children will become carpenters; the doctor's children will become doctors; the labourer's children will become labourers.  All that is grossly unfair.  It is a complete negation of the ideals and aspirations of those who fought for the formation of the Republic in 1916 and of the Constitution which contains the ideal of cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  The Minister has made no attempt whatever to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan is quite right in his remarks about uniformity.  I derive a certain cynical amusement from a practice which is rampant throughout girls' and boys' secondary schools. There is an attempt to establish uniformity not only in clothes&mdash;which I would not mind so much, though I do object to the idea, which is silly and stupid&mdash;but also in the thinking of children.  Education appears to be directed towards telling children the answers rather than asking them to reason things out for themselves.  There seems to be the desire to foster in the minds of children an established attitude on thinking, on reasoning&mdash;an attitude of mind on practically everything. That has the effect of destroying the initiative of the child.  It destroys the child's facility to think things out for himself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="364" /> It serves the end purpose of these schools to turn out young people with an accepted attitude on everything and, in particular, on their position in society.  They accept the higher status and stratum of society to which they are lucky to belong&mdash;with all its great advantages, jobs, professions, facilities for making a lot of money and of being well paid.  The average child leaving a secondary school and going on to University is quite happy that that state of society shall continue.  He will not question it in practically any regard.</P>
    <P>The absolute unanimity of thinking which eventually is achieved in these fields is in many ways quite frightening. It has given me a certain cynical amusement.  One of the greatest criticisms levelled against the socialist is that he destroys initiative, individuality and insists on mass society.  In fact, that is the very thing which critics of Socialism do themselves, starting with the uniforms in the schools.  The unfortunate children must wear absurd uniforms right through school and up to the University stage.  I speak of an attitude of mind which is universally reflected in this House&mdash;with exceptions&mdash;on every conceivable subject.  I speak of the unthinking mind accepting everything that is laid down by the teacher and the professor.</P>
    <P>The Soviet Union have a comparable system in many ways.  They dedicate their educational institutions to the idea of the individual who accepts everything, who questions nothing.  There appears to be no difference between the two sets of society which prostitute this most wonderful thing, the educational system, to the perpetuation of a particular system of society.  I was particularly interested in Deputy Ryan's very brief reference to the very unfortunate perversion of our educational system through insistence on uniformity, whether in clothes or in whatever the child is taught.</P>
    <P>Another interesting question which emerges from our educational system is that&mdash;I am arguing on the advantages of State intervention in these matters &mdash;with all the disadvantages which are there and which I am criticising in the State school system&mdash;in the primary <Col N="365" /> system for which the State is absolutely and completely responsible&mdash;it is noticeable that the State insists on providing education for the total population up to the age of 14 years. It seems to me that in that part of our education which was left primarily to private enterprise&mdash;first of all, secondary education in schools and then the Universities&mdash;there has been a quite remarkable failure by these people to provide the necessary facilities for the proper education of children beyond the 14-plus age group.  There has been failure in relation to the State's activities also.</P>
    <P>I am not anxious nor do I intend to criticise the people who try to provide secondary education.  I am asking the Minister to examine the position. He must agree that they have had 40 years to do it.  They have probably done their very best in those 40 years to provide a secondary school education for all those children intellectually qualified to benefit from such education. They have made quite an outstanding failure of it, that is, relatively speaking.  They may be satisfied with their efforts.  We have been unable to establish a secondary school or a University educational system which will provide for all those children who require or who could benefit from such a scheme of things.</P>
    <P>I believe that the handing over of secondary education to and attempting to allow private bodies to provide secondary education and University education has been a failure.  It is understandable that it has been a failure.  One of the main reasons for its failure is that these private bodies could not possibly be expected to find the money to provide all the buildings required to provide a fully-equipped secondary school arm within the educational system or, indeed, University buildings or equipment to provide University facilities which are required within this State.  I do not say the State need necessarily intervene in all stages of secondary or University education but, until the Minister agrees to provide the money for the building of secondary schools in much the same way as he does for primary school buildings, these private bodies <Col N="366" />&mdash;let them try as hard as they appear to have tried&mdash;simply cannot provide education at a level or in a measure which will cater adequately for the needs of the children.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the figures in the Minister's opening statement.  They illustrate my point very well.  The money spent on primary education is about £10,000,000; on secondary education, £2,500,000; and on University education, less than £1,000,000: that is, outside capital expenditure.  It is quite clear that higher education is a matter of relative disinterest to the Minister and to the Department of Education.  There was a time when there were tremendous demands on capital for projects such as the magnificent slum clearance achievements of successive Governments.  Whether these demands justify a certain parsimony in relation to the spending of money on these different forms of education is another matter but that is no longer so.  Road building and the other non-capital forming aspects of State spending no longer exist to the same extent as they did.  The same amount of social capital has always been spent by different Governments and that money should now be made available to people who are anxious to build secondary schools and for the expansion of our universities.</P>
    <P>We are assured all the time by the Government, and particularly by the Taoiseach, that there is no shortage of capital.  We are buying jets and running them at a great cost and we are spending money in various parts of the country for every nationality under the sun for a great mass of industries which we hope will be successful.  Surely the Minister must accept that our own children have a prior claim on any available capital? If it could be said that the building of roads and hospitals is not what one might call productive capital investment&mdash;I believe it is, but assuming it is not&mdash;surely he cannot argue or will not argue in that way in relation to investment in education?</P>
    <P>In education we have a moral responsibility to every child gifted with a mind capable of coming to full <Col N="367" /> bloom and full fruition under proper educational circumstances.  We have a responsibility to give the child that education.  A consideration which might operate with the Minister, and certainly would operate with his colleague, the Taoiseach, is that we should have the highest-trained, skilled technicians and technocrats who are indispensable now to the proper expansion of the industrial arm on the one side and the agricultural arm on the other side, so that whatever way the Minister looks at it, it seems to me it would be sound and productive investments to persuade the Government to canalise more money towards the secondary side of education and to the universities.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, from the Minister's speech, that he is unbelievably complacent, in the light of things as they are.  There are very serious problems such as the extension of the school leaving age from 14 to 15.  In Britain they are thinking of extending it from 15 to 16 and, as Deputy Dillon pointed out, there are magnificent opportunities available for higher education in Britain and Northern Ireland.  It seems to me that to turn out such a high percentage of our children with, at best, the primary school certificate, and, at worst, relatively illiterate, is a very poor preparation for life for the average child.  It appals me to think of a child being asked to go out to try to earn its living at the age of 14 with only the primary school certificate.  It is quite appalling to think that my children should be asked to do that.  I sincerely hope they will never have to do it.  But that is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that I am all right or that my children will be all right. Every child in the State has exactly the same rights and should be given the opportunity to go to a vocational school and get his training there, not simply to join up, as they all do enthusiastically at the beginning of the season, and then drift away to get 30/- a week as a petrol pump attendant or drift into some dead-end occupation. I think that the opportunity for vocational education should be <Col N="368" /> afforded on the one hand, and on the other, the opportunity of staying at school until the age of 15, going later into secondary school with ultimately the prospect of going to the University. That seems to be the only rational and intelligent system for any society to adopt and it is the system suggested by Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>I should like to take up the matter with Deputy Dillon in this way.  It seems to me that he, as Leader of the Opposition, had a certain responsibility to pursue this proposition further than he did.  It is not good enough either for him or the Minister to utter the same empty platitudes.  I suggest that it is an empty platitude to say that every child should have an equal opportunity in education but that we cannot afford it.  Neither the Government, the Minister nor the Leader of the Opposition should rest at that.  It is not as if we were a new country adopting a novel idea.  We have had our own Government for 40 years and we were in existence for centuries before that.</P>
    <P>We have been 40 years in control of our own affairs and we adopted a particular social and economic system which has created many of the problems facing the Minister today.  It is not good enough for the Minister, the Government or the Leader of the Opposition to say: &ldquo;Well, when our ship comes in we shall do all these wonderful things.&rdquo;  I think that is humbug and refusing to face the situation.  The Minister for Education and Deputy Dillon know full well that if we wait for a month of Sundays, if we waited another 40 years, we would still be sitting here and the Minister&mdash; I hope he will be in the House then&mdash; and Deputy Dillon will be using the same empty platitudinous remarks.</P>
    <P>It all boils down to the one fact, that if we are sincere about our professions that every child has the same rights, we must say that the economic system we have operated for 40 years has failed to provide us with the money to do these things and we must say, as a distinguished predecessor of the Minister once said: &ldquo;If we cannot provide the money within the system, then we are prepared to go outside the <Col N="369" /> system.&rdquo;  In relation to this argument, the Minister for Education is displaced by the Minister for Social Welfare who says: &ldquo;We should like to give better old age pensions but the time is not yet ripe.&rdquo;  He is displaced by the Minister for Health who says: We should like to give the same standard of health services to everybody but we have not got the money.&rdquo; In turn, he is displaced by others.  By the present processes, following the economic systems accepted by both sides of the House, these will continue to be apparently unattainable ideals.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that they are not attainable; other countries have achieved these standards.  The heirs and successors of those who fought in 1916 have failed to realise these ideals.  There are other countries who, under less dramatic circumstances, set out to achieve these objectives and achieved them.  There is every kind of country.  There is the highly industrialised country like Great Britain. Admittedly, she had to pillage an Empire in order to subsidise the expansion of her welfare society, but there is Sweden, half industrialised and half agricultural; there is Denmark, there are Norway, Switzerland, New Zealand&mdash;every kind of country. Therefore, there is no use in saying we are a poor agricultural society, that we cannot afford it.  We could afford it if we set about it in the right way.  There is nothing wrong with the country or the people; it is the economic system we have to try to make work that is wrong.  People who have dedicated themselves to trying to make the private capitalist system work have failed.  That will not enable the Minister to make the substantial changes which are required in our educational system if every child is to get a fair crack of the whip.  I am sorry I used that phrase, because I want to deal with that question later.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not dealing adequately with these problems.  There is the question of raising the school-leaving age and also the question of the size of classes.  Some of the classes are small, admittedly, largely <Col N="370" /> due, unfortunately, to emigration.  In some of the rural schools, the classes are small, but there are city schools in which there are 60 or 70 in a class. In those circumstances, although I disapprove strongly of corporal punishment, he must have a cane if he is to try to keep order.  It is completely outrageous that he should be asked to teach a class of that size. The best he can do is to keep order; he cannot be a teacher.</P>
    <P>In this connection, the Minister did make the easy gesture of allowing married women teachers to start teaching again.  That helped a little, but, according to the Minister's figures, it increased the numbers to only a very small extent.  Taking into consideration the fact that the numbers in the primary schools have gone up, it is very debatable whether there is any nett gain in the teacher-pupil ratio.  It is obvious that if the Minister is to achieve the objectives set for him&mdash;I would imagine he would be interested in and would be influenced by the findings of the Commission on Emigration which recommended that 40 is the optimum number of teacher-pupil proportions&mdash;he has a number of very big tasks ahead.  He does not seem to have that in view in his Estimate speech.  I do not see any substantial progress being planned towards reducing the very high figures for many classes.  He will have to recruit very many more teachers and also provide greatly improved accommodation in many schools.  He is doing neither of these things.</P>
    <P>The school building programme is a little more than marking time.  The slow-building rate of the Board of Works is inexplicable and should not be tolerated by the Minister, in view of the fact that he makes money available each year in excess of that spent by the Board of Works.  How long does he intend to tolerate that position? Is it not about time he told them to get on with the work or established in his own Department a school-building section much on the lines of the Department of Health sanatoria building section which succeeded in building the necessary sanatorium accommodation?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="371" /> I criticised the secondary school and University building rates.  I believe the fault lies with the Board of Works in this matter and unless some progress can be made, by persuasion, with the Board of Works, he would be justified in transferring the task of school building to his own Department but he would have to act in a more dynamic way than he has in relation to other matters to ensure that the building rate is greatly increased.  There are between 800 and 1,000 dilapidated schools but the annual building rate is a little over 100.  There are children who will continue and will probably complete their education in these derelict schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister is fortunate in that as far as the building trade is concerned, the slum clearance drive and the hospital building programme are coming to a standstill.  Consequently, he can call on unlimited resources, building technicians, skilled craftsmen of all kinds, architects, and various other persons in order to proceed with the school building programme at the rate at which it should be going, if he is serious about providing better schools for our children.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to another question to which he did not seem to refer at all in his speech, that is, the question of untrained teachers.  Why does he stand over employing untrained teachers in our schools.  As a doctor, he would not tolerate an unqualified man looking after his nearest and dearest, if they fell ill.  That applies equally to other professions, architecture and engineering.  Why should untrained teachers be tolerated? There are historical reasons why they are there, but why does the Minister not take a decision about it?  Why does he not say: &ldquo;Within a certain time, you must be qualified or you must cease teaching.&rdquo;  Or he could accept those who have been teaching for 10 or 15 years&mdash;any figure he chooses to establish&mdash;as teachers capable of teaching and competent to teach children, and from there on accept no untrained teachers in the schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> Is the Minister really satisfied with untrained teachers?  Is an untrained teacher as competent to teach children as a trained teacher?  Surely the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  If they were as competent, why have trained teachers? Is it not about time this question was settled?  There is a very high proportion of untrained teachers and whatever the number is, no child should go through its educational career burdened not only with overcrowded classes and the difficulties associated with many of these dilapidated schools but with being taught by a person who has not been properly trained.  It is a problem which will not be answered by sitting and looking at it.</P>
    <P>The Irish language was mentioned. I was rather sorry to see the extent to which it dominated the debate, because it allowed Deputies, who should concern themselves with important issues such as the school-leaving age, the school-building programme, the teacher-pupil ratio, the provision of better education facilities for the children of the poor or less wealthy parents, to evade the discussion of those problems.  I have very little to say about the language.  We discussed it at considerable length on a motion a little while back.  The Minister then referred us to a Commission which is sitting and which, we hope, will report soon and tell us what their findings are.</P>
    <P>I believe, however, that with the best will in the world and no matter what methods are used, the likelihood of the Irish language becoming the spoken language of the people is irretrievably lost.  I do not think there is any hope of reviving it as the spoken language of the country, no matter who tries or how they try. Probably the best hope is to try to retain the language to the extent we can in the Gaeltacht areas and probably expand from the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why we should not face the facts.  If we dodge the facts, we are quite incapable of analysing any situation.  I hope the Taoiseach will have the courage to find out as efficiently as he can the present position in terms of figures as to the <Col N="373" /> number of nominal speakers left in the country.  I say &ldquo;nominal&rdquo; because we all know that none of us speaks the language to any extent.  I speak it when I go to the Gaeltacht, but never outside it.  The late Deputy Mongan spoke the language constantly and so does Deputy Ó Briain.  One can count on the fingers of one's hands the number of Deputies who feel they can conduct business in Irish in this House.  The same can be seen in relation to every other aspect of our society&mdash;the cinema, the church and sporting features.  You have people like Michael O'Hehir who might broadcast in Irish, but there is little or no use of the language outside the Gaeltacht areas.  I do not mind what the Taoiseach will find.  These are the facts as we all know them.</P>
    <P>This is due to the policy followed over the years, the policy which has become known as the compulsory Irish policy.  It seems to me that there are many reasons for this.  I believe one of the most important reasons is economic.  The fact that the average parent knows his child will likely have to emigrate to a country in which the language is not of any use conditions his mind.  The attitude is that one has very little time in which to learn anything at school and the time should not be spent on the language.  There is the difficulty about teaching a language that is not spoken in the home.  Then you have the tremendous impact of television, the radio, the cinema and tourism.  All our newspapers, including the Dublin newspapers, are written practically completely in English, a commonsense realisation of the facts as they are. With the coming closer together of the nations, with the ending of the introverted nationalism which is becoming wonderfully prevalent throughout the world, the attempts by nations to retire into themselves will become less and less practical and less and less desirable.</P>
    <P>I think that to a certain extent there is a considerable amount of disillusionment. There was a certain preference given because of the love for the language.  Sometimes it was real and sometimes it was imaginary but it all <Col N="374" /> contributed towards creating the apathy there is at present.  There was some absurd propaganda.  The wearing of kilts was advocated, a suggestion which would be regarded as silly to-day.  Who would question the nationality, the Irishness or the essential patriotism of people like Deputy Seán MacEoin, Deputy Jack Costello, on the one hand, or Deputy Lemass, the Taoiseach, and Deputy Traynor, the Minister for Justice, on the other.</P>
    <P>These are half-baked arguments, ill-thought out arguments which had no validity and the people saw that.  The American is as American as he can ever be and he speaks English and so are the Canadians, the New Zealanders, the Australians.  They speak what has now become a <i>lingua franca</i>, English. They are no less nationalist in their outlook.  If you question them, they are no less independent.  They believe in their countries.  You had these silly half-baked arguments.  There was the power of propaganda and there was probably a negligible amount of promotion arising out of the use of the language as a lever among political friends.  All these things contributed to a greater or lesser degree.  The net result&mdash;and many people regret it very much&mdash;is this hostility and apathy.</P>
    <P>I regret it in many ways because Irish is a beautiful language.  I think it is as beautiful as Italian or French. It gives me great pleasure to hear it and speak it and I should feel sad to see it go.  I do not know whether it is a rational thing to worry about such a matter as losing a language.  After all, language is merely a means of communication. The older Deputies will probably find it hard to accept that it can never again become what it was to many&mdash;I quite appreciate their sympathy&mdash;the symbol of resistance, the Cross of Lorraine 40 years ago. It means nothing in those terms to the young children growing up to-day.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable how a generation can change the whole attitude of mind of people.  I was interested to see in connection with a certain proposed trial that Ben Gurion was trying to bring back to the young Jewish children the memory of the behaviour of the Nazis in Germany who slaughtered <Col N="375" /> millions of Jews.  It amazed me that it should be necessary to try to bring back to the minds of growing young children the horrors of anti-Semitism and Nazi atrocities during the war period and it must be difficult for an adult Jew who has been through it all, who has seen it happen and knows all about it in its worst details to understand it.</P>
    <P>It must be hard on the older generation to whom the language was a beautiful thing and a symbol of their own personal courage in resisting. Seeing that the language no longer conveys that symbolism to children must be both upsetting and disturbing.  Again, it must be appreciated, and the fact must be faced, that no matter how you may try to popularise the language, you will never be able to popularise it in that particular way.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to Deputy Dillon's view that the language should become an instrument in the formation of an aristocracy for higher education and that, because people learn the language and speak it, they should be granted higher education.  That is a superb example of completely superficial thinking by Deputy Dillon.  First of all, he says we cannot afford to provide higher education for all our children and, in the next breath, he says that, in order to revive the language, facility in it should be made a condition of higher education.  If everybody learns to speak the language, Deputy Dillon will find himself faced with the problem of providing higher education for all.  If that cannot be done now, how does he propose to do it then?</P>
    <P>He is not greatly interested in the language as a spoken language.  He probably shares my view that it can never be made the spoken language but he nevertheless produces again this half-baked idea of creating an intellectual aristocracy of Irish speakers.  The absurdity is patently obvious.  A linguist is someone who is able to learn languages.  Why should a potentially brilliant mathematician, scientist, agricultural technologist, classical <Col N="376" /> scholar, or philosopher be denied higher education because he cannot learn the Irish language?  This is an attempt to create yet another privilege like the privilege in relation to jobs in the Civil Service, advancement in the Civil Service, and so on.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of thing that creates nothing but hostility.  There are some who can learn languages easily.  I happen to be one of them.  What credit is it to me if I did learn Irish? Why should I be privileged as against others who are not gifted in the same way?  I am an appalling mathematician; I know little or nothing about science; I am not a philosopher; I could never become a classical scholar. Why should others be victimised and I be privileged because of some God-given gift?  I do not believe Deputy Dillon has given this matter any really serious thought.  If his idea worked, everybody would learn the language, everybody who could learn languages, and he would be faced with providing them all with higher education.  Yet, he says now we cannot afford higher education.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon baulks at the same fence at which the Minister and the Government baulk.  Whether it is the treatment of old people, better health services, better allowances to the unemployed, the building of more schools quickly, the provision of grants for secondary schools and more grants for universities, we face the same situation.  Under the economic system we have, we have failed to do any or all these things and, so long as we adhere to the present system, we shall still get the same answers to the same question in another ten, 20, 30 or 40 years.  The country cannot afford it.  There is both dishonesty and hypocrisy in this refusal by both sides of this House to face facts in relation to every Estimate we consider here.  Fabulous sums of money are poured out by the Department of Industry and Commerce and we have no reason to believe that these sums will provide us with the resources we need to give our people even a modicum of social justice in matters such as education, health and old age.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a new Minister.  He <Col N="377" /> is also a medical doctor.  I should like to have his views on a matter which was referred to by Deputy Coogan and Deputy Lindsay.  I was both amazed and consoled to discover that there was even one other member of this House who takes the view I take in relation to corporal punishment.  I wonder does the Minister share my view?  I am, of course, absolutely opposed to corporal punishment, either in the school or in the home. It is an outrageous practice.  From a medical point of view and as Minister for Education, would the Minister not agree that a teacher who is asked to handle 60 or 70 children at a time has great difficulty in keeping order?  I suppose the justification for corporal punishment is that such a teacher could not keep order, unless allowed to beat the children.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the <i>rationale</i> of beating children.  We assume we are dealing with rational children.  The tragedy is that in many cases we are not dealing with rational children because there are so many maladjusted children, backward children, mentally defective children.  Children who are the products of broken homes are inevitably maladjusted.  Those broken homes may be due to emigration.  The fathers are away.  The Minister must know that creates serious emotional problems for the children.  There are the children from the homes of quarrelling parents.  There are the children from the homes, but fortunately much fewer nowadays, of drunken parents.  Such children are inevitably emotionally disturbed.  That has been shown pretty convincingly as a result of certain investigations in Sweden.</P>
    <P>The emotionally disturbed child, the recalcitrant child and the maladjusted child is invariably the product of a broken home or a disturbed domestic and family life.  The reaction is for the child to misbehave in school, to get into trouble.  Then it is beaten. That is akin to the old practice in Bedlam of flogging mental patients.  It cannot possibly put the illness right. It will not unite the parents.  It will not remove the cause of the child's maladjustment.  One is beating a symptom; one is not dealing with the <Col N="378" /> cause.  Consequently, it is both unjust and unfair.  There are not sufficient psychiatrists to care for all the children needing their attention.  There are not enough hospitals to care for all our mental defectives.</P>
    <P>The teacher is in the position of having to try to recognise, and it is very often very difficult to recognise, the maladjusted or the mentally retarded child.  That is a much higher grade child than the mentally defective child.  But there are those borderline cases which are impossible to sort out, certainly by the average doctor.  It needs a trained psychiatrist to decide why a particular child is behaving in a bad way.  It seems to me very wrong indeed that these sick children&mdash;and they are essentially sick children&mdash; should be beaten, and that is what happens in our schools.  The teacher does not know any better.  He may not recognise that child.  Even a doctor who is not a specialist may not recognise that child.  The simplest remedy is to beat it into silence.</P>
    <P>If it were a case of a mentally defective or maladjusted adult or a recalcitrant adult, I am sure nobody would suggest such a person should be beaten.  But why do we think it will help a child?  Of course, it does not help a child.  It just pushes the repression deeper and deeper, in which case you end up by making the child's case much worse than it was.  The child needs understanding; it needs affection and an intact home.  I know we cannot give it the last-named, but certainly we do not help it by beating it.  These children, for one reason or another, over which none of us has any direct control, become recalcitrant, difficult and hard to handle.  Our solution to that in the majority of cases, except where you get a very understanding teacher who sees the child's problem, is this business of beating the child.</P>
    <P>It is no good for the Minister to say that children are not beaten except for disciplinary purposes.  In many of our schools, the children are beaten&mdash;to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the teacher&mdash;for misbehaving themselves in any way at all.  So long as the power to beat is there, there will be abuse of that power and it is the abuse of that power I am particularly concerned <Col N="379" /> with, although, as I say, I am totally opposed to corporal punishment in any form.  The Minister, as a medical person, must understand to some extent as well as I do myself the real problems which are created by large classes with a difficult child.</P>
    <P>The next point in this matter of corporal punishment which I cannot understand is this.  The Minister must understand that the rational child will respond to a reasoned explanation.  I assume that the Minister accepts that point of view.  If the child does not accept a rational explanation for a particular point of view, then the child is irrational, abnormal, is, in a way, a psychopath.  But there is no doubt that the child cannot be put right by beating it.  If the child does respond to rational treatment, to an explanation as to why it should do a particular thing and why it should not do another thing, why it upsets other people if it behaves badly, then there is no reason in the world why such a child cannot be taught to behave itself.</P>
    <P>This is not an original suggestion.  I am not asking the Minister to plough any novel furrow in this regard.  This idea of not beating children is widely accepted in many countries of the world, countries which have no higher rate of juvenile delinquency than we have here.  There are many schools which are successfully run without ever using a stick, cane or strap of any kind.  Given that the children are not beaten by their parents and that you have reasonablysized classes of children, all properly examined to see they are not maladjusted or mentally retarded, given a normal classroom of rational children, the intelligent teacher can handle those children right from the time they come into his hands without ever laying a finger on them.  That has been proven. That is not an experimental thing.  It is accepted by educationists in many countries.  What a perfect relationship, what a much finer, much better and much healthier relationship there is in that teacher-to-pupil attitude than this one built up on the use of the stick, on fear dominating the classroom !</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="380" /> The Minister would be well advised to think in a cool, detached way about this thing.  It is about time we started to catch up with the rest of the world in some of these matters, especially when it will not cost the Government any money.  We can change this attitude to corporal punishment in our schools without asking the Taoiseach to part with any of the many millions to which he tells us he had ready access for any project, other than one of social advancement of any kind.  I would ask the Minister to think about this whole question again.  I cannot see how there can be any justification for a grown-up hitting a child, and that is what it amounts to.  The children are completely in our power.  We can do anything with them.  We can beat them to death if we want to, because they cannot hit back.  Why is it that we should do such a shameful thing as to hit a child?  The teacher is <i>in loco parentis</i> exercising indirect parental control.  That a grown-up should hit a child is an extraordinary thing.  It is accepted that a big person should not hit a little person.  Yet in many of our schools throughout the country grown-ups are perpetually hitting little children.</P>
    <P>This appears to be an unimportant thing, a trivial thing, but, in my view, it tends to condition to a considerable extent the relationship between the child and the grown-up.  One of the first things the child learns is to become deceitful, to be not found out, and the relationship between the adult and the child is broken down.  The adult becomes an enemy who must not find out what in fact the child is doing. That creates the deceitful child.  That is, unfortunately, only too true with too many children: the docile poor infants we sometimes used to see sitting around, clean, beautiful and angelic looking.  The fact, of course, was they were merely playing a part, saying to themselves: &ldquo;This is the kind of little humbug these people seem to like and that is the way I will behave.&rdquo;  But once your back is turned, they behave like the natural little children they are.  That seems to me to be part of the essential relationship of hostility which is created immediately <Col N="381" /> the adult lays his hands on a child.</P>
    <P>It is an outrageous thing that a big person should hit a little person, but that an adult should hit a child is one of the things that to me have always been completely inexplicable.  It is based on the idea that the child is irrational and will not respond to thoughtful, though admittedly it must be patient, argument.  I am prepared to stand here and you are very kindly prepared to sit and listen to me while I try to bring forward these arguments at various times, on various Estimates, and in various instances, and I am prepared to sit here and listen to those arguments being answered.  We are prepared to accept this system of rational argument in our dealings with one another; why can we not accept the same attitude in relation to the treatment of children?</P>
    <P>The teachers' case that it is due to large classes is no answer, because it is our fault that the classes are as big as they are, and that is a simple matter to remedy.  Therefore I would ask the Minister to think about this.  I know he is a gentle, kind-hearted person, irrespective of all the hard things I have said about him, and when he gives it a little thought he will tend to think there is a case for treating children in a civilised, humane way.  If that is done they will respond in the most wonderful way in the world.  I have seen it happen in many cases and it has happened in many schools.</P>
    <P>The main reason I stood up to speak in this debate was that the Minister did not at all mention something I expected he would have mentioned, something about which I have been patiently withholding questions from him for many weeks, and that is in relation to the extension of the scholarship schemes.  I understand, in relation to a debate we had here some time ago in regard to the extension of scholarships to secondary schools and Universities, that the Minister gave an undertaking&mdash;it sounded very rosy at the time&mdash;promising that.  I think it was the present Minister was concerned, not his <Col N="382" /> predecessor.  I asked him a question a little while ago about that and he appeared to give me the impression that we would get an announcement about a substantial expansion in relation to the provision of scholarships for children to secondary schools and to Universities.  That was a motion which was agreed to by this House and it was accepted unanimously.</P>
    <P>I know he has thrown a pittance to the Gaeltacht and that there are a few more children there who will get an education that they would not otherwise get, but to me it does not seem to be facing up to the problem of the segregation of the wealthy, the not-so-wealthy and the poor, in our educational system.  It is merely the Minister trying to inject a few more native speakers into the Galltacht and the Breac-Ghalltacht in order to resuscitate the dying language.  That seems to be his main purpose and it is that attitude of mind which I resent so much&mdash;the fact that he gave us this undertaking that there was to be an expansion in scholarship opportunities and that he has not brought that about, and secondly that he should allocate these only to Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>I do not want it to be said that I am opposed to expanding the opportunities for children in Gaeltacht areas for secondary and University education. I welcome those opportunities with open arms and the more we get them in the Gaeltacht and along the Western seaboard the more I like it, but again I am a stickler for this business of equality of opportunity.  I do not want any particular section of the Irish people, whether they be doctors, industrialists, or whoever they may be, to have a privilege that others have not got.  I just want equality of opportunity.  I know I have been misrepresented on this, but if some people have been born in a particular part of the country I do not see why that should give them privileges over other members of our society.  If a person happens to be born in one particular part rather than another, I do not see why that should give him a privilege be it in educational or health services. I resent this privilege in our educational system for the children of <Col N="383" /> wealthy parents&mdash;the children who through no effort of their own are given a higher education.</P>
    <P>When it is suggested, as I suggest, that we should have a welfare society in this country we are told that would undermine initiative, destroy independence and all that kind of rubbish.  If I can afford to send my children, no matter what kind of dunderheads they may be, to a secondary school or a University, that is no credit to the children.  It just happens that I can afford to do it.  Only people who are intellectually competent to assimilate the education they get in Universities or secondary schools should go there. If my child is fit to be a doctor he should be a doctor; if he is fit to be a carpenter he should be a carpenter.</P>
    <P>This system is merely a retention of the old &ldquo;son of the manse&rdquo; principle, which the whole revolution was meant to change, but instead of that we have established it more rigidly than the British.  The British have scrapped all that idea of privilege in education, privilege in health services and in other things.  They are the people who started this, the Tories, the Conservatives, and we are holding on to this out-dated, out-moded idea long after they have scrapped it for their own people.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that there is privilege in our educational system. That it should be so has always been a matter of wonder to me when I listen to Deputies talk from time to time about the problem of Partition. There are many difficulties in the solution of the problem of Partition but I think one of the most important will be the question of educational facilities, and also the question of social services, but particularly the question of education.  No intelligent Unionist in Northern Ireland will come into our society as it is at present organised.  The average labourer in the dockyards in Belfast would be a damned fool to accept participation in our society as now organised&mdash;that is the intelligent Unionist and I am quite happy that the intelligent Nationalist would be equally determined not to come into our society and accept the <Col N="384" /> second class citizenship which we allocate to the less wealthy and the poor in our society in matters relating to education.  Taken with old age pensions and discrimination in health services these are likely to be important barriers against the solution of Partition.</P>
    <P>One hears that the objective is that everybody will have the same opportunity in regard to education but that we cannot afford it now.  That is hyprocisy.  That is the real partition between our two parts of the country, &mdash;absence of equal opportunity, better health services, and a better standard of education.  These are the things that are going to make Partition insoluble so long as they continue to be there, and not loyalty to monarchs and absurd ideas of that kind.  There are perfectly good, reasonable explanations, because we have mis-handled the State over the last 40 years, why the thoughtful parent should say: &ldquo;No, thank you.  Bad and all as it is here, and it is bad enough in certain respects, it is better in regard to very important aspects of our lives.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As long as the Ministers for Health, for Social Welfare, for Finance and Education continue to operate their lackadaisical policy of complacency and inertia in relation to their various Departments, then I think the Taoiseach's present policy of saying nothing about Partition is a rational and reasonable one, and very sensible, because there is nothing useful he can say about it until these very important issues in relation to the problems I have raised here in regard to education and other matters have been dealt with.  I regret to say that I have no reason to believe that the present Minister is fully appreciative of the great problems that he has in his Department, and even more I regret the fact that he appears to be completely unappreciative of the tremendous opportunities he has while he acts as a Minister for Education in a society such as ours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise one or two points on this Estimate. The first is in relation to schools.  It has struck me that, in <Col N="385" /> the heavy schools programme we have before us, it is unfortunate that so many schools that have been built in comparatively recent years are found to be insufficient to accommodate the pupils in a particular district.  By cooperation between the Minister, the authorities watching the census of population and school managers, it should be possible to overcome the difficulty.  Quite recently, I was asked to use my influence to have a school extended.  It had accommodation for about 45 pupils, whereas there were 105 scholars in the district.  The school was built only in the past 20 years. That problem seems to arise generally. As I know the position, consultations do take place between the managers and the Department of Education and a decision is taken as to the size of school required and the Office of Public Works construct the school.  If that is the case, it is a matter to which the Minister should give considerable attention with a view to overcoming the difficulty I have outlined.</P>
      <P>In my constituency, there are four or five modern schools that are totally inadequate to accommodate the pupils attending them.  Having regard to our falling population, it seems there must be very great error somewhere. Unfortunately, many parents have emigrated and many children of Irish parents are born outside the country. Despite that, the schools are not adequate to accommodate the numbers that remain.</P>
      <P>It is very desirable, particularly in rural schools, that the classroom windows should be facing away from the road.  Most of the schools I have seen have a corridor off which there are two, three or four classrooms.  It does not take much to distract a pupil from his studies.  In a country district, every cow that passes and everything that goes by on the road distracts the pupil.  Human nature being what it is, I should imagine that very often even the teacher's attention is distracted.  It would be a very simple matter to have schools so designed that classrooms face away from the road so that pupils may attend to their work free from distraction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some schools have a water supply <Col N="386" /> and sanitary arrangements.  One aim of the schools should be to improve the standard of living of our people and to inculcate principles of sanitation. There is no better place to start than the primary schools, where all of us start our education.  I have been very impressed by some schools that I have seen, which have a water supply.  There should be a definite rule that every school should have a water supply.  In areas that have not a piped water supply, wells could be sunk near the school so as to provide the necessary water supply and sanitation.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me from headmasters that as a very high percentage of our people must lead a rural life, working on the land and in agriculture, it is very necessary that they should be educated in agricultural science.  There is one very definite impediment which the Minister could overcome.  The Department of Education insists that agricultural science teachers in secondary schools should have the Higher Diploma in Education.  It is very desirable that anyone who is teaching anyone else should have a high standard of education but it does seem to me that a person who obtains a degree in a University has a sufficient standard of education to teach a subject with which he is conversant. I therefore ask the Minister to consider allowing agricultural science to be taught in secondary schools by persons holding the degree of Bachelor of Agriculture, without insisting on their having a Higher Diploma in Education.</P>
    <P>On two occasions, I have asked the Minister questions with regard to first-aid and the Minister's reply has been that there is a half-day a week of free time in which the teacher or the manager&mdash;whoever directs the education&mdash; is free to have any subject taught. Without being unkind, it seems to me that that is an answer that would have been drafted for the Minister by his advisers.  We must be practical in all things.  It is the duty of a parliamentarian and of a Minister to be as practical as possible.  The Minister is a practical man.  How can national <Col N="387" /> teachers or managers of schools organise first-aid classes on a national scale?  If you are to have first-aid classes, you must have persons competent to teach first-aid.  How can individual schools introduce first-aid classes without the assistance and cooperation of the Department and without expert advice?</P>
    <P>In this country there is a Red Cross Society&mdash;quite a sizeable one&mdash;the St. John's Ambulance Brigade and the Order of Malta.  If the Department and the Minister are serious about having instruction in first-aid, it should be possible to call those societies into consultation and arrange for the instruction to be carried out at national level.  There is no need for me to draw the attention of the House to the fact that we live in a very dangerous age.  Serious troubles may beset the world and a conflagration may start at any time.  It is most important that everyone should have a knowledge of first-aid.  It is most important that a civic spirit should be inculcated. The place to begin is the school, with the youth.  The Minister should seriously consider having national direction in this matter.</P>
    <P>Apart from the risk of a world conflagration, first-aid can be useful in everyday life.  The Minister is a medical man, as I am.  How many people know that in a case of a bleeding varicose vein, life may be saved by lifting the limb and that the consequences of not doing so may be fatal? I read recently of a case of a woman whose clothing caught fire when she was standing near an open fireplace. She rushed into the open air, seeking assistance, and was burned to death.  I quote that case as showing how valuable first-aid could be, not only at national level but at the ordinary domestic level.</P>
    <P>It is not for me to offer an opinion in regard to our educational standards. This has been a long debate and that is a good thing, because education is such an important subject.  Like everything else, education must move with the times.  The curriculum in Ireland 30, 40 to 50 years ago was designed to deal with the type of pupil who probably <Col N="388" /> would not leave the country.  In those days, the majority of those who had to go, went to America.  Nowadays, unfortunately, boys and girls, we find, will go whether it is necessary or not, to seek new fields in other parts of the world and establish careers for themselves there.  For that reason, I feel that a modern trend in our educational system is desirable.  I think it was Deputy Ryan who mentioned that a wider attention to modern languages was desirable and that seems to have aroused the indignation of a Deputy on the other side who felt that this was belittling the Irish language.  Be that as it may, it seems to me that here is one facet of our educational system that could very well be dealt with and it seems to be the desire of the ordinary young person growing up to have that wider trend.  I know a town in my own constituency where there were voluntary language classes and out of 33 pupils, over 80 per cent. opted to learn a modern European language.</P>
    <P>This is a commercial age; we must move with and keep up with the times and, apart from the language angle, I think that in a changing world, it would be beneficial if we had in the schools themselves&mdash;I speak subject to correction; they may be there already &mdash;more educational discussions with the national school pupils, talks dealing with the Irish way of life, our history and so on.  With no derogatory intentions towards anybody, I want to say that our history began hundreds of years ago and in discussing history, we should go back beyond recent years and give the students wide coverage of national life and try to imbue in the rising generation a pride in their own country.  I suggest that pupils so educated could make greater progress, especially if they were aware of the state of the world now, the forces that face one another, the difficulties of the situation, the growing materialist and atheistic spirit that exists, the anti-Christian feeling.</P>
    <P>Our students should be fully instructed in all that is going on, so that they may be free to choose for themselves and if they leave our <Col N="389" /> shores or even leave rural districts to live in the cities, they should be in a position to face the issues of life.  Take a boy reared in a country district, brought up under the old educational system, the same now as it was a great many years ago, to the age of 14; he spends a few years after leaving school knocking about working, perhaps, in London, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham or the United States or wherever he goes.  Does he really know anything about the world and about the issues that arise?  I think it is necessary that people should be educated in this way.</P>
    <P>It has been my privilege to have been an Irish representative on the Council of Europe for some years now and I have had many opportunities of meeting people from all the countries of Europe, from the free world and even from behind the Iron Curtain.  In the case of the latter countries, they do not hesitate to instruct their people and keep them fully conversant with the changing situation.  They may be propagandising from a certain point of view, but I think it is our duty to see that our people know what is happening in the world and to make such information freely available to them in an intelligent, interesting and instructive way which young people will understand. This will help to fit them to face the dangers they will have to meet.  By doing that, I think we shall do more to preserve what we hold sacred, the way of life of an old Christian nation, than by doing what Deputy Dr. Browne has proposed just now.</P>

      <P>Tá cúpla poinnte le plé agam maidir leis an diospóireacht seo.  I dtosach, ba mhaith liom an tAire a mholadh as ucht an fheabhsú atá tagaithe ar an gcóras oideachais, as ucht na scoileanna úra atá ann agus na scoileanna a deisíodh le tamall.  An rud is mó ar mhaith liom moladh a thabhairt don Aire ar a son, 'sé an aoráid níos fearr atá ann anois idir na múinteóirí agus lucht oideachais agus idir na múinteóirí agus na cigirí scoile agus an comhoibriú agus an chomhairle atá ann.  Chomh fada agus a chiallaíonn sé sin go <Col N="390" /> bhfuilimid ag dul ar aghaidh, is maith an rud é.</P>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to the discussions which have taken place in recent years in connection with teaching Irish and fostering Irish in so far as that is being done by the national schools. There has been a good deal of Press publicity and discussion in connection with the Irish language and, looking at it all, I think we find we have three groups: first of all, what might be termed the purists who have adopted and are adopting the policies and methods that have been in use for the past 20 or 30 years; secondly, the group who advocate changes of method in teaching, changes of programme and so on; and thirdly, the group who are totally against the Irish language and against the revival and who, under the guise of criticising existing methods and past methods, are trying to make sure that the Irish language will be done away with as the medium of instruction in our schools.  On debates on various Estimates for the Department of Education over the past number of years, I advocated that changes should be made in the method of using Irish in our schools.  What the Minister is trying to do is sound enough, although he has not gone far enough.  He is trying to get the use of oral Irish more widely practised, and I think he is aiming in the right direction.  It is by putting our efforts and our emphasis on the spoken word, on oral Irish, that we can make the children more proficient in the language and give them a greater liking for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see a situation in most of our schools outside the Gaeltacht, where Irish writing and reading would be left over to the third or fourth standard.  From the third standard on, our pupils could get a sufficient grasp of Irish writing and reading and those years&mdash;although they are fewer than the years occupied in the life of a child learning Irish reading and writing at the moment&mdash; would be sufficient.  With a good foundation of oral Irish, the progress would be much greater in the latter years of the children's school life. Some of the critics have attacked the <Col N="391" /> older generation for their purism in insisting that grammar should be perfect and there is some justification for that.  It is true to say that some people frowned on anyone who made grammatical mistakes.  I think that is wrong.  No matter how many mistakes a learner makes, he should be pardoned, encouraged and helped, rather than the reverse.</P>
    <P>There are people who say that no progress has been made in the revival of the Irish language.  That is not true, or, at least, it is only partly true.  Great progress has been made.  A very large number of our people under the age of, say, 40 years had at one time, after they left school, a good knowledge of Irish.  They could understand the language and speak it, maybe not too well, but they definitely had reached the stage that, given the opportunity of using what they knew, they could have become very proficient, so that in imparting a knowledge of the language, we have progressed.  Where we have gone back is in the use of whatever Irish each of us has learned.  We have not had the opportunities to use it.  It is true that a revival is necessary, and it is true that we must begin to adopt ways and means to enable a very large number of our younger people to use and practise what Irish they have.</P>
    <P>Many people say it would take a national revival of spirit to do that. That may possibly be quite right. National spirit comes in waves.  We reach periods where it is low and periods where there is a quickening of the spirit of nationalism.  However, if the Minister and the Minister for the Gaeltacht can do more to ensure opportunities for practising the Irish which so many of our teenagers, and others between the ages of 20 and 30 have, they will be doing a good day's work.  Whether amongst the civil servants, the Garda or in the shops, if this extension of the use of Irish could take place, it would go a long way towards making Irish more loved and more widely used.</P>
    <P>The language revival is looked upon by many people as something which should be tackled by teachers, priests, clergymen and such people.  That is <Col N="392" /> a mistake.  Our pupils and younger people should understand that the language is an important part of our national make up, and it is an incentive to them, not only to become better Irishmen, but to become better citizens and better workers.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on the change he has proposed for the recruitment of national teachers.  Some years ago, I spoke on this question of the preparatory colleges.  I think it was a great mistake to take boys and girls aged 13½ or 14 years and stick an N.T. label on them, because that is what it amounts to.  They go to the preparatory colleges and then automatically enter the training colleges, even though, at that stage, some of them know perfectly that they have no vocation&mdash;and teaching is a vocation. Although they knew they had no vocation, the difficulties of finding some alternative and the penalties imposed by the Department if they found some alternative were so great that they just went ahead.</P>
    <P>The proposed scheme is much better for the reason that it will not require boys and girls to make up their minds until they have reached the age of 17 or 18 years of age.  At that age, the pupil has a better chance of knowing what he wants to do and deciding against teaching, if he does not like it. I think the older system, the monitorial system, was much better, where, before doing the entrance examination to the training college, the pupil &ldquo;had a go&rdquo; in his own home school.  After the first day, some of them threw it up and left.  Others left at various stages of the course because they knew they were not cut out for the teaching profession and, as a result, we had teachers who really had vocations.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the preparatory system joins together in one building pupils who study together from the age of, say, 14 until they do the Leaving Certificate examination.  They are all going on to be teachers. They never got the opportunity of mixing with recruits for other professions.  It was the only profession catered for in the preparatory colleges.  The new system will have the advantage that, during <Col N="393" /> their secondary school years, teachers will mix in study, in play and in discussions with boys and girls aiming at other professions.</P>
    <P>Over a number of years, there has been a good deal of talk regarding the raising of the school-leaving age. I do not know whether that is the solution to some of the problems which confront boys and girls after the age of 14.  Instead of an increase in the school-leaving age, I should like to see two things.  For the cleverer pupils, there should be scholarships to secondary schools.  Far more scholarships should be given to boys and girls after the age of 14 to enable them to continue in secondary schools.  A very large number of our brighter pupils and best brains cannot go to secondary schools.  A scholarship system to enable them to do so is necessary.</P>
    <P>I should like more vocational education opportunities at the age of 14 for those who are more skilled with their hands than with their brains.  In that way, we could, in a better manner, give advanced education, to national school pupils.  The extension of the school-leaving age to 15 years does not do that.  For the boy or girl who goes to a vocational school, there should be, after he or she has spent two years there, a system of free scholarships to special courses.  The set-up then would be that in each area there would be vocational schools with courses in domestic economy, woodwork, shorthand and typewriting and general subjects.  That is what they have at the moment.  After spending two years at a vocational school, the boys and the girls should be given opportunities to specialise.  To do that, it would be necessary to give scholarships. Take a boy interested in boat-building. He should be given a scholarship to some school catering for that subject.  If a boy is interested in electrical engineering, he should be given a scholarship to some central vocational school with such classes on the curriculum, and similarly with other specialised occupations.</P>
    <P>In that way, the majority of our pupils would get a post-primary school education.  It is necessary, even in the technical schools, to start the pupils <Col N="394" /> at the age of 14.  Whether it is good or bad, I am afraid the emphasis now is on specialised education.  The pupil specialises in a particular branch of education.  The old method of leisurely going through school and college and amassing a large amount of general education is falling into disuse.  People nowadays have no time for that.  They want the boy and girl to start their career much earlier than previously.  The father and mother want to see the children learn a trade or a profession at a much earlier age than heretofore.  The facilities which are available can provide for that.  It is much easier to qualify now in a shorter time, with modern methods and modern educational facilities, than it was some years ago.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne discussed our standard of education and the facilities here as compared with those in the Six Counties.  I have experience of the system in the North.  Our standard of education is as high as, if not higher than, that in the Six County area. That was proved during the War when children from the North and from England were evacuated here.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on his recent award to pensioned teachers.  Not alone does that action do justice to them but it gives confidence to serving teachers who realise and appreciate the attitude of the Minister and his Department.  The fact that justice is being done gives them confidence in their own Department and that is very necessary in any profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has been very much drawn out.  It is a very healthy sign that so many Deputies took part in it.  I remember that, ten or 12 years ago, very few Deputies spoke on the Estimate for the Department of Education.  I wonder if it is because there are now so many teachers in this House that the debate is a bit prolonged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With other Deputies, I congratulate the Minister on what he has done for the pre-1950 teachers in obtaining for them what was their due.  They are deeply grateful as are all members of the I.N.T.O. who struggled so hard in the past 10 years to ensure that <Col N="395" /> justice would be done to that section of our pensioned teachers.</P>
    <P>As we are speaking about pensioned teachers, there is just one other matter I should like to mention. Provision was made recently by the Minister for Finance for increasing the pensions of teachers who retired prior to some date in 1952 because of the increase in the cost of living. The cost of living has increased a great deal since 1952 and there have been several rounds of wage increases for workers of various types.  I wonder could the Minister persuade his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to increase the pensions right up to 31st March last.  It is remarkable that there is always some kind of barrier or some kind of boundary left in anything that is introduced here, just as there was in 1950.  Now we shall have the post-1952 pensioned teachers claiming their rights also.  I happen to be one of them myself but that is not why I am speaking on the subject.</P>
    <P>The Minister has achieved a lot of good during his short term of office. In fact, since I entered this House 12 or 13 years ago, various improvements have been made by the different Ministers for Education and today we have the happy relations which exist between teachers, inspectors and officials of the Department of Education and the Minister himself.  Those relations are most happy and that is due to the wisdom of the Ministers&mdash; Deputy Mulcahy, then the late Deputy Moylan, then Deputy Mulcahy again, then Deputy Lynch who is now Minister for Industry and Commerce, and now the present Minister. They all did their best and succeeded in bringing about these happy relations which should bring about an improvement in education in general.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to talk about the revival of Irish and how the advancement of education can be brought about.  It may be regarded as an economic question in a sense and also a question of method.  It is an economic question because we have not got sufficient money to do all the things we should do.  For instance, there is the question of the extension of <Col N="396" /> scholarships and also the speedy erection of all the schools that are required&mdash;700 of them&mdash;and the reconstruction of about 300 more. Another question which is frequently raised is the extension of the school-leaving age.  All these matters require a great deal of money which this country cannot afford.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said here at various times about the revival of Irish and some people within this House and outside it speak in such a way that they are often regarded as being opposed to the revival of Irish.  I do not think they are and in fact the majority here seem to be quite anxious to co-operate in every way for the revival of the language.  Really it is a question of the method of reviving it. It is there the difference comes in.</P>
    <P>I know that when the National Programme Conference was held in 1923 or 1924&mdash;representative of teachers and various other bodies&mdash;they set out the subjects which should be taught and the method for reviving Irish. That was a long time ago and it would be quite feasible that such a programme conference should be called again in the new age which now exists. I suppose that the commission of inquiry which is to be set up by the Minister in regard to the teaching of Irish and the methods of improving it should be able to evolve a scheme which we hope will improve the methods of teaching and which will bring about the revival of the language, if its personnel are reasonable men and women with no fanatics amongst them.</P>
    <P>So much has been spoken about the revival of Irish that everyone should now be an Irish speaker.  Yet in spite of all that has been done and all the money that has been spent on that project, the population in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and in the Gaeltacht is dwindling. As I stated earlier, the question is really an economic one because of emigration.  It is principally in the Gaeltacht and Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas along the western and south-western seaboards that emigration is most prevalent. Those places were the home of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>The teachers' organisation never believed <Col N="397" /> in the method adopted by the Programme Conference in relation to the teaching of Irish in the national schools.  It was held that it was ridiculous to begin teaching Irish to children of five or six who came in full of hope and heard a language which they never heard before and who did not know what the teacher was speaking about.  It made them most unhappy and I should think gave them an inferiority complex.  It is right that Irish should and must be taught in all national schools and in all schools, secondary, vocational and university. It must be taught as a subject, which is the best way to revive the Irish language.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of talk about compulsory Irish.  In a sense, it is not compulsory in national schools because it is a subject, like arithmetic, history, geography or any other subject, and where the teacher is not capable of imparting the language or where pupils are not capable of imbibing a knowledge of the language, they are not really bound to teach subjects through Irish, so that after all we cannot really say there is compulsion. There was a time when if a teacher did not teach subjects through the medium of Irish, he certainly did not get excellent marks and was not regarded as being highly efficient and I suppose all teachers made an attempt to do their best to teach subjects through Irish.  I am sure that is now changed and that the revival of Irish is now to be brought about in a manner which will be of advantage to the children and the teachers.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the raising of the school-leaving age.  That would require money but it would require something else.  It would require sufficient room in the schools for the extra number of pupils.  There are very many schools, especially in the cities and towns, which are not sufficiently large for that at present and extensions would be required to these schools.  Furthermore, we have not got the required number of trained and qualified teachers to teach the extra pupils if the age were raised at any time to 15 years and eventually to 16 years.  There should be a provision <Col N="398" /> by which there will be attached to each national school a certain high primary system of education&mdash;not exactly full secondary education but high primary education&mdash;and some extra subjects should be taught.  Of course, raising the school-leaving age and making provision for the teaching of Irish right through would certainly advance the revival of Irish. When children leave schools they do not bother again about Irish or even English.  It would be a great advantage if children could be taught to educate themselves after leaving school by reading good literature, both Irish and English, learning history and geography and thus continuing their education.  However, I am afraid that does not occur.  I am speaking of children who cannot go to secondary schools, and I suppose 80 per cent. or 90 per cent. of Irish children finish their education in the national school.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Dr. Browne speak at length on the question of corporal punishment.  There was a great deal in what he said, but if Deputy Dr. Browne had been a teacher instead of a doctor he would find he would have to use the cane sometimes.  If he has children of his own he is rather foolish if he does not use the cane at home now and again.  A good teacher can always maintain discipline in the school without undue punishment.  It is understood that children should not be punished if, because they are mentally defective, they do not know their lessons, but the teacher who maintains discipline will be respected throughout the parish in which he teaches.  It would be very difficult for him to maintain, discipline without the threat of corporal punishment.  There is no harm in the threat of the rod both at home and at school.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Government have not made provision for the erection of proper secondary schools.  I do not know if they give grants at any time for the building of secondary schools but there are secondary schools being established privately in towns and villages and good work is being done there.  We spend a good deal of money on building vocational schools, which is quite right, although sometimes they are too elaborate and <Col N="399" /> too expensive because in 30, 40 or 50 years' time they will be out-moded and a new type of school will be required. However, if grants are given for the building of national or vocational schools why are grants not given also for the erection of secondary schools in towns and villages where they are needed?</P>
    <P>There should be more co-ordination between national, secondary and vocational schools.  The ideal system, if the financial position would allow it, would be that after leaving the national school at 14 years of age, the child would spend two years in a secondary school or a higher primary school and then two years in a vocational school.  That would be the ideal system for those who could not have a University education.  It would be a great advantage to our people, whether they continued to live at home or had to emigrate, if they were skilled in the use of their hands as well as their brains.  We should ensure that the youth of the country are given the best education possible.</P>
    <P>There is no provision made for the mentally retarded child and the mentally defective child who should be in a special home.  There are numbers of these special homes but they are not sufficient.  Teachers have only two methods of dealing with the mentally retarded or backward child. They must either keep such children back in the class or have a special class for them.  It is not satisfactory to keep a child back in a class for a second or third year because that child feels the position; there is also the consideration that you will draw the anger of the parents because every parent thinks his child the most intelligent of all.</P>
    <P>The other method to deal with retarded children is to form special classes for them.  However, that tends to give these children an inferiority complex and, while it might be good for their educational advancement, they would feel the fact that they were being segregated from other children of their own age.  It has been known that children who were backward in school and who got the <Col N="400" /> benefit of vocational education, got on very well when they went out in the world.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to Irish is not satisfactory.  Our educational system is not perfect but, as I stated at the beginning, education has advanced a great deal and the happy relations that exist between national, secondary and vocational teachers and the officials of the Department, the inspectors and the Minister, will certainly help to advance it in the future.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful to the Deputies for their very helpful attitude in the discussion on my Department's Estimates and I shall try as briefly as possible to deal with some of the points raised.</P>
      <P>An Teachta Ua Maolchatha asked, in relation to the scholarships announced for the Gaeltacht, where is the Gaeltacht.  The position about the scholarships will be that nobody will be permitted to enter for them unless he is living in the Gaeltacht as defined by the 1956 Act and unless Irish is the language of his household.  Such winners of scholarships will be permitted to avail of them in A schools and B. 1 schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of scholarships was also raised in relation to children other than those from Gaeltacht areas who up to now attended preparatory colleges.  There were no scholarships, as such, to preparatory colleges.  Any students whose parents could pay did pay the full fee and there was no question of scholarships to them.  However, there will be a scheme of scholarships which requires legislation and, therefore, I did not mention it during the debate on this Estimate.  That scheme will cater for other people who up to now attended the preparatory colleges.  The preparatory colleges for which arangements have more or less been made <Col N="401" /> are Coláiste Íde, Coláiste Mhuire and Coláiste Éinde.</P>

      <P>Comhair a bheith socair gur gnáth-mheánscoileanna A a bhéas iontu.  Deputy Mulcahy asked about putting into effect the recommendations of the Council of Education. The first essential in putting the recommendations of the Council of Education into operation is the improvement of the staffing of the national schools.  Steps have already been taken in that direction.</P>
      <P>The removal of the marriage ban has given us a sufficiency of women teachers and the new buildings at St. Patrick's, Drumcondra, will ensure that there will be an adequate supply of men teachers.  The steps already taken to improve the staffing involved the creation of 100 new posts.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond asked how many of the newly trained teachers can be assured of employment.  All of them can be assured of employment in our national schools.  The Deputy also asked how many of last year's teachers are now employed.  My information is that all the teachers who left the training colleges last year are now employed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moloney was anxious that teachers should be taught rural science and domestic science.  I should like to point out that all trainees in the training colleges are taught rural science in the case of men, domestic science in the case of women and physical culture in respect of both men and women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some questions were raised in relation to the national school programme. Deputy Esmonde requested that a further subject such as instruction in first-aid be added.  The main problem is to find time for the basic instruction which is necessary.  That is why I pointed out recently that the half day of free instruction which is available weekly can be used by teachers to teach Red Cross activities.  Many people think that a great many more subjects could be introduced in schools but having regard to the present staffing, it is not possible to introduce <Col N="402" /> any new subjects, as far as I can see, at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner asked about Irish readers and suggested that something should be done about grading them. There is already an advisory committee at work in my Department examining the position in regard to the grading of those books.</P>
    <P>With regard to the building of new schools, Deputy Jones suggested that the teachers should be consulted. Some other Deputy spoke of the difficulties arising in regard to accommodation in the new schools.  When the new schools are being planned, every effort is made to forecast as accurately as possible what the accommodation requirements will be.  Sometimes unforeseen circumstances occur which upset the estimate.  I do not think there is much that can be done about that.  As far as possible, everybody concerned is consulted and as near an estimate as possible is made as to the future needs.</P>
    <P>In relation to the national schools and the reduction in the grant for heating and cleaning there is, in fact, no reduction in the amount of the grant.  The apparent reduction in the Estimate as compared with last year's was due to over-estimation last year. The same amount of grant will be paid this year as last year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde asked a question about school sanitation.  It is the policy of the Department to provide flush sanitation, wherever possible.</P>
    <P>The question of the mentally retarded child as an educational problem is always before our minds in the Department of Education.  We have at present provision in eight centres for such children and the full accommodation available in these centres is not being used.  In spite of that, plans are in train for increasing the accommodation, for making more educational provision for mentally handicapped children.</P>
    <P>There is one problem I have with figures in relation to children going on to post-primary education from the national schools.  Sometimes it becomes embarrassing to repeat oneself.  I find that no matter how often I repeat myself, I hear wrong figures coming back <Col N="403" /> and, even to-day, I heard various estimates of the number of children going on to post-primary education.  One estimate was that 80 per cent. did not go on.  I think it was Deputy Ryan who suggested one in seven and Deputy Russell mentioned some other percentage.</P>
    <P>It is a popular misconception and it is based on the misuse of the figures available from my Department.  In arriving at the percentages in relation to the number of children going on for post-primary education, the usual mistake made is that the figure accepted as a base is the figure for the total population in primary schools. Then the number in the post-primary schools is taken as the other figure and expressed as a percentage of the figure in the primary schools.</P>
    <P>To get an estimate of the children going from primary to post-primary, the base has to be the age group from 14 years to 16 years because the total population of the primary schools is 505,000.  That includes children from 4 years to 18 years.  Taking that total figure and expressing as a percentage of it the number of children getting post-primary education gives a false result.</P>
    <P>The number of children in the country from 14 to 16 years is 104,000. Of that age group, 37,000 are in secondary schools; 22,000 are in vocational schools; and 14,000 in senior classes in the national schools including secondary tops.  That is a total of 73,000 out of 104,000, which gives the figure of 70 per cent. receiving post-primary education.  It would be necessary to bring in a blackboard to explain this because the figures are difficult to handle.  The mistake is that the number of people in the secondary and vocational schools is taken and expressed as a percentage of the total number in primary schools.  The proper base is the 14 to 16 age group in the population at large.</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell, Deputy Corish and Deputy Dr. Browne referred to the introduction of more scholarships.  It is my intention that there will be an enlarged scheme of scholarships to <Col N="404" /> post-primary and University education. This scheme will require legislation and the House will, therefore, have ample opportunity of discussing the scheme when the legislation is introduced. That is why I did not deal with the matter in introducing my Estimate.</P>

      <P>Examination results came up here last year also.  People are anxious that the results should be out earlier.  The Leaving Certificate results are issued within two months, and the Intermediate Certificate within three months.  Someone suggested that by spending more money we could speed up the results.  It is not a question of money.  The fact is that it requires highly qualified people to correct the papers.  The pool is limited.  It is important that we should have a high standard of examiners. Under the circumstances, getting the results out in two months and three months respectively is an achievement. Written work from 24,000 candidates has to be examined.  It has to be marked, tabulated and checked.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Report of the Council of Education, I shall have arrangements made to have the report published immediately I receive it.</P>

A good deal of what Deputy Coogan said about the <Col N="405" /> University does not come under my Department as I am not concerned in day-to-day administration.  He mentioned a reduction in the grant to Galway University in the Estimates this year.  That is a reduction in nonrecurring capital.  It does not represent a decrease in the College income. The question of making a capital sum available to University College, Galway, was referred to by both Deputy Carty and Deputy Coogan.  I should like to assure them that the urgent capital requirements of both University College, Cork, and University College, Galway, are not being lost sight of.</P>
      <P>Some questions were raised about the space problem in the National Gallery.  A summary catalogue of the contents of the National Gallery has been prepared and steps have been taken in relation to the provision of increased accommodation for the hanging of pictures.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the Irish language.  I should like to repeat what I said at Column 847, Volume 179, of the Official Report on this matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Here is where I stand as regards the Irish language.  I believe that every Irish child should be taught to speak Irish.  I would ask those who have argued along that line but against compulsion how can a child learn to love a language unless it knows some of the language and how can it know some of the language unless to some extent the teaching of it is essential.</P>
      <P>A form of incentive which, at best, could only influence a limited number would in no way be a substitute for giving a knowledge of the language to all our children.</P>
      <P>I was asked what the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies does.  Its reports are presented to the House, Presentation 5462, which is available to Deputies in the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some suggestions were made with regard to Marlborough House.  In introducing the Estimate, I said a new site has been found and it is intended to make many improvements in methods when that building has been <Col N="406" /> completed.  I assure Deputy Dillon his suggestions will be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>The last point with which I wish to deal is the rule about corporal punishment in the schools.  Rule 96 is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Corporal punishment should be administered only for grave transgression. In no circumstances should corporal punishment be administered for mere failure at lessons.  Only the principal teacher, or such other member of the staff as may be duly authorised by the Manager for the purpose, should inflict corporal punishment.  Only a light cane or rod may be used for the purpose of corporal punishment which should be inflicted only on the open hand.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy Cosgrave.)</P>
    <Col N="409" />
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's statement. He expressed great confidence and referred particularly to the live register for unemployed.  I do not think it is fair for the Minister to say that because the figure on the live register is so low at present all is well with the country.  We all know that but for emigration the figure of 58,000 would be 108,000.  It is very hard to be happy about this Estimate.  When the present Taoiseach was Minister for Industry and Commerce he stormed around the country with his promise of 100,000 new jobs.  He has never made any attempt to keep this promise and during debates and Question Time has always avoided making any statement about it.  It was obvious that it was simply a cheap trick.  It was deceit on a large scale, deceiving unfortunate unemployed people, their wives and their families. That cannot be put on the record too often by members of the Opposition. It is something the Government Press will never publish or comment fairly upon.</P>
      <P>The Government appear to take great pride in their industrial policy because a large number of foreigners are coming here now.  For years Fianna Fáil prevented outside industrialists from coming into Ireland unless they came under the Control of Manufactures Act.  Great firms of international reputation would not come here and have a couple of members on a board along with a few Irishmen who knew nothing about the business and who could outvote them at any time.  That stupid policy was backed up by the cry from the platform &ldquo;We will not allow anybody to come in here and exploit us.&rdquo;  Now we realise that we would be glad to have people come in here and erect factories; we go even further and put up the money for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil policy towards my constituency has been disgraceful.  My constituency and the city from which I come have been treated as if these areas were conquered territory and the people had no right to anything. For years the people of Waterford treated any references in the papers <Col N="410" /> to industries with a certain amount of contempt, and rightly so.  When it was decided to put up further beet factories here, a case was made for Waterford as one of the best places geographically to erect a factory.  We discovered, however, that it was not right to make a good case, that you should make a bad case and put on the &ldquo;poor mouth&rdquo;.  The factory would not be built because a good case had been made but it would be built if there was enough &ldquo;pull&rdquo; behind the proposition.  However, they did not put it in Waterford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I can imagine what Major-General Costello would do if he had a beet factory in Waterford and the amount of money he would earn for this country.  He is now able to bring unrefined sugar into Waterford when the beet factories here are closed. He is able to unload it there, bring it to Carlow, refine it, bring it back to Waterford again and ship it out again refined.  That is magnificent work.  It is being shipped out to some of the greatest sugar people in the world.  But how different it would be if he could take the unrefined sugar from the ship, bring it straight into the factory and then reload it on to the same ship again?  I know the kind of tonnage deal Major-General Costello would make with that shipping company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The story of Irish Cement so far as Waterford people are concerned is something that stinks.  The market for cement was first investigated in the 1930s by a group of Waterford people at their own expense.  An option was taken on a river side site close to limestone quarries.  It had, as the saying is, road, rail and sea going into it.  I saw the whole proposition set out in a beautifully bound book, a copy of which was sent to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Portland Cement were the people who were to come here, but the next thing we heard about it was that the factory was in Drogheda.  That is a matter of fact. Good luck to Drogheda, but the people who introduced the project were cheated out of it.  This is no laughing matter for people who actually put up their own money and <Col N="411" /> did not make use of the Government's money.</P>
    <P>There was also the question of a lace factory.  The <i>entrepreneurs</i> were brought into Waterford in the late 1930's when the proposition was first made.  There was silence and then we discovered that the lace factory was to open in Ennis.  Then a legend was put out that the Waterford people would not put up any support for an industry. Yet Allied Ironfounders and Portlaw Leather were established, and in the case of Allied Ironfounders I think the capital of £100,000 or £120,000 was oversubscribed in a matter of 20 minutes.  That is what happened in the place about which this miserable legend was put out.</P>
    <P>During these years, in the 1930's, with the Economic War, the livestock trade was lost to Waterford and has never been recovered, and the great pig-buying industry in Waterford was destroyed by legislation in this House. We have bacon curers in the country at the present time and we had bacon curers then.  We had four bacon curers in Waterford at that time and we now have two, and even though I often heard the sirens in those factories calling the workers back for overtime in the days before this penal legislation, in the days when we had a pig-buying industry in Waterford, we were able to ship upwards of 600,000 live pigs from Waterford that were not wanted by the Irish factories because they were too heavy.  That might seem to be a matter within the scope of the Department of Agriculture but it was related to industry in Waterford.  It was related to the wealth of Waterford and it was ruthlessly destroyed.</P>
    <P>Coming on to the years after the war, there was a small battery factory at The Glen in Waterford and it just disappeared up to Dublin.  H.M.V. radios, gramophones and records were going strong in Waterford but the rumour circulated that they were to come to Dublin.  There was an approach made to the Minister but the Minister could do nothing about it. If it were anywhere else, it would not be allowed to move from <Col N="412" /> the place, but away it went.  An edible oil factory was started in the 1930's and then, after the war, we were told that McDonnell's margarine factory could not keep going in Waterford but had to move up alongside the edible oil factory.  It closed down and if that happened in any other city or centre Deputies from that place would be coming in here moaning and groaning.  Unfortunately the people of Waterford have a little bit of conservatism or independence and I would say it is a pity they have it.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the chipboard factory.  I know very little about this factory and about the nervousness of the people who are promoting it in Waterford.  They appear to have got the disease that Waterford is a conquered city or is the same as a city of the southern States undergoing reconstruction and under martial law. They were afraid to mention this matter for over two and a half years to either myself or Deputy Kyne, who happened to be a member of the Opposition, so I can assure the Minister that he cannot hold it against these promoters, these <i>entrepreneurs,</i> that they had anything to do with the Opposition. There is a great deal of unemployment in Waterford because no local authority building is taking place.  There are 1,200 men signing at the labour exchange in Waterford and the trade unions called a meeting last Saturday night to consider the position.</P>
    <P>A great many people came to that meeting and said it was a pity it was called because it might embarrass the promoters.  I think that is an extraordinary thing.  I do not think it would embarrass the promoters for anybody to call a public meeting and ask that the industry be sent to Waterford. I am sure the Minister would take that in the spirit in which it was asked and I am sure he would not appear to be a tyrant and say: &ldquo;You cannot have an industry now because you held a public meeting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Ormonde, my colleague from Waterford, said it was ill-advised. The chairman of Waterford Harbour Commissioners said it should not have been brought about, but I consider it <Col N="413" /> was the people's democratic right to ask, and it was interesting to hear what I heard at that meeting.  There is a factory at Scariff in County Clare but the people who are promoting the Waterford factory say they have investigated the market and that they are not going to bother with the Clare factory's market.  The whole thing boils down to the words in the Act in relation to the Government giving or not giving money to help an industry&mdash; that it should be of vital national importance.  I submit to the Minister that in view of the treatment Waterford has got, it is of vital national importance and I might as well explain to him what the feeling in Waterford is about this.</P>
    <P>The people there consider that the proposition in Waterford is so good that that is what is damning it.  They consider that no stop should be put to it because the people promoting it are prepared to put £100,000 of their own money into it.  At that meeting, I was surprised to hear this, and I quote Deputy Ormonde: &ldquo;I understand there was a threat from the Scariff people that they would close down if there was a second factory established.&rdquo; I am informed that the Scariff people got £400,000 from public funds and I do not see what reason, they would have to close down if they had that money behind them and that kind of plant behind them.  I think it would be good for this industry if there were two factories, from the point of view that they would have to get out and look for markets, but if this one industry is left there in Scariff, it will become one of our hothouse industries.</P>
    <P>Another thing the Waterford people resent is this: they consider that Waterford is a better centre.  It is situated near more of the forests in this country but, as I said before, whatever seems to be a good case for Waterford seems to damn Waterford.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should endeavour to stop some of the propaganda that seems to go on behind the Department of Industry and Commerce because it must be a source of terrible disappointment to people who sometimes build themselves up when they <Col N="414" /> read the newspapers.  Others say that you cannot believe anything you see in the newspapers because it is not true, but there must be a great many people who are unemployed and who must be greatly disappointed.  Nearly every Sunday, in the paper supporting the Government, one reads about some new factory or industry being established. In the <i>Irish Press</i> of 2nd March, 1958, there was an announcement to the effect that a horsemeat factory was to be established in Limerick which would handle up to 25,000 animals every year.  Those who knew realised that there were not so many horses to be bought, that the factory would not proceed.  There it is with its licence from the Government to go ahead.  It did not go ahead and it must have been a terrible disappointment to the local people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes but, at the same time, we see these announcements and they always seem to have the imprimatur of a Minister.</P>
      <P>There is another matter the Minister would have something to do with, our imports and our exports.  We have an adverse balance of payments with many countries.  I have put down a series of questions asking what we buy from other countries and in particular, what we buy from Soviet Russia.  We buy £700,000 or £800,000 worth from them and they buy nothing from us. From Japan, we buy £2,800,000 worth and they buy £42,000 worth from us. The value of our imports from Germany is three times the value of what they buy from us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to get into any economic war but I think it is reasonable to suggest to the Minister that an approach should be made to these <Col N="415" /> countries in regard to this matter.  We should start off with Germany and say: &ldquo;You do buy heavy cattle from other people to whom you give a quota.  You will not give us a quota. You are buying tinned meat from other people.  We buy millions of pounds worth from you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The value of our imports from the Federal Republic of Germany is £10,479,654 and of our exports to that country is £3,510,019.  The reference to this is Column 937, Volume 179, No. 6, of the Official Report of 25th February, 1960.  The value of our imports from Belgium is £3,940,130 as against £893,263 worth exported.  The value of our imports from France is £3,480,249 as against £1,216,537; from the Nettherlands, £6,331,478 as against £1,124,787; from Italy, £1,952,383 as against £737,756; from Sweden £3,097,498 as against £966,661.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Minister to say to these countries: &ldquo;I do not want to put up the bars against your products; I do not want to put any extra tariffs on them; but, if you do not do something to redress the balance of payments, I shall have to do something about it.&rdquo;  Let us deal with these people but let us not deal with the people from behind the Iron Curtain. We appear to be on very friendly terms with them.</P>
    <P>The value of our imports from India is £4,800,000 and of our exports £900,000.  From the U.S.S.R. we imported £362,000 worth and exported £39,000 worth.  We imported £872,000 worth from Poland and they bought £292,000 worth from us.  We imported £2,000 worth from Rumania. From Czechoslovakia we imported £391,000 worth and exported £193,000 worth.  We imported from Eastern Germany £539,000 worth and we sold them £79,000 worth.</P>
    <P>I respectfully submit these figures to the Minister and I suggest that they represent a very adverse balance of trade.  We could do better by paying more attention to this matter.</P>
    <P>I am informed that we buy coal and artificial manure from Poland.  The Coal Board in Britain are up to their hats in coal and do not know what to <Col N="416" /> do with it.  Coal could be bought at the right price from Britain and a good concession could be wrung from Britain.  The Government have a good deal of leeway to make up on what was lost last year when they had the Dáil in session for weeks discussing the Referendum Bill.  In February, I heard the Leader of the Fine Gael Party appealing to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce to go to Britain and to come to terms with the British and not to mind going to meet the people in Paris about the Inner Six and the Outer Seven.</P>
    <P>He appealed again in May, on the Estimate.  Then we woke up when we read the papers one day and discovered that the Danes had wiped our eye and the ten per cent. that the Danes had not, the Danes had got.  I often wonder how that ten per cent. concession was wrung from Great Britain.  I would say that it was wrung from them on the basis of a <i>quid pro quo</i> that we seem to be afraid to have anything to do with.  I should prefer, if I could get a preference for Irish bacon or butter or Irish cattle, to give Britain a preference for British cars.  That may sound like treason but we have the imprimatur of the Taoiseach for it when he said he would &ldquo;trade with Britain first,&rdquo;.  I have it in banner headlines; that is the way it is in the paper and that is right.</P>

      <P>I remember its being shouted from Waterford platforms by Fianna Fáil speakers who said that they would do it and that they would hit everybody in the pocket who would not vote Fianna Fáil, if that is what the Deputy is talking about.  But it is the fashionable thing now to deal with Great Britain.  It took a long time to <Col N="417" /> teach that to Fianna Fáil and it must have cost the nation a lot of money when one thinks of all the countries with which they messed around and all the fiddling they did to try to build up an economy.  Yet they always had to come back to Britain.</P>
      <P>I want to say a word about the British market as it is and about the sale of our products in that market.  I address my remarks especially to my namesake, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, this being his first Vote.  I said this on a previous occasion, a year or two ago.  I was in London with some friends and we went into a publichouse, the name of which I have.  One of them asked for an Irish whiskey, Gold Label, and although there were 30 or 40 barmen there they did not know what it was. They had none.  We demanded to see the manager and we got him.  He turned out to be a County Clare man. We asked him why he did not have Irish whiskey.  He said that was a fair question but that he had a man from the Scotch distillers in every Tuesday morning and that nobody called to sell Irish whiskey.</P>
      <P>I submit that the great thing in commerce&mdash;and the Minister is Minister for Commerce as well as for Industry&mdash; is to sell and there is no substitution for the salesman who calls to sell the goods.  The Minister has an organisation and I suggest that he should ask that organisation to say to the Irish distillers: &ldquo;Why should you depend on the Irish Government to promote the sale of your whiskey?  Why do you not go and sell it yourselves and put your own representatives on the road, put it into the houses, on sale or return if necessary, and try it out anyway?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I shall have the same thing to say about Irish butter when I come to the Estimate on Agriculture.  I shall have to go back to the balance of payments. Other countries are a little more active than we are.  I just picked this out of the paper on May 8th, 1960:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bacon Key to Plane Exports: Britain's appetite for Polish bacon has increased our prospects of selling <Col N="418" /> airliners in Eastern Europe. These will be directly affected by the Anglo-Polish trade talks which start again in London on May 16th.</P>
    <P>Last December British and Polish negotiators were unable to agree on the terms of a new trade arrangement to replace that of 1956.</P>
    <P>The British quota for Polish bacon was reduced under a six-month provisional agreement&mdash;and promising negotiations over something like two years for the sale of British airliners to Poland were suspended.</P>
    <P>That is the way to talk to them.</P>
    <P>Although the cut in the bacon quota was felt by the Poles to be a serious matter it amounted to only 1.4 per cent. of the total yearly bacon consumption in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>That is something like what we send them.</P>
    <P>Yet it almost certainly stopped the sale of six or seven Viscount aircraft to the Polish Airlines, LOT.</P>
    <P>The aircraft industry felt that Britain's chances of gaining markets in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, too, were seriously prejudiced.</P>
    <P>The Poles, who had been on the point of placing an order for three or four Viscounts and were thinking of ordering three more in 1961, ordered three Russian II. 18s.</P>
    <P>That was &ldquo;being on the ball&rdquo; and I would commend the Minister if he went to Britain with the same ideas in his mind.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about buying Irish.  In the case of motor cars we cannot very well say they are an Irish product but the components are brought here from Britain, Germany and America and assembled here and it is a great industry that gives a great deal of work.  In the matter of buying Irish the Minister should say to the Government that when buying cars they should at least buy cars assembled in this country.  While I consider it only right that Ministers should have cars&mdash;and good cars&mdash;<Col N="419" /> no car that has not been assembled here should be bought for a Minister or any Department of State.  If you rightly insist on buying Irish we should see to it that all Government Departments buy Irish products when they go to market.  Several Departments would need to mend their ways in that respect.</P>
    <P>In regard to promotion of new industries the Minister said that 52 projects assisted by An Foras Tionscal were in production in the undeveloped areas and that, in addition, there were 18 other projects for which assistance had been promised and which were in varying stages of development.  I should be grateful to the Minister&mdash; I would not ask him to read out a list&mdash;if he would ask some of his officials to send me a list of the 52 projects, and also a list of the projects for which assistance has been promised.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Greyhound Race Track (Racing) Regulations, 1960: Motion to Annul.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Greyhound Race Track (Racing) Regulations, 1960 (S.I. No. 64 of 1960) be and are hereby annulled.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear to the Minister and to the House that I am moving the motion in this form because it is necessary for me to do so under the particular set-up of the Greyhound Industry Act.  In doing this, I do not wish to imply that I consider the regulations are entirely at fault or that I really object to them generally at all. I am moving it in this form to bring myself within the rules of procedure and to enable me to deal with the matter with which I wish to deal.  I have read the regulations as a whole, and I am quite satisfied in my own mind, from my limited knowledge of the subject, that in the main they are satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I am moving the motion for the purpose of drawing attention to Article 20, subsection (4) which says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="420" /> No owner or trainer may parade his greyhound except with permission or at the request of the stewards of the meeting.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the procedure which has been adopted over the past few years, in the only parallel conditions which I could cite, in regard to owners being allowed to lead their own greyhounds, is an immensely more desirable state of affairs than that they should have regulations imposed upon them whereby they are virtually prohibited from doing so.</P>
    <P>The Minister may well answer me and say they can do so if they have the permission of the stewards of the meeting, but that does not really meet the case.  I think it is a reasonable case to make that anyone who owns a greyhound may himself lead it in the ring.  There are several reasons for that, and the particular reason I see for it is that in dealing with highly-bred and sensitive animals such as greyhounds, who are subject to nervous conditions and in some cases, I might say, hysterical conditions, it is far better for them to be led by someone they know and are accustomed to being handled by every day.</P>
    <P>I believe it has been argued as one of the reasons why owners should not lead their own greyhounds in the ring that it would ruin the spectacle&mdash;that those leading the greyhounds around the ring would not be dressed in conformity with the general appearance of the meeting.  Those who have instructed me, and on whose behalf I am moving this motion, have told me they are prepared to dress in accordance with the wishes of the stewards or those who are in control of the meeting concerned.  I am also informed that one of the troubles of greyhound racing is the risk of the dogs fighting with one another.  It is perfectly reasonable to assume that if an animal is disturbed or upset in any way&mdash;and they are a highly sensitive type of beast&mdash;they are liable to fight.  One of the bugbears of greyhound owners is that if their dogs get into the habit of fighting, they run the risk of being suspended.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider this <Col N="421" /> matter in the spirit in which I am moving it.  I am moving the motion because I consider it is a reasonable request on behalf of the owners.  I may say that the general opinion, in so far as I have been able to get it from the owners and those concerned with this type of racing as a whole, is that it is eminently desirable.  It may be argued, possibly, that there is some risk of interference with the animals or some risk of doping.  Indeed such things have been known to happen before at dog tracks not only in this but in other countries.  It may be argued that the officials, whether of the Board or the meeting itself, are more reliable and that there is no risk whatsoever of doping if officials lead the greyhounds around.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair if suspicion is directed towards the owners&mdash;in other words, if owners are considered unreliable with their own animals and liable to do things such as doping or interfering with them in any way&mdash;to ask: is it not also reasonable that the stewards can be got at as well?  I do not want to cast any imputation on the honour of anybody concerned with this type of sport, but if the suggestion on the one hand is that the owner may do those things, I may quite reasonably answer: could not the attendant who is leading the dog be motivated by considerations of financial gain or otherwise, to do the same?  It does not seem to be a reasonable argument for anyone to put up that you have to prevent the owners from leading their own greyhounds for fear they may dope them. Someone must lead them, and if it is possible for the owner, it is possible for the other person as well.</P>
    <P>I have with me one or two details in connection with cross-Channel racing.  The White City stadium in London is pretty well-known and one of the regulations or conditions of entry states:</P>
    <P>An owner desiring his greyhound to be led round on the parade by his own Kennelman or maid must see that proper uniform is brought, i.e., white coat, black bowler hat or blue beret, otherwise members of the <Col N="422" /> Company's Kennel Staff will lead the greyhound on parade.</P>
    <P>I think that is reasonable.  It is quite different from the regulations contained in these Articles which I am protesting against this evening.  That regulation <i>ipso facto</i> implies, that the owner may lead his greyhound, if he so desires.  The only imposition is that he must dress in accordance with the appearance of those around him.</P>
    <P>One of the regulations of the Catford stadium states:</P>
    <P>Trainers are requested to see that their Kennel Representatives who will lead their Greyhounds in the Parade are suitably attired in a White Coat.  Only those so dressed will be permitted to lead Greyhounds in the Parade.</P>
    <P>Those are two well-known race tracks in England in which the owners are permitted to lead their dogs.  There is no prohibition whatsoever.  I ask the Minister to consider permitting the Irish greyhound owner, like his counterpart across the Channel, to lead his own greyhound.</P>
    <P>There is no need to stress that this is a valuable industry in which a considerable amount of money is involved. It provides quite a deal of employment.  Through sales and through exports, it brings money and profit to our people.  The owners feel strongly about this matter.  To some Deputies it may seem a small point. It may seem that, under certain conditions, they may be permitted to lead.</P>
    <P>I do not know a lot about greyhounds. I have no vested interest in this matter.  I have never owned a greyhound.  I do not know if I could afford one.  Anyone dealing with a greyhound and training it is surely the best person to handle it and see that the animal will behave well, go in for the purpose for which it is there and give of its best in a race.</P>
    <P>There is another angle to this subject. If the Minister stands fast on this, as I hope he will not&mdash;I hope he will be reasonable&mdash;there is the risk of incalculable harm to this type of sport and to this industry in this country.  It is possible that people with greyhounds to race may consider the position <Col N="423" /> here unsatisfactory.  They may feel uncertain about the future.  They may feel anything can happen if they are not permitted to lead their dogs. They may be anxious about their dog running to form.  They may say to themselves: &ldquo;There is no use in continuing to support the Irish greyhound race tracks.&rdquo;  There is nothing to stop them from taking their dogs across the water and having them trained there. We must bear these matters in mind and consider every point from every angle.  If we antagonise or create a feeling of uncertainty amongst greyhound owners, we may indirectly contribute to unemployment in this industry and that would be a shattering blow.</P>
    <P>I move this motion with some regret. The House may well wonder if representations have been made to the Board on this matter.  I can assure Deputies that they have been made from my county and from other counties, too.</P>
    <P>I also feel the owners had not sufficient time to examine the whole question and to know what it really means, except in some instances.  There is a widespread feeling of opposition to the regulation I am opposing.  As time goes on, if people bring greyhounds to race meetings and get unsatisfactory results, they will come to realise that this regulation is unsatisfactory.  Therefore, I put this motion to the House and ask the Minister to give my suggestion his consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion.  In view of the great opposition which there seems to be to these rules and in view of the unhappy manner in which they were introduced, I urge the Minister to reconsider the matter.  I addressed a Parliamentary Question to the Minister some time ago with regard to these rules.  They were to come into operation on 1st March.  My question was put down on 3rd March.  I asked the Minister if he would have the date postponed until 1st May.  He replied that the answer to the first part of the question was in the negative and that the making of the regulations in question was entirely <Col N="424" /> a matter for Bord na gCon.  The reference is the Official Report of 3rd March, 1960, Volume 179, No. 8, Column 1245.</P>
      <P>Bord na gCon sent a copy of the regulations to the greyhound owners on 26th or 27th February last.  They told them they wanted them to consider the regulations and make any recommendations they cared to make.  It was pointed out that the regulations would come into force on 1st March and that it would be a physical impossibility for the Greyhound Owners' Association to call their members together or even to call their executive committee together.</P>
      <P>I think that, through the good offices of the Minister, the matter was postponed for some time, but in any case, the whole matter was a bit of a rush. Any recommendations that were made were made in a bit of a hurry.  The owners considered that they were not dealt with in a fair manner or even in a competent manner by the Chairman of Bord na gCon.</P>
      <P>I shall not go over what Deputy Dr. Esmonde said.  I know why the Minister and the Board have inserted the qualification in relation to fighting. They want Irish greyhounds to be above reproach.  I know how young dogs will behave at their first trial. Inexperienced stewards or managers or even inexperienced stipendiary stewards might say: &ldquo;He has had it. He is a fighter.&rdquo;  The dog may only have been in a rough and tumble going about the track but his card is kept and stamped immediately that he is a fighter.  Even though he might be cleared of that afterwards, the stigma will always be there on his card.  That is one of the reasons why these rules are not what they should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new regulations have gone back to pre-1947 days when the draw for places was held in private.  It was always a bone of contention at tracks all over the country.  Nobody was ever satisfied with it.  The greyhound owners and the public always considered that somebody got a preference. I do not see why the draw should not be held in public.  It used to take place an hour before racing and people went to see the draw.  In <Col N="425" /> these modern times, when we are to have a totalisator at Irish tracks, it is said that that would not do in relation to the numbers of greyhounds. The people who go to horse racing and greyhound racing in Ireland are always prepared to mark their cards and adjust them before the race.  That is no load on any sportsman or any lady who goes to the track.  They will have their cards and they will mark down the numbers as they are drawn.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any objection to having that draw.  I cannot see how that would upset the running of the Tote. I would say to the Minister that in view of the fact that there are a very large number of greyhound owners in the Greyhound Owners' Association they are entitled to representation on the Board.  It appears that all interests outside of the actual owners are represented on it&mdash;the track proprietors, the bookmakers and representatives of the I.C.C.  The Minister may say that they would represent the greyhound owners but a great number of greyhound owners will say that they themselves want to have representation and they should have it.</P>
    <P>It may be said that it is up to the greyhound owners to start a revolution in the I.C.C., to attend their various coursing meetings all over the country and to cut out the government of the I.C.C., but I do not think that is the idea which the greyhound owners have at all.  They recognise the I.C.C. as the governing body of greyhound racing but they say, and I submit rightly, that they represent the owners of the greyhounds; they represent the people who rear the greyhounds; they represent the people for whom the Bill was passed and for whom we struck our breasts and said: &ldquo;The owners are the people we are considering, the people feeding the greyhounds and rearing the greyhounds.&rdquo; Therefore, if all sides of the House have subscribed to that I submit to the Minister that it is reasonable that the owners should have that representation on the Board.</P>
    <P>I should like to see an atmosphere of peace and co-operation between Bord na gCon and all the people concerned <Col N="426" /> in racing.  I am sure the Minister would like to see that also because this industry could be improved and it would help what we spoke about on another Estimate, the balance of payments.  We could send a large number of greyhounds to various other countries.  I would ask the Minister to meet this motion in the spirit in which it was moved by my colleague. Deputy Esmonde, without any rancour and with ordinary reason.  I appeal to the Minister in the matter of the fighter, in the matter of parading dogs&mdash;with which Deputy Esmonde dealt&mdash;and in the matter of giving representation to the owners.  Lastly there is a point that I consider is important because it will be the cause of great friction and great suspicion and that is the matter of the draw for places.  I appeal to the Minister to consider that matter also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess I never led either a winner or a loser in dog racing or in horse racing.  I am sure that there was no malice in the mind of the Minister when he drafted this regulation.  It will be noted that the motion deals with a regulation which is more or less all embracing but I think Deputy Esmonde made it clear that he had in mind only one small portion of the regulation when he asked that the regulation be not approved by this House.  That was the regulation in connection with the parading of dogs by owners or that part of the regulation which says owners may not parade their dogs except with the permission, or at the request, of the stewards or the track manager&mdash;I forget which.  Whilst, as I say, I do not believe there was any malice in the mind of the Minister,&mdash; and I am sure there was no malice in the minds of the people who advised the Minister&mdash;there is the possibility that they did not have full regard for the feelings of the greyhound owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that because as far as I know there is a strong feeling about this amongst the 300 or 400 greyhound owners in Wexford.  One can appreciate their point of view.  I suppose the perfect solution might be that there should be six attendants who would <Col N="427" /> parade the dogs but there is a funny sort of relationship, if one could so call it, between the dog and the owner and the owner believes the dog is not absolutely perfect unless he handles him all the time, even up to the time of putting him into the box.  The greyhound owner is dissatisfied if he believes the dog has been mishandled or roughly handled&mdash;I do not say deliberately&mdash;by some attendant.  I have often heard complaints made by people at greyhound meetings and they say: &ldquo;Look at the way he is handling the dog.  The poor dog has not got a chance at all.&rdquo;  For that reason I believe the owners should be allowed to parade their own dogs if they so desire.</P>
    <P>This is not a harangue directed at the Minister for making this regulation. It is an effort on our side to point out to him the attitude of the owners.  In the absence of any explanation of this part of the regulation, we are somewhat at a loss.  I do not know what the Minister had in mind when he drafted that part of the regulation. I do not know whether he was afraid of doping; I can see a real fear there after the recent experience in horse racing.  If this arose from a genuine desire to prevent abuses in dog racing I would not have the slightest objection to it.  I think it was Deputy Esmonde who pointed out&mdash;and he might know more about doping than I do&mdash;that it is not possible to give an effective dope to a dog such a short time before a race.  It is usually administered a long time before the parade, half an hour, an hour or perhaps a couple of hours before it.</P>
    <P>I do not think it conceivable that a dope administered some minutes before the race could have any effect. The regulation itself is very specific. The first part says that the owners may not parade dogs.  I think it would be better if the regulation were drafted the other way and if it were couched in such terms as to allow the owners to parade their dogs except where the steward or manager objected.  If there was somebody about whom they had doubts, he should not be allowed to <Col N="428" /> parade his dog in case he might engage in any funny business.  But the majority of the general body of dog owners are pretty reputable people.  I suppose we have some disreputable people in this as in other sections of the community.  I suggest, therefore, that that part of the regulation might be framed to allow greyhound owners to parade their dogs except where the stewards and track manager believed it would be wrong for the greyhound owner to parade the dog.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I came into the House to listen to the debate on Industry and Commerce.  Listening to Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde and Deputy Corish speak on this question one would think there were greyhounds nowhere in Ireland except in Wexford and the small neighbouring county of Waterford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this matter because I come from a county where some of the best greyhounds in Ireland have been bred.  The Minister attends the show in Ballsbridge every year, as I am sure we all do.  We see there the various breeds of livestock paraded by their owners or somebody representing the owners.  If you give me time.  Sir, I shall lead up to the question under discussion.</P>

      <P>If the owners of these other animals, such as horses, can lead them around the track why should the owners of greyhounds not also lead their animals around and be proud of them?  The only condition seems to be that they must display certain colours, either black with white or black with gold.  I cannot understand why greyhound owners are not given the same privilege.  This is an important industry and I am sure that under Bord na gCon prospects will be much brighter and that it will be a far more important industry in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I should <Col N="429" /> attempt to follow the line of reasoning of the Deputies who have spoken on this motion.  I feel I should not.  It was felt that we should have an investigation into this whole question of the greyhound industry.  A representative advisory body was set up for the purpose of making a report to the Minister for Agriculture on this subject. I do not know what time it took them to complete their deliberations but they made a report which contained a number of recommendations.  One recommendation was that a board such as that now in existence should be set up to control this industry.  They also made a recommendation to the effect that revised and more stringent rules should be prepared.</P>
      <P>The Board has been set up and it is composed of men who have a fairly good knowledge of greyhound racing, greyhound breeding and everything associated with the industry.  I do not think it would be fair of me to interfere or to attempt to interfere with the day-to-day deliberations and decisions of that body.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the recommendations made by the Advisory Committee, the Board prepared draft regulations. It is not correct to say that these regulations were hurriedly brought into force; in fact as far as I know, these regulations in draft form were circulated to all the interested parties some time in January.  Around the 30th March, the decision was made to bring into force the amended regulations, following discussions with all the interested parties.  There were prolonged discussions and as a result of these discussions many amendments were suggested and accepted by the Board.  As Minister I am prepared to defend here the decision of the Board in their refusal to accept the contentions advanced in regard to the matters mentioned in the course of this discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all people who have a knowledge of affairs and we know that, when regulations are being prepared in regard to a matter such as this, it is not possible to secure the complete acceptance of all the interested parties as to what is considered vital if the end that is desired is to be achieved. <Col N="430" /> You will not find agreement with interested parties to that extent.  It was the duty of this Board&mdash;a duty which as far as I know was fully performed &mdash;to discuss and argue these matters but it is not in any way obligatory on a board to succumb to any demand made by interested parties in relation to any matter affected by a regulation of this nature.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the reasons for this regulation in regard to the parading of dogs nor into the question that was raised by Deputy Lynch in regard to the marking of the card showing the dog's behaviour.  Deputy Lynch knows, perhaps better than I do, the reasons for these decisions. As I say, I am quite confident that the men who are responsible for making the ultimate decision were men who knew every aspect of the greyhound industry.  I am quite sure also that they were there to devise rules that would secure what the advisory committee thought such a board should aim at securing, in the shortest possible space of time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish suggests that these were rules made by the Minister.  I had nothing whatever to do with the making of these rules.  Any more than some of the Deputies who spoke on the subject, I certainly would never claim that I was a knowledgeable man on the subject.  I have enough experience to tell me that when a board of this nature is being set up to administer the affairs of a business of this kind, it must be given freedom without interference or meddling on the part of the Minister&mdash;even if he had the right to do so&mdash;to operate and devise the methods whereby the aim for which they were set up would be achieved.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more I want to say.  It certainly is not my intention either in regard to the matters raised now or at any time in the future to intervene so long as I am satisfied that the body entrusted with the responsibility of looking after this work is composed of men who are well-intentioned and knowledgeable and who have the same aims and objectives as those set out in the Report. <Col N="431" /> After all, the greyhound industry is quite an important business.  Every member of this House and most of the public outside realised that something fairly drastic was necessary in order to try to get the whole business on a surer and better basis.  I believe that the Board is trying to do that and so long as I am satisfied that they are engaged in that in an intelligent and reasonable way and so long as they continue to show respect for and to have regard to all the interests concerned, to provide for adequate consultation before vital decisions are made, then they must and will continue to have my support as Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>When this motion was put down, the Minister's Department were informed of the particular Article with which I was concerned. In his reply just now, the Minister simply stated that the Board was created for the purpose of framing regulations and that he was prepared to stand over the decision of the Board.  What is a democratic Parliament for?  A democratic Parliament is for the purpose of defending certain sections of the community and enabling a Deputy to ask a Minister a question and to request him to answer arguments.</P>
      <P>I approached this matter in as friendly a spirit as I could.  According to the Greyhound Industry Act, these regulations have to be placed in the Library and cannot become effective until they have been there for 21 parliamentary days.  I, as a duly elected Deputy, came into the House and put down this motion.  I expected, having made my case clear and dealt with one Article alone, that the Minister would make some attempt to reply to it.  I have no objection to the Minister rejecting what I said here, but I do object to a Minister making what I can only describe as a puerile reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He made no attempt whatsoever to answer any of the arguments made; he made no attempt to deal with any point I raised.  What he came here for was to defend Bord na gCon, to defend the people he appointed.  At the outset <Col N="432" /> of his speech, he said that all sections of the community were represented. That, Sir, is not correct.  It is at total variance with the facts.  We have got several hundred greyhound owners. There is an association in my constituency. They are in Waterford, Kerry, Cork and other counties and right well the Minister knows that, too.</P>
    <P>What is the point of a parliamentary democracy where a Government, just because they have a huge majority, treat this House with contempt? What is the point in a Deputy putting down a motion if he will get no answer?  What is the point in a Deputy putting down a motion if there is to be no attempt to answer it?  Deputies across the way may object to what I am saying.  Let them put themselves in the same position.  If they were in a minority and if they wanted to put anything down, whether it was right or whether it was acceptable or not to the House, they would at least be entitled to an answer.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has done a bad service to the country this afternoon by his conduct on this motion.  I am surprised at him.  He says he has no function whatsoever.  If he has no function, democracy has no function. He has the right to object to these rules.  He has the parliamentary right to accept my motion, if he wishes to do so.  I do not expect him to do that but at least I would expect him to take cognisance of what I said.  I made a reasonable case here this afternoon.  I cannot expect the House to accept it. I do not expect the Government with a majority such as they have to take any notice of what we do but what I do expect is ordinary civility.</P>
    <P>I put down this motion and I have a democratic right as an elected Deputy to have my arguments answered or refuted, if necessary.  The Minister did not refer from end to end of his speech to the argument.  I can only come to the conclusion that the Minister met Bord na gCon this afternoon and they decided they would not agree to this. He said there was plenty of time to discuss it.  It was discussed by Bord na gCon.  Their attitude was unreasonable. The Minister could have explained and he could have given us <Col N="433" /> some indication as to why owners should not lead their own greyhounds in the ring.  I regret to say that I have a poor opinion of the control of the Department of Agriculture and the <Col N="434" /> whole greyhound industry if that is the way it is to be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; drive and the purchase of State cars.  Cars have been bought by the State which were manufactured and assembled abroad.  I want to reiterate that we should never buy any cars for State purposes except those which have been assembled at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall go back now to the question of the chipboard factory.  I do not want any political kudos for it. The Minister and his colleagues are <Col N="435" /> welcome to the kudos.  I should be glad to have the Minister down to open the factory, if ever that should happen.  The proposition as it was explained to the meeting in Waterford last Saturday night appears to be a splendid one.  The manner in which the <i>entrepreneurs</i>, the promoters, have gone about their business is above reproach.  It cannot be said they have shown any preference for either my colleague, Deputy Kyne, or myself.  As a matter of fact, when I was leaving Waterford today, it was strongly rumoured they were about to bring on to their board a prominent Fianna Fáil T.D.  That seems to be the <i>imprimatur</i> necessary for gaining concessions and winning the approval of the Department in such matters.</P>
    <P>An Foras Tionscal is said to be a statutory body.  Ministers are often inclined to hide behind that phrase and say they have no powers to interfere with such bodies, just as the Minister for Agriculture has said in relation to the matter raised by Deputy Esmonde.  We know that is all poppycock, that if he wanted to do it, he could.  In this case, my colleague, Deputy Ormonde, pointed out to us at the meeting the other night that responsibility was in the hands of the statutory body, An Foras Tionscal, and he said that was done mainly for the purpose of having these matters of national importance, involving the spending of huge sums of money, divorced from the realms of politics and outside influence.  I deplored that statement from my colleague, but I did not want to criticise him at that meeting because I wanted to have a united front.</P>

      <P>I know that.  I do not want to divorce anything from politics.  We are the elected representatives of the Irish people and the Minister is a Minister of State in the Government of this country.  I do not want to see anything divorced from the authority of this House or from the authority of the Minister.  I prefer to see the Minister with the authority <Col N="436" /> because he is then answerable to the House.  Having made the statement I referred to, Deputy Ormonde went on to say that this project would not have gone so far but for himself, and so on.  I was very glad to hear him say that.  Even though this body, An Foras Tionscal, appears to be an ivory tower, it is obvious there is a doorway into the ivory tower.  I am convinced that if the Minister in charge of the Department which set up that body made a recommendation to it, that body would take notice of it.  I therefore appeal to the Minister to intervene in this matter and give this worthwhile project in Waterford a chance.  I appeal to him to do this, in view of the facts I have given him and in view of the raw deal industrial promoters in Waterford have got in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most encouraging to know that this year there has been a very considerable increase in the number of employed in manufacturing industry over the number employed last year.  We have now approximately 4,000 more employed in this type of industry.  What is even more important, the trend is in the right direction and we have every reason to believe that next year will prove an even better year than this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The efforts of the Opposition to belittle the increase in employment in manufacturing industry by referring to the fall in the number employed on the land forces one to mention the fact that during the period of office of the Coalition Government, not only was there a fall in the number employed in industry but the fall in the number employed on the land was very much greater than during the Fianna Fáil Government's term of office.  Deputy Dillion referred the other day to the <i>Economic Statistics</i> issued prior to the Budget in 1960 and he mentioned that Table 16 shows that, in the year 1955, we had the highest number employed in nonagricultural economic activity.  That of course is true, but what he did not mention was that from 1952 to 1955, which was mainly a Fianna Fáil term of office, the number was increasing <Col N="437" /> each year.  On the other hand, after 1955, the number declined very considerably and it was only last year that the decline stopped and the number evened out.</P>
    <P>It is also encouraging to note the comparatively large increase in the output of our industries and particularly the increased amount exported.  Despite the fact that last year the unfavourable weather and unsettled conditions pertaining to the eradication of bovine tuberculosis resulted in a reduction in cattle exports, the value of our total exports was almost as high as it was in the previous year. In his statement, the Minister referred to the upward trend in the flow of foreign capital into Irish industry.  As he said, this is most heartening.  I was glad to note he is considering appointing more representatives abroad to work in this field.  I feel we have not nearly enough representatives engaged on this.  The representatives we have are doing very fine work, but considering the vastness of the field, I feel we should have very many more of them.</P>
    <P>From my own experience, over the past few years, of industry in my own constituency, I have come to the conclusion that for industries to continue to thrive, in the conditions now facing us, for example, the progressive reduction of tariff barriers in Britain <i>vis-a-vis</i> the other nations associated with her in the Outer Seven and also the Common Market tariff wall, it is vital for us to tie up with large industries in these countries.</P>
    <P>As I said on this Estimate on a previous occasion, what our industries need most is technical know-how and markets, and with markets we could ally salesmanship.  The best method of obtaining the technical know-how and the markets is to tie up with industries in other countries which have already got them.  The Minister should go to great lengths to impress upon all our industrialists that they should gear themselves towards the export markets and that, if they do not, they simply cannot hope to survive. Capability to export is the hallmark of efficiency; it is proof of efficiency, <Col N="438" /> and the industry which is now exporting a considerable percentage of its output need have no fear for the future.  The industry which, however, is making no effort to improve its methods and increase its efficiency, or making no effort to get into the export market, is in for a very rough time when the tariff barriers are lowered, as has been forecasted by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>What I have said in this respect is in no way to be taken as a criticism of the protection policy adopted by this Party in former years.  We hear a lot of nonsense talked by the members of the Opposition with regard to our protection policy, of inefficiency hiding behind tarriff barriers, and of the public being mulcted in prices and so on, but what we have to remember is that apart altogether from the fact that these industries have provided a very large number of jobs for our people over the years, they are now the spring board from which we are making our advance on the industrial front and without which it would not be possible to make an advance.</P>
    <P>I know of industries in my own constituency which grew up under this protection policy and, because of the go-ahead attitude of the management and the efficiency of the workers, they forced themselves on the attention of foreign industrialists who were not only willing, but anxious, to merge with them.  The result is that there are in my county relatively large industries employing very considerable numbers of people and exporting a large precentage of their output, and this is due largely to the fact that the policy of protection gave them the opportunity to start.  If we had not had this policy of protection we would not have these industries and foreign industrialists would not have the same incentive to come in here.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister referred to the activities of An Foras Tionscal, and to the amounts of money paid out during the past year by this body.  While I appreciate the difficulties that face An Foras Tionscal and am aware of the various aspects which this body must take into consideration before giving grants, I must say that I am not <Col N="439" /> over happy with regard to its general policy.  I feel that if a small industry shows, by the initiative of its management and its workers, that it is a success in the export market, and can show that if given a grant to allow it to expand, its exports can be increased and the number of workers it employs also increased, it should get a grant.</P>
    <P>The general impression appears to be that if a person goes to An Foras Tionscal with an idea regarding the manufacture of a particular product for export, and can show to the satisfaction of that body that there is a reasonable likelihood of the project being successful, that it will export the bulk of its products and employ a certain number of people, he will get a grant.  On the other hand, if an industry is already started on some individual's own initiative, if it is exporting a considerable amount of its products and can show that by getting a certain amount of financial assistance it would be able to increase its exports enormously, nevertheless, it is refused a grant because it is already started.  It appears to me that while, in the first instance, so far as it is humanly possible it is ascertained that there is a reasonable chance of success, in the second instance it is almost a certainly that it will be a success.  A small industry, which is capable of development with the aid of a small grant, should be regarded as of national importance.</P>
    <P>People could be put into employment in such industries at a much lower cost than in a new project.  Our minds tend to be directed towards large industries because if we have unemployment in our areas we are anxious to get industries which will absorb all those who are unemployed, but it must be remembered that a number of small industries would also absorb the unemployed and would be much easier to establish and less costly to finance.</P>
    <P>Last year I mentioned the special type of problem we have in my county. Because of the fact that most of our industries came to that area or were expanded in it over the past 30 years or so, the workers in them are still comparatively <Col N="440" /> young.  Many of them have grown-up families but because only a small number are as yet reaching the retiring age in these industries there are not enough openings for young people.  That is why I am anxious that An Foras Tionscal should consider applications for grants from already established industries in my area.  An Foras Tionscal should take into consideration the special problems which confront us in that area.</P>
    <P>It would be ungenerous of me in discussing the work of An Foras Tionscal if I did not mention the very fine rôle this body played in the organisation and development of the Dundalk Engineering Works.  I should like to assure the Minister that we in county Louth are very appreciative of their efforts in that regard.  Looking back at that period and remembering the almost insoluble problems that faced us, it seems to be little short of a miracle that we have got as far as we have in this project.  Of course, that is not to say that all the problems in this matter are solved.  Far from it.  However with full co-operation, the projects should prove, in the long run, a great help to the general economy of the country.</P>
    <P>I should like, as I have done each year on the Estimate for the Department, to refer to the matter of buying and selling Irish goods.  The publicity given by the Minister to this matter over the past year is very welcome. Very fine work has been done in the schools in explaining to the children, and through them to their parents, the vital importance of buying Irish goods. If there are people in the locality working in a factory, it is a simple matter to explain to the children that these people are employed full-time because the goods made in the factory are bought in sufficient quantities and, on the other hand, that they are on short time whenever the goods made in the factory are not bought in sufficient quantities.</P>
    <P>To buy Irish is not only patriotism but practical common sense.  One very important aspect of the matter is that we are not asking our people, in 1960, to buy Irish goods simply as a matter of patriotism but because they are of <Col N="441" /> high standard, of good quality and are being bought in considerable quantities in other countries, not because the people of those countries have a particular liking for the Irish people but because the goods are of as good quality or of better quality than they can get at home and because the price is competitive.</P>
    <P>We all realise that in order to sell on foreign markets our goods must be of high quality and offered at a price the people are willing to pay.  I am glad that in our appeal to our Irish people abroad the note has been changed, that we are appealing to them now to buy Irish goods because they are quality goods and not simply as a matter of sentiment.  Business and sentiment, as a rule, do not mix. Irish people abroad would be most anxious to assist in strengthening the economy of our country by buying our goods, provided we offer them goods of a quality at least equal to that which they can get from any other country and at a price which is keen.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the beginning that the propaganda issued by the Minister in connection with buying Irish was welcome, but the leaflets issued could show more imagination.  Advertising is found to be more effective in picture form than in the printed word.  I would suggest that the Minister should issue a leaflet of roughly the same size as the leaflet he has issued, divided in four, having on the top left-hand corner a picture of an Irish shop displaying Irish and foreign goods, people in the shop demanding Irish goods and coming out with Irish goods; on the top right-hand corner a picture of a factory workshop in which the goods are made, with all the machines in operation and fully manned; on the bottom left hand corner a picture of the same shop with people going in, not expressing preference for Irish goods, some of them coming out with foreign goods and, on the bottom right hand corner a picture of the same factory workshop showing a number of the machines idle and fewer people employed.  Something of that type would be more effective than the printed word.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the cost would <Col N="442" /> work out but I suggest that advertising in local papers would be very effective. The local papers, in my constituency have done very fine work in connection with the promotion of sales of Irish goods.</P>
    <P>We have heard many remarks in this debate on the slowness of progress in the industrial field.  For a country whose industrial development began such a short time ago and which is now forced to compete with countries having a long industrial tradition, we are doing reasonably well.  The fact that our rate of progress has been accelerating for some time past gives hope that in a few years we shall be able to compete with countries, which were in the field before us, in all aspects of industrial production. We are building up an industrial tradition of which we can be proud.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the amount of money available for An Córas Tráchtála has been considerably increased. In present circumstances we cannot spend too much money on export promotion and market research and development.  The British market is our most important market and it is generally agreed that it has not even been scratched, that there is very much more that we could do in selling to the British.</P>
    <P>We must try to get into other markets also.  Reference has been made to countries in Africa which have got their freedom lately.  As the economies of these countries develop, worthwhile markets for processed agricultural goods will be available and we should see to it that we get a foothold there and not wait until other countries have taken over the markets.</P>
    <P>As has been mentioned often, there is a fund of goodwill in these countries for Ireland because of the work of our missionaries there.</P>
    <P>Our balance of trade problems are a continuous source of worry to us. They have been referred to tonight by Deputy Lynch.  We find ourselves on the wrong side of the balance sheet with practically every country with which we trade.  To over-simplify the problem is not much help in our efforts to solve it.  The problem has many aspects.  If the Department <Col N="443" /> made a close study of the matter the problem could be solved at least in part.</P>
    <P>To get to grips with this matter we must first examine imports and exports in each individual case and find out in what way our economy may be affected by the imports, what effect the prohibition of such imports would have on employment, how our people would react to a prohibition of a certain type of import, what effect it would have on prices and, having assessed the position, take action accordingly.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, Greece.  We are on the wrong side of the balance sheet with that country.  I have not asked for any breakdown of the imports from Greece but I assume that the bulk of them are dried fruit, currants and so on.  We would have to ask ourselves whether our people would be satisfied to do without this fruit, what effect the prohibition would have on our bakery trade and employment in that trade.  All these questions would have to be answered.  It might be suggested that we could buy the fruit elsewhere.  We would have to consider whether we could sell even the small amount that we are selling to Greece to the other country from which we would buy the fruit over and above what we sell to it now.</P>
    <P>To develop that a little further, take a country in which we are in imbalance to the tune of £3,000,000 imports against £1,000,000 exports. Suppose we were to say to this country: &ldquo;As you are buying only £1,000,000 worth from us, we shall take our business elsewhere.&rdquo;  I do not doubt that in a relatively short space of time we could get the £3,000,000 worth of imports from other countries but the question would arise then as to whether we could sell the £1,000,000 worth of exports and, if we could not what effect would that have on our economy?  I suggest that in a country such as this we should first explore every possible market and use whatever pressure we can bring to bear on its Government.  While <Col N="444" /> we are doing that, An Córas Tráchtála should search diligently for an alternative market for that product so that we would then be in a position of some strength to bargain.  If Córas Tráchtála were successful, we would then be able to say: &ldquo;If you do not improve your balance of payments with us we shall take away our business from you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The other side of the picture in regard to the balance of payments is also important and relates more or less to the question of buying Irish.  We import a considerable quantity of agricultural goods such as cheese.  If our people were to concentrate on buying Irish cheese and&mdash;perhaps more important&mdash;if our producers would produce the particular type of cheese that is being imported and for which there is obviously a demand we could reduce our imports.  This applies to a number of other commodities also.</P>
    <P>During last year industrial output increased; industrial exports increased and industrial employment increased and I feel that we have every reason to be hopeful for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to make a speech on the Estimate but rather to use the occasion to appeal to the Minister to use his good offices with An Foras Tionscal as best he can in connection with the proposed chipboard industry in Waterford.  I know An Foras Tionscal is a statutory body and perfectly free to make its own decisions on grants but I feel sure that it would pay due regard to any view expressed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I should be very loath to say or do anything in this House or outside it that might be thought to prejudice in any way the question of a grant for the proposed chipboard factory because, as I understand it, a final decision has not yet been taken. In making this appeal I shall endeavour not to say or do anything that would imply unfair criticism or jump to any false conclusions.  It is my sincere wish that common sense will prevail and that the City of Waterford, so badly in need of a major industry, will secure the grant necessary to give this proposed industry a chance of starting there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> As I understand it, the promoters of the industry have gone to a good deal of expense and trouble to make a full investigation of the economic possibilities of establishing the industry in Waterford.  They are quite confident that, given the assistance they seek from the Government, they can make an economic success of the project. I understand that the delay in regard to the grant is due to further investigations into the possibilities of outside markets and the home market for chipboard products.  Evidently, should that investigation be prolonged it is likely that the Six Counties may take advantage of the fact that there is a market of 40 per cent. available at present in Britain that is being met from Japan and countries behind the Iron Curtain and which is not being met either by Britain itself or by the chipboard factory in Northern Ireland. Any long delay may justify installation of further equipment in similar factories either in Britain or in Northern Ireland and so limit the prospects of the establishment of the chipboard factory in Waterford.</P>
    <P>The directors of the company have such confidence that it is not merely the question of the grant that is holding them up.  They are more concerned with the fact that in order to make the factory an economic success they must have some assurance from the Department of Lands that the forestry timbers will be available. They believe the only real assurance, or the best assurance, on which they could rely would be the Government grant.  I am inclined to agree that the grant would provide an inducement to the Department of Lands to endeavour to maintain supplies for the factory. Situated in Waterford it has every advantage; it has a first-class port which could be used to export&mdash;ex-factory-practically.</P>
    <P>We have a grave unemployment problem which could be eased by the establishment of this factory as it is the hope of the directors that at least 100 male adult employees would be taken on with another 100 indirectly employed in haulage and various other jobs.  In addition, we would have the associated shipping helping Waterford <Col N="446" /> port or, if not Waterford, it would go to the port of Rosslare.  It is the hope of the directors not only to establish the chipboard factory if the grant is available but to establish a subsidiary in the form of a furniture factory which would give additional employment.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to use his good offices to impress upon An Foras Tionscal that, although we may not be able to meet that clause which they have asked us to meet, we should show proof of the national importance of establishing the industry in Waterford.  We have grave unemployment problems and great emigration and if the factory is established it will, I am confident, prove economically sound.  The promoters have secured a monopoly on the best type of machinery available in Germany for chipboard production and if the grant is given the Government can be assured that there will be a first-class chipboard factory in Waterford comparable with anything of its kind in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reiterate what Deputy Faulkner has said in regard to the attitude of An Foras Tionscal and also that of the Industrial Development Authority in regard to applications for grants received occasionally from small concerns.  The accent appears to be on large industrial concerns involving hundreds of thousands of pounds when grants and loans are being sought.  That, of course, is appreciated and understood.  The Minister must safeguard the finances at his disposal for these bodies and distribute the money amongst worthwhile concerns but I am afraid he is very often sacrificing the smaller family concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know a couple of cases in my own town of Dundalk where individuals applied for a loan.  They submitted accounts proving their entitlement to the loan and they showed that their exports to Northern Ireland had considerably increased over a given period of time.  They submitted all that information to no avail.  An Foras Talún-tais refused them, or it may have been the Industrial Development Authority &mdash;I am not sure.  The loan was refused even though, as I say, it was obvious that this comparatively small firm was <Col N="447" /> entitled to get it.  I could quote other cases, but I just want to urge on the Minister if he can do anything in that matter to whisper in the ear of those concerned that they should be more favourably disposed towards meeting the wishes of these small concerns whenever the occasion arises.  Deputy Faulkner emphasised that point, and I join with him in doing so.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to ask the Minister again to do what he can to ease the terrible congestion which recurs annually at our ports, in relation to the cross-Channel services. I was asked to raise this matter by a number of people who have travelled across the Channel and who experienced much inconvenience. Within the past few years, a system of issuing sailing tickets was adopted with the express purpose of easing the traffic congestion.  I do not think that system has achieved its aim in that regard.  The position definitely has not improved.  That was some time ago and we are now entering a period of the year at which we hope to see many thousands of people coming into the country, not only our returning emigrants but foreigners and strangers.  We should do everything we possibly can to ease the position in regard to the cross-Channel services.</P>
    <P>I presume I am in order in referring to tourism on this Estimate.  It is a comprehensive Estimate, I think.  I should like to ask the Minister to urge on Bord Fáilte the advisability of not concentrating too much on the giving of financial aid to the well-known resorts around our coast.  It is only natural that money should be poured into the well-established areas to enhance them still further and to provide them with additional amenities for the attraction of visitors.  We are neglecting, to a very damaging degree, the smaller resorts which are, perhaps, not so well-known but which have in their own way as much right to financial aid as resorts such as Killarney, Bray, Galway, Salthill and such places.  It would encourage the local development organisations in these small resorts to redouble their efforts to attract visitors to their areas <Col N="448" /> by providing the desirable amenities. If they received more encouragement in the form of financial aid and technical assistance from Bord Fáilte, a good day's work would be done.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister also to request Bord Fáilte to direct the attention of foreign tourist agents, when they come here, to spread out and not concentrate on the well-known areas.  Let them travel to the smaller areas, the places which are less well-known. There are many such areas in my constituency of Louth, especially in the northern end, in the Carlingford-Omeath direction.  I do not think groups of foreign travel agents have ever appeared there.  It would be a good idea for Bord Fáilte to encourage them to visit the smaller less well-known resorts.</P>
    <P>While speaking of Louth, I should like to inquire whether the Minister can give any information with regard to the proposed industry which, rumour has it, is to be set up in Greenore.  It is said&mdash;I do not know whether or not it is true&mdash;that a container traffic industry is to be developed in that port.  During the past number of years, a number of false alarms have been spread about Greenore.  Some years ago, the Taoiseach, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, made an announcement guaranteeing trade loans to a company to set up a business there. Through some mishap, or unexpected development, that industry was not set up, with the result that the people in the Greenore area have become very disillusioned and disappointed.  It is definitely a depressed area, especially now since the railway which used to lead into it has been closed down.  If this industry does develop and fructify it would be very welcome indeed.  It may, of course, be a private enterprise affair and, if so, I shall understand if the Minister cannot give any details, but if he would refer to it at least, let us see where we stand and give some ray of hope, it would be a good idea.</P>
    <P>With regard to the remarks made by various speakers about the attraction of foreign capital into this country, there is, of course, one facet of this matter which might, on reconsideration, <Col N="449" /> prompt us to be a bit hesitant about attracting such foreign capital. There are large industrial concerns throughout the world which have set up factories in other countries.  If anything goes wrong with the parent company, the subsidiary companies will be the very first to be closed down.  If a large British or American firm sets up a subsidiary company in Ireland and then falls on evil days, the factory set up here will be the very first, naturally, to be closed down, with consequent unemployment.  Even at the risk of that happening, I think, willy-nilly, we must do all we can to attract foreign capital, because it is one of the most expedient and effective ways by which we shall be able to solve, in a comparatively short number of years, the twin problems of unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>With regard to the search for markets which goes on from year to year and which is in the charge of that very competent body, Córas Tráchtála, delegations are frequently sent abroad seeking markets for the various commodities we have to sell.  We have a number of Embassies throughout the world.  If we set up a commercial section in each Embassy, charged with the express job of watching for market opportunities, I think we should make more progress because delegations sent from here go only for a number of weeks and then come back.  They are not on the spot all the time.  If some of our representatives in our Embassies were deputed to concentrate on looking for markets, I think it would help. I do not know whether or not there are commercial sections in our Embassies but if there are not, it would be a good idea if they were set up or if that point were investigated.</P>
    <P>One remedy for unemployment would be that both employers and employees should always be prepared to go more than half-way to settle their various differences.  The trouble appears to be that each section, the workers and the employers, will go only 50 per cent. of the way when they are negotiating.  If each side were prepared to go one point beyond the 50 per cent. it would change the picture radically throughout the <Col N="450" /> country.  We would then have less industrial strife, less unrest and less uncertainty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal first with the problem of unemployment in rural areas.  The concentration on the establishment of industry in Dublin is going beyond the limit of satisfaction.  No matter what Government may be in office, the tendency of the unemployed person in rural Ireland is to make for the place where there is some hope of employment.  It is strange that we do not make a comparison between what has happened in Britain and what may happen here.</P>
      <P>It is well that Dublin is prosperous. It is well that the people in Dublin may get employment.  However, that is not sufficient.  The tendency is to move in from the country in the hope of obtaining employment in Dublin but it has the effect of denuding the country.</P>
      <P>In Britain, it has been established and is accepted as a principle that dispersal of industry is essential. Apparently that is not our idea. When we reach the stage at which we shall have to do something in that direction, it may then be too late. Many Deputies can recall that only a few years ago a lot of land around Dublin which is now covered by factories was part of the country, almost. If some of these industries could be diverted to areas where they are urgently needed from the point of view of providing employment, as has been done in Britain, it would greatly benefit the community.</P>
      <P>Despite the best endeavours of Córas Tráchtála and the Department of Industry and Commerce, we are concentrating on the establishment of factories in respect of which the raw material must be imported to the detriment of concentrating on the processing of agricultural products for industrial purposes.  Many Deputies have urged the importance of exports. If we concentrate on agricultural exports and on the export of processed agricultural products, we can develop a rural arm rather than be entirely dependent on outside sources for raw materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was proposed to establish an <Col N="451" /> industry in Bandon.  I want to inquire about that matter because the people there are anxious about it.  Trade statistics show to a certain degree the favourability of the project for the export market.  Is it correct that a combination of Irish manufacturers, through the power of monopoly, tried to prevent the establishment of that factory in Bandon?  We hear a lot about encouraging industrialists to establish industries in areas where it is not easy to get Irish industrialists to establish or to extend their factories. If Irish industrialists are not prepared to do that, then it is a pity if they want to prevent anybody else from doing so.  I am not making a charge now but in fairness to the Minister and to all concerned, I want to know if there was interference by Irish manufacturers in this case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" /> In view of the enormous amount of money we are offering to industrialists by way of grants and inducements to come to this country and establish industries in areas where there is much unemployment, surely there is a touch of irony about the position if Irish manufacturers combine to prevent such industries from being set up?  I could name two industries in one town in South Cork which received very handsome grants and all the benefits that are available.  In one instance, they are exporting and getting very good prices for their product, which, I am informed, is of top grade but they pay a measly wage to their workers.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
