      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, having regard to the fact that the examination for the Clerical Grade of Civil Service Clerks announced to be held on the 30th June, 1925, is apparently intended to give persons who have served the State in a temporary capacity an opportunity of qualifying for permanent appointment, and whether, having regard to the wide range of age limits fixed, he can see his way to give persons who will not be eighteen years of age on the 1st June, 1925, but who are otherwise qualified, an opportunity to sit for this examination.</P>

      <P>The limited competitive examination for the clerical grade referred to in the question is being held for the special purpose of giving an opportunity for entering permanent posts to persons who have given service, in some cases for as long as ten years, in a temporary capacity.  A large proportion of the candidates are of middle age and have long left school.  In the circumstances, it is considered that the lower age limit represents the fullest concession that can be given to the younger candidates.  Any temporary official at present serving, whose age on the 1st June next will be less than 18, will be eligible for admission to the open competitive examination for the clerical grade to be held in the coming autumn.</P>

      <P>If no age limit appears in the regulations which have been laid on the Table of the Dáil, may we take it that there is no such age limit?  For the Minister's information, I would say that neither 18 nor 55 appear in these regulations.  What I want to know is this: is the regulation as laid on the Table of the Dáil the only regulation, or are there other instructions as to the eligibility of competitors, which have not been laid on the Table of the Dáil?</P>

      <P>In the past financial year disastrous weather conditions inflicted grave hardship and loss on the agricultural community in many parts of the country.  Events such as the Army trouble, which occurred just before the commencement of the period and some of its sequels, did much to shake confidence and impede improvement in business conditions.  The seriousness of the shock was evidenced very clearly by the fall in the quotation of the National Loan from 99 to 90; its long depression and slow recovery.</P>
      <P>It is significant to find that in spite of adverse circumstances, the Exchequer returns on the whole disclose a reassuring position.  We opened the present financial year with a debt of £13,360,353, made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>If we deduct the Exchequer balance on 1st April of each year from the debt outstanding on the same date, we get a figure of £10,523,000 at the beginning of <Col N="10" /> the last year against a figure of £11,679,161 at the beginning of the present year.</P>
    <P>The yield of tax revenue during 1924-5 was £23,203,500.  The yield estimated at the beginning of the year was £22,543,000.</P>
    <P>The excess of £660,000 is more than accounted for by the fact that the income tax collection exceeded the estimate to the extent of £910,000.  Stamps were £12,000 down, and death duties realised £138,000 less than the estimate. Corporation Profits Tax produced approximately the amount anticipated. Excise duties were £212,000 down on the estimate.  The deficiency was entirely due to the shrinkage in the yield of the spirit duty, which fell short of the estimate by about £540,000.  The beer duty more than came up to expectations, and gave no evidence that any decline is to be anticipated.  The yield was £4,439,000, as compared with an estimate of £4,250,000.</P>
    <P>The duties imposed on boots, candles, bottles and soap gave a revenue of £245,000 as compared with a loss of about £279,000 consequent on the reduction of the tea duty.  The customs duty on motor cars and motor cycles produced £293,000 against an estimate of £240,000 and in actual income in the previous year of £256,000. The yield from sugar and sugar confectionery was £2,149,000, being £49,000 in excess of the estimate.  The customs duty on tobacco produced about £40,000 less than was anticipated. Motor vehicle duties yielded £458,000, which is £108,000 more than the estimate.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that not only has there been an unexpectedly large yield from income tax, but that with one exception the other staple sources of revenue have given very good results. The fall in the produce of the spirit duties, which, taking Customs and Excise together, amounts to £546,000, is the only indication in our tax returns of increased financial stringency in the country.</P>
    <P>The delivery fee on parcels produced revenue at the rate of £47,000 per annum and reduced the number of incoming parcels from 54,000 to 39,000 per week.  The Customs Entry Duty <Col N="11" /> brought in revenue at the rate of £40,000 a year but does not so far seem to have had any effect on the number of consignments imported.  As, however, it only came into operation on 1st September last, it will be continued at any rate for another year.</P>
    <P>Turning to the expenditure side of our accounts, it is worthy of note that expenditure on the Army sank to very little over £3,000,000 as compared with £10,500,000 in the previous year.  The amount paid out of the Property Losses Compensation Vote was only £2,270,000.  The great discrepancy between the estimate and the actual expenditure was due in part to the fact that early in the year a serious question arose as to the interpretation of the Terms of Reference of the Compensation (Ireland) Commission.  For many months the work of the Commission which deals with all pre-truce cases of damage to property was suspended while negotiations were being carried on with the British Government. It was not until the end of the year that a satisfactory agreement was reached and the issue of new Terms of Reference by the Governor-General on 7th January enabled the work of the Commission to be resumed.  Another reason for the small expenditure on compensation was that the progress made by the Courts in dealing with claims under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923, was not nearly so rapid as we had reason to expect a year ago.  Even when cases have been heard there is often great delay before awards and reports are forwarded to the Ministry of Finance. Sufficient progress has now been made to enable us for the first time to form an estimate of our net liability for compensation.  The total net amount payable out of the public funds of Saorstát Eireann in respect of compensation for property losses and personal injuries, both pre-truce and post-truce, will not, it is believed, exceed £10,300,000.  This is a figure very much less than the burden which was at one time feared.  The gross amount of the awards in respect of pre-truce property claims will total about £7,660,000.  The British contribution, <Col N="12" /> it is estimated, will be £3,560,000.  The net payment to be made from our Exchequer in respect of this part of the compensation charge will, therefore, be about £4,100,000.  The estimate which has now been made of our total liability in respect of compensation for post-truce damage to property and for personal injuries of all periods mainly post-truce is £6,168,000.  As the investigation of personal injuries claims has been completed, and as between 60 and 70 per cent. of the claims lodged under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923, have been heard by the Courts, we have now the data for making a very close estimate.  It may be taken that the figure mentioned will require very little subsequent revision. I should like at this point to mention as it were in parenthesis, that £6,168,000 is only a fraction of the cost to the Exchequer of the civil war.</P>
    <P>During the past three years Army charges have amounted to more than £21,000,000.  The normal figure would have been £6,000,000.  Thus the struggle of 1922-23 will involve an actual abnormal disbursement from the Exchequer of well over £21,000,000.  The cash payment involved, however, is far short of the measure of loss suffered by the community.  Consequential loss, arising from damage to property has not been paid for from State funds, but it has been, none the less, a real burden on the country.  It would be impossible to build up a firm estimate of the amount of money represented by such loss and by the general loss of production following conditions of acute disorder.  But it may be safely asserted that it was several times greater than the aggregate of the compensation awards for the post-truce period.  The case of the Mallow Bridge may be cited as an illustration.  The cost of the new structure was only about thirty thousand pounds.  But Deputies will realise that the consequential loss to the community arising from the destruction must certainly have run to many times that figure.  A conservative estimate, therefore, of the cost of the civil war would be thirty to thirty-five million pounds.</P>
    <P>Allowing for the amount yet to be received from the British Government <Col N="13" /> the net outstanding liability of the Saorstát in respect of compensation may be put at £3,814,500.  Deputies will understand that ability to estimate with certainty the amount remaining to be paid under the head of compensation, together with the fact that that amount is very little more than half the sum already disbursed, must affect profoundly our Budgetary position. This time last year we had little idea of what the total compensation figure would be.  In consequence we could not estimate how much we might have to borrow or what figure our annual debt charge was likely to reach; and a single year's experience in the raising and control of our own revenue had left us uncertain as to the yield which could be anticipated from certain important taxes.  Moreover, at that time the end of the civil struggle was still very recent; the possibility of some recrudescence of strife could hardly be said to have completely disappeared; the credit of the State though good was not too firmly established, and the possibility of having to borrow considerable sums in the atmosphere that existed was not one to be faced without a good deal of heart-searching.  Consequently last year's Budget, like that of the year before, carried out the view of the Executive Council that existing taxation should be carried on until the financial prospects had become more clearly defined and until there was a disappearance of conditions under which State borrowing might become an occasion of national danger.</P>
    <P>This year we propose to make reductions.</P>
    <P>It is the opinion of the Executive Council that without further delay the greatest possible relief from taxation consistent with the requirements of sound financial policy should be given to the country.  We shall always insist that outgoings not of an abnormal and non-recurrent character, and not in the nature of capital expenditure, shall be met out of revenue.  On the other hand, we feel that at the present juncture it is not in the national interest to impose taxation for the payment of charges which may properly be met by borrowing.  It is, of course, <Col N="14" /> a fact that the amount and objects of public expenditure and the value received for it, are the really important considerations.  Nevertheless there are various factors which make the raising of special sums by borrowing a very different thing from raising them by heavy taxation.  It can hardly be doubted that a reduction in taxation will have on industry and commerce a stimulating effect not to be obtained otherwise.  The Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure for the year ending 31st March, 1926, published as a White Paper, show that the sum required for Central Fund Services is £3,890,527, and Supply Services £26,238,453.  The total estimated expenditure for the year, therefore, is £30,128,980.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of arriving at the sum which ought to be defrayed out of revenue certain deductions have to be made under the following heads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A.  Vote 8&mdash;Local Loans, £50,000 in respect of new capital.</P>
    <P>B.  Vote 11&mdash;Public Works and Buildings, £60,000 in respect of compensation for commandeered premises, and £320,000 in respect of new works, being the part of a total provision of £419,715, which may reasonably be regarded as abnormal.</P>
    <P>C.  Vote 14&mdash;Property Losses Compensation, £3,675,300, the entire provision.</P>
    <P>D.  Vote 15&mdash;Personal Injuries Compensation, £32,000, the entire provision.</P>
    <P>E.  Vote 44&mdash;Technical Instruction, £16,075, being a duplicate item included in error in the preliminary estimates.</P>
    <P>F.  Vote 57&mdash;Army, £1,053,117, being the provision in excess of £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>G.  Central Fund Services.&mdash;Service of Debt, Sinking Fund, etc., £910,000, being the provision included in Central Fund services for repayment of ways and means advances, and Savings Certificates.</P>
    <P>The aggregate of the deductible items under these seven heads is £6,116,492, which leaves £24,012,488 as the total of the expenditure to be met by imposition of taxation or out of other income.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="15" /> On the existing basis it is estimated that in the present year there will be paid into the Exchequer tax revenue amounting to £22,554,000, and non-tax revenue to the extent of £4,686,110, or a total of £27,240,110.  From this, however, we must deduct £1,260,000, being the estimated instalment of the British contribution towards compensation. We have now a revenue figure of £25,980,110, which may be set against the £24,012,488 expenditure, payable out of income.  The difference is £1,967,622, which, if the various deductions we have made are justifiable and sufficient, is the amount by which our revenue would at the present rates of taxation, exceed the sum necessary to be raised in the form of income.</P>
    <P>The list of deductible items already given is one which cannot rightly be increased.  It would, of course, be possible to go through the Estimates and pick out, here and there, smaller items which in themselves have something of an abnormal and non-recurrent character.  But it must be remembered that the Estimates will continue to have a sprinkling of such items which will change in identity year by year but will not vary greatly in number. To bring them into the calculation would only be, to some extent, to falsify the result.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that some figure ought to be deducted from expenditure in respect of pension charges at any rate.  It is true that at present the Exchequer bears an abnormal burden in the form of superannuation and retired allowances, but most of that part of the charge which is in excess of a normal figure arises from pensions to disbanded members of the R.I.C. These are comparatively young men. They have now a somewhat easy existence and may, in the great majority of cases, be expected to attain to a ripe old age.  The same remarks may, to some extent, be applied to civil servants who have retired or have been discharged on Treaty terms.  No appreciable diminution of the cost of pensions can be expected for a great number of years.  The charge, consequently, must be regarded as fully recurrent and as such ought to be met <Col N="16" /> out of revenue.  If any additional argument against borrowing in respect of pensions were necessary, it would be found in the fact that very soon after a substantial reduction in the total of the R.I.C. pensions has commenced to take place, members of the Civic Guard who are more nearly of an age than is usual in a police force will begin to come out on pension in great numbers. A certain overlap will consequently take place keeping the cost of pensions at an abnormal height for a further period.</P>
    <P>Looking at the matter from a different angle, it might be argued that under peaceful conditions such as now exist borrowing to meet any part of the cost of the Army is a thing which cannot be justified.  The Executive Council, however, are satisfied that Army expenditure would already have sunk to the neighbourhood of £2,000,000 per annum but for the fact that, although fighting has ceased for a considerable time, arms have not been surrendered.  This necessitates the maintenance for the present of a force somewhat beyond the normal peace-time requirements as an insurance against a renewal of organised violence.  The fact is, indeed, that it is only recently that the Executive Council became completely satisfied that the existing strength of the Army was sufficient.  That the country is rapidly settling down, there can be no doubt; and the further we leave the habits and atmosphere of the Civil War period behind us the less becomes the danger of any renewal of rebellion.  In the circumstances the abnormal part of the Army charge may be expected to disappear comparatively soon, and, in the meantime, we are satisfied that no just criticism can be levelled against us for borrowing to meet it. In this connection weight must be given to the fact that we have already paid out of revenue a figure not far short of half of the excess or &ldquo;war&rdquo; cost of our Army up to date, assuming payment in respect of compensation to have been made from borrowed money.</P>
    <P>The question whether the surplus figure of £1,967,622 may rightly be taken as indicating the extent to which remission of taxation should be allowed <Col N="17" /> is one to which close consideration has been given.  The calculation we have made allows for the provision out of taxation of £329,000 for redemption of debt as follows:&mdash;National Loan Sinking Fund, £262,000; Compensation Stock drawings, £67,000.  On the other hand, it assumes that the savings in certain votes will equal the supplementary sums which will almost certainly have to be provided during the course of the year in the case of other votes.  In view of the elimination of the Compensation Votes and the marginal part of the Army Vote this is perhaps an optimistic view.</P>
    <P>In regard to the future it has to be borne in mind that additional debt for non-productive purposes has to be incurred before we have done with compensation and before the Army has been brought down to a normal strength.  In view of the state of employment it becomes more and more doubtful whether any addition to the million and a quarter already advanced to the unemployment fund can be regarded as recoverable either as to princpal or interest. Recent legislation has tended to increase recurrent expenditure under certain heads.  All our agricultural and land legislation may be cited as an example.  Under existing commitments there will be automatic increases for several years in the cost of secondary education.  The passage of the Compulsory School Attendance Bill will result in increased expenditure on primary education.  Accruing increments will cause an expansion of the amount required for police.</P>
    <P>Moreover, on the revenue side there has over the past three years been an appreciable decrease in the proceeds of taxes as a whole.  The estimates of the Revenue Commissioners point towards some further contraction, and the position is rendered weaker by the fact that the estimates are temporarily inflated by an abnormal arrear of income tax.</P>
    <P>Against this, however, may be put the view held in many responsible quarters, that in industry and commerce rock-bottom has been reached, and that improved conditions are to be anticipated. In any case, it may safely be said that a substantial reduction in the burden of taxation will of itself produce <Col N="18" /> an improvement in the rate of yield. Again, it seems not extravagant to expect for the future better weather and better agricultural conditions than have obtained for the past couple of years, with a consequent improvement in revenue returns.  In view of all the circumstances, the Executive Council is of opinion that, subject to a deduction for unfavourable contingencies, the surplus which has been indicated should be exhausted by remission of taxation. If next year, adjustments seem necessary in consequence of any new facts that may have come to light, they can then be made.  It is proposed, therefore, to set aside from the surplus of normal revenue over normal expenditure, a margin of £117,622, and to budget for a reduction of revenue to absorb the remainder, namely, £1,850,000.</P>
    <P>The Executive Council believe that the reductions now to be proposed may, given favourable conditions, be regarded as permanent, but it should be pointed out that further reductions cannot arise through changes from taxation to borrowing.  They must be based either on reduced expenditure or increased yield of taxes.  We are forced to the conclusion that while some relief may be got by cutting expenditure, the best hope of substantial reductions lies in the better development of the resources and industries of the country. Saorstát Eireann has a sparse and scattered population, and close social and commercial connection with a rich and thickly-populated neighbour.  These two facts tend to make the costs of running certain Government services disproportionately high.  Proposals to cut down expenditure by wiping out services, which modern countries are more and more coming to regard as essential, are of no assistance.  The Government will try every means to secure the utmost possible limitation of expenditure, but it will not cut off services, regardless of consequences, and it cannot pledge itself not to undertake from time to time new activities which may be urgently necessary and overdue.  The position is, that since whole services cannot be scrapped, big and speedy reductions of expenditure are not possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="19" /> Economies in the public service can only be accomplished by detailed restriction and adjustment and by gradual simplification of machinery. On the other hand, a very moderate improvement in trade conditions, or a very slight increase in national productivity, would, providing expenditure were merely held tight and not permitted to expand, allow of a quite substantial reduction in tax rates.</P>
    <P>The Government since the end of the period of turmoil has given a good deal of attention to the development of the productive resources of the country. I need only mention, in passing, the steps that have been taken by way of agricultural legislation and land legislation and the proposals regarding the Shannon and the Barrow.  It will be expected, however, that I should make some more detailed reference to our action and policy in reference to tariffs for the promotion of manufacturing industry. Last year certain Customs duties were imposed with a view to giving the country an experiment in Protection.  Having regard to the short time that has elapsed and the forestalling that took place in certain cases, the results have been satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The boot tax brought in revenue to the extent of £225,000 and stimulated production to a remarkable degree. Returns furnished by the four principal firms in the industry showed that between 1st April, 1924, and 1st December, 1924, the number of persons employed increased by 80 per cent., while as a result of full time being worked wages increased by 100 per cent.  Since December the rate of progress has been more than maintained. At least one new factory has been started and others are to be started. As a result of careful inquiries by the Department of Industry and Commerce we are satisfied that the prices of Irish-made boots have not been increased, and in a few cases have been slightly decreased.  There is no doubt that in the present year the industry will expand considerably.</P>
    <P>The duty on sugar confectionery has been of great assistance to the industry. It is difficult to estimate the <Col N="20" /> revenue resulting from the imposition of the tax since confectionery previously paid duty at rates that varied very considerably according to the sugar content of the kinds imported. It may perhaps be put at £30,000 or £40,000.  Between 1st April, 1924, and 1st December, 1924, the number of persons employed in the industry increased by about 26 per cent.  Owing to the great variety of goods produced in the sugar confectionery business it has been found impossible to get reliable information as to the movement in prices in confectionery goods.  In the case of jam, however, to which the tax applies, careful inquiries show that the prices of Irish jams have gone down, while the prices of imported jams have gone up.  In addition, there is evidence that the reputation of certain Irish jams has improved.  Enquiries from retailers in Dublin have shown that apart from the differences in price there has been an increase in preference amongst the public for Irish-made jams.  In this instance it can certainly be said that Irish manufacturers have risen to the opportunity presented to them.  While in the case of sugar confectionery there has been throughout the year a decline in imports, in the case of cocoa preparations (including chocolates) no perceptible decline took place until recently. This, however, was not altogether unexpected, since the making of cocoa and chocolate is a more complicated business than the making of jam or boiled sweets.  There is now reason to believe that home production is about to increase.</P>
    <P>The effect of the duty on soap and candles cannot yet be judged in consequence of the forestalling that took place.  Generally speaking, there has been no increase in the price of these commodities to the consumer as a result of the tax.  Candles have become slightly dearer, but the cost has gone up in Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the same extent as in the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>Before the tax on bottles was announced, big stocks were already held in the country.  On top of this a certain amount of forestalling took place, with the result that the tax has not yet had <Col N="21" /> time to take much effect.  Nevertheless, some additional employment was given.  The revenue collected amounted to little over £3,000.</P>
    <P>During the year we have had a multitude of appeals to afford protection to all sorts of industries.  We have been able to give more mature consideration to the whole question, and we have decided to lay certain further proposals before the Dáil.  In submitting these proposals, I should like to state quite distinctly that the Government does not believe that it would be for the benefit of this country to establish a general tariff or anything approaching it.  And it will not allow itself to slip into the position of having laid the foundations of a general tariff by imposing each year a few duties and giving rise to a host of claims for others.  After the present Budget this Government will not break any further fresh ground in the matter of protective tariffs, before the general election.  We may alter the rate or adjust the scope of a particular duty; and we may, if we think necessary for revenue purposes, propose to the Dáil Customs duties on manufactured goods of a luxury or semi-luxury type, but we will not propose fresh duties of a protective character on manufactured goods of common and necessary use. At the end of three years from now the effects and reactions of our experiment in protection will have begun to appear pretty plainly and the country will have had an opportunity of giving electoral expression to any conclusions it may have come to in the matter. Whatever Government may then be in power can take any further action it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>As we see the position the prosperity of the Saorstát must for a long time depend upon its export of agricultural produce.  A protectionist duty, particularly from the point at which it begins to be successful and ceases to yield substantial revenue, must as a rule operate to increase the cost of living. In particular cases there may be reactions which will neutralise this effect.  But it can hardly be gainsaid that a large number of protective duties would be bound to result in an appreciable rise in our cost of living <Col N="22" /> figure.  A definite increase in the cost of living must act as a handicap on agriculture.  While new industries cannot be built up by tariffs without some cost to the country, we are satisfied that if we do not try to go too far or too fast a great deal can be done without imposing on the general community a burden which cannot be borne.</P>
    <P>The advantage which all classes would derive from the development of manufacturing industries would be manifold and important.  Denser population and greater traffic would help to solve the problem of railway freights for our agriculturists.  Bigger towns and cities would mean the expansion of a not unimportant market for our agricultural produce.  Energy and money diverted from the creation of unnecessary distributing houses would remove a burden on producer and consumer.  The surplus population of the countryside would have increased opportunities of making a livelihood in their native land.  Greater variety of occupation and interest in the country would help to develop the social and intellectual life of the nation and give us a more alert and enlightened public opinion.</P>
    <P>The Government believes that agriculture must be our first care, but it also believes that we cannot postpone the need for endeavouring to promote industrial activity within our borders.</P>
    <P>The tariff proposals which we submitted last year were of a more limited character than we should have put forward if we had had sufficient trained staff to carry them out.  Further consideration has convinced us that they were of too limited a character to give the country the practical demonstration of the various aspects of protection which would enable it later on to fix with certainty on the fiscal policy best suited to its needs.  We think, however, that the number of protective duties which a country like ours can afford to impose is limited and we think also that any steps in the way of protection taken at present must be looked upon as experimental.  Therefore, we must be regarded as shutting the door for some time with our present proposals.</P>
    <P>Our main proposition is one which <Col N="23" /> was considered last year, but was not proceeded with.  It is for the imposition of an <i>ad valorem</i> duty at the rate of 15 per cent. on all personal clothing and wearing apparel.  We also propose a tax of 15 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> on blanketing, blankets and rugs.  The yield of these two taxes is estimated at £520,000.  The manufacture of apparel is a type of industry which might well become independent of the assistance of a tariff in the course of a very few years.  Many branches of it are already carried on, to some extent, in the Saorstát.  The existing factories are by no means working to their full capacity.  In this case the imposition of the duty is expected to mean immediately a considerable increase in employment. There has been, it is true, a good deal of speculative forestalling, but it has not covered anything like the whole range of articles of apparel capable of being made here.  Labour for this industry is easily trained, and the plant required is not elaborate.  It is expected that expansion will be rapid and that before the end of the year several thousands of additional people will be employed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The tax on blankets and rugs will give some assistance to the woollen industry in meeting the difficulties with which it is at present faced.  The woollen industry is an old-established one and fairly efficient: it would, no doubt, be able to weather the storm without assistance.  But the tax proposed will help to prevent its coming out crippled or unduly impoverished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We propose that a duty of 33? per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> be charged on bedsteads and on wooden furniture.  The industry affected is one employing highly skilled labour.  It presents problems different from those arising in the other industries we have protected. Like the apparel industry, it is of a type which could be carried on in the Saorstát without being under any handicap.  If employers and workers both rise to their opportunity, the prospects of the industry may be completely transformed.  The revenue anticipated <Col N="24" /> for the year is £75,000.  Little will be paid on the cheaper class of furniture, which has always been made to a considerable extent here.</P>
    <P>Last year a duty of 33? per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> was imposed on black and green bottles.  It is proposed now to extend the tax to all empty glass bottles and jars.  The change will remove certain difficulties arising from the large number of border line cases. That, however, is a minor matter.  Its main effect will be to give Irish bottle makers a field sufficiently large for real growth.  An industry of a too limited type is not, in our circumstances, worth protection, since it is unlikely ever to grow strong enough to dispense with a tariff and face competition unaided.  It was never intended merely to give protection for the manufacture of porter bottles and leave the matter there.  The idea was to enable the factories to resume the work they had lately been doing and later to extend the scope of the duty to give them the opportunity of branching into new lines.  The Executive Council is convinced that, since the industry is protected at all, it should be protected in such a way as to produce definite results within a reasonable time.  The extension of the duty is expected to yield revenue to the extent of £20,000.</P>
    <P>Another duty which it is proposed to adjust is that on soap.  At present there is a 10 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> duty on all soap.  It appears, from recently increasing imports, that on toilet and shaving soaps, which are the profitable end of the business, less than a 20 per cent. tax would not be effective.  On the other hand, the Executive Council is satisfied that, after a suitable duty on the fancy soaps has been in force for a few years, there will be little need for continuing to tax common soap.  It is proposed to levy on toilet (including shaving) soaps and on soap powders and soap substitutes, a special duty of 10 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>, additional to the general duty of 10 per cent.  No increase in revenue will result.</P>
    <P>The proposed new duties, if agreed to by the Dáil, will bring in additional revenue to the extent of £615,000.  Adding this to the figure already arrived <Col N="25" /> at for distributable surplus, we have a total of £2,465,000 available for reduction of other taxation.</P>
    <P>Many suggestions have been put forward in recent months as to the form in which relief should be given.  I need hardly say that they have all received the degree of consideration which they seemed to deserve.  It has been hinted that abolition of income tax on all incomes arising in the Saorstát would be in the nature of an economic panacea. In saying that the proposal does not commend itself to the Government, I think it is only necessary for me to point out that its adoption would involve the Exchequer in an annual loss of well over £4,000,000 in income tax alone.  A big loss of super-tax would also be inevitable.  Further, we are satisfied that most of the loss would be felt immediately.  The collection of existing arrears would become difficult and much slower.  We had evidence of this in the fact that for a month or six weeks after the proposal was first mooted, there was practically a stoppage in a certain important part of the country of all payment of income tax. An idea has got abroad that because we have 8¼ millions, or thereabouts, in dividends coming into the Saorstát annually, that the Exchequer benefits to the extent of two million pounds in income tax.  The duty chargeable in respect of foreign dividends would be about two million pounds if all such dividends were assessed at 5/- and no allowances made.  But most of the income in question is subject to double taxation, and, consequently, is entitled to relief to the extent of, say, 2/3 in the pound on our part.  Further, it must be clear to all who will consider the matter that only a portion of the £8,000,000 income which we have under consideration would actually be charged income tax at all.  In a great many cases the dividends come either directly or ultimately to people of low income, who pay tax on only a fraction of the sum they receive, or perhaps escape tax altogether, by reason of the allowances to which they are entitled. A great many of the dividends come to various charities which are exempt from income tax altogether.  A careful review of the situation convinces us that we could not rely on revenue of <Col N="26" /> as much as £500,000 per annum from tax on incomes arising outside the Saorstát.  It would be dwelling too long on a proposal which, perhaps, was not meant to be taken literally, to deal with the cases in which, if the Cork proposal were adopted, we should lose Revenue merely for the benefit of the British Exchequer or the cases in which the change would result in increasing the effective salary of public servants who are protected by the Treaty and by Statute.  I shall leave the abolition proposal, therefore, with the remark that in my view the substantial shifting of the burden of taxation from the richer to the poorer sections of the community, which the change would necessarily involve, could not be justified, particularly when it is clear that the industrial stimulus aimed at could be achieved by far less drastic measures.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the necessity for abolishing Corporation Profits Tax.  While we admit that a case might be made for modifying the scope and rate of the tax, we are satisfied that, even as levied at present, it does not constitute such a handicap on industry as is frequently alleged.  Its abolition would mean a loss of revenue of £250,000 per annum, a sum which we believe could, at the present juncture, be used to better advantage in other forms of relief.  Even if we had a surplus which would make it easy for us to drop the tax, I should not be in favour of doing so until it had been further examined in relation to the question of death duties on assets held by foreign companies in the Saorstát. At present, if a Saorstát shareholder in a British company dies, we get our share of the duty.  If the company has assets here we can get the whole of the duty payable on the death of a Saorstát shareholder, provided the company has established, or has been obliged to establish a Colonial register here.  But we would get no duty on the death of a British shareholder, even though the company in question had all its assets in Ireland and the shareholder who died had held ninety-nine per cent. of its shares.  In such a case, property situated in the Saorstát would actually, though not technically, pass on a death, <Col N="27" /> but the British Exchequer would get the tax and we should get nothing. There are nearly four hundred British companies carrying on business here and some of them own property of enormous value.  As we are continually losing duty which would be paid if such property were owned by British residents individually, it should be clear that a case could be made for retaining some form of Corporation Profits Tax permanently, and that in any case the whole matter merits full consideration.</P>
    <P>I shall now give the proposals for the reduction of taxation.  We intend to reduce the Income Tax from 5/- to 4/-. This reduction in an ordinary full year would cost £1,000,000 or slightly less. In the first year, however, owing to what may be called normal arrears, resulting from the double instalment system in force and duty outstanding in respect of disputed assessments, it may be taken that an income tax reduction will cause only half the loss of revenue that would be sustained in a subsequent year.  If, therefore, we had no reservoir of abnormal arrears to draw upon, the cost of a shilling reduction in the present year would be a little under £500,000.  But we are satisfied that the reduction proposed will facilitate and expedite the collection of old arrears to such an extent that the revenue from income tax will not fall below the estimate given in the White Paper by more than £200,000.</P>
    <P>I come now to the farmers who notoriously do not pay income tax.  We do not propose to return to the prewar basis for the assessment of agricultural land, because it would result in a substantial loss to the Exchequer and give no relief to the farmer who lives solely by husbandry.  A substantial amount of tax on agricultural land does reach the Exchequer, but it is almost entirely paid by shopkeepers, teachers, clergymen and the like, who are also owners of farms, by big landowners and by farmers with investments. There are, of course, a certain number of ordinary farmers whose valuation renders them liable to tax, but only to a very limited extent.  A few examples will illustrate this.  Let <Col N="28" /> us take the case of a married farmer living in County Meath whose only source of income is a farm of 130 statute acres freehold, the Poor Law Valuation of which is £128.  His liability for income tax last year was 5/-; this year it will be 4/-.  I shall give another example: A man holding a farm valued at £240 for Poor Law purposes.  This man is not a freeholder. He pays a Land Purchase annuity of £195, is married, and has no other income. The interest portion of his annuity is 11-13 of the total, namely, £165.  The liability of such a man for income tax is nil.  In the case of farmers with holdings of higher valuation or paying smaller purchase annuities, I think it will be acknowledged that they should pay income tax, like other people, if they make profits.  And the farmer of two or three hundred pounds valuation who does not keep accounts to show whether he has made profits or not, ought to be made to pay double. We do not think that the way to help the agriculturist is to give the shopkeeper-farmer, or the shareholder-farmer relief that would be inadequate. An example will show how this class is affected by the present basis of assessment. A taxpayer is assessed under Schedule D as a shopkeeper at £500. He is married and owns and occupies a farm of 80 acres, the Poor Law Valuation of which is £40, and the Land Purchase annuity on which is £31.  His total liability to tax at the 5/- rate has been £37 7s. 6d.  A person in employment earning £500 a year and married would pay £28 2s. 6d.  A difference of £9 5s.  Our proposal for the relief of the farmer whose industry is the most important factor in our economic life is that the agricultural grant should be doubled.  The cost in round figures will be £600,000.  Although a payment out of the Exchequer will be involved and technically fresh expenditure will be incurred, we regard the step we are taking as being essentially as much a relief of taxation as if we took, say, 8d. more off the income tax at a similar cost.  We propose to take steps similar to those prescribed in the Local Government (Rates on Agricultural Land) Act, 1924, to enable appropriate reductions to be made in the <Col N="29" /> demand notes.  The necessary legislation and estimate will be submitted as soon as possible.  The only other remission of direct taxation which we propose is an increase of the allowance for the Corporation Profits Tax purposes from £500 to £1,000.  The cost will be about £15,000.</P>
    <P>We propose to abolish the duty on tea.  The cost will be £450,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>We propose also to abolish the duties on raw cocoa and coffee and chicory at a cost of £39,000.</P>
    <P>Our principal proposal, however, is in connection with the sugar duty. We propose, in the first place, to drop Imperial preference in sugar, the cost of which has been very considerable, and does not benefit the consumer or even Great Britain&mdash;the great market for our produce.  The countries which produce the sugar, and benefit by the preference, cannot give us any reciprocal advantage.  In the first year in which we had control of our own Customs, the proportion of preference sugar imported hardly exceeded 5 per cent.  During the past six months the percentage has grown, so that in February it amounted to 77.92 per cent. and in March to 78.52 per cent. of our total imports of sugar.  The seriousness of the increase from a financial point of view is obvious when we remember that the duty on preference sugar is £1 1s. 4?d., while the full rate is 25s. 8d.  If we had given no preference last year, our revenue from the sugar duty would have been £75,000 in excess of the realised figure.  If the recent trend were to continue, we might this year lose one-sixth of our entire revenue from sugar through preference. A like result could not happen in a big market like Great Britain. Although a change in rate of duty on our part would check last year's trend, the experience we have had of the possible effects of preference in this particular commodity show that it is not suitable to a small country like this. In any case, we want now to give the greatest possible advantage to the consumer at the least cost of the revenue. Therefore, we intend to reduce the duty on sugar from a full rate of 2¾d. per lb., with a preference rate of ? <Col N="30" /> less, to a flat rate of 1d. in the lb. The cost will be £1,100,000.  The various remissions of Customs duties proposed will take effect from the 6th May, leaving a period of fourteen days during which traders may clear stocks on hand.  This is considered ample.</P>
    <P>Certain proposals for the reduction of the postal and telephone charges have been considered.  The Government are satisfied that, at the present juncture, it would be an unjustifiable proceeding to reduce the letter rate to 1d. and throw on the Exchequer the burden of providing an additional contribution of £220,000 towards the maintenance of our postal services.  No stimulus could be given to business that would at all correspond to the cost. Besides, such a step would mean practically an abandonment of the idea that within a reasonable period the Post Office should be made to pay its way.  There are, however, certain concessions which would not be costly and which would be of benefit to the business community.  It is proposed to lower the rate for inland postcards from 1½d. to 1d.  Before the European War the rate was ½d., so that with the proposed change it will simply be doubled, like the letter rate.  Allowing for a certain increase in the traffic, it is estimated that the reduction of a halfpenny in the rate will mean a loss of revenue of less than £14,000 a year. Post-cards are a remunerative class of business from the Post Office point of view.  They are easy to handle and deal with, and do not add much to the weight of mail bags.  A moderate increase in the traffic would not, therefore, entail extra expense.</P>
    <P>The telephone service is the particular branch of Post Office activity in which reductions are most likely to pay themselves in increased traffic apart altogether from stimulus to business.  Unlike the remaining postal services, the telephones are almost, if not quite, paying their way.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs thinks they are paying their way, and I think they are almost paying their way.  In any case, they are doing better than ever before.  It is proposed to make the following reductions: Rentals for first lines to business <Col N="31" /> houses will be lowered from £7 10s. to £6 10s., and auxiliary lines from £6 10s. to £5 10s.  Rental for lines to private residences will be lowered from £7 10s. to £5.  The local fees for calls will be reduced from 1½d. and 3d., according to distance, to 1¼d. and 2d. respectively. The present discount of 5 per cent. on calls in excess of 2,000 a year will be discontinued.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the Post Office concessions will be about £50,000, though it is expected that after a year, with increased traffic, most of the lost revenue will be recovered.</P>
    <P>I have now exhausted our list of reliefs, which amount in the aggregate to £2,454,000, leaving the modest net surplus of £11,000.</P>
    <P>We have not proposed to apply any part of the gross surplus towards supplementing the Old Age Pension Vote, because we feel that the situation does not permit of any increase in recurrent expenditure; that, in fact, existing expenditure can continue to be borne only if conditions improve.  Substantial reduction in taxation is, consequently, necessary above all else.  But, if the situation is found to have improved at the end of the year, we believe some revision of the Old Age Pension Act, 1924, will have to be given precedence of any further reduction of taxation, however much required.  Meantime the tea and sugar reductions will be of some benefit to old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill will contain a number of relief proposals which will not involve any appreciable cost to the Exchequer. A clause will be inserted giving effect, for a further period of three years, to the arrangement relieving British charities from Saorstát tax. The British will reciprocate by relieving our charities.  It had not been intended to renew the arrangement, but we have been convinced that refusal on our part to do so would have meant serious loss to Saorstát charities.  After a careful review of the circumstances, we have come to the conclusion that the period of three years is not too long. But, at the end of it, no Saorstát charity which has not transferred its funds to home investments, will have grounds for complaint, or for a plea <Col N="32" /> for a further extension of time when it finds its income becoming subject to tax.</P>
    <P>Following the example of British legislation last year profits arising from Agricultural Shows will be exempted from income tax.</P>
    <P>Since the imposition of the Entertainments' Tax, duty has not been paid in respect of events promoted by the Gaelic Athletic Association, though under the law they clearly were not exempt.  So far we have simply followed British precedent and refrained from enforcing payment of the tax without altering the law.  The time has now come when the position must be regularised, and we propose that statutory authority be extended to the exemption that has hitherto, tacitly but illegally, been given.</P>
    <P>Other minor changes in the law will be proposed, but they can be most satisfactorily dealt with when they come before the Dáil in the form of resolutions or as sections of the Finance Act. I propose to deal briefly with two matters of importance outstanding.</P>
    <P>The first is the Road Tax on motor vehicles.  Various suggestions have been put forward for a new basis.  We have not yet been able to reach any conclusions.  If it is decided to propose any change from the horse-power basis, a Finance Bill No. 2 will be introduced. In view of the fact that the Road Tax year ends on the 31st December nothing will be lost by two or three months' delay.</P>
    <P>The other outstanding matter to which I wish to refer is the question of the inauguration of the beet sugar industry in Saorstát Eireann.  It is now possible to announce that the Government has come to a satisfactory agreement with a firm of Belgian sugar manufacturers to enable a factory to be started here for the manufacture of sugar in the autumn of 1926.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait and see.  Last September an inter-departmental Committee, consisting of representatives of the Departments of Finance, of Industry and Commerce and of Lands and Agriculture was formed for the purpose of considering any proposals <Col N="33" /> that might be put forward for the development of a beet sugar industry in this country.  Representatives of the sugar industry from Holland, France, Belgium and Czecho-Slovakia visited the country and set out the terms on which they were willing to set up a beet sugar factory here.  Some of the offers were of a rather tentative nature while others were definite in form. Members of the Committee went to the Continent and were shown over the sugar factories of some of the groups that were prepared to start a factory here, and interviewed the heads of these groups with a view to getting their terms modified in certain directions. When the various proposals were in their final form, they were laid before the Executive Council which decided that, taken generally, especially from the farmers' point of view, acceptance of the terms offered by the Belgian group headed by M. Lippens afforded the best prospect of setting up the beet sugar industry on a sound basis.  I may state here that no country ever established this industry without the grant of subsidies, and that no country ever regretted the money spent on fostering it.</P>
      <P>The terms of governmental aid which it has been agreed to grant to the company which will be formed by M. Lippens and his associates by way of remission of excise duty or by payment of a direct subsidy for a ten years' period commencing in 1926 are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>For the first three years 24/6 per cwt. of manufactured sugar of a polarization of 98 degrees.</P>
      <P>For the next five years 22/6 per cwt. of manufactured sugar of a polarization of 98 degrees.</P>
      <P>For the last two years 22/- per cwt. of manufactured sugar of a polarization of 98 degrees.</P>
      <P>This represents approximately an average subsidy of 23/- per cwt. of manufactured sugar over the whole period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This subsidy will be conditional on payment to the sugar beet growers, for the first three years of the ten year period, of a price of 54/- per ton, factory weight, washed and topped, for beets of 15½ sugar content delivered at <Col N="34" /> the factory, provided the grower enters into a three years' contract for growing and delivering the beets.  The price of 54/- per ton will be liable to variation by the addition or deduction of 2/6, or a proportional fraction thereof for every one per cent. or fraction thereof by which the sugar content is greater or less respectively than 15½ per cent.  For one year's contract the basic price to the grower will be 50/- per ton, with the above variations. Growers, in addition, will be entitled, if they so desire, to have returned to them on specially favourable terms a proportion of the dried pulp from which the sugar has been extracted and which is a valuable cattle food.  One of the chief considerations that led to the acceptance of the Belgian offer was the fact of the high prices to be paid to the beet grower for his crop, as it is certain that the industry cannot be established without the hearty cooperation of the farmers.  After the fullest consideration of all the proposals submitted, it can be stated confidently that no firm of continental reputation with experience of the growing of beet and the manufacture and marketing of sugar, was willing to accept as low a rate of subsidy while giving a guarantee of such prices to the beet grower.</P>
    <P>As regards the site of the factory, it was felt necessary to concede to the company complete freedom of choice in view of the fact that if the experiment is a failure the main loss will fall on the company.</P>
    <P>It was further considered that it would be foolish, in such matters, to interfere with the discretion of men of many years' experience in the beet-sugar industry.  The company can go ahead with every certainty that there will be no attempt by the Government to dictate to it as to the best way in which it can carry out the experiment to a successful issue.  It was not, however, considered incompatible with this decision to direct the attention of representatives of the company to the notable pioneer work in beet growing that has been carried out under the auspices of the North Cork Industrial Development Association.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to subsidise more <Col N="35" /> than one factory at the present time. This first factory is experimental.  We have no precise data as to the yield per acre and the sugar content of sugar-beet grown in this country.</P>
    <P>I hope that, after a very short experience of the running of the first experimental factory, it may be possible to obtain much better terms, and, therefore, I hesitate about stating definitely what number of additional factories, if any, I will be prepared to license.  The Dáil will appreciate that this is a matter which a little more knowledge and inquiries will certainly elucidate, and that public interest requires caution in issuing licences on the present terms.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that information will soon be available, as grants are being given by the Department of Lands and Agriculture for growing sugar-beet on a commercial scale in various districts.</P>
    <P>If these experiments are successful, there will be no difficulty later on in persuading farmers to grow beet for another factory, if it is decided to enlarge the experiment.  Furthermore, the Government has no certain information as to whether the rate of subsidy required now is the least possible necessary for the successful establishment of the industry in the Saorstát.  M. Lippens was very anxious to obtain some private Irish capital for his enterprise. He has now received assurances of such support.  It will be a condition, however, of the granting of a licence to the company that a balance-sheet and profit and loss account for each year's working shall be furnished to the Government, with such explanations as shall be considered necessary, and the balance-sheet will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  To this condition the company agree, and we will, consequently, in a few years' time, be able to measure, with some degree of certainty, the amount of State assistance necessary to set the industry on its feet.  It would be difficult to justify at this transition period, when so many factors are unknown, the grant of these substantial concessions for a period of ten years to more than one factory.  It should be remembered that the terms we are granting are considerably <Col N="36" /> in excess of those, the offer of which has resulted in the building, or the proposed building, of a number of factories in Great Britain.  Placing the terms side by side and taking the Colonial Preference rate into account, we get the following comparison:&mdash;</P>

    <P>I should add that the British factories which were working during the two seasons before 1924 received in remission of duty State assistance at the rate of 25/8 per cwt. for these two seasons in addition to the subsidy now granted.  On the other hand, most of the British factories will enjoy the certainty of the subsidy for nine years only.</P>
    <P>It should be said, however, that these comparisons, made just now, are unduly unfavourable to our terms, because the 8/5 at the end of the tenth year, paid by the British Government, is paid at the end of 19 years' experience of beet sugar manufacture, whereas the 22/-, paid at the end of our tenth year, will be paid at the end of only 10 years' net experience of beet sugar manufacture.</P>
    <P>The amount of sugar which will be manufactured in the factory here is, of course, problematical, but it has been roughly estimated that the amounts will be 5,000 tons of sugar the first year, 6,000 tons the second year, 7,000 tons the third year, 8,000 tons the fourth year and 10,000 tons each of the next six years.  If these estimates prove correct, the amount of State assistance will be £122,500 for the first year, £147,000 the second year, £171,500 the third year, £180,000 the fourth year, £225,000 the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth years, and £220,000 the ninth and tenth years or £1,961,000 over the period of ten years.  In view of these figures, and the fact that they might actually be exceeded, it is obvious that prudence dictates that we should not commit ourselves to more than one factory till our <Col N="37" /> knowledge of all the factors governing the situation is considerably wider than it is at present.  It is hoped that our experience will be so successful that we will be able to review this decision within a very few years.  No expenditure will be incurred in connection with the present proposal in the current year, and the necessary legislation will be submitted to the Oireachtas in due course.  If the experiment is a failure, the loss will fall entirely on the Company which is putting up all the capital required.  If it is a success and leads to new and improved methods of tillage, improvement in dairy farming, and the finding of useful employment in the fields and in the new factories for those who might otherwise be forced to emigrate, the price is not too high, and the cost is not greatly in excess of the cost of the experiment at Kelham, in Great Britain, if capital losses there are taken into account.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I have to warn the members of the Dáil that although the reductions proposed are justified for the present year and the next, they are such as cannot be continued beyond the year 1926-7 unless the general economic position of the country is improved by increasing production in agriculture and industry.  We are now preparing to rely considerably for the next few years on sources of revenue which must disappear like the income tax arrears, and sources such as the protective duties which, we hope, will dry up by reason of their having achieved their purpose.  If there is not a general realisation that all classes in the country are concerned in its economic welfare, and if that realisation does not translate itself into some practical action, I believe that the future will hold great difficulties, and they will not be such as can be solved by changing Governments and Constitutions and oaths.  On the other hand, if, in the economic field, the people will face the new responsibilities, the new opportunities, the new difficulties that are theirs, there need be no fears for the future.  The Government is convinced that people all over the country are adopting a new outlook; that they want no more political wrangles; that they want to see constructive <Col N="38" /> things done, and to help in the doing of them.</P>
    <P>We propose the reductions I have announced as an act of faith in the Saorstát and its future.  We do not propose them rashly or casually, but because we are convinced, after careful thought, that they are a stimulus which the country needs, and to which it will respond.</P>

That resolution sets out that it is expedient to amend the law relating to Customs and Inland Revenue and to make further provision in connection with finance.  On that motion the Dáil may have a general discussion on the Minister's statement and on all the questions that arise in the course of the Minister's statement.  That discussion could be taken to-morrow, or on any other day that would be fixed by the Bill and that would be found suitable for the convenience of Deputies.

Has he got in summary form the total of the remissions on the one hand and the total of the revenue coming in from new taxations on the other?  Such a summary would show the resultant balance sheet.  I ask that question because, as the Minister spoke, I made out a summary and I find there is a difference of about £1,300,000.

The line that we on these Benches have taken in regard to income tax and reductions of income tax has been, from the beginning, that we would oppose any reduction unless there was, concurrently, a reduction in the taxation of commodities generally consumable by the poor. I am glad to know that the Minister has met that claim by a very valuable remission of taxation on particular articles which are in very large demand by the poorer people&mdash;sugar and tea.  That, I am sure, will be welcomed by every household, and especially by the poorer households.  More particularly will it be welcomed by the poor with large families.  I have no doubt that there will be some dissatisfaction, some sorrow, and some tears wept in Cork because of the retention of income tax at the rate of four shillings. There will be sorrow there even though there is a reduction of twenty per cent. in the tax.  But Cork will float and the tears will dry up.</P>
      <P>The people of Cork, at any rate, who would be most intimately concerned with the problem of how to keep a house going will be very greatly relieved to find that income tax on the man with 30/- a week and on the man of 15/- and 20/- a week of a dole, the income tax on the poor which is collected by means of taxation on sugar, tea and such like commodities, has definitely been reduced by a considerable amount, and I think the Minister should be highly commended for that act.  I confess that I would prefer to have learned from the Minister that his proposal was to make an exemption, or, shall I say, to make an additional exemption, in connection with income tax in respect of lower incomes, and in respect of allowances for the larger families.  I think that it would have been the better way to meet the case, but probably we will deal with that a little more fully at a later stage in these discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question that will arise later on&mdash; and I would ask the Minister to pay special attention to it, and I hope that none of the resolutions will preclude it <Col N="42" /> even when they are finally passed on Report&mdash;is the question of a change in respect of the law relating to the collection of income tax from wage-earners. I hope the Minister has taken into account all that has been said in criticism both from employers and workmen and workwomen in respect of the collection by the employer of the tax, unless by agreement.  I think that that is a matter we should give some consideration to and that we ought to change the law in respect of. I do not want to go any further into the question respecting this particular matter at the moment, but I thought it necessary and desirable and only due to the Minister to say that we appreciate the move he has made respecting taxation of the poor, that is, taxation on the breakfast-table commodities, and to regret that he has not seen fit in modifying the income tax, to extend the exemption in respect of the allowance for families and the lower incomes.</P>

      <P>The resolution before us in connection with income tax is one which, I think, will meet with general approval in so far as it is a reduction on a tax which was at a rate that was becoming, and was being felt as unbearable under the conditions with which we have been faced in recent times.  In saying that, it must not be taken, while the shilling reduction is very acceptable&mdash;and we accept it with very great gratitude&mdash;that the shilling reduction in income tax is adequate to the situation. On the other hand.  I think that the Minister in making out his Budget had clearly before him the comments that would be made by Deputy Johnson in connection with indirect taxation. In taking the line which he has taken in abolishing the other taxes, I think he will, in a large measure, satisfy the people with incomes, in view of the reduction that is made in the income tax.  The relief given in the indirect taxation in general application will, I feel, be accepted by the payers of income tax as a reason and a justification for the very moderate reduction that is made in the income tax.  Therefore, as far as I can speak for the people who are <Col N="43" /> benefiting by this reduction of one shilling in the income tax, I think, while we possibly expected more, possibly expected abolition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>In the year 1915 the British Legislature brought in a Finance Bill by which the farmer was assessed on one-third of his valuation. That was subsequently made up to the full valuation, and it was doubled during the war.  After the war it was brought back to the full valuation, and that is the position we are now in. We contend that we should be placed in the position we were in up to 1915 and that we should be assessed on one-third of our valuation as regards our incomes.  I cannot understand what the Minister meant by asking farmers to keep accounts, considering that all the farmer's time is engaged in trying to make a living, to make ends meet, that there is no such thing as profit, and that rather than furnish these accounts he is willing to pay whenever he is made to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking seriously, it is a very objectionable feature to introduce the idea that farmers, when they are up to a certain valuation, should be compelled <Col N="44" /> to keep accounts.  We know, and the Minister knows perfectly well, that the larger the amount concerned in the farm at the moment, the more difficult is it for the farmer to make a profit.  The reduction now taking place in the tax on tea and sugar will mean a considerable rise in wages to the wage earner, and in any household will amount to at least two or three shillings a week.  I hope that while we have a reduction in the household expenditure, farmers will also have the advantage of the reductions which the Minister has given to every householder and every workman in the country.  Of course we do not object to the reduction to 4/-.  We would like to hear the Minister's reason for singling out that particular class of individual for special treatment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickLeonard" hpid="Mr. LEONARD Mr. LEONARD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEONARD</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy who has just spoken as to his interpretation of what the Minister meant by large farmers keeping accounts. As I understand the Minister, farmers of a certain large valuation would be assessed for income tax on that valuation, but if they kept correct accounts all the income tax they would have to pay would be on the profits shown by the correctly kept accounts. I think that is what the Deputy did not understand in the Minister's statement. The Minister told us that he estimated a loss of £200,000 on income tax in the coming year in consequence of the reduction from 5/- to 4/-.  Personally, I would be very much surprised if he finds any loss at all.  It is infinitely better for any Chancellor of the Exchequer to receive 4/- in the pound income tax from two people than to receive 5/- from one person.  It is quite within the knowledge of a great many people here, and certainly within my knowledge, that there are people who would pay Irish income tax when it was as low, or lower, than that of Great Britain, and, consequently, I think that these people of means who will come and live and spend their money in our country will provide an undeveloped source of income upon which the Minister has not calculated.  I think that, instead of having a loss on a reduced income tax he will probably, and I sincerely hope, have a gain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>While I will pay a tribute personally to the Minister for Finance, I cannot say that I am satisfied with his Budget.  On the question of income tax, and as regards the point Deputy Wilson made, under the Act of 1886, income tax was assessed on Schedule B, and in 1919 it was assessed on three times the valuation, but during the Great War it was assessed on twice the valuation of the holdings.  In other words, the occupier of land was assessed during that period at six times the amount of assessment pre-war.  That is an extraordinary thing.  It has been reduced, however, to three times the amount, but, even so, is it not an extraordinary and anomalous position, and would there not be a great outcry among the community if any person were assessed at three times his pre-war assessment?  The limit certainly has been lowered, but I submit that the occupiers of land have been particularly hard hit, and it is scarcely fair that the assessment should be made on that valuation.  We want to revert to something like the old conditions, inasmuch as land does not show the same profit now as it did before the war.  I am rather sorry that the Minister did not see his way to reduce income tax to something below four shillings. We cannot, of course, yet say what the British income tax will be, but if it is lower than 4/-, if it is 3/6, does the Minister realise how it will affect companies doing business in this State and having their offices registered in Great Britain?  Messrs. Guinness, for instance, would pay no corporation tax in Ireland because their offices are registered in Great Britain.  If our tax is higher than the British tax what will happen the companies who are in business here and having their offices in Great Britain?  They will only pay at the British rate on their dividends here. That is scarcely fair.  The position should be that our income tax should, at least as a minimum, be equal to that of Great Britain, whereas, even if we were below it, companies registered outside Ireland will continue to pay at the British rate.  That is a point which I would like the Minister to take up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister has not seen his way to remove the corporation tax and I, for one, am not satisfied with the reasons which he has given for the course he has taken.  Undoubtedly the reduction of income tax by 1/- will be a great relief to this country, and it may be an inducement to those who are outside the country for a time, to come back and stay here, but that does not get away from the fact that even if the British income tax is reduced to 4/- in the course of the next few days, and thereby be equal to the proposed new income tax in the Free State, the corporation tax payable by companies here will be 1/- more than that payable by companies in Great Britain.  That is not an inducement for any enterprise from any source in this country.  Another thing which I regret in connection with this matter is that the Minister has not seen his way to make some statement in regard to double taxation. On several occasions I myself and other Deputies during the last year have drawn his and the Dáil's attention to this iniquitous system of every taxpayer having to pay twice, first to the British and then to the Irish Exchequer. I have always claimed that the taxpayer should only pay the sum that is finally due from him and that he should only pay that sum once.  It has been suggested that a clearing house should be set up whereto the taxpayer should pay the sum finally due by him, and in that clearing house the two Governments should fight it out between them as to the various sums to be allocated.  I think, therefore, it is a pity that after all this time some arrangement could not have been come to between the two Exchequers on that point.  Perhaps now that the income tax will likely be the same in both countries, there may not be quite the same delay, because it is quite true that owing to the fact that income tax was <Col N="47" /> at the rate of 5/- in the Free State and 4/6 in Great Britain, there were considerable difficulties to be overcome by way of mathematical calculations.  Now it will merely be a question of halving the amount, but that, to my mind, is a stronger argument still for setting up something in the nature of a clearing house.</P>
      <P>I think it would do away with a great deal of delay, and also do away with an irksome burden that is unnecessary, and, I think, unjustifiably borne by the taxpayers of this country who have to pay more than is actually due from them, and who are out of their money for a considerable time.  A taxpayer should be called upon only once to pay the actual sum required by the State from him in the way of income tax.  These are the only remarks I desire to make at this stage in regard to this particular resolution.  I certainly am in favour of the step the Minister has taken.  I think the direction is a right one, and I am sorry the Minister has not gone further.</P>

      <P>I have not much to say, as Deputy Connor Hogan has given expression to our view point, and I may add that Deputy Captain Redmond has also given expression to our views with regard to the dual income tax.  To my mind, there is nothing so unfair to this country as having to pay English income tax, and to pay here also, and go to considerable trouble in trying to get it back.  A few years ago it was not got back at all.  The Minister talks glibly about farmers keeping accounts. It is all very well for Deputy Leonard, who keeps an office, to keep his accounts in the ordinary way of business, but it is not so easy for an ordinary farmer to keep his accounts.  To do so he would want to keep a typist, or somebody of that description.  He would then be between the devil and the deep sea, and there might be other aspects.  It might be quite as cheap, or cheaper, to pay the income tax assessment than to keep accounts.  I do not think the Irish farmers have to any extent kept accounts for a great many years.  It may be considered that is a <Col N="48" /> misfortune.  Perhaps it is, but I do not think they will keep accounts.  Speaking from my own personal experience of this year, last year, and the year before, I know that farmers have been losing instead of making money, and losing by hundreds and thousands, even good farmers.  The income tax, with regard to farmers, is really based on loss and not on income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to say much at this stage.  We are very fully aware of the objection to double income tax.  We have continually had the matter in mind, and have given time and thought to exploring new possibilities for at any rate minimising the difficulties that have been found to exist.  We certainly are not at the end of our tether in that particular matter.  We have not sat down and become satisfied with the position.  We are most anxious to get at a simpler method, and as a matter of fact at present I have under investigation in the Revenue Office a proposal for a considerable simplification, and if we find it will not unduly penalise us from the view of revenue it will be taken up with the British Government.  Generally, we are prepared to explore, in conjunction with the British Government or separately, any possible steps that may be taken for the purpose of modifying these.  I do not think that a clearing house into which all the income tax would go, leaving the two Governments to find out how much was owing to each, would work out at all.  You can only use diplomatic methods between the Governments. If you have to settle thousands of claims year after year, I am afraid the clearing office would have some of the characteristics of a dog fight.  I will deal at some future time at greater length with the questions raised by Deputy Gorey and Deputy Johnson. When the Finance Bill is before us, proposals for the modification of collection, and changes in the bases of assessment, could be brought in as amendments and fully discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of a tax on the farmers under Schedule B is one that Deputies should understand.  The farmer is entitled first to the one-tenth reduction for his unearned income allowance. <Col N="49" /> Then there is deducted the interest borne on the land annuity, about eleven-thirteenth of that, so that anybody can see there is very little to pay under Schedule B.  This is the position, that a farmer, to be taxed, should be a farmer of very considerable valuation if he has no other income than from land.  If he has other income besides land, he gets his allowance for the other income, and he will be charged on the land.  We get considerable sums into the Exchequer that way.  If a man is a teacher he gets his personal, married and other allowances, and similarly if he keeps a shop. These are exhausted before we come to the land, and that is why he pays on the land.  That is why going back to the old basis would result in loss of revenue, but as regards the ordinary farmer who lives on his husbandry and has no other income, the aggregate amount of tax paid by him is not worth talking about.</P>

There is one class of citizen who would escape the rule that applies to nearly everybody, and that is, shall we say, a Belgian living here and who has become a citizen of Saorstát Eireann; he would escape certain liability that other citizens would not escape.

      <P>That any repayments of income tax for any year of assessment, whether ending before or after the passing of this Resolution, to which any person may be entitled in respect of any deduction allowed under Sections 18 to 22 of the Finance Act, 1920, or in respect of the reduction of the rate of tax on the first two hundred and twenty-five pounds of taxable income under Section 23 of that Act, shall be made at the standard rate of tax for that year, or at half that rate, as the case may be, but subject to such adjustments as may be proper in cases where relief is given under or by virtue of the Double Taxation (Relief) Act, 1923 (No. 8 of 1923):</P>
      <P>Provided that, in the case of any person who proves as regards any year that, by reason of the deductions to which he is entitled, he has no taxable income for that year, any repayment to be made shall be a repayment of the whole amount of the tax paid by him, whether by deduction or otherwise, in respect of his income for that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest, that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the <Col N="52" /> Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1913.</P>
    <P>This resolution is one that is taken from the British Finance Act of last year.  The declaration made under it follows the practice that has always existed, but in England a year or so ago litigation arose in connection with the point as to the rate at which a person was entitled to repayment once a change of duty arose.  The courts decided in favour of the Inland Revenue authorities, but the judge expressed some doubts as to what the legal position really was.  Following that the British introduced this provision into their legislation.  As I explained last year, our courts are not bound by British precedents, but we must assume that if a doubt arises in a British court, or that a British court decides in a particular way, it is most likely that a court here would decide in a similar way, and when the British Government has found it necessary to make provision for a possibility of an established practice being overturned by a legal decision, it is only wise that we should make that provision also.  The whole difficulty and confusion in the mind of the taxpayer is likely to arise through companies deducting a tax at composite rates.  A company will pay a dividend next December, and tax will be shown as deducted at the rate of 4/3, because one-fourth of the dividend relates to the past financial year up to the 31st March, and tax is deducted in respect of that at the 5/- rate, while tax is deducted in respect of the remainder of the year at the 4/- rate.</P>
    <P>There is then shown on the dividend warrant which the taxpayer receives tax deducted at 4/3, and it would generally produce in the mind of the taxpayer the type of confusion which we used to find in regard to Summer Time; when it was 9 o'clock by Summer Time people could not make out whether it was 8 o'clock or 10 o'clock ordinary time.  No difficulty would arise if companies were to do something like this: to give two dividends, one in respect of the period up to the 31st March, and deduct tax at 5/-, and another for the six months running up to December, or whatever the next period was, and deduct tax at 4/-.  The taxpayer <Col N="53" /> would know then that in respect of this year he was only entitled to repayment in respect of 4/-.  But as the dividend warrants, coming out as they will, with the change of tax and with these composite rates, a great deal of confusion will arise and taxpayers will be difficult to satisfy.  Then there is the question that arose in England by that decision, and litigation on the head of it, and it is possible that under the existing procedure the only and the completely equitable procedure may be overthrown by the courts.</P>

The major portion, that is the portion dealing with cinematograph films, clocks and watches, musical instruments, motor cars and motor cycles, we regard as the type of revenue that arises very largely from luxury expenditure, and we have felt that we should make all possible reductions in taxation rather in things of a necessary character than in these matters.  The loss in revenue that would take place if we were to drop these particular taxes would be fairly considerable, and we do not feel that it could be justified or that we should undertake it.  The loss in revenue, if we were not to pass these duties, would amount to £370,000.</P>

      <P>I am obliged to the Minister.  In regard to the renewal of these taxes I must at the earliest possible stage enter my individual protest.  In England these taxes were imposed, not as revenue producing taxes at all, but for the purpose of protecting British industries.  I am now speaking with regard to what are known as the McKenna Importation Duties on motor cars and motor cycles. These taxes were imposed in England before we had a Government of our own, to protect existing British industries, and when they had served that purpose in England they were removed. We are seeking to utilise these taxes, not for the purpose of protecting industries, but for the sole purpose of revenue.  The Minister has rather laid stress on the point that the articles included under this head are articles of luxury.  Does he mean to say that at this stage of the twentieth century motor cars in Ireland are articles of luxury?  If he does say that, I think he is a little out of date.  I consider <Col N="55" /> that motor cars are anything but articles of luxury in Ireland, and I consider that they are essential to the future internal traffic, intercourse, intercommunication and trade within the four shores of this country.  Unfortunately, we have not got a super-magnificent railway system, and so we are driven largely to use the roads. We have to go back to the roads now from the old coach days.  We see that road traffic is the proper means, at present at any rate, of communication between the various trading centres in this country.  What does this tax mean in regard to motor cars?  This tax imposes a duty of 33? per cent. upon all motor cars coming from countries other than Great Britain or the other parts of the Empire.  It imposes a duty of 22 and a fraction per cent. on motor cars coming from Great Britain and from places within the Empire.  What does it amount to?  Is it protecting any industries in this country?  Have we got any great motor industries or even any motor industries in embryo? Have we anything in that way that is to be protected by these taxes?  There is a Ford factory in Cork.  Does that benefit in any way by these taxes?  Do we get a Ford motor car cheaper in Ireland to-day because these taxes are imposed than we would if these taxes were not imposed?  I, certainly, for one, believe that we do not.  Instead of doing everything possible to encourage the import of all classes and kinds of motor cars and vehicles which we do not produce, for the development of the country, and of which there is no sign of our ever being able to produce, we are imposing on these cars an almost prohibitive import duty. At any rate we are making it more difficult for those who want to develop the trade of the country to do so than it would be if there were no taxes whatsoever on motor cars.  Everybody knows that the motor industry, the distributing portion of it certainly, is in a very bad way in the Free State at the present time.  Nobody will buy a car in this country if he can buy it elsewhere, and succeed in running it here for any length of time.  That is not such an extraordinary proposition <Col N="56" /> as some Deputies, perhaps, might be inclined to think, because anybody who goes out in the streets of Dublin any day and sees the numbers of the cars will see that they are foreign numbers and marks, and by foreign numbers and marks I mean English marks as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not so difficult, then, to purchase cars outside the Saorstát, and to run them, for a certain time, at any rate, within the Saorstát.  That is the point. Why?  That is done to avoid this unnecessary, and, I think, groundless and untenable, tax upon an article which it is not even suggested that we are ever going to produce here, and which, to my mind, now in the twentieth century is absolutely essential, and is not a luxury, for the progress and welfare of the country.  In view of the fact that protests have been made so often, certainly during the last year, and that these protests have come from very many quarters, from trading quarters, business quarters, from tourist quarters, from motor distributors, and from other quarters, I think something should be done towards mitigating this taxation, if not removing it entirely. This, also, includes taxation of motor parts.  If a tourist happens to be in the West of Ireland during the summer, and finds he has to get a spare part, he has to send to England for it; we do not manufacture them here.  He sends across the water for it, and he has to pay duty on that part whether it is a small nut or an important portion of his engine.  The very tiniest screw in his car to the most intricate portion of his engine has to have duty paid on it. That is bad enough, but what time has he to wait for it?  Anyone who has to do with motor cars knows that the delay in getting through the Customs is absurd.  If you send for parts of a motor car&mdash;I do not know whether the Minister has had any experience of it himself, but I have had&mdash;you will be very lucky if you get it within the space of three or four weeks, or perhaps three months.  That is due to the unnecessary delay occasioned by these Customs tariffs.  I do think it would be wise even still for the Minister to consider whether it would not be possible to do away, if not with the tax on <Col N="57" /> cars, at any rate, with the tax on the spare parts.  This is a matter that is hitting everybody in all parts of the Saorstát.  It is hitting traders, professional men, and people engaged in the motor trade itself, and I think that this resolution should not be passed without at least making a protest, because nothing has been done to mitigate this grievance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, in the first place, to renew the protest that I made last year on a similar resolution that the amounts of the duties levied are not stated in the resolution.  I know the Minister is acting according to British precedent, but in this respect I think the British precedent is a bad one.  The Dáil should not be asked to vote any duty without having an exact statement of the duty that it is voting. I have not the faintest idea of what the duty on dried fruits is, and I do not think any Deputies have.  I have an idea of the duties referred to in subsection (2), which are 33? per cent. But we ought to have them on the paper before us before we are asked to pass a resolution of this kind.  I agree with almost all that Deputy Redmond said as regards the duty on motor cars.  These McKenna duties are duties that were imposed in Great Britain for the purposes of protection which have been found unsuitable in the country of their origin and repealed; they are still continued in this country, where they offer no protection of any kind whatever.  On the last occasion that we were discussing this, the Minister informed us that there was a certain manufacturer of drums in his constituency. I think these were manufactured for export and not used in the Saorstát, and I do not think that that industry would be very severely hit by the importation of drums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of spare parts, I want to endorse Deputy Redmond's statement.  The Minister objected last year to any exemption of spare motor parts because he said that the result would be that ingenious people would import sufficient spare parts to put their car together here; that they would have a car with certain parts taken out; that those parts would be imported separately and the car would <Col N="58" /> be put together here.  Even if that were so, it would create an assembling industry and might have some value.  In practice, I do not believe it is impossible to schedule a list of parts that might be brought in without paying duty&mdash;small parts, such as nuts, springs, parts of the carburetter, and so on&mdash;while compelling the larger parts of the motor car, such as cylinders, wheels, and so on, to pay duty. That is a sufficient check on any evasion of that kind and it would simplify matters enormously, because not only do these spare parts have to pay duty, not only are they subject to delay, but a little nut, a bolt or a spring has to pay a minimum duty of 2/6 and also a Customs registration fee of 6d.  So that if you are importing a small nut or bolt for one particular car, you have to pay at least 3/- on an article whose value might be only about 4d.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I know, did something to try and meet the case last year, but he did not do enough.  The matter was not pushed through, and I do hope that before the Finance Bill goes out of our ken he will be able to tell us that something more will be done in this matter.  The yield of the tax is not the only thing; the cost of collection and the ease of collection are also very important factors in dealing with any tax.  In the matter of this motor part duty, there is an amount of friction, delay and book-keeping that makes the tax a disadvantageous one to the community, whatever yield it might give to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to another duty that is included in this omnibus resolution&mdash; the duty on musical instruments.  I raised this last year.  That again is not a protective tax to any serious extent. The making of the musical instruments that are most commonly used, such as the piano, violin, and so on, is a trade requiring very highly-skilled workmen, many of whom have adopted it as a hereditary trade, who are not to be found in this country and whom we are not likely to find in this country.  It is, in a sense, as the Minister says, a luxury tax, but it is also a tax on education.  Music plays a part &mdash;I believe an increasing part&mdash;in education. You are taxing the raw material <Col N="59" /> of education when you tax musical instruments.  Apart from that, taking any luxury tax, you must take the question of whether the trade can bear the tax or not.  I would say that possibly a 10 per cent. tax on musical instruments would be justifiable, but I believe that the 33? per cent. is killing the trade at the moment.  There are those in the Dáil who can speak with greater knowledge, but we do not want to knock out any trade or industry, even if it is an importing industry, which at present employs labour and spends money in the State.  We do not want to deprive the citizens of the amenities and conveniences of life.  I do urge the Minister to inquire into this duty on musical instruments and see, not only whether it is justified or not, but whether its maintenance at the present level is justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputies Redmond and Cooper in their objections to this resolution.  On the introduction of last year's Budget I also raised the point with regard to this resolution, with particular reference to the duty on imported motor cars.  I do not agree with the Minister that this is a luxury tax.  In my opinion it is not a luxury tax.  It is common knowledge that motor cars are now a necessity and not a luxury.  That applies particularly to this country because the cars which are commonly used are the cheaper cars, very often of the American type.  If the Minister wants to reach the luxury cars he can come at the owners by placing a tax on cars above a certain value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one very strong objection to this tax; that it would interfere with the tourist traffic.  The tourist traffic depends almost entirely on the availability of motor cars.  The cost of motors being 33? per cent. above American prices and 22½ per cent. above English prices, together with the high annual duty, on top of the cost of upkeep, makes the cost of hiring motor cars at present almost prohibitive.  It would be very much to the interests of the State, and helpful to the endeavour which is being made to promote the tourist traffic, if this duty were wiped out.  It does, I believe, act to a certain <Col N="60" /> extent as a protection.  I believe it protects the Ford motor car industry here, but I believe a Ford motor car produced in the Saorstát is being sold at a price practically equal to the English price, plus the protective duty.  So I have been informed.  That is an indication of what we get from the promises sometimes made by manufacturers, that if they get protection they will produce an article not dearer than a similar article made outside the country.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that this tax was originally introduced in England purely as a temporary measure. My memory differs from that of the Deputies who have spoken.  My recollection is that this duty was introduced for the purpose of saving shipping space, as motor cars and such bulky articles were taking up much more shipping space than the Government thought advisable, in view of the urgent necessity of having all available space for food and other necessary products.</P>
    <P>I do not object to some of the articles mentioned in this resolution being taxed.  I see no great objection to taxing cinema films, but it is a mistake to tax musical instruments.  They are, perhaps, articles of amusement, but they are certainly very necessary. We have foreign melodeons, foreign tin whistles, and things of that kind being taxed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">

      <P>Melodeons are not free of duty.  If the Minister travels to some parts of the country on Sunday afternoons or evenings he will find that foreign melodeons are an article of necessity, as well as luxury.  With regard to the motor parts, I also took exception to that tax last year, and I made a suggestion to the Minister, which I think he considered, but finally said was not feasible: that a tax should not be placed on any article imported of a lesser value than £1.  The reason for that is, not because of the duty, which is not perhaps so great, but because <Col N="61" /> of the obstruction which takes place in the importing of small parts. If anybody is the possessor of a motor bicycle and something goes wrong with the gear box or some other part of it, he has to send away for the part either directly or through an agent.  Owing to the Customs difficulties&mdash;I do not say the obstruction of the Customs, because I believe the Customs people are doing their work very well now&mdash;but because of the difficulties which are between him and the manufacturer, he finds that his machine is laid up for at least three weeks and sometimes longer. I think it would be well worth the Minister's while to consider the saving in time, patience, and even in temper, which would result from the removal of this tax.  If sufficient thought is given to the matter, some method could be devised whereby the small parts required for repairs to motors would be allowed in free.  I think the Minister could easily avoid the wholesale importation of small parts with the idea of assembling machines in this country.</P>

      <P>With regard to the tax on cinematograph films, I want to ask the Minister if films for educational purposes are brought into the country to any extent, and if the tax has any detrimental effect on their importation? I do not know much about the matter, but I think that we must look forward and see to it that the cinema, as well as providing amusement for the people in the cities and towns, can be utilised by the people of the country and perhaps, in the rural districts, in schools, for educational purposes.  I think Deputies will agree that the rural inhabitants of this country can learn a good deal from the work and the methods of other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the urban dwellers can do likewise.  If, at the moment, films for educational purposes are subjected to the same tax as, say, films depicting the doings of &ldquo;The Thief of Bagdad,&rdquo; then I am afraid encouragement is not given to those who would seek to teach the people by means of educational films.  I think the Minister should take this matter into account, if he has not done so, so that the people generally might learn from the methods of the peoples of other countries and benefit <Col N="62" /> accordingly.  Such opportunities are not available at present and I think it would be very valuable if they were provided.  My attention was called to this matter some time ago by people who thought to avail of these films for educational purposes, but who found considerable difficulty in doing so because of the tax.  I would like the Minister to say that films used for educational purposes can be brought into the Saorstát free of tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisMcCullough" hpid="Mr. McCULLOUGH Mr. McCULLOUGH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCULLOUGH</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with considerable amazement that I learned from the Minister's speech to-day that it is proposed to continue the duty at the very high figure imposed on musical instruments.  I am aware that the Minister has been supplied with a good deal of material from the small number of persons engaged in this business, in which they point out the very great disadvantage under which they labour as a result of the rate of duty charged.  I am rather loath to speak of this matter, as it affects my personal business, but I think it is also one of general interest on which strong representations should be made to the Dáil, with a view to getting the Minister to reconsider the attitude he has taken up with regard to the duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the articles to which the duty applies were luxuries.  Undoubtedly music is a luxury.  It is a luxury in so far as life could go on without it, but we are a civilised people, I hope, and no one will deny that music is one of the amenities of life in modern civilisation. Surely it is not the intention of the Minister to withdraw from the ordinary affairs of life those things which make it sweeter and pleasanter. While music can be considered a luxury, in the sense that it is not an entire essential of life, I think it can be maintained that it is essential for the ordinary, easy progress of life and for the amenities of life in the ordinary everyday affairs of the people.  I think its influence in this country has been for good.  The fact, if I may mention it, that our national emblem, up to recently, was a musical instrument, shows that it has some standing in tradition in this respect.  I only mention this because I think even the Minister <Col N="63" /> will not deny that music has become an essential of life to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>In addition music has become an essential part of the education in the country.  If it has not, why does the Minister provide the Minister for Education in the Saorstát with money for the teaching and carrying on of musical programmes in the schools?  Money is provided by the Dáil and administered by the Department of Education for teaching music to our children.  It seems to me a rather stupid proceeding to provide money for the musical education of the people while making it almost impossible for them to secure the means by which they can put into practice the teaching they have obtained.</P>
    <P>I do not think it can be argued, even by the Minister, that this duty of 33? per cent. on musical instruments is in any sense a protective duty.  Deputy Cooper mentioned that drums were made in the Minister's constituency.  I say, if they are, they are not made in sufficient quantities to be a menace to the drum makers of England.  They are only a drop in the ocean of the number of musical instruments of that kind that are imported.  Even if the duty was protective, I hold it is so exorbitant and high that it fails to serve its purpose. The manufacture of musical instruments such as pianos, band instruments, gramophones, melodeons, that we find throughout the country, has become a very highly specialised industry requiring tradition and long training.  As Deputy Cooper said, that training has been handed down in families.  In time we could build up a musical manufacturing industry in this country, but it would be a growth of years.  I hold, and I venture to think that I have some expert knowledge in this matter, that 33? per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> duty in the meantime is not a help, but rather a hindrance to the growth of that industry.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to give evidence before the Fiscal Commission that was set up by the Minister some few years ago, and I think if the Minister had perused the evidence, he would have been interested, and would have found <Col N="64" /> sufficient data to convince him that it was not possible by a tariff such as has been erected against musical instruments to assist the manufacture of musical instruments in this country in a hurry.  That can only be done in the progress of years, and by slow growth. A smaller duty would serve the purpose equally well.  This duty is an inheritance of our Government from the English Government.  It was put on in England, Deputy Heffernan suggested, to help to save shipping space.  I understand it was put on to help industries that existed in England, and to prevent dumping by foreign manufacturers, because at that time the currency of the Continent had more or less collapsed, and the manufacturers were able to get instruments into England, and sell them in England at prices with which the English manufacturers could not compete. That, I think, was the origin of the McKenna duties.</P>
    <P>They served their purpose in so far as they gave the English musical instrument manufacturers a breathing space, or time to reorganise their industry. At the present moment, when the German currency has been stabilised, and is now on the dollar basis, and when the English pound sterling is not up to full standard, on the basis of the Rentenmark the German musical instrument manufacturers cannot compete with the English manufacturers on their own ground.  Therefore the English statesmen, with a good deal of wisdom, have removed those duties from England.  Owing to the large circulation of the English daily papers in this country, our public read, from day to day, advertisements of low-priced musical instruments which they cannot obtain in this country, owing to the high import duties.  The duty itself is thirty-three and one-third per cent. <i>ad valorem.</i>  It is not a protective duty and is certainly an unfair one.  I do not think it is fair to ask the struggling father of a family, who is trying to educate his children in the better and more artistic side of life and is perhaps giving them some musical education, to purchase musical instruments and pay one-third of the very high cost of those instruments as a tax to the revenue.  I do not think it is fair, and it is certainly <Col N="65" /> putting an undue burden on one portion of the population.  I think if we are going to have any musical education in the country or any development of musical knowledge&mdash;the Government have not been behind in this particular matter in so far as they have, under their own auspices, one of the finest musical combinations probably in the world&mdash;and if we are going to develop it on proper lines, it would not be too much to ask the Minister to reduce the duty, which is a heavy incubus on the sale of manufactured musical instruments, from thirty-three and one-third per cent.  I think it is too heavy a burden to ask a man to bear.  Were musical instruments all instruments which could be bought at a few shillings the thirty-three and a third per cent. might not be a big consideration, but in view of the fact that the very cheapest piano manufactured costs a dealer anything around £40 to £50, and that on that he has to pay one-third <i>ad valorem</i> duty, which must necessarily be handed on to the purchaser&mdash;probably with a little addition in respect of his capital investment&mdash;it is asking the purchaser, the hard-working father of a family or the father of a family who puts his children to music as a profession, too much to pay this heavy amount as a tax to the revenue.  That is the point of view of the ordinary member of the public.</P>
    <P>With greater reluctance I pass on to the point of view of those who are handling those instruments as a matter of trade.  I am reluctant to let my personal interests interfere with my public duties.  I have submitted to the Minister a memorandum covering those points, and I had hoped he would have given it more favourable consideration. It has to be remembered that the largest part of the musical instruments imported into Ireland comes from the Continent.  Before the war the dealer could purchase at all times on very favourable credit terms.  He could purchase any of his requirements on a three or a six months' bill, which gave him an opportunity to dispose of the goods before he was called upon to pay for them.  The largest distributing houses which were spread over England and Ireland educated the public <Col N="66" /> into this credit system whereby musical instruments of high value were sold on long deferred methods of payment enabling the wage-earning and the smaller salaried class to procure musical instruments.  That has all gone by the board.  Owing to the financial conditions in Europe to-day you cannot buy even from the largest or wealthiest of the manufacturers of musical instruments on any other terms except cash with order or cash against documents, which means that you must pay at the port on arrival.  You have to pay the invoice price to your bankers or the exporter's bankers before you release the musical instruments.  From no source outside England can he buy musical instruments on any other basis, and England is not by any means the largest source of supply for us.  Added to this, the purchaser has to pay one-third on the invoice price, not on the invoice price alone, but the invoice price plus the carriage and plus all port dues.  On that the ad valorem duty is struck.  It does not need a great deal of knowledge of business to realise that you cannot change the public mind very quickly.  The public were trained to this method of purchasing by long terms of credit.  They cannot be easily changed, especially in view of the fact that the first cost of musical instruments to the dealer has risen by more than 100 per cent. on the pre-war value.  Consequently the purchaser has to pay a much higher price and has to look for credit terms to enable him to purchase.  It does not need a great deal of business knowledge to realise how difficult it is for any trader to carry on under those conditions. I put it to the Minister that the musical trade in the Saorstát is not so extensive that it can be wisely embarrassed in business.  The total number of musical instrument dealers of any standing in the country could be counted on the fingers of one hand easily.  The trade submitted to the Minister here figures showing the actual reduction in the number of instruments imported and consequently in the number they sold.  These showed that they had gone down by half.  I think that should be sufficient to induce the Minister to consider his decision <Col N="67" /> in this matter.  The difficulties have become so enormous that practically every house in the trade&mdash;some of them have offered the Minister to submit their books for inspection&mdash; have found business becoming more and more difficult because they cannot capitalise owing to the enormous increase in first cost, and in the credit terms used in the disposal of the instruments. I put this to the Minister in the sense of an appeal&mdash;that it is an injustice to the small number of traders involved.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Minister that this is a trade of some repute and standing, that the business places of those engaged in it are located in the best parts of the cities and towns, that they pay very high rates and taxes and, in the sense of appeal, I would say to the Minister that their views, when put reasonably before him, should receive his consideration.  They are prepared to submit any evidence required in order to support their arguments. They should not be crushed out of business, which is really what will happen owing to the way in which they are embarrassed and owing to the difficulty of financing their business.</P>
    <P>I would put another point of view to the Minister&mdash;the point of view dealing with revenue.  I venture to say that the total revenue obtained from this tax is not of sufficient importance to justify the Minister in its rigorous continuance.  The total revenue obtained from all duties under this comprehensive resolution will amount to £370,000.  Of that, we are informed by the Minister that he expects that motors will bring in £300,000, leaving a net balance to cover all the other items in the resolution of £70,000.  I may not have those figures correctly, but, if I am wrong, the Minister will set me right.  I put it to the Minister that the small proportion of that £70,000 represented by duty on musical instruments does not justify him in continuing the embarrassingly high duties which at present obtain.  I hold, further, that if the duty were reduced to a reasonable figure&mdash;I understand the trade are prepared to accept, say, <Col N="68" /> 20 per cent. ad valorem&mdash;the increased sales which would take place, in meeting the demand that is there, would safeguard the revenue against loss. Rather would he gain in collectible revenue by the change.  At present the people cannot rise to the level of the retail charges.  I would ask him to compare the figures, in round numbers, of importation last year, as compared with that of the previous year. I think he will find that there is a reduction of not less than one-third.  At least it is the experience of those in the trade&mdash;I have had figures sent me &mdash;that sales of new instruments have gone down by, at least, one-third. Whatever increase in trade they have is in second-hand instruments, which pay no duty.  If the duty were reduced the revenue would not be less, and it would probably be more than it is under this prohibitive duty of 33? per cent.  With regard to the question of values, it is true to say that the lowest-priced German piano has gone up since the 1st January of last year by £8, and in some cases by £9&mdash;that is the very lowest-priced German piano&mdash;on which a duty of £3 or more is payable.  That makes a difference of £11 or £12.  The Minister may have examined the figures in money values and, with this increased price, that would give him a wrong impression.</P>
    <P>I suggest that he should rather examine the figures relating to the number of instruments imported.  The effect of this duty is to make the traders' position practically impossible.  I can say sincerely, from my own experience &mdash;and I venture to hope that my words will have some attention paid to them&mdash; that the trade has been practically brought to a standstill.  The purchase of new musical instruments of high value&mdash;by that, I mean pianos&mdash;has practically stopped because of this high duty.  The trade does not comprise many people but it employs a number of highly-skilled persons, and pays high wages and high rates.  I would, in the sense of appeal, ask the Minister to give some consideration to this question and to give those interested in the trade some hope that he will reconsider and reduce the duties to a reasonable figure, <Col N="69" /> at least to 20 per cent.  Although the traders have already paid duty on their present valuable stocks, they are prepared to drop that in order to get business moving again.  Those engaged in the trade are, of course, affected by the general economic condition of the country, and I would ask the Minister to give their position as serious consideration as possible and reduce the duty of 20 per cent. approximately.</P>

      <P>I also disagree with this tax on musical instruments.  When you put a tax on musical instruments, you put a tax on music.  We all know that the Irish are a musical people. Just take the connection between music and education.  For instance, take the gramophone in a country house.  I hold it is a source of education to the youth of that house.  They can listen to John McCormack or they can be talking Scotch to Harry Lauder if they like. They can listen to all the great singers and to all the great orators&mdash;that is, if they are not privileged to come here. What a grand thing it is in a village to have a nice band.  In the evenings, now that we have Summer Time, and an extra hour of daylight, they can assemble after tea and go out for a march two or three miles in the country.  Half the bands are smashed now, and how disappointed the bandsmen will be when they cannot buy musical instruments on account of the tax.  A few months ago if a big meeting were called by Ministers, how glorious they would feel when they would hear the music along O'Connell Street and see the big crowd following.  At that time, you could not get one of them to say the word &ldquo;tax&rdquo; for the world.  When he would see them coming along he would know that was not the time to put a tax on.  He would be in the height of his glory.  There are a great many other advantages derived from music in this country.</P>

      <P>It keeps them out of publichouses and takes them out to dances.  But, now, dances are condemned, too&mdash;and some of them are condemned rightly.  I was amazed to-day to find that there was not a tax on &ldquo;jazzing.&rdquo;  It was the <Col N="70" /> only thing left out.  No matter where you go, you are not fully equipped without music.  For instance, if you go to church on Sunday you have beautiful music.  You can pray twice as well as a result of that, and with one twist of the organ you fancy you can see the Promised Land.  I appeal to the Minister for Finance not to put a tax on those musical instruments. There are lots of things he can tax besides musical instruments.  I would not be in order in saying now that he should tax flour and allow wheat in, and I will hold over my remarks until the next day.</P>

      <P>I want to endorse the view expressed by Deputy Baxter with regard to educational films.  I think the amount likely to be sacrificed by giving a preference in respect of films of an educational character would not be very great, and machinery is available for making differentiation, owing to the fact that there is a censorship at the present time.  There is no doubt that if there were a distinct preference, in respect of tax, given to films which the censor decided were of an educational class, it would change the character of the shows to a very considerable extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The story was told about 18 months ago, I think, when the cinema people were up in arms, that educational films were at a discount, and that the public were not at all anxious to enjoy them. I think the fact was that they were more prejudicial to the exhibitor somehow or other.  He thought it was far more attractive to put on films of a sensational, rather than of an educational, character.  I think if they found that it was possible to get in films at a little lower rate of tax which the censor was prepared to certify were of an educational character, we should then have a change in the general atmosphere of the cinema house.  I support very heartily the Deputy who raised this matter in his view respecting a preference for educational films. There is, of course, the other consideration, that cinematographic shows might be used directly and avowedly for the purpose of education in the schools to illustrate lectures.  That should be definitely encouraged and not discouraged. <Col N="71" /> If it could be possible to abolish the tax entirely on educational films, it would, I suggest, be of the greatest possible advantage.  I think the cost to the revenue would be so slight that the education would be bought at a very cheap rate indeed.</P>

      <P>I am not going to follow Deputies into the musical end of the debate, because I think the points from that angle have been put very well already.  With regard to the tax on motor cars and on motor parts, I have a few words to say.  The argument that a motor car is a luxury could not, I think, be seriously advanced at the present time by anyone laying a claim to sanity.  It enters so much, as a necessity, into the life of the community, and occupies such a useful place as regards the traffic of the country, that I do not think anyone could say, except perhaps by way of a joke, that it was a luxury.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's requirements do not take him far, except to the Dáil.  I congratulate him on not having any expenses worth speaking about.  If this tax was designed to help or protect an existing industry, we could understand it, but it is nothing of the sort.  It is alleged, of course, that there is a car manufactured or assembled in Ireland.  As to how far that is true, or whether it deserves to be called a car, I will not say.  As regards the tax on motor parts, those engaged in the trade and those who own cars and who have had experience in trying to get parts cleared by the Customs authorities at the port, will I am sure, assent to the proposition that it is one that could only have been devised by the Spanish Inquisition.  As far as the owners of cars and those engaged in the trade are concerned, this tax on motor parts is really one of the greatest tortures that could possibly be imagined.  It takes days, by sending messengers up and down to the ports, to get small parts cleared.  That is all very well, of course, for the trader carrying on business in the city of <Col N="72" /> Dublin.  He happens to be near the port, and he can engage two or three messengers for that particular work. In the end, of course, it is the unfortunate owner of a car who has to pay for all that expense incurred by the trader.</P>
      <P>The position is much worse in the country where the trader lives a long distance from the port.  Sometimes he cannot get small parts cleared at the port unless he sends a special messenger up to Dublin.  In many cases these small parts are held at the port by the Customs' authorities for weeks and weeks.  I think a continuance of this tax could only be advocated by someone who wants to exasperate the people. It is a tax that brings in very little money.  The expenses incurred in the collection of it are far more than the actual duties which have to be paid on the small parts that come in.  If the Minister cannot see his way to abolish the tax on motor cars, I, at least, would appeal to him, in all seriousness, to abolish this tax on motor parts.  As a matter of fact, the cars which require new parts or replacements are mostly old cars that were purchased at a time when there was no such tax as the one we are now discussing.  The majority of these cars are old models which are no longer on the market, and parts for them are not kept in stock.  Therefore, when new parts are required for them they have to be manufactured.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister himself is the owner of an old car, but I think I could not wish him anything more annoying than to be such an owner, or to be in the position of trying to get parts for it cleared at the ports. I am sure that if he had such an experience it would change his views altogether on this matter.  In view of the small amount of money which this tax on motor parts brings in, and of the annoyance and worry caused to the owners of cars, I hope the Minister will see his way to abolish it altogether.  To say that a new car can be got together by the importation of parts is simply ridiculous.  A statement of that kind could only be put forward as a joke, and not as a sensible argument.  I would again appeal to the Minister to give his serious consideration to the points which I have put before him.</P>

      <P>I would like to add a few words to what Deputy Gorey has said as regards the trouble that arises from the tax on motor parts.  A great effort is now being made in the Free State to encourage a large number of people from other countries to visit this country of ours during the coming summer. It is also urged that they should bring their motor cars with them in order that they may thoroughly explore our scenery.  With that view, I think we shall all agree, and I am sure Deputies here would be very anxious to do everything to encourage a large number of tourists to visit this country.  What would be the result if we pass this resolution? Let us look at it as practical men.  A number of people will bring their cars as a result of the efforts that have been made to induce them to do so.  The roads, unfortunately, as some of us know, who do a little motoring in distant parts of Ireland, are not of an ideal character at the moment.  A number of those motorists with cars in the habit of running on roads in England and Scotland, if they try to carry out, exactly, the same practice on our roads, will find that the cars will not withstand such work on the Irish roads as they would on the English roads. And they will find themselves stranded possibly for parts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tax on these parts, I am quite sure, instead of being a source of revenue to the State, is rather a charge of a different character, because I am quite satisfied that from the number of these parts that come through, the tax does not pay for the time taken up by the officials who are engaged in its collection; so that, from the point of view of revenue, the tax, on these parts, does not contribute at all sufficient to pay the charges incurred by the State in connection with them.  If these taxes are not a source of revenue, what is the idea of keeping them on?  Take the unfortunate tourist who suffers a break-down, as not at all unusual with tourists.  He will find it takes at least ten days before he will be able to get in the new part, and that will be the minimum time required to get in a new part.  If a motor tourist in Connemara has a break-down and wants a part he will wire across to England for <Col N="74" /> it.  He gets a wire back saying the part has been shipped, but it will take another two or three weeks to get it through the Customs.  What will a tourist, with that experience, do?  He will clear out of the country, immediately, and go away with a very bad impression.  He will probably stop a number of other visitors coming here. This kind of thing will produce a very bad effect, and will do an immense amount of injury to the tourist traffic of the country.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the matter of the motor tax from that aspect.  I have had some other aspects of the question brought before me during the last few days.  If you order a motor car-replacement part from the other side, when it comes here you have to pay duty on it.  But the order may not have been carried out in accordance with instructions, and the part does not fit, and has to be returned.  In that case there is no refund of the duty.  No matter what aspect you take of this duty it seems to be framed in such a way as to cause irritation to those engaged in the trade rather than to encourage revenue.  From all these sides I urge that in the national interest the Minister should seriously consider the removal of this tax on motor parts.</P>
    <P>With regard to other taxes, I do not want to take up the time of the Dáil, but I am quite with what Deputy Baxter said about the removal of the tax on films of an educational character.  I am quite satisfied that it will be necessary in the near future to make use of the cinema-house as part of our educational system, and, in view of that development, I think it would be exceedingly wise for the Minister to consider, in conjunction with the Minister for Education, whether it would not be desirable to remove the tax entirely upon films of an educational character. Further, at a later date, I would urge that it should be made compulsory on all cinemas that films of an educational character should occupy a certain portion of the time of all performances. Otherwise the cinemas are going to do an immense amount of harm instead of an immense amount of good in the country.</P>

      <P>All that has to be said in connection with these duties is this: I suppose all taxation is evil; but we have to have some taxation, and when we are reducing taxation it is a question as to where we will give the reduction.  You could not remit these particular duties without affecting remissions proposed elsewhere or putting on other duties.  It does seem to me that, on the whole, the articles affected by these duties are good subjects of taxation.  I never said, or did not intend to say at any rate, that motors are luxuries.  There is no doubt that the luxury element does come in.  I know various people who own motor cars.  I know people who bought motor cars, and I do not know anybody who uses his motor car solely for business.  There are very few who buy cars who do not use them for pleasure jaunts.  Very often people who do use their cars a little for business, use them more for convenience in pleasure expeditions. The man who goes into town in the morning in a car for business could just as well go in in the train.  But possibly he wants to stay late at night, and it is very convenient for him to have the car to travel in and out with.  There is certainly that element to be considered. A large proportion of the cars that pay tax are, I should say, cars bought partially for pleasure, and to that extent I think the tax can be said to be a good tax, so far as any tax is good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is some element of protection in this tax.  I do not know what will be the future of the Ford industry in Cork.  I do say that it is of some benefit to them.  I also say that part of the reason of the Ford car being dearer here than it is outside is because a certain proportion of the parts is imported and those parts are not made in Cork.  They pay  and the price of <Col N="76" /> the cars as they are sold here does contain some proportion of duty.  It is not simply that Fords at Cork pocket the whole of the duty and sell their car here for the same price as that at which they sell it outside.  I do not know the details of the accounting, but I do know there is some element of duty in the price of the Ford car as sold here.</P>
    <P>We have thought over the question of letting parts in, duty free, and we have come to the conclusion that if we were to do that it would be better to remit the duty altogether.  At present, including the duty on parts imported by Fords, the receipts from the duty on parts is nearly £100,000, as against £200,000 received from the duty on cars.  I have no doubt if we relieved parts of duty, the number of separate parts that would be imported would increase very considerably; but there will always be the difficulty of deciding when you have a car and when you have simply a number of parts.  In general, the position is such that probably the duty would be halved; perhaps we would get less than one-half of the present duty if we remitted or abolished the tax on parts.  Our feeling about the matter is that if we can do anything, and if we feel at any time that we ought to do anything, it ought to be in the nature of an entire abolition of the duty.</P>

      <P>If you make distinctions of that sort, you do not hasten the getting of goods through the Customs. The more fine distinctions you draw, the more investigations have to be undertaken, and the longer delay there is likely to be.  Deputies here have complained that the delay involved in the Customs weighed more with them than the actual duty paid. Deputy McCullough referred to the musical instrument trade.  I think he admits that it is very largely a luxury trade.  He says it cannot bear the tax, and he suggests that if that duty were decreased imports would go up.  If I could be convinced that imports would go up I would be very much influenced <Col N="77" /> indeed.  After all, we are really imposing these taxes for revenue, and if we are going to get more revenue by a remission of duty, that would be what we desire.</P>
      <P>I do not want to say anything against the argument put forward about the struggling father of a family buying musical instruments for his children.  I do think that most of the neighbours of the struggling father would be very annoyed if any more musical instruments were got.  Houses engaged in the musical instrument trade may be finding it difficult to carry on, but so have many other houses been finding it difficult to carry on.  Where you have agricultural depression and unemployment, such as we have had, all sorts of houses are affected.  In such circumstances the demand for all sorts of goods tends to fall off.  Probably a trade like the musical trade&mdash;a trade which is dealing with non-necessities&mdash;feels that dulness more quickly and more keenly.  I would suggest to the Deputy that possibly even a shilling remission on income tax may have some effect in reviving that particular trade.  I would also suggest that probably part of the cause of dulness is the acquiring of wireless sets by people.  Possibly when we come along to establish our broadcasting station here, no remission of duty would enable the trade to pick up. However, the point that I would be glad, at a later stage, to hear more from him on, and to consider with him, would be the point of increases of imports and increases of revenue as a result of remission of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of educational films is one that I think I can promise to consider very sympathetically.  I have not so far looked into the matter, but I should say, just speaking on the matter for the first time, that the revenue involved would be very slight indeed. The number of educational films that would be brought in, to the exclusion of other films, would be small and I do not think there would be much loss of revenue there, and before the later stages of the Bill come on, I would promise to consider that as closely as possible and to consider it sympathetically. The resolution which is now submitted involves £370,000 of revenue. <Col N="78" /> We cannot lose that revenue without getting something else, because in the matter of the reduction of taxation perhaps we have really gone to the very limit.  We have gone as far as we possibly could go, in the matter of revenue losses through reduction.  We could not go further.  If we were not to have this tax, or if we were to have any modification of these taxes that would cause any appreciable loss of revenue, we would have to take some other steps to make it up.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in addition to the Customs duty imposed by Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1924 (No. 27 of 1924), a customs duty of an amount equal to ten per cent. of the value of the article shall be charged, levied, and paid on all toilet (including shaving) soaps, soap powders, and soap substitutes imported into Saorstát Éireann on or after the 24th day of April, 1925.</P>
      <P>It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1913.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to this briefly in my general statement.  We are, as I said, satisfied that this particular alteration of the tax will enable the industry to get on its feet here.  There is not very much, from the point of view of profit, in the manufacture of common soap.  The end of the business that pays and the end of the business that will cause the manufacture of the remaining classes of the article to be carried on, is the part concerned with toilet soap and shaving soaps.  If we have these we will have the manufacture of the common soap.  On the other hand, if we have only a duty at the rate of ten per cent. we will probably go on simply having a manufacture of the common soap here.  The position will be that the tax to maintain the manufacture of the common soap and to prevent its being again threatened by imports <Col N="79" /> would have to be made practically permanent.</P>
    <P>There is another advantage in including these toilet articles.  That is, we will have employment given to young chemists from our Universities.  We will have some of the men we are training employed in their own country on the scientific side of industry, and we believe that that employment of some of our young University men on the scientific side of industry will have a very tonic effect generally, and may lead to improvement of standards in quite other lines of manufacture than the particular lines we are dealing with now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to remind the Dáil that this is a leap in the dark.  It is an inevitable consequence of protection that every industry protected comes along and says it has not got enough protection, and that an additional 10 or 20 per cent. is needed to put it on its legs.  We are asked to make this increase of duty in connection with the one industry for which we have no data as to the effect of the duty imposed last year&mdash;absolutely no data of any kind.  The Minister himself in his speech says that the effect of the duty on soap and candles cannot be judged in consequence of the forestalling that took place.  That is what we told him last year, and then he did not believe us. I cannot find the reference now, but I have a vivid recollection of Deputy Johnson urging on the Minister that the delay in imposing duty on soap and candles was producing forestalling in certain imports and the Minister saying that a certain amount was taking place but that it was not anything very serious.  Deputy Johnson invited the Minister to walk down the quays, and the Minister said that he would not do that.  I think I am accurate in that.  I always like to quote my references if I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the soap duty, I want to quote a couple of points.  The Minister, when he introduced the 10 per cent. duty, said that &ldquo;if manufacturers and workers are prepared to give a fair deal to the general public, <Col N="80" /> practically all the soap and candles required in the Saorstát should be supplied from home factories without any added cost to the consumer.  The value of these commodities imported annually is something between £340,000 and £350,000.&rdquo;  That is the Minister's prophecy.</P>
    <P>My prophecy made later on in the same debate was: &ldquo;As a result of the postponing of the coming into force of this duty until the 1st July, I can prophesy that the Minister will get no revenue at all.&rdquo;  I gather that he has not, because he has not told us. &ldquo;There is ample time between now and the 1st July for the retailers of this country to import the whole of the soap that is needed for the next twelve months and to store it here.  But though the State will get no revenue and the manufacturers will get no protection, the retailers will put up the price.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a false prophet there.  I then urged the Minister to postpone putting on the duty until the machinery was ready.  What are the facts?  The Minister says that the average import of soap and candles was £350,000, whereas last year, according to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, it was £674,000, or almost double what the Minister believed. We have no data or facts to go on in dealing with this resolution.  The Minister told us that owing to forestalling he cannot tell the effect of the duties.  He has proved to be 100 per cent. out in his estimate of the total trade, and we have no knowledge of any extension in the soap industry beyond the statement of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, in Cork, that the foundations of a new soap factory are being laid.  Yet we are asked to double this duty.  I say that this is an illustration of the dangers of Protection. I am not going to take up the time of the Dáil, or to challenge a division, but I think that this is a very important matter and should be carefully considered before we decide to increase the duty on this substance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we cannot <Col N="81" /> consider this matter without bearing in mind the fact that the greater part of the soap factories in the Saorstát belongs to the firm of Lever Brothers, and it is very largely in their hands, whether they will supply from their English factories or from their Irish factories. The 10 per cent. has not been sufficient, as I gather, to induce them to put their Irish factory on the production of soap for the Irish trade.  I think that the proposition in the resolution is justified.  I think the fact that a Deputy has quoted £600,000 as being the amount of soap imported is at least a very important item of information which goes far to justify the proposition in the resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to raise a question which I raised last year.  I am not sure what answer was given to me, but I imagine there was some doubt as to whether the duty was paid on the value of the soap, or upon the value of the parcel of soap that was imported.  I think I quoted a case where it was shown in a trade journal, when advocating that certain Canadian manufacturers of shaving soap should try and capture the English market some years ago, and when a detailed costings analysis was given, that the retail price was something like 1/3, and that the freight, carriage, retail profits, etc., were so much, while the advertising, packing, printing and wrappers were so much, but the price of the soap itself was 1½d., while the balance of the 1/3 was for things other than soap.  We know that a great deal of toilet and shaving soap is sold in fancy packages, and I am curious to know whether it is the intention to charge this extra ten per cent. on the value of the soap, or on the value of the article which is sold to the customer in the shape of soap, duly wrapped and packed.  I think, if it is not the latter, that it will help to encourage the sending of soap in one parcel and the wrappers in another, but that, at any rate, would lead to a few people being engaged in the occupation of putting soap into wrappers, wrappers into boxes, and so on.  That brings me to a question that really affects not merely soap but the whole financial proposition as regards the tariffs on imports.  It is as to the <Col N="82" /> method of checking the value of the articles imported.  Most of us are new to the experience of ad valorem duties, and it will be some satisfaction to know that there is a real check upon the price, or rather upon the value, that is declared, and that the revenue is getting the full value of the duty.  For instance, it is suggested to me, that boots are imported, the declared value of which is very much lower indeed than the price which is actually being paid by the wholesale importer, and while you are supposed to be getting fifteen per cent. ad valorem&mdash;three shillings on a pair of boots worth £1&mdash; I would like to have some information from the Minister as to how that value is checked.  It will come on this particular proposition as well as on any other, in as much as soap may be valued at a certain price, and it may be found that the purchaser on this side of the water is actually paying a much higher price than that he is being charged on the invoice.  Perhaps the Minister would find an opportunity to tell us the method by which the <i>ad valorem</i> duty is being checked, being quite sure that it is <i>ad valorem.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, in approaching this question of tariffs on different articles, the hesitancy of the Minister has led him into some difficulties, and we have one of these difficulties before us.  Before the question of a tariff on any particular commodity is brought before the Dáil.  I think it ought to be carefully inquired into by the Department concerned, and if the Minister makes up his mind that by imposing a tariff his object would be to encourage employment rather than to obtain revenue, he ought to take drastic steps along lines which will carry out his intention.  In a country such as this, where our basic industry, on which the welfare of the country entirely depends, is agriculture, which depends for its success on its ability to meet traders from elsewhere in the great market in the adjoining country, I say that we ought to consider the question of tariffs very carefully, and only bring forward tariffs in cases where we are satisfied that the commodity can be produced in this country and <Col N="83" /> give employment here, and be sold at a price not higher than that at which it is being sold at the moment.  If I might illustrate that point, I would refer to the tobacco industry.  There, as I previously pointed out, employment has been given to a large number of young people, a large amount of capital has been spent in this country, and we are paying nothing more to-day for that particular commodity produced by these factories than we were paying when these factories did not exist here, and when that particular item was imported.  We are, therefore, not penalised in any way, but, on the other hand, we have a great advantage in additional employment, and in the spending of a large amount of capital in the country.  If the Minister made up his mind that this is an item that could be manufactured here as cheaply as it is being sold, and, therefore, that it is an item which he should tax in order to provide employment at home, he should have made his tax very much higher.  That, to my mind, as I pointed out this time twelve months, was the mistake which he made in connection with the boot tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened in connection with the soap industry is that on the other side there were a very large number of manufacturers, and their Irish trade formed a very small portion of their output.  If they had to sell the particular quantity required to meet the Irish demand even at a loss it would have a very small effect on their profit.  That being so, it is obvious that if you want to stop that particular commodity coming in and ensure that it will be manufactured at home, the tax must be fairly heavy. Therefore, I would impress on the Minister in connection with these tariffs, if he is satisfied that the item is a suitable one from the point of view I have mentioned &mdash; because tariffs will want to be very cautiously used and carefully inquired into before being adopted&mdash;that he should not kill his effort by making the tariff a small one.  That, I think, has been the failure in many of his proposals, and I think that is true in this particular <Col N="84" /> case.  I have grave doubts, knowing the conditions of this particular trade, that the additional 10 per cent. proposed will be sufficient to ensure that this particular commodity will be manufactured in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that an amount of forestalling took place which I did not anticipate.  It was an amount of forestalling that the rate on the commodity did not justify.  It was due to a certain number of people losing their heads, and rushing in large quantities of soaps.  They have made no profits by the forestalling, and there has been no increase in the price of soap.  They simply have had large quantities of soaps on their hands with no advantage to themselves. They did, as I have said, forestall, and to that extent they prevented any increased employment in the soap industry here.  We still believe that the 10 per cent., when the quantities brought in by way of forestalling have been worked off, will give increased employment, and cause increased manufacture in common soap.  We have come to the conclusion that the better way of dealing with the matter is to put a higher tax on the finer ends with a view to removing in a reasonably short period the tax on common soap.  We would not be in favour of keeping the tax on it if the manufacturers did not rise to the occasion and equip themselves to manufacture the finer ends of the soap industry. I do not want at this stage to enter into the question of the boot tax, but I believe it is having its effect in the extensions which are taking place.  While there might be arguments for having it higher, the increased production we had in mind is being brought about with a fair amount of rapidity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson asked were we reasonably sure that we are getting the right value.  In many cases where we have no reason to suspect the genuineness of invoices, and we saw nothing in the behaviour of the particular trader or importer on previous occasions to make us suspicious, the invoices have been taken, but in other cases very close inquiries have been pursued before the <Col N="85" /> invoices were accepted, and even the question of the retail price at which the boots were afterwards sold has been examined.  In the case of house to house imports, a firm outside sending its goods to its own branches here, we cannot, of course, accept invoices, and in these cases there are long-drawn-out and careful inquiries made with a view to establishing that the alleged value of the boots was the real value.  There might be cases where this would escape us, but as our experience grows in the case of any particular class of goods, and where officers get more experienced in detecting tricks that may be resorted to, the administration will be tightened.</P>

    <Title>CUSTOMS RESOLUTIONS. - RESOLUTION No. 6.&mdash;PERSONAL CLOTHING AND WEARING APPAREL.</Title>
    <P>(1)  That with the exceptions hereinafter mentioned, a customs duty of an amount equal to fifteen per cent. of the value of the article shall be charged, levied, and paid on all personal clothing and wearing apparel, whether completely or partially manufactured, and all component parts of personal clothing or wearing apparel, and all accessories of personal clothing or wearing apparel imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 25th day of April, 1925.</P>
    <P>(2)  That the duty mentioned in this Resolution shall not be charged or levied</P>
    <P>(a)  on boots or shoes (including slippers, goloshes, sandals and clogs), nor on any component parts or accessories thereof, nor</P>
    <P>(b)  on any accessory of personal clothing or wearing apparel imported separately from the clothing or apparel and made wholly or mainly of non-textile materials, nor</P>
    <P>(c)  on any article of a surgical or medical character and intended to be worn because of or as a preventive against or remedy for any physical ailment or defect.</P>
    <P>(3)  That whenever the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that any article of personal clothing or wearing <Col N="86" /> apparel is imported for use exclusively in a stage play or other dramatic or musical representation or performance, they may, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, permit such article to be imported without payment of the duty mentioned in this Resolution.</P>
    <P>(4)  That whenever the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that any partially manufactured article of personal clothing or wearing apparel is imported for further manufacture and subsequent exportation, they may, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, permit such article to be imported without payment of the duty mentioned in this Resolution.</P>
    <P>(5)  That for the purposes of this Resolution the expression &ldquo;wearing apparel&rdquo; shall include pocket handkerchiefs and umbrellas.</P>
    <P>This resolution proposes a duty on personal clothing and wearing apparel. Deputies will see that we exclude from the scope of the duty boots and shoes, which we keep as a separate duty, and not incorporating it in this particular one.  We also except certain articles like studs, whether diamond or articles of horn and bone, from the tax.  We exempt medical articles of any sort, and particular types of stockings and belts. We are also admitting clothing required for theatrical purposes.  We are giving power to admit any partially manufactured article that is to undergo a further process of manufacture and be re-exported.  The last section includes articles which would otherwise be border-line articles, and if charged might possibly be liable to dispute.  At a later stage, I am willing to hear any arguments from Deputies as to whether these two particular things should be included within the scope of the tax or excluded.  This is a tax that we believe will immediately give very considerable employment.  It embraces a very wide range of articles.  Many of them are actually manufactured to a greater or lesser extent in the Saorstát at present.  Others perhaps are not manufactured here, but they are of the type of goods that could be easily manufactured here.  As I have already said, <Col N="87" /> the equipment required for carrying on many of these apparel industries is not elaborate, though in many cases it may be moderately so.  We believe that the extension of employment as a result of this tax will be very great and rapid. I have had estimates as carefully prepared as they could be, but I hardly like to give them, because it is difficult to foresee the effects of a tax, but I have no hesitation in saying that thousands of people will be employed.  I believe that this is the sort of industry that should be carried on here as efficiently as it can be carried on anywhere else.  There are industries that we could never cause to take root here. There are industries dependent on very heavy consumption of coal, for instance. There are industries that could only be carried on in a country that has iron mines and coal fields, but these are a type of industry that could very well be carried on here.  Most of them, when the Shannon scheme gets going, would be independent of the use of coal.  In any case they are the type of industry that could be carried on here. We think it desirable to go over the whole range of them.  Some branches of the industry may develop rapidly, take root strongly, and become quite independent of any protection that may be given them.  Others may not develop, and the time will arrive, as in the case of all these tariffs, when a reconsideration will have to take place, when we may split the tariff, remitting part of it, continuing part of it, or reducing it.  Meantime we cannot see that any of these branches should be selected and others left out.  Some of these, which perhaps employ less people than others, are the very ones which might have the best prospects for the future.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would inform us whether this resolution covers the import of manufactured woollens, such as tweeds, cloths and other things.  If so, I think that there is a want in the specified articles.  We know very well that the woollen mills of the country, which some years ago reached a high state of finish and production, are suffering at the present day from mass production on the other side.  I know of nothing in the rural areas, where these mills are situated, which would give so much employment as they would, and add to the prosperity of their neighbourhood. I think it is only fair that a trade which was deliberately killed by Act of Parliament should now receive the assistance of legislation in restoring it to its real position.  From many points of view, the woollen trade is specially suited to this country. Woollen manufactures of all shades, and particularly the woollen tweeds and cloths made in our mills, are specially suited to this country.  I think the Minister would do well if he made the wording of this resolution read so that the effect of the resolution would mean a tariff upon imported tweeds and woollens.</P>

      <P>I do not propose at this stage to anticipate the general argument as to the effect of these new duties on the cost of living.  This will arise in the general discussion; but I want to be quite clear in my mind, and perhaps it would help to clear up the minds of some Deputies also, as to whether the words &ldquo;personal clothing and wearing apparel&rdquo; cover every article of clothing of every kind whatever. In other words, would everything I wear now, if imported, be taxed, except my collar-stud?  I take it, from the wording of the resolution, that it would.  I take it that it includes hats, pocket handkerchiefs and umbrellas. It is just as well that that should be understood by the public, that every article of clothing, whether manufactured in the Saorstát or not, or to whatever extent it may be manufactured here, if brought into the Saorstát from Great Britain or from Northern Ireland even, by a man who <Col N="89" /> had been for a week's holidays there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I understand; it will be administered in the same way as in France, Italy and other countries. But setting that aside, the fact is that the tax will be imposed on anything imported, at any rate by parcels post. It is just as well that that should be known, because it is really a very extensive scheme.  A great many were under the impression that these taxes would apply only to ready-made suits. It is quite clear that we are up against very much larger and wider things than that.  I do not want to labour the point now, or to delay the passage of this resolution, but it is a matter into which we must look closely and get fuller information before the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The total importation under the head of this tax, plus boots, amounts to £7,153,000.  Fifteen per cent. on that makes the bulk of the reduction which under this well-beloved Budget, which was commended to-day, is the sum that we are going to lose on clothes.  If there is any tax which will operate against the poor this is the one. We know, from whatever cause it arises, we cannot get our clothes made at a reasonable price, and it is a boon to the people that they are able to buy ready-made clothes and by that means clothe themselves for a couple of pounds.  The Minister has not expressed an opinion as to the capability of the manufacturers in this country to make hats.  Why tax hats?  There is no hat factory that I know of in this country. There is no use in taxing hats.  Was he <Col N="90" /> after revenue?  Then we have clothes, overcoats, hosiery, collars and shirts of all kinds.  Without exaggeration, I believe that this tax will do away with the good effect which the Budget would otherwise have given to the poor.  It will be outside the range of possibility for the poor man at the present time if this duty is imposed to get a suit of clothes, and we will be all on the farms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Of all the taxes that the Minister is imposing this is about the second best; he forgot one, and that was on manufactured flour, leaving the wheat to come in.  But I for one compliment him, and I compliment Deputy O'Doherty on drawing special attention to the fact that not alone will the Minister have the blessing of the tailors of the country but of the tweed-makers, the weavers, and everyone engaged in this industry. This is a tax to which we have been looking forward for years, a real Home Rule tax, a real Republican tax, if you like, because it shows to the world that we are free to impose our own taxes, even against England.</P>

There are houses, and you need not go outside Dublin to find them, where you can give your measure and get a suit of clothes, and not a chilling is spent for Irish labour on these clothes, except for the taking of the measurements. The imposition of this tax would cure that evil.

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid this tax is <Col N="92" /> very likely to increase the cost of living. I do not know whether the Minister has inquired into it at all from that point of view, but certainly a casual glance at the proposal would lead one to that conclusion.  I question if it will not do more injury than good in that connection.  That is a matter on which I would like some information, and doubtless the Minister will give us that information.  But to the exemptions in the last clause I think that it will be necessary to make an addition.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of it or not, but in the preparation of the costumes referred to in this resolution a great many are copied from what are known as French models.  The same is true of hats.  If these models are to be excluded&mdash;in other words, if they are to be taxed&mdash;I am afraid you will not help the industry, and I would suggest to the Minister that amongst the items which the Revenue Commissioners might include on the exempted list of taxed articles would be models, either of costumes or of hats.  It is obvious, without taking up the time of the Dáil in discussing a matter of this kind, that if we do not get these models the products of this particular industry in this country will fall very much behind the standard of other countries, because we will not have the ideas to copy.  I would, therefore, suggest that the last clause should be extended so as to include models&mdash;that is, items that would be used exclusively for models, which I think should be admitted tax free.</P>

      <P>This is one of the resolutions to which I take particular exception, and to any Deputy who would stand up on behalf of Labour to support it I would say that he does not represent Labour; I say to him deliberately that he misrepresents Labour.  This resolution may act, as the Minister has said, to the benefit perhaps of a thousand people, and possibly to more than that, but what will it mean to more than a million of our people?  One cannot read it and realise what it means without feeling that the Minister is making one vast mistake in his Budget. Ready-made clothing imported and cloths and tweed manufactured in the <Col N="93" /> country are two different things.  The cloth turned out by woollen mills is not proposed to be dealt with by this resolution at all.  Unmanufactured articles are not proposed to be dealt with, and Deputies would need to keep that in their heads.  It is the very poor who have, of necessity, to buy this class of clothing.  Men like the Minister and some Deputies, including myself, can afford to go to a good tailor, have a few tries on, and get good material. But what is the position of the very poor, perhaps two and a half out of our three and a half million people?  When the tax was put on boots last year I considered that this one was likely to follow, and happening to be in London last October I went into one of the biggest houses in the Strand and I got a suit of clothes turned out in about a week.  I had two tries on and I got it for five guineas. The two previous suits I had made in Dublin cost from eight to ten guineas, and they were inferior to this one, which I am now wearing.  That will give a fair idea of what people may expect from this resolution.  It is an iniquity; it is an injustice that is sought to be perpetrated not on the rich man but on the very poor.  These are articles that are of particular necessity to the poor and to the poor alone.  It may be a boon to Labour, and it may be a boon to the tailors, the few of them that are left in the country.  How many suits of clothes are worn by the poor man and his family?  What will this mean to the family budget of a man with five or six of a family?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Deputies and the Minister to consider this resolution seriously. This resolution is going to bolster up inefficiency and small output.  The tailoring trade in this country would not be in the position it is in if the people engaged in it gave anything like value or output for money.  The trade in ready-made clothing has grown out of all proportions, not on account of the cheapness of the articles, but because the people engaged in the trade will not approach it in a businesslike or proper manner.  I challenge any Minister to stand in any constituency and put this resolution to the test.  I <Col N="94" /> challenge any Labour Deputy or any other Deputy to do it.</P>

      <P>The price of these clothes when completed will compare favourably with those imported from Leeds and Bradford.  It may interest the Deputy further to know that 90 per cent. of the material to be made up that I saw in the factory was Irish-made. If this duty is imposed it will make it essential for those who desire to supply the ready-made trade to set up factories here, and the fact that they can get the kind of cloth they require <Col N="95" /> for the ordinary cheap ready-made suit will make it imperative for them to get material of Irish manufacture.  Deputy Gorey was very worried about the workingman, and he said that this was a tax on him and not on the well-to-do. He must not have eyes to see or he would know that in this city, or any other city in the Saorstát, the well-dressed young men to-day are wearing ready-to-wear suits.  The whole tailoring trade of this country is passing from the working tailor to the ready-to-wear firms.</P>

      <P>Through you, sir, I will inform Deputy Gorey.  It is just the economic argument, that a country with a big population can manufacture in large quantities by well-organised team work, and can supply an article at a cheaper rate than a country with a smaller population at its door.  It is a fact that 50 per cent. of the well-dressed young business men, professional classes, and others of that type, wearing well-made and well-cut clothes, are to-day buying them ready-to-wear, because the average working tailor cannot, by the methods of his trade, manufacture a suit at the same price, or anything like the same price, as can a factory with well-organised team work, where the work is specialised and each part of the suit is made by a special team.  That is a fair argument, and a reasonable view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that this tax will certainly bring about the establishment and extension of factories for the making of ready-to-wear suits, both for the workingman and for the professional and business classes.  It is the very best step the Minister could have taken to ensure an increase of employment.  I say that very seriously.  I do not wear ready-to-wear suits myself, because I <Col N="96" /> think I should be patriotic enough to give orders to a tailor.  But really it is a fact that the average man to-day can buy a suit of ready-to-wear clothes at considerably less price than he can get it made by a tailor, for the reason I have stated.  If this tax is put on it will enable factories here to organise team work and establish the effective organisation required to turn out that kind of suit for all classes.  I regret something was not done on the lines that Deputy O'Doherty mentioned to deal with the material itself, but perhaps that may come from the bigger development of the factory work.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding Deputy Gorey's denunciation, I welcome this Resolution.  The argument that Deputy Gorey used, which will probably influence a few people, was used without any examination of the facts. Deputy Gorey says that the effect of this tax will be to raise the cost of living. Deputy Good also uses that argument. It is quite possible that there may be a rise in the price of wearing apparel in the first few months, perhaps for the first few years.  I am not going to deny it.  But I take this proposed tax with the tea and sugar reductions, and amongst my numerous papers I just happened to find certain figures which I used in the discussion last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>In the discussion last year I argued that it would be possible to abolish the duty on tea and sugar and replace it by a duty of 25 per cent. on wearing apparel, and that the position of the working man with a family, as far as taxation is concerned, would be about the same.  I based that argument on statistics supplied in a report by a committee on the cost of living in Ireland.  That committee made the closest possible inquiry into the incidence of family budgets and the purchases of the average family in town and country throughout the Saorstát.  From that I find that the percentage of the average income of the working-class family, including a country as well as a town family, spent on clothing, was 17.48 per cent.  If we take the percentage <Col N="97" /> of the average family's income spent on tea and sugar we have 3.80 per cent. on tea and 3.24 per cent. on sugar.  I reckon that the abolition of the tax on tea and the reduction of the tax on sugar, on an income of 100/- weekly, will represent a reduction of 6/-, while the increased cost of this tax of 15 per cent. on wearing apparel, provided it is all passed on to the consumer, and that no benefit is given from the increased output here, would only cost 1/9.  That is to say, there is a net benefit for the working-man's family on this Budget of 4/3 weekly.  That is a rough calculation, but I will endeavour to check it before to-morrow.  I think it is not far wrong.  Perhaps the Minister would be able to confirm the figures or otherwise.</P>
      <P>On the other side what is the position? This is an industry that obviously ought to be a native one.  It is a natural growth out of a domestic industry, out of home production, and the making-up of the raw material into clothing.  Deputy Gorey and other Deputies have spoken rather of suits. Wearing apparel is not merely men's clothing.  It includes shirts, stockings, vests, and all the paraphernalia of a lady's outfit.  Before the Finance Bill becomes law we might be able to find out something about the number of people employed in factories or engaged in these varied occupations.  It is not merely tailors that are in question. There are shirt-makers, handkerchief-makers, as well as other industries which have hitherto been almost monopolised by the North of Ireland, so far as the demand in the Saorstát is concerned.  You have dressmaking, shirt-making, handkerchief-making, hosiery and other industries which supply every man and woman, as well as children, with ordinary requirements which have hitherto been imported.  Naturally, and of necessity, in my opinion, these articles should be produced in the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of our great troubles in this city, particularly, and in Cork, Limerick and other places, is the absence of occupation for young women.  This proposal will meet that want to a very great extent. During the war, Limerick Clothing <Col N="98" /> Factory employed 300 or 400 people, chiefly girls.  To-day they are employing 30.  There are two or three factories in Dublin which at one time employed a large number of women at machines making boys' clothing.  They are now practically idle.  A firm producing men's clothing, doing a very large proportion of the trade of the city and also in Cork, imports every article.  It produces not ready-made clothing, but made-to-measure clothing. That firm promised about two years ago that, when they had established a certain number of branches, they would establish a factory here.  They have not yet established the factory, but this proposal will induce them to do so. In my opinion, it will compel them to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gorey's ideal is the £5 5s. London suit.  I want to suggest that this is the way to get the £5 5s.  London suit made in Dublin.  You are going to develop here exactly the same kind of business that has brought about the £5 5s.  London suit.  The old craft tailor may not get any benefit out of this proposal.  I do not think he will, but he will have to adapt himself to the new demand.  He will readily adapt himself, I think, when he sees that there is a very great increase in the demand for clothing made to measure, even though it may be made to measure in a factory or by what is known as the division-of-labour method.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good spoke of exempting French models from the duty.  I think there really should be no need for that as from one model perhaps 100 or 200 copies are made.  A duty of 15 per cent. on a model is not going to do very much harm to anyone.  As far as that particular kind of wearing apparel is concerned, I want to suggest that it will not make any difference whatever &mdash;not a half-penny worth of difference &mdash;to the wearer in this country.  I do not believe that ladies' clothing of the fashionable kind&mdash;what we might call luxury clothing&mdash;is affected at all by the cost of production.  It is always sold at the highest price that can be got for it.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Good's wife were to go into a shop for a lady's hat, the price would be £5 5s.  If my wife or someone else went into that shop, for the same hat, it would depend on her appearance whether the price would be three, five, or seven guineas. I suggest that a duty of 15 per cent. is not going to make any difference whatever until that particular article comes into the ruck, and the French model influence has passed by.  I believe the effect of this duty undoubtedly will be to develop a very great industry, one that is badly wanted in our towns and cities.  Again, it may, when electricity is cheap, develop a rural industry. That in itself would be very valuable. Probably there is no group of commodities which would give more employment, without raising prices very much, that would be more beneficial than those affected by this particular proposal.</P>
      <P>I am glad, notwithstanding the possibility that it may mean to the mother of a large family quite an appreciable rise in the price of clothing in the year, of the amount of employment that will be given, and that the chances of the girls of that family getting employment, will be very much greater.  Such increase is more than set off by the reduction made in tea and sugar duties. I hope and expect that we shall see the benefit of this particular tax more quickly than that of any other tax suggested either this year or last year, that we shall see factories developing and business growing, always with the possibility of being able to meet the mass production of Leeds, Leicester, Northampton and other places on much more nearly level terms.  I welcome the proposal and I think that notwithstanding the possibility of an increase in the price of clothing in the first instance, that it is a desirable tax, and that the effect will entirely be good.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Coupled with the Minister's statement that it is not proposed to put a tax on tweeds or woollen fabrics such as that before us, we have his statement that in the proposals before us we have the final word <Col N="100" /> on any effort at protection on his part until such time as there may be a general election.  I think, taken together, this perhaps raises a very serious question for our woollen manufacturers.  It would warrant some time during our discussion on this Budget that we should have a pretty full statement from the Government point of view on the state of our woollen industry.  Some of us recently have seen evidence, at any rate as far as the homespun industry is concerned, that things are very bad.  Very little homespun tweed is being made at present.  I do not know in what position the ordinary mill industries are, but we are told here to-day that there is to be no protection given to our woollen industries. We are also practically told that the present Government will not propose to reconsider the matter until the Budget, say, of 1928, because the life of the present Dáil has not yet half run.</P>
      <P>I take it the Dáil will be able to save the country a general election until it runs out its full term.  You would not have a Budget in which you would deal again with your woollen industry until 1928.  I think that is perhaps a serious matter from the point of view of our textile manufacturers.  On the general objection raised here to protective tariffs, we are, apparently, to have a couple of years at any rate in which we are to judge the effect.  Personally I do not see that anybody would gain very much from a general election which would be fought out on the question of protection.  I think the matter of protection in the country is one on which you can have a very common understanding if the thing is gone into systematically.  We do not want to split up into parties on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson pointed out with regard to this resolution that it bears particularly on the domestic life of our people.  I think, just as the Minister to-day has faced the position of a free breakfast table, that all parties in the country will have to face at some time or another, and in the near future, a policy of what we may call the Irish home, that is, whether we shall definitely set so to protect the industries that will provide the necessities for our homes that we will have a nucleus of <Col N="101" /> organised industry in the country, so organised as to provide the necessities for the fabric of the Irish home, including furniture, crockery ware, and everything else like that.  Those people who are out against protective tariffs will, I hope, take advantage of the couple of years before them, according to the Minister for Finance, in order to take a sensible and wide view of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I take exception to the tariffs imposed by this Resolution. It is very hard to segregate a question of this kind without entering into the general question of tariffs on all articles.  It is stated by the Minister, and it was stated by him last year, that the Government were trying an experiment in Protection.  I maintained last year, and I maintain now, that there is no such thing possible as an experiment in Protection.  Once you have started Protection you are committed to it.  It seems to me that there is no possible going back from it.  You give Protection to boot manufacturers and ready-made clothing manufacturers. They build their factories and get their operatives trained, and get going, depending on this protective tariff.  Without that protective tariff they could not exist, and would never have existed. Does anyone think that these people would invest their capital or take a chance of building up an industry if after a period of two or three years they were to be told that this tariff was to be taken off and that they would have to stand on their own legs?  That is not possible, and will not take place. The men who establish those factories understand, if they have not been actually told, that the tariff is going to be permanent.  We are told that the Government contemplates nothing in the nature of general tariffs.  They are getting close to it.  They have put protective duties on the majority of the essentials of life in this country, and two years does not take long to pass. There is no doubt in my mind that the intention is to continue this policy of imposing tariffs until we have a tariff on every article imported into the country.  We have it stated by Deputy Mulcahy that that is the ambition of those advocating tariffs.  With that <Col N="102" /> ideal I am not in agreement.  I think it is a wrong ideal, and running contrary to the trend of modern development. It is almost impossible for any country to be self-dependent at the present time.  It is impossible for a country like Ireland, with her limited resources and her one-sided possibilities, to develop into a complete self-supporting nation&mdash;a nation, as some Deputy said, surrounded by a wall of brass.</P>
      <P>In my opinion every country is dependent, to a certain extent, on other countries at the present time.  I am rather surprised that Labour Deputies should advocate protection, because the whole tendency of organised labour is to see that articles are produced in countries which are best suited for their production, and that labour devotes its attention to the best type of production and to the best type of article which can be most economically manufactured in a country, and that it imports articles which can be more economically manufactured elsewhere.  We are told that the cost of living will not go up.  We are told that the cost of our tea, sugar, and coffee will more than counterbalance the increased cost of living which will result from those tariffs and, in particular, the tariff imposed on ready-made clothing.  I am willing to acknowledge that, and that the cost, in so far as the reduction in the duty of tea and sugar is concerned, may more than counterbalance the tariff placed on those articles of which I am talking. I maintain that the Minister, instead of balancing the duty on tea, sugar, and coffee with the duty on clothing and other things, should have made a greater effort to reduce taxation, and that his efforts would be better used to that effect than in changing over from one article to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am looking at this largely from the point of view of the agriculturist. I have always believed that those engaged in an industry like agriculture, which has to export its surplus products, cannot benefit in any way from tariffs.  Their prices are fixed by conditions existing outside the country. The conditions inside the country have no real effect on their prices.  They <Col N="103" /> have to sell their articles in an open market, and they have to continue to buy their requirements in a closed market.  They have to buy supplies, which are protected, and some of which are getting considerable advantage from protection.  We get pious recognition here, and in other places, of the prominence of agriculture in the economic life of this country.  But that is all we get.  What advantage is agriculture getting directly under this Budget?</P>

      <P>That is not a Budget matter.  That is only putting right a matter which has long been wrong&mdash;the over-taxation of the agriculturist as compared with others who live in the rural districts.  I do not regard that as an ordinary budget matter at all.  I regard it as putting right what has been wrong for years and recognising, at least, some arguments which we have put forward here.  The Ministers know the conditions that exist in the rural districts.  They know the hardships that exist.  They know that the people of some parts of the country were almost in a state of semi-starvation. Now, they are going to increase the cost of these people's clothing.  The fact of the matter is that, as the people are in some cases going without boots at present, they will be going next year without clothes, because you are balancing the advantage of abolition of the tea tax by a <Col N="104" /> tariff on clothing.  Is there any indication that the small farmer and agricultural labourer are able to exist decently with the present high cost of living?  There is not.  The efforts of the Government should, in my opinion, be directed to reducing the present extremely high cost of living, which bears hardest on those who reside in the rural districts, rather than to the imposition of tariffs on necessary articles. Deputy McCullough made an extraordinary statement.  He said that works were already being got ready in anticipation of the employment that would be given when the tariff proposals became known.</P>

      <P>Certain Deputies have referred to the advantage the woollen industry would derive from this tariff.  I think it should be obvious to everybody that the woollen industry will not derive any advantage. There is nothing in this Budget to prevent all ready-made clothing being of foreign material, with foreign thread, foreign buttons and all the other articles that are necessary.  I think it should not go out from the Dáil that the industry of woollen manufacture in Ireland will derive <Col N="105" /> any benefit from the tariffs that have been proposed in this Budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Doherty asked about the inclusion of woollens in this tariff.  The difficulty is, that if there was a tariff on woollens, either all making-up and all tailoring would be wiped out in this country, or, on top of the tariff on woollens, we would have to put a higher tariff on the clothes made out of them.  Instead of having a 15 per cent. tariff on, say, ready-mades, which we have been dealing with, we would have to have a 30 per cent. tariff.  It was felt that we could not really face the imposition of a two-tier tariff of that sort.  It would raise far too sharply the cost of particular articles.  We tried, so far as we could, to meet the case of the woollen industry by another tax, which I will deal with subsequently.  Perhaps I could also deal with the whole matter then.</P>
      <P>I would not say that the imposition of a tariff on articles like these is bolstering up inefficiency.  As a matter of fact, I believe that we will have people who have experience of the trade elsewhere opening factories here, and that we will have efficient factories.  I think people from outside who open factories here and who know how to do their share of the business, have no cause of complaint about the workers employed by them.  I have not heard that the people connected with the tobacco factories or that Fords had any cause of complaint about their workers. If we have people who know the business&mdash;who can run it properly&mdash;opening factories here, they will not, I think, become inefficient because of coming here, and they will not have very serious cause of complaint about the inefficiency of the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were asked, why not exclude <Col N="106" /> hats.  There is no hat factory, so far as I know, but you do not want to exclude an article that is, to some extent, a substitute for some other article made.  There are certainly caps made, and you do not want to discourage the wearing of the democratic cap and put everybody into hats.  Apart from that, people have been making inquiries for some time about the possibility of hat manufacture here.  We know that there is a distinct possibility of a hat factory being started here, even apart from this tariff altogether.  We believe that the manufacture of felt hats will be undertaken as a result of this tariff.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson has dealt with the effect on the cost of living.  I have not the calculations here, but I think that he is not very far out.  I think there is nothing I need add to what Deputy McCullough and Deputy Johnson have said about the matter.  We will have a very great amount of employment given here, employment that will be spread over the country.  I believe that this duty will cost nothing like a 15 per cent. increase to the people of the country.  In the case of many articles Irish manufacturers are already carrying on in a small way fairly well and are not charging 15 per cent. above the British prices or anything like it, because if they were they could not carry on at all.  The experience we have had, so far, in other matters is, that manu facturers have been glad of the opportunity which the tariffs gave them, and that they have not tried to screw out excessive profits, but rather that they have tried to expand their industries and put them firmly on their feet.  I have said that, in the case of boots, we know that there has been no increase: we know in fact, that there has been, in fact, an actual decrease.  In the case of jams, we know that there has been a decrease in the price of the Irish jams and that the price of the foreign-made jams has gone up.  In addition to that, in the case of certain jams at any rate, there is a general acknowledgment that the quality of the Irish goods has gone up.  The Irish manufacturer has seized the opportunity of getting on his feet and of making his industry big here. He has taken the opportunity in the <Col N="107" /> right spirit, and I believe that we will have many people doing that in this instance, too, and that there is no <Col N="108" /> danger of an increase to the people to the full extent of the 15 per cent. in the article manufactured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That a Customs duty of an amount equal to thirty-three and one-third per cent. of the value of the article shall be charged, levied, and paid on all bedsteads of whatever material made and on all component parts of bedsteads and on all furniture (other than bedsteads) made wholly or partly of wood and whether completely or partially manufactured and on all component parts of furniture (other than bedsteads) which parts are themselves made wholly or partly of wood imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 24th day of April, 1925.</P>
      <P>(2)  That where the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied in respect of any furniture which is being imported that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the importer thereof resides or intends to reside permanently in Saorstát Eireann, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the furniture had been previously used by the importer or by his family or household, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  the furniture is being imported <Col N="109" /> for the use in Saorstát Eireann of the importer or his family or household,</P>
    <P>the Revenue Commissioners may, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, permit such furniture to be imported without payment of the duty mentioned in this resolution.</P>
    <P>(3)  That whenever the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that any partially manufactured article of furniture is imported for further manufacture and subsequent exportation, they may, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, permit such article to be imported without payment of the duty mentioned in this resolution.</P>
    <P>This resolution imposes an amount equal to thirty-three and one-third per cent. on furniture, including bedsteads, but except in the case of bedsteads the duty is confined to wood furniture.  We believe that the duty of thirty-three and one-third per cent. will be sufficient actually to produce big results in the matter of getting the organisation, and the plant, set up to produce increased quantities of furniture here. Deputy Good suggested that in certain cases we did not put on a high enough tax to get results, and that instead of having a protective tariff we simply have a revenue duty.  We believe a very small duty in the case of furniture would be only a revenue duty.  We believe, on the other hand, this duty will produce a greatly increased output of furniture in this country.</P>
    <P>It has been complained frequently that the reason of the unsatisfactory state of the furniture manufacturing industry was that there was no output amongst the workers.  I do not want to go into that, to any extent, now, but I just want to say this: That we are providing the possibility of steady and increased employment for the workers in this particular industry and, if we are not able to build up then, perhaps, the whole matter might be one to be reconsidered after a fair term.  On the other hand, I do believe&mdash;I am assuming for the sake of argument that there is truth in the suggestion&mdash;that generally you find if there is not good output <Col N="110" /> amongst the workers the fault does not lie with them entirely.  If there is good organisation in business, and good management, and good prospects of continuous, and steady employment, you will find that a good output can be got in one country just as well as in another.</P>
    <P>I think that this tax will probably bring new people into the trade and will, certainly, cause the setting up of new establishments for the manufacture of furniture.  It is expected to bring within a year or so, the employment of about 1,000 hands additional to the number employed at the present time.  There are certain very good factories, well equipped factories, for manufacturing furniture at the present time.  They will be able at once as a result of this tariff to be busily occupied.  Other establishments will be set up to complete the equipment necessary to meet the demand.</P>
    <P>As I said in my previous statement in regard to the cheaper class of furniture, a good deal has always been manufactured here.  I do not know at the moment what the very recent position has been, but the normal position has been that a great deal of very cheap furniture has been manufactured here.  I believe the effect of the imposition of this tariff on the cheaper class of furniture, the furniture which the worker will use and which many of the farmers of the country will use, will be slight indeed.  As it is an <i>ad valorem</i> duty, it will come stiff on the furniture that is the furniture of the rich and the furniture of ornamentation, fashion and luxury.  I believe it is a tariff which deals with a type of industry different from all the others, and even different from the point of view of the class of labour that it employs.</P>
    <P>We believe that in completing and rounding-off the experiment of protection, a tariff of this sort is very necessary, and I commend it to the Dáil in the belief that it will give an industry which was one time carried on here in a successful way, and that produced stuff of high quality, the opportunity of being revived in whatever form modern conditions may require.  It is an industry that does not require iron or coal fields; it is an industry that requires <Col N="111" /> a certain moderate amount of power.  It is one of the types of industry that we can afford to try to set on its feet here in the belief that it will come to maturity and in time be able to stand its own ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister, after twelve months' consideration, has thought fit to bring in a tariff of this kind.  I have been interested in this industry, because I have been more or less concerned with one particular firm that has died out as a result of the dumping of furniture from the other side&mdash;furniture that was manufactured under the most horrible conditions from a labour point of view.  Last year, when the Budget resolutions were brought forward, I advocated a tariff for the sake of saving an industry that appeared to me, at that stage, to be almost wiped out.  Twelve months ago the demand for the tariff, so far as I was concerned, and so far as I was connected with it, came from one of the oldest furniture firms in the country.  Strange as it may appear, it was advocated both by the employees connected with the firm and the employers, who were endeavouring to carry on under the most adverse conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made reference to the fact&mdash;I do not know whether he himself was convinced from some of the arguments put up to him&mdash;that the failure of the firms connected with the manufacture of furniture in Ireland was due to the small output on the part of the workers.  So far as I could gather from the employers, the failure was due to the fact that we had not in this country workers of the type required to turn out furniture in the same way as they do in those highly industrialised centres such as High Wycombe, and other places on the other side of the Channel.  If the additional employment anticipated by the Minister will be available as a result of this tariff, then I anticipate in the very near future&mdash;in the course of a few years at any rate&mdash;that the apprentices of to-day will be the then skilled workers.  If that be so, then we will not be looking to England or to other countries to provide our industries <Col N="112" /> with that technical skill which will be made available because of the increased employment that is anticipated from this duty.</P>
    <P>Ten days or two weeks ago I attended a conference that was held in Edenderry&mdash;part of my own constituency&mdash;where a works' council was set up composed of an equal number on the employers' side and an equal number on the employees' side in the factory. It was decided there that suggestions for the better working and management of the firm should be brought forward month by month in future.  The workers as well as the people responsible for the management will have an equal share and an equal responsibility in developing the furniture industry on such lines as will ensure that in future, whatever articles of this nature are required by our people, they will be provided.  So far as the industry is concerned, everything is on the side of success.  We have in this country, as far as I can learn, timber suitable for making the type of furniture required.  I believe that the tariffs now proposed ought to put this industry firmly on its legs, and any failure that may come in future will, no doubt, be placed at the doors of those engaged in the industry.  I think it is due to the Minister to say that the encouragement given to the furniture industry, both as a result of these tariffs and as a result of the efforts on the part of the Government, ought to make it possible for the people engaged in the industry to turn out all the furniture required by our population and so save the two millions which hitherto have been going out of the country by reason of the unfair conditions under which the people engaged in the industry have had to carry on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if Deputy Davin was correct in saying that two millions could be prevented from going out of this country?  I wonder where he got that figure?  The importation of bedsteads last year amounted to £60,000, roughly.  I have yet to learn that there is a factory here that can make a bedstead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the sort of exaggerated statement that takes the imagination of Deputies and gets them to vote wrongly.  I do not mean that in any wrong sense.  I want to point out that, as regards bedsteads, we have no aptitude and no special qualifications for the working of angle iron and the other things necessary for making bedsteads. It will mean an increase in the cost of production, and a cost to the consumer of one-third more than at present. It is all very well to speak about factories and to say that later, when we have the Shannon scheme, we will have all the power required.  I would like to tell the Minister that he has begun at the wrong end; he should have obtained the power first and then he could commence to put up the factories. Possibly we will not have the power from the Shannon sooner than ten years, and then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was amazed at the Deputy from Tirconaill &mdash; Deputy McCullough&mdash;when, declaring that he was in favour of taking the tax off the necessities of life, he advocated the reduction of the tax on pianes.  Of course we do not want the tax off clothing; that is not a necessity of life at all.  That is the Deputy's argument. I wonder how he is going to square himself on this subject?  The Deputy is most inconsistent.  He advocated the reduction of the tariff on pianos which, he said, were necessities of life, and he insists on getting a high tariff on boots, shoes and clothing.  When he is dealing with this subject, I would like him to consider what he has advocated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>We will leave it that way.  The point I want to make is, that all those tariffs are going to raise the cost of living, and while we at this side would be very glad to see factories of our own and very glad to put our children to learn these technical trades, we are afraid these tariffs, which are really a general tariff, will be very oppressive. If we go over all the items on which you are putting a tax, you would say a general tariff is established. We are afraid, coming at a time when it is very hard to live, that it will blot us out of existence entirely and you will not have factories or people to work them or anything else.</P>

      <P>I wish to correct what Deputy Wilson said with regard to the bedsteads.  He said we know nothing about angle-iron in this country. The next thing I expect to hear from the farmers' benches, with regard to beds, is that we never sleep on them at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamSears" hpid="Mr. SEARS Mr. SEARS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>In Pierce's factory in Wexford they have laid down a costly plant for making iron bedsteads.  Deputy Wilson may not have heard that, but their bedsteads will be as good as their ploughs were before, and I hope they will get better support than in the case of the ploughs.  The Wexford firm turned out a large number of bedsteads last year, and the encouragement given in this proposal now will, I am sure, enable them to capture a large proportion of the Irish trade in bedsteads.  I do not believe that the opposition from the farmers to these proposals is altogether seriously meant, because I know myself that the farmer Deputies represent more than the eldest son.  The farmers' families are not built up on French lines. There are other sons besides the eldest son, and to-day it is a very sad thing to see all these fine young fellows leaving the country to make bedsteads, <Col N="115" /> shirts, and suits of clothes elsewhere. We have to send over our young men to these factories to make them for us, and we then buy the articles from the other side.</P>
      <P>What I expected the farmers to say with regard to these proposals is this: that at present, as we have no factories in Ireland, the farmers of Ireland are obliged to send over their produce, their beef and their mutton, to England to be eaten by the men who make these things in the English factories.  A lot of them are young Irishmen.  I have met them from Cardiff up to Glasgow, thousands of young Irishmen, making articles that we pay dearly for.  Instead of having these made at a distance of three or four hundred miles, we should have them made here at home and the money circulating at home instead of enriching British artisans.</P>
      <P>Deputy Heffernan said that this small nation could not be self-supporting. Well, if we do not support ourselves, no other nation will support us.  There is every reason why we should protect ourselves.  If Deputy Gorey goes to London for a suit of clothes, and Deputy Wilson goes to Halifax for a bedstead, well, there will be neither clothes nor beds made in Ireland after a while.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamSears" hpid="Mr. SEARS Mr. SEARS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very glad to hear the Minister for Finance saying one thing at all events.  He said that if there are no good factories in Ireland, it is not the fault of the young Irish artisans.  I am acquainted with a very intricate trade myself, the printing trade, and I know that a printing firm in Wexford town won first prize in London where an international exhibition was held.  This little firm in Wexford won that prize year after year, so that it is not the fault of the Irish artisan, whether the farmer's or the labourer's son.  It is the fault of the management, and you cannot expect the management to do wonders unless they get protection.  As Deputy Good pointed out, we are living side by side with a wealthy nation like England, <Col N="116" /> highly industrialised, far more advanced in mass production.  If we are not going to contemplate meeting that mass production by some method, then we might as well give up all notion of building an Irish State.</P>
      <P>I remember Arthur Griffith again and again insisting that if we did not aim at cultivating the industrial side of our national life, then we would only have done half our work.  Englishmen and the other foreigners who send their bedsteads and their clothes here are sending them only in return for a certain price which they get from the farmers. The industries in Ireland will give the farmer the same price, and he will have no cause for complaint.  It will be simply an exchange between one industry and another.  The agricultural industry will be carried on at home as profitably, perhaps far more profitably, than at present.  The American farmer, when tariffs were proposed there, had the same objection to them as are now advanced here on behalf of one small section of the farming community, but the American farmer who goes round in his motor to-day would be horrified if anybody suggested to him that the tariff walls in America should be thrown down and that foreign goods should be allowed to come in to crush the industries of America.  We can never build up Irish industry unless we put on tariffs of this kind.  I welcome these tariffs.  They are our only hope. We made some sacrifices for political freedom and we must make some more if we are going to win industrial freedom.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to hear from Deputy Johnson that Labour is not going to be frightened by these petty arguments about the increase in the price of bedsteads or boots.  Is it not better for a man to have a weekly wage on a Saturday night to spend on tea and sugar than to have all these articles made abroad and our men living on the dole or emigrating to English factories to make suits or bedsteads?  I have great pleasure in supporting this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody has got off scot-free in this debate on tariffs, and he will, I think, be complimented <Col N="117" /> by people other than Deputies here. I refer to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It seems to me&mdash;I may not be correct, but I think I am&mdash;that he has been able to impress his mind and impress his point of view on the Minister for Finance.  We know that it is his ear which has to listen to the tales of woe from the industrialists of the country and they, no doubt, will welcome this Budget.  We, however, are taken to task because we, on these Benches, cannot welcome the imposition of tariffs in the same way as, say, manufacturers in Deputy Davin's constituency, or in Deputy Good's constituency. I want to say at the outset that we are just as keen to see these industries rising up in the State as anybody else, but we are not keen to see them established at the expense of our industry and everybody, even those on the Government Benches, gives lip service to the statement that agriculture must be the first consideration of the Government.  The Minister for Agriculture the other day in Wexford pointed out to the farmers in Ireland generally the state of their industry, the necessity for organisation, the importance of improvements in methods, and the difficulties which we have to meet at home and abroad.  We are conscious of these difficulties ourselves. The state of the country generally reflects the condition of the agricultural industry.  What protection is there for us in the Budget which has been produced here this evening?  I think I hear Deputy McCullough say &ldquo;Blow in another tune now.&rdquo;  He says &ldquo;subsidy.&rdquo; It is a subsidy which we say is long overdue.  If there is a reduction in other things, such as tea and sugar, there was a necessity for reduction all round in taxation, but we want to remind the Government Party, every one of them, that if agriculture is to live and if agriculturalists are to compete with farmers in other countries, we, too, must get protection.  But what kind of protection?  A protection that will enable us to compete with the other fellows.  There is no use in our asking you to put on protective tariffs on certain products of ours, because most of our products are sold outside the country and we have to meet farmers in <Col N="118" /> other countries at their prices, and the only protection which is of use to us is that which enables us to produce at the lowest possible cost our clothes and boots and the other things which we use.  When the price of these things goes up, it means that we cannot produce in our fields the articles which we put on the foreign market at the same price as our competitors.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sears says that industrialists here will give the farmer the same price as he is getting, but I want to tell the Deputy that the price he is getting is not enough to make farming pay, and when you add on to the present cost, the cost which you will have to carry owing to this Budget, you are putting upon him an extra load and you are not guaranteeing to him, nor can anybody guarantee to him, that he is going to get a penny extra for what he has to sell.  When you ask us to pay something more for what we have to buy we ask you what guarantee will you give us that we are going to get more for what we have to sell?  That is the pounds, shillings, and pence problem which the farmer of the country has to face to-day.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce cannot, I think, guarantee to the farmer that the rising of these industries is going to give him a higher price for his produce than the price that rules in the world's market.  We have every desire to see industries built up, but if the industry which has to live against foreign competition is to get a fair chance, the Government ought to see that it gives that fair chance which it pretends it is giving.  I say that if this burden raises the cost of production to us it will prevent us from meeting the foreign competitor.  Our position to-day is that the cost of production is too high.  Land has gone out of tillage because it does not pay to till.  If the farmer has an off season which does not enable him to have a profitable crop he has not enough to pay his workers and how can he pay rents, rates, or taxes, or anything else?  What has he to put on the foreign market?  Why is our trade balance against us?  One reason why it is against us is that these tariffs prevent us from competing on level terms with the foreign farmer.</P>

      <P>We cannot fix that until to-morrow.  The idea was to go as far as Resolution No. 13 this evening.  A discussion would then be in order on the whole range of the Minister's speech; in other words, anything relevant to the Resolutions can be raised again on Resolution No. 13.  When that is concluded a date will be fixed for the Report Stage.  It cannot be later than ten sitting days after the adoption of the Resolutions.  The day will be fixed, so that Deputy Heffernan or anybody <Col N="120" /> else will have the opportunity of sending in amendments.</P>

      <P>I only want to deal with the taunt hurled at our benches from the other side.  We were told that we were getting a subsidy.  I say it is a most unsatisfactory subsidy, and I would like to draw attention to the way we are treated about this subsidy. I would like to ask the Minister in how many counties is this Agricultural Grant paid up.  Is it not held as a security for non-payment of annuities? The Government have secured themselves, and they have added a double security by holding out this £600,000, but I would like to know when is it going to be paid?</P>

      <P>In how many counties is the Agricultural Grant in its present form held up?  We are tired of writing to the Minister for Local Government about this grant.  He writes back saying that the annuities are not paid up. The same thing will happen now.  You have secured yourselves by giving this £600,000, and perhaps in six or seven years' time the farmers may get the benefit of it.</P>

      <P>I will reserve what I have to say in reply to Deputy Baxter until to-morrow.  In answer to Deputy Doyle I may say that this £600,000 will go to the farmers this year, for there is quite sufficient in the Guarantee Fund without putting any of this into it.</P>

      <P>It is only fair that when a Deputy like Deputy Wilson is referring to figures that he should quote the <Col N="121" /> figures in the form he has before him. The value of the articles on which the tariff is now going to be placed, according to Deputy Wilson's own book which he quoted from, is £761,824 as against £345,712 quoted by Deputy Wilson.  I am sorry Deputy Wilson used figures which misrepresent the point of view which he desires to support.</P>
