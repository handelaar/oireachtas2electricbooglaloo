      <P>asked the President whether he has received the final report of the Post Office Commission of Enquiry; if he will state when it will be published; whether the Report has been considered, and, if so, what decision has been reached.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The final report of the Commission of Enquiry into the Post Office has been received and will shortly be presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas, after which it will be available for publication.  The Executive Council have decided to accede to the request of the members of the Commission that they should be relieved from further service, and each of the members has been so informed.</P>

      <P>I think I would be better able to answer that question to the satisfaction of the Deputy when the report is laid before the Oireachtas. I might say, however, that in part at any rate, some of the recommendations have been accepted.</P>

      <P>asked the President if he is aware that the Wicklow County Board of Health at their <Col N="2184" /> meeting on May 18th, 1925, adopted a resolution calling on the Executive Council to take steps forthwith to carry out the scheme recommended by the Committee on Reconstruction in order to relieve destitution caused through unemployment, and whether he has anything further to add on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he will state the reason for the refusal to pay unemployment benefit to Thomas Magan, of Coonagh, Carbury, Co. Kildare, Book No. 1062, Edenderry Branch Office; whether he is aware that Mr. Magan claims to have been a contributor in England since 1912, and whether he will communicate with the Unemployment Insurance Department in London with a view to payment of benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is laid down in sub-section 4 of Section 8 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, that where no contributions are paid in respect of any person during any insurance year, he shall be disqualified from receiving unemployment insurance benefit until twelve contributions, exclusive of any contributions paid for him before that year, have been paid for him under the Act.  As no contribution has been paid into the unemployment fund in this country for Mr. Thomas Magan during the 1923-24 insurance year, his claim of the 26th March was disallowed under the sub-section to which I have referred.  The claimant appealed against the decision, but the Court of Referees recommended that the claim should be disallowed, and that recommendation has been accepted by the insurance officer. <Col N="2185" /> No unemployment benefit can, therefore, be paid to Mr. Magan until at least twelve further contributions have been paid for him in respect of employment in this country.</P>

      <P>These services have not been sufficiently long in operation to enable an accurate statement of the annual cost of running of each type to be made, but I may say that Post Office motor services have not been sanctioned unless where they were cheaper than the horse or motor services carried out by private contract.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether he is aware that tenants on the Bathurst Estate, Cappamore, Co. Limerick, have been proceeded against for one half-year's interest in lieu of rent due on November 1st, 1924; that the said tenants are unable to meet this half-gale of rent owing to the flooding of the lands in consequence, it is <Col N="2187" /> alleged, of the failure of the Land Commission to keep in repair the banks of the River Mulcair or Bilboa adjoining the said lands; and whether he is aware that an engineer from the Land Commission inspected the banks in July, 1924, and that no repairs were carried out since; whether he will state the engineer's report on the matter, and if he will expedite the carrying out of any works suggested by the engineer this coming summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Two tenants on the Bathurst estate have failed to pay their instalments of payment in lieu of rent when due, and the usual proceedings have been taken by the Land Commission to recover the arrears.</P>
      <P>The estate comprises 4 holdings in the townlands of Killuragh and 3 holdings in Turagh, and the owner has lodged schedules of particulars to enable the lands to be vested.</P>
      <P>It appears that there is an embankment protecting the property on the south and east sides from the overflow of the River Mulcair, and that the lands are within the Mulcair river drainage district.  The Land Commission gazetted the lands on 15th January, 1924, when the tenants lodged objections to the vesting of the lands on the grounds that the lands were affected by the embankment and a drainage maintenance rate, and that they were not prepared to undertake the future liability.  The objection was listed before the Commissioners who, after hearing the parties, directed one of their engineers to visit the lands. The Commissioners have considered the matter, and have informed the owner's solicitors and the objecting tenants, that they propose to make application to the Judicial Commissioner to retain out of the purchase money a capital sum for the future upkeep of the embankments and for the drainage maintenance rate.  There is no liability on the Land Commission for the maintenance of the embankment.</P>

Numerous applications continue to be received in response to the circular letter issued on the subject, and organisers of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society are being sent, where their services are desired, to explain the steps necessary for the establishment of credit societies. It is not possible as yet to estimate the extent to which such societies will be established under the scheme.  The reply to the concluding portion of the question is in the affirmative.</P>

As regards the other items, No. 2 will be taken first, No. 3 second, No. 4 third, No. 5 fourth, and No. 6 fifth, I apologise to Deputies who made inquiries as regards Item No 7 (Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Bill, 1925&mdash;Second Stage) for not taking it next.

      <P>In view of the importance of item No. 1 (Dundalk Harbour and Port Bill), will the Minister say if it will be taken definitely this day week? The reason I ask the question is that there are a good many interests involved, and if it were not taken on this day week it would probably necessitate a postponement of the work for twelve months.</P>

      <P>I move for leave to introduce <Col N="2193" /> a Bill to make provision for continuing the maintenance and regulation of the Phoenix Park, Dublin, as a public park and the preservation of order therein and for other purposes connected therewith.  It has been felt for a long time that it is necessary to have legislation defining more clearly, than at present, the powers and duties of the Commissioners of Public Works, in regard to the maintenance and regulation of the Phoenix Park.  This Bill has been introduced to give effect to that.  As a matter of fact, during the British administration Bills were prepared, three or four times, for this purpose, but were never presented.</P>

      <P>These words in brackets were inserted simply on the view that you could not from without the State levy war against the State.  That view, of course, is not strictly accurate and that was pointed out in the Seanad.  We propose to delete these words accordingly.</P>
      <P>Amendment 2 is in Section 1 (3), after the word &ldquo;shall,&rdquo; line 40, to insert the following words: (&ldquo;unless he satisfies the court that he did not know, and had no reason to believe that the person encouraged, harboured or comforted was so engaged, concerned or taking part as aforesaid&rdquo;).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accepted that amendment, my personal view on it being that it merely <Col N="2194" /> states the legal position.  It merely sets out, expressly, what I believe would be the case, in any event, whether or not this amendment were inserted, and that it would be a sufficient reply to a charge, under that particular sub-section, that the accused had no knowledge or means of knowledge, that the person he was harbouring was engaged in hostility to the State.</P>
    <P>The third amendment is consequential on an amendment passed here in the Dáil providing that two witnesses would be necessary to secure a conviction on any charge under this section, and, consequently, in view of that amendment, the words &ldquo;and upon the like evidence&rdquo; as in the case of a murder charge, were deleted.</P>
    <P>Amendment 4, in Section 2, line 6, the words &ldquo;the Dublin Metropolitan Police or&rdquo; were deleted, is an amendment that follows upon the passing of the Police Forces Amalgamation Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment 5 to Section 3, suggests that before the word &ldquo;orders,&rdquo; in line 39, the adjective &ldquo;lawful&rdquo; should be inserted.  That is an obvious kind of amendment, and it follows the wording of the Defence Forces Act, a particular section of the Defence Forces Act, which is relevant.</P>
    <P>Amendment 6 is, in principle, the same as amendment No. 2.  It sets out expressly that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No person shall be liable to be convicted under this section in respect of the act of encouraging, harbouring or protecting, mentioned in paragraph (b) of the foregoing sub-section, if he satisfies the court that he did not know and had no reason to believe that the person he encouraged, harboured or protected, was engaged, concerned or taking part in any such attempt as is referred to in the said paragraph.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It merely states what the position would be in any event.  The remaining amendments follow from the passing of the Police Forces Amalgamation Bill.  I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in those amendments.</P>

      <P>I had hoped&mdash;and I certainly would have been better <Col N="2195" /> pleased in the circumstances&mdash;that the Minister would move that the Dáil do not agree with these amendments.  My hope was based on the expectation that the Seanad would insist on their amendments, and then the country would be given a respite for nine months, at any rate.  In the meantime, and perhaps even now, the Minister might agree to propose that the Dáil be asked to refuse to accept the amendments in the hope that the Seanad would insist upon them.  Then, possibly, the Minister would arrange to have the whole question referred to the country by way of referendum, at the time of the Seanad elections.  I think we would be doing a very good piece of work, from several points of view, if the Minister would adopt that course. I mean that he would move to disagree with the Seanad amendments, and suggest to the Seanad that they should insist on their amendments, with a view to referring the whole Bill to the country by way of referendum.  We might then be testing the views of the country on the present Bill; we might then be testing the practicability of a referendum without much expense; and, generally, we might be testing the views of the country upon the Minister's policy in respect of this matter. I have not much hope that that suggestion will commend itself to the Minister; but I throw it out for his consideration.  I am not going to risk the loss of these amendments.  Slight as they are, there is a certain value in them.  Perhaps the Minister would rise to the bait that I have thrown on the waters?</P>

      <P>In page 8, to delete Section 13 and substitute a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;13.&mdash;(1)  Subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance given either generally or for any particular case, the Minister may supply, during the construction under this Act of works for the purpose of the undertaking, on such terms and conditions as he thinks proper to any person, whether for his own use or for re-sale, any quantity of electricity produced by the undertaking during such construction of works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The Minister may before or as a condition for the construction of transmission lines, transformer stations, or other works for the delivery of a supply of electricity to any particular person or group of persons, require such person or persons to enter into an agreement or agreements with the Minister to take, for his or their own use or for re-sale, a supply of electricity when available in such minimum quantity as the Minister, having regard to <Col N="2197" /> the cost of the works required for the delivery of such supply, shall consider reasonable and shall specify and at such price or prices as the Minister may be authorised by statute or otherwise to charge therefor.</P>
    <P>(3)  Any local authority or other public body or any company may, notwithstanding any statutory or other limitation of their powers, enter into and carry out any contract or agreement with the Minister under this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to give effect to an undertaking that was given by the Minister in Committee; that is, that the powers given by the clause, as originally drafted, should be restricted to meet two classes of cases for which it was agreed it would be desirable to make provision.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2) to delete the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; before the words &ldquo;to charge therefor&rdquo; at the end of the sub-section and substitute the words &ldquo;order under statute or by resolution of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment to the amendment we have just adopted.  It is intended to substitute for the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or under statute or by resolution of the Oireachtas.&rdquo; It is to make the formal &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; more detailed and more specific.  I am not quite sure what the legal construction of such an expression &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; might be.  It might leave it open to the Minister to go to the Minister for Finance and get him to sanction his proposed scale of charges. I agree with Deputy Thrift that the new amendment does meet the points that were raised in Committee.  I would like to have this one point made more specific, that we should definitely <Col N="2198" /> see, so far as the general contract for the supply of electricity is concerned, not the contract for the supply of electricity during the constructional period &mdash;there will not be much electricity and it will be used for the purposes of construction or giving additional light to Limerick, and so on&mdash;the Minister should be regulated by rulings of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>If this amendment is adopted, the effect will be that the Minister may fix prices within such limits as may be prescribed by statute&mdash;that is the second Bill which we have been promised&mdash; by rules made under that statute, so that the Minister will not have to go to the Dáil and so that he may exercise any powers the Dáil may give him in that respect, or by a resolution of the Oireachtas.  I put in the last stipulation because some emergency might arise in which the Minister, before passing his statute, might wish to have power to fix a scale of charges.  In that case I suggest he could come to both Houses and obtain a resolution authorising him to do so.  I do not want to be unreasonable, but it might not be possible to force through a Bill in the necessary time.  A resolution would be a resonable and constitutional way by which we could keep control.  I hold as strongly as on the Second Reading, and as strongly as Deputy Johnson did on the State Lands Act, that we should have some control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment is to replace the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; by another phrase.  The two phrases have exactly the same meaning.  I must be authorised; authority must proceed from the Oireachtas. The Oireachtas can only authorise me in two ways.  They can authorise either by regulations under statute or by resolution. The effect of the words moved by Deputy Cooper would in no way change the paragraph as it stands now. It simply puts in another way what is already there.  If the Deputy thinks it desirable, I would suggest yet another way.  I would suggest in front of the word &ldquo;statute&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or under.&rdquo;  The paragraph would then read: &ldquo;Such price or prices as the Minister may be authorised by or <Col N="2199" /> under statute or otherwise to charge therefor.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Distribution Bill, when it comes along, will entirely wipe out the paragraph.  The paragraph will then be entirely repealed. It is just a question of whether the House wants to leave me the possibility of being authorised by a resolution or whether they would prefer to have the more restrictive phrase, &ldquo;by or under Statute.&rdquo;  Personally it does not matter to me.  The Supply Bill will be introduced in the Dáil before any contracts for electricity are given out in any way, and before any arrangements are being made in regard to them.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is introduced to meet a point made by Deputy Gorey in Committee.  It is moved for the special purpose of determining the value of improvements on lands or premises under Section 14.  It was desired to secure that the arbitrator appointed by the Reference Committee should have a knowledge of land values.  As a matter of fact, the Minister will employ officers under the Department of the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture, so that I am not clear <Col N="2201" /> that it improves the section very much. However, if Deputy Gorey prefers the amendment, I will move it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Deputy that it does harm.  At least I suggest to him that it may contain the possibility of harm.  The position will be this: that instead of leaving, as is suggested by the Bill, a Reference Committee consisting of two judicial persons and the Chairman of the Surveyors' Institute to appoint an arbitrator, these three, after consultation with the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, will appoint an arbitrator. Then the Minister for Lands and Agriculture will in fact be giving me his best advice on the question of land values, but the amendment will be giving me people whose advice I may take, and, after taking their advice, I may put forward offers for lands that may be seized for the purpose of the excavation of the canal.  You are putting the Minister for Lands and Agriculture in this invidious position, that he is advising me and giving me an opportunity of having the prices beaten down.  Then you make him consult with the two judicial persons and the Chairman of the Surveyors' Institute to appoint an arbitrator to fix a reasonable price.  I do not know if the Deputy takes the view of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture that is very often taken of Ministers here&mdash;that they are completely and entirely liable to error.  He is putting the Minister in a very unenviable position.  He is advising me on the one hand and advising the arbitrator on the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>My only reason for requiring this is to ensure that this committee, when making a selection, will have a proper class of man appointed.  You have here three persons who know very little about what an expert arbitrator should be in this matter.  We are only taking steps to ensure that somebody should be consulted so that the proper class of man <Col N="2202" /> will be appointed, because we recognise that the arbitration will be final. It is the last appeal and we want to be sure that the proper class of man will be appointed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Deputy that this judicial body is not likely to appoint a person without making some investigation, without finding out whether he has some expert knowledge of land values.  I also suggest another difficulty.  Land is not the only thing falling for valuation and compensation.  The question of fishery interests to be destroyed will also come before the arbitrator appointed by the Reference Committee, and in that case the Minister for Lands and Agriculture would not be a suitable person to advise.  In that case the suitable person would be the Minister for Fisheries.  May I, then, take it that the proper Minister in each case would be brought in to advise the Reference Committee?  I think the Reference Committee had better be left on its own.  They are not likely to appoint a person who will have no knowledge of the matter to be discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is arguing on wrong premises.  This section has reference, not to the taking of land, but to an added charge for the improvement of land by drainage. The arbitrator comes in where the tenant is asked to pay a subsidy to the Government for improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a question of officials at all; it is a case where, in any event, the occupier will have to put up opposition to the Government.  He will be assessed for improvements, and whether <Col N="2203" /> this particular Reference Committee is set up or not it will be the duty of the occupier to make a case against the Government, because the occupier will say that no improvement has taken place, the Government will say that there has been an improvement, and it will inevitably end in opposition. I want to put the Minister clear on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I made a mistake.  I had thought of this in connection with Section 6, instead of Section 14.  Section 14 is applicable to the question of lands benefited by drainage, so that whatever argument I used with reference to officials does not apply.  The other argument does apply.  I leave it to the Deputy whether or not he thinks it wise.  If he thinks it wise the amendment will be accepted.</P>

      <P>This amendment is also introduced to meet the point raised by Deputy Gorey in Committee.

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out that this suggestion is not altogether on all fours with the last amendment, because under this amendment the arbitrator is to be the Minister for Local Government.  Now it appears that he is brought into this section in connection with the preliminary arrangements, and his opinion is to be sought as to whether it is necessary or is not necessary to make a bridge.  Then, in <Col N="2204" /> the event of any differences subsequently between the local authority and the Government on a question of payment, that question is to be settled by the Minister for Local Government.  I objected to that principle when the Bill was going through Committee.  The incorporation of these words makes the Minister for Local Government a party to the arrangement in the first instance and the obtaining of his opinion, to my mind, makes the difficulty of having him the arbitrator all the more objectionable. The position is under this clause that in the event of a difference between the Government and the local authority a member of the Government, that is, the Minister for Local Government, is brought in to decide between the two parties.  That, to my mind, is exceedingly unwise.  Therefore, I would urge that an effort should be made to try to keep the Minister for Local Government as much apart as possible from an arrangement that may lead up to the difference, that he should not be made a party, as this amendment would make him, to the matter in the first instance.</P>

      <P>This point was raised on an amendment which was moved by Deputy Duggan in Committee, to which Deputy Gorey took exception. After the amendment had been debated for some time I put forward a suggestion which was agreed to, and Deputy Gorey said: &ldquo;I think I could accept that.&rdquo;  It was some time after that that Deputy Good again intervened and said: &ldquo;If there is a dispute, will it not be between the Government, acting on behalf of the Shannon scheme, and the local authority?&rdquo; I replied: &ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; and he went on: &ldquo; Do you suggest that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health&mdash;a Government Minister &mdash;would be a reasonable arbitrator if there is a dispute?&rdquo;  That point lapsed, and the only point I was disposed to meet, the only point I gave notice to meet, was the point made by Deputy Gorey.  My way out of it was this, that a bridge conferring substantial advantages would not be built until after consultation with the Minister for Local Government.  When <Col N="2205" /> the Minister for Local Government thinks that a bridge conferring these substantial advantages should be built we will look upon him as the protector of the local authority; if he says it is sound it will proceed, and naturally the local authority will have to pay. While you will still have the Minister as arbitrator, the items on which arbitration will be necessary are reduced almost to a minimum.</P>

      <P>I cannot separate my private from my public views.  I would say that as far as the local authority is concerned it will have two runs for its money.  In the first place, if the Minister for Local Government were to state originally that the bridge or road is not required, I think the case of the Minister for Industry and Commerce for imposing the liability on the local authority goes by the board immediately. He must first convince the Minister for Local Government apparently, as far as the amendment is concerned. To my mind that is an admirable and well-worded safeguard for local authorities.  Having done that the question of arbitration is a simple matter, and I am sure he has not got to present the Minister for Local Government with the problem to be solved and the apportionment to be made, but rather he must satisfy him originally that the thing is an absolute necessity as far as the local authority is concerned.</P>

The firm have very little play with us under them.  One point that arose for interpretation is the point that was raised in letters, including the letter which was circulated to Deputies to-day.  That is the question of Clause 13.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak on the final stage of the Shannon Bill, but I think it seems to me to savour of the procedure that is being adopted in connection with this Bill all through, that it should be rushed through its final stages without even comment from anybody.  This Bill now has gone through its various stages and it is due a valedictory address from this House on its having run its course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like that it should go through the House without comment from anybody and therefore I would like to make a few remarks on the subject.  This Bill was brought into the House by the Government, and I hope nobody will underestimate its importance as far as the country is concerned.  On becoming law it puts into operation a very large scheme, for better or for worse, of great importance to the country&mdash;for better if it forwards the proposals claimed for it, for worse if it saddles the country with a very large amount of charges for the maintenance and upkeep of the scheme as a whole.  It has been brought in by the Government and we must take it that the Government represent the considered opinion of the electors of the country.  It has been received by the Government Party with enthusiasm. As far as this House is concerned I think the responsibility and the credit, if credit is due, largely rest with Deputy Johnson and the Labour Party when having taken up the position of absenting themselves as critics they have come into the Government Lobby wholeheartedly as supporters of the Government.  Deputy Johnson has thought well to apologise for the fact that he finds himself supporting the Government.  As leader of the official Opposition his action carries with it not a little responsibility, because both in this House and outside Deputy Johnson's opinion carries weight.  At all events, had he been in a critical mood he would probably have had support for criticisms which other parties have <Col N="2209" /> brought forward uselessly.  The Farmers' Party are, I think, non-committal on this.  I do not think that they are clear in their own minds as to whether they voice the views of the people they represent or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like an explanation of that.  We know quite well what the views of the people are that we represent, and I think Deputy Hewat should withdraw that statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Heffernan wants me to withdraw.  If I have made an imputation on the Farmers' Party that is not warranted, I willingly withdraw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hewat said that we did not represent the views of the people we are here to represent on this Bill.  Is not that an imputation on the Farmers' Party? Will he withdraw that imputation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very glad to withdraw that if I had made it, but I have not.  The Bill is committing the country to a large expenditure at a time when such a large expenditure is of material, and I think of vital, importance to the people of the country. The expenditure is based on a certain report which we must accept as being the views of the people who promote the scheme and the critics who examined it.  On the other hand, it is perfectly notorious that the cost of large engineering works, more especially when they deal with a water supply, are not very easy to calculate exactly to the penny.  I am concerned with the expenditure of a very large amount of money, coming on the top of many other proposals, with the expenditure of capital in connection with the needs of the Free State.  As to whether one should take precedence of the other is a moot point, but as far as the raising of the money is concerned I venture to <Col N="2210" /> think that the raising of those large sums of money within the Saorstát at the present time will not be as easy as the Minister for Industry and Commerce anticipates, and as the Minister for Finance indicates.</P>
      <P>It has been said here, and in other places, that there is a large amount of money lying in the banks of this country.  That may be so, but, in my judgment, it is, to a great extent, money which is not going to be taken out of the banks of the country for schemes of this kind.  I hope I may be wrong in that, because, of course, the importance of getting money for improvements is fairly obvious.  But, when you say that there is a large amount of money in the banks, I ask the Dáil to recognise that that money cannot be laid hands on.  I should certainly imagine that the money would be less available according as the demands on it increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now as regards the scheme itself there are, of course, differences of opinion, and, at this stage, I am not entering into any criticism on that subject.  The measure has passed through the Committee Stage, and, I think, has elicited all the criticism that is likely to be of any use at the present time.  I would emphasise the fact that in the Dáil the Deputies have been enthusiastic and have met the desire of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in pushing the Bill through to completion in the shortest possible time.  The whole scheme is based on the provision of electricity through the country as a whole.  In my opinion the whole question is whether the means justify the end.  The scheme is based on the optimistic forecast of the Minister, I think, that he will supply a long-felt want of the people of the country.  I rather question whether in many parts of the country the scheme will be availed of as regards the power supply. Certainly I doubt very much that it will be availed of within the period that it is estimated the scheme as a whole will be a paying proposition. The Minister, in this matter, has been led into comparisons with other countries.  I would be very glad if he were right and that the comparison were applicable here.  Personally, I <Col N="2211" /> doubt if, first of all, the scheme will be put into operation with as little trouble as the Minister seems to think.  I doubt very much if the headline afforded by the scheme will be adopted in the country as a whole.  I doubt that industries will grow up rapidly to absorb the current that is to be produced.  I refer to new industries, because the owners of old industries cannot be expected&mdash;even where the application of electricity might be desirable&mdash;to scrap all their present arrangements at a moment's notice.  I doubt, therefore, if new industries will grow like mushrooms, as the Minister seems to expect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I specially said I did not expect that, and I was criticised for saying it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then &ldquo;as the Minister did not say.&rdquo;  If the Minister says that industries are not going to grow up, then I say that the needs of the scheme are not as urgent as other needs which confront us.  It is a question if the same amount of money were spent in other directions whether better results would not be attained&mdash;that is, if the Minister repeats that he does not expect industries to grow up.  The real argument in favour of this supply, in mass, of electricity from the Shannon, for the use of the community as a whole, fails if it does not incite the people to greater industry, and so help the progress of the country.  The farmers, I think, are not likely to take the current to any considerable extent in the early stages at all events.  As far as Dublin is concerned, I have said all I want to say in Committee Stage. But I am dealing with the scheme as a whole and its effect on the country, and with the expenditure of this amount of money.  If there is a possibility that the scheme, or the construction of the works, is going to cost considerably more than the amount of money that is estimated; if you consider that, in operation, the scheme is not going to produce, within the time specified, the revenue that is expected, then I say you have to recognise that for a considerable time it is going to be <Col N="2212" /> a charge on the country and a charge on the taxpayer.  And that will have to be measured by the amount of benen that is going to accrue from the operation of the scheme as a whole.  I think this matter&mdash;which has passed so lightly, if I may say so, through the Dáil&mdash;is of great moment and of great importance to the future of the country. In so far as that is so, and in so far as the judgment of the Dáil is right &mdash;and it seems to be pretty unanimous &mdash;we must look forward with hopefulness to the operation of the scheme.  I personally consider that it is due to myself to express some doubt on these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to say anything on this stage of the Bill.  However, owing to the action that Deputy Hewat has taken, I feel that it is up to me, as the member of the Dáil who proposed the amendment to refer the Bill to a committee for further consideration, to give my point of view. In expressing that point of view, I will be also expressing, I think, the view of my Party.  On the introduction of this scheme, our view was that it should receive the greatest possible consideration and should not be allowed to pass through the Oireachtas until the majority of members of the Oireachtas were firmly convinced that the scheme was perfectly sound, both economically and from an engineering point of view. We protested, on the introduction of the scheme, when the Minister asked for authority to go ahead.  We put in our protest at that stage and we would have voted to support our protest at that time were it not for the fact that the debate concluded late on Friday night, and that, owing to illness and other causes, there was only a very small number of our Party present.  In consequence, we did not, at that stage, put it to a vote.  On the Second Reading, in pursuance of our decision, we did put the question to a vote.  Although I still hold the opinions which I held in the beginning, I have, to a certain extent, been convinced by the sincerity of the Minister and by the knowledge of the subject which he has displayed, that if this scheme, as it stands, can be made a success, it will be made a success. <Col N="2213" /> That being our view, we did not see that there was any use in obstructing further the passage of the Bill.  We realised that the Government had passed the scheme and were determined to put it through and, having made our protest, we saw no further use in obstruction or attempting to prevent the passage of the Bill.  Now that the Bill has passed the Dáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson knows very well what I mean.  We know it will pass the Dáil, that the country is committed to it and that we are committed to it.  Our hope is that the scheme will be a success.  We are not particularly anxious to put ourselves in the position, as Deputy Hewat has done, of saying: &ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; if anything goes wrong.  We trust the scheme will be a success, and we think that there are reasonable possibilities of its being a success.  We are not sure that the measure can be confined within the limits of the finance set out, but we trust such will be the case and we sincerely hope that the scheme will prove, if anything, a greater success than is anticipated.  On our part, we will give the Government all the help we can, now that we are committed to the scheme, to make it the success we want to see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hewat is opposing this Bill.  He would like to see the Bill defeated.  But he was not prepared, on the preliminary stage, nor is he prepared now, to put the House to the test, and to vote against the Bill.  If I had the view which Deputy Hewat has rather inferred than definitely expressed&mdash;that of blank opposition to the Bill&mdash;or if I had the views of Deputy Heffernan&mdash;not quite so blank, but slightly variegated and shot with hesitation&mdash;I would oppose the Bill in its final stage, I would have a division, and I would have my name recorded as opposing the Bill.  As has been pointed out, it is a very important legislative measure.  If the Deputies want to put themselves right with posterity, they should challenge a division, <Col N="2214" /> and have their names recorded as being opposed to the Bill.  It is, perhaps, worth nothing that the Journals of the House do not give the speeches. They only give the names of those who oppose, and Deputies who do not oppose will be assumed to have supported the Bill.  I would suggest to Deputy Hewat and Deputy Heffernan&mdash;but particularly to Deputy Hewat, who is clearly opposed to the Bill&mdash;that he should have his name recorded in the division on the Journals of the House as being in opposition to this Bill.  I appreciate the compliment he paid respecting responsibility for the Bill having got through to the present stage with so little alteration and with much general approval.  I would inform Deputy Hewat that, so far from apologising for having been found in the Government Lobby in support of this Bill, I am extremely proud of it. I would be proud to be found in the Lobby in support of any Bill of equal possibilities and equal merit, even if promoted by Deputy Hewat.  I think the Bill is one which will bring very great benefit to the country. The cost of the scheme proposed in the Bill is not such that it should make anyone hesitate.  If a commercial undertaking were to try to raise five and a quarter million pounds for a scheme with the possibilities that this scheme has, Deputy Hewat would be the most fervent advocate of the proposal. I am surprised at his harping upon the financial difficulty, and suggesting that this scheme will restrict capital expenditure on other reconstructive schemes.  Does Deputy Hewat mean that if this scheme were not put into operation, and that the finances which this scheme will call for were left unabsorbed, that there are ready and waiting schemes of equal merit and of equal nation-building value to use up that money?  I think we should have some indication from Deputy Hewat as to whether there are schemes waiting which would call for this amount of money, and which would give something like equal value from a national reconstructive standpoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the claim has been <Col N="2215" /> made by anybody that this scheme is going to supply a long-felt want.  So far from the need being long-felt, it has never been felt.  It is a need that has not been realised.  I submit we are doing now what the commercial element in the country, if they were really living up to their responsibilities and their claims, should have done long ago in one form or another.  We see almost every country with any claims to civilisation, and some countries which have no claim to civilisation, bounding forward in regard to hydro-electric development.  Proposals are being pressed upon the Governments of every country in this respect&mdash;America, Australia, Africa, Japan, and many other countries.  Deputy Hewat would say that we must go slowly, that we must wait.  We must wait until commercial interests have found it possible to do this thing and to find the money cheaply, not to embarrass governments and parliaments&mdash; to wait, wait, wait until the country has had time to become decrepit.</P>
    <P>I believe that the scheme is one which will succeed in reviving industry, sustaining industries which would otherwise decay, but, more important, will generate a new spirit through generating a new environment.  I believe the social value of this scheme is of even more importance than the economic value, but I believe the economic value to be great.  I am proud to have had the commendation from Deputy Hewat that any action taken from these benches in regard to the scheme has helped it forward.  We believe that the scheme is going to help to make the country a country we will be more proud than ever to live in. Again I say, if Deputy Hewat, or any Deputy who thinks as he thinks, wants to have his name recorded as opposing the Bill, he ought to call for a division on this final stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point about the opposition of Deputy Hewat to this Bill that requires to be more particularly drawn attention to. <Col N="2216" /> The attitude of Deputy Heffernan is that having opposed the Bill, once the scheme is going to be put into operation, he and those associated with him propose to support it to the utmost of their ability.  It seems to me that the attitude at any rate suggested in Deputy Hewat's speech is that, having opposed the Bill to the best of his ability, he now proposes to oppose the scheme, and to put as many obstacles in the way of the carrying out of the scheme as he can.  I can place no other interpretation on the remarks he made than that he would like to queer the pitch of this scheme, financially, if he could, whether in order to save us from the disaster supposed to be latent in this scheme or not I do not know.  But it is desirable that we should be clear as to what Deputy Hewat's final words on this Bill were, representing, as he is supposed to do, the financial and commercial classes. He puts it up to us as his final word that money will not be made available in Ireland for this Bill; that the power it is proposed to generate under this scheme will not be used by the people, and that the scheme itself will cost more than it has appeared to the Dáil that it is going to cost.  Put up in the way in which the Deputy has put it up, I repeat it seems to me that he suggests opposition to this scheme after opposing the Bill.  Just as it is advisable, if people want to oppose a Bill, that they should record their opposition to the Bill, I think it is very advisable from the point of view of the success of the scheme and the wellbeing of the country that we should know, as far as we can, who are going to oppose and endeavour to interfere with the scheme when it comes to be put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the suggestion that the putting into operation of the scheme is going to swallow finance that would otherwise be available for promoting other schemes, my opinion is that the putting into operation of this scheme will suggest to people who have money to invest, that if there is instability in the country, whether arising from environment or from certain economic conditions, the putting into operation of this scheme is going to remove some <Col N="2217" /> of that instability.  The prospect of that instability being removed will result not only in money being forthcoming for the Shannon scheme, but money that would be held back if the Shannon scheme was not put into operation, because of doubts as to whether conditions here were sufficiently stable to invest money in business ventures, will in addition, I feel sure, be put into other schemes, many of which are awaiting development.  In that respect I think Deputy Hewat, whether deliberately or otherwise, is attempting to spread his own want of faith and heart amongst other people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what Deputy Mulcahy has said, I should just like to make my position clear.  I put more amendments down on the Committee Stage of the Bill than any other Deputy, other than Deputy Duggan, and I put down the only non-official amendment on the Report Stage.  I have always been in favour of producing hydroelectric power on a large scale by means of the Shannon, but I did regard, and I do still regard, the Bill with some misgiving in the exceedingly wide scope of the powers that it gives to the State.  I am old-fashioned enough to regard it as somewhat of a gigantic instalment of State socialism, and therefore I strove, when the Bill was passing through the Dáil, to limit it on that side so far as I could.  I was unsuccessful.  That being so, now that we are committed to this scheme, my earnest prayer is that the scheme may be a success and may redound to the credit of the country and the prosperity of the country.  However, I do not want definitely to take the position of blessing the Bill, because we cannot have seen the last of it.  The Bill will go to the Seanad and may return here with amendments, some of which I may feel inclined to support.  Subject to that reservation, it is my earnest desire that the Bill will become law without delay, and that it may achieve the fondest hopes of the Minister in charge. I just wish to say that, as I have been active in opposition.</P>

      <P>We did not even oppose the Bill.  It was proposed that the scheme should be gone on with without tenders being asked for.  It was that and some other proposals that we opposed.  I do not purpose to follow Deputy Hewat.  From the figures we have had put before us, it would appear that, even though the scheme was never worked, at the most it would mean a loss to the State of £300,000 per year.  As I see it, there may be a possible loss of £100,000 per year, and probably no loss at all.  I should like to know from the Minister for Finance, or some other Minister, what we are paying yearly in unemployment benefit. It would be interesting to know that, so as to make a comparison with the figures given us in connection with this scheme.  The money spent on unemployment is a recurrent expenditure. Except something is done to relieve unemployment that expenditure will be added to considerably.  Deputy Hewat, although he seems to be wearing a mask, ought to be able to see that.</P>

      <P>He erects a sort of wall so that he may only see what he wishes. This is a rather big scheme, but it means the starting of a new effort in this country to create an industrial atmosphere in it.  No one could describe our business men really as business people.  Our business men have merely been distributors.  I do not know that they deserve the title of business men at all.  We want to convert these distributors into producers if it is possible to do so.  We may have to wait until the present generation dies out and until a new generation has come along. <Col N="2219" /> That may be a long wait, but the sooner there is a change the better.  This scheme lays a foundation for industrial development.  It is time to make a beginning. There is one item that I hope will be eliminated from our imports as a result of the scheme, that is foreign coal.  I hope we will eventually be able to do without such coal.  If we could it would help us to square our balance sheet.  I do not propose to join in Deputy Hewat's wail.  He reminded me of a banshee keening over the death of some person.  I look at the scheme from another point of view.  I believe it is going, if it is possible, to give this country a chance of development.  If the country and the people do not avail of that chance it is the fault of the nation and not the fault of the scheme or the Government.  If it is not successful it means that the people of this country are hopeless and that nothing can be done for them.</P>
      <P>I would like to know what is to be gained by adopting the attitude of doing nothing and going slow.  Is that the attitude that developed other countries? Ireland is one of the oldest countries in civilization, but it has not kept time with the march of progress. Why are the new countries going ahead?  If they adopted the attitude of Deputy Hewat would they have gone ahead?  It is time to change the outlook in Ireland, and I hope this scheme will bring about that change.  It provides possibilities for Ireland, and if the people do not avail of these possibilities it is their own fault.  One thing is certain, and that is that people who are out of employment should be able to get employment as a result of this scheme, and that it should give an impetus to the establishment of factories and industries. I see no prospect of loss in the scheme except £50,000 or £100,000, and if that is all we are going to lose we are prepared to lose it.  I say that on behalf of those who will have to pay most of the money, and that is the agricultural community.</P>

      <P>I have refrained from speaking on the financial aspect of the Bill, as I believe the Shannon scheme itself does not raise a problem of financial <Col N="2220" /> magnitude.  We have raised some 13 millions which have been largely used in paying for damage that was done.  That was money for which there was no return from the productive standpoint.  To raise nearly 5¼ millions over a period of three or four years for capital construction is not a matter that will, in my opinion, present the slightest difficulty.  At the start the expenditure will be about £600,000, the next year £700,000, and the following year it will be higher.  There will be about four years during which £5,200,000 may be raised.  In my opinion it will be got without any difficulty whatever.  I think it is unfortunate that Deputy Hewat, time after time, comes into the Dáil and suggests that there is going to be some sort of organised opposition on the part of people who own and control money to the scheme which the Government wishes to carry out.  I believe there will be no such opposition but that there will be, in fact, a spirit of cooperation with the Government in providing whatever capital sum may be necessary.  It is one thing to spend money on objects that will give no return; to borrow for the purpose of some sort of current expenditure, or to borrow for war purposes.  It is another matter to borrow for the construction of capital works.  If you spend your money well on capital works perhaps the bigger your national debt may be within very wide limits the better, provided good value is got. It is bad to have to borrow money for the other purposes.  It is very good to be in a position to borrow it for capital expenditure.  For a country like this, with a revenue of 22 or 23 millions, an expenditure on a capital work of a sum of £5,000,000 is not a matter of any magnitude.  It is looking at the future in a wrong perspective to talk of enormous sums in this connection.  For a small town £5,000,000 would be a very big sum, but £5,000,000 for a State is not a big sum unless it is the case that 5 millions are being wasted.  But 5 millions being invested is not a big sum for the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in this position, that a loan raised here has some of the effects of a foreign loan.  This country has at least <Col N="2221" /> 150 or 160 millions invested abroad. When money is raised for such a purpose as this a good deal of money invested abroad is brought home.  We have actually some of the effects that one can see from foreign borrowing by borrowing at home.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of the Shannon project that I may mention. The whole amount spent on the construction of the works will not go out of the Exchequer without hope of return. Before the canal is dug a good deal of tobacco will be smoked and a good deal of porter will be drunk, and I think we may anticipate a distinct stimulus to the gathering of revenue from the time the work is under construction. That is only a small point, but there is no doubt that the work during its progress, just in the same way as the undertaking of industrial activity in a more permanent way, will stimulate the yield of revenue very much during that time.</P>
    <P>The State will have to borrow for certain other matters this year or next year, the remaining part of our compensation charges, and for certain Army expenditure and other minor matters, but at the end of, say, a year from now we will not be borrowing as far as I can see, for matters other than such matters as constructional works of this nature.  I think that our total National Debt is so small we could easily borrow, not only for works that have been projected, but for any further works that may possibly be undertaken for a considerable time.  Deputy Gorey referred to the expenditure on unemployment benefit.  During the past three years about £3,000,000 has been paid out on unemployment benefit. The revenue of the unemployment fund is about £70,000 per annum.  In addition there has been an advance of £1,200,000 from the Central Fund. £400,000 a year has to be advanced from the Central Fund and, in addition, a considerable amount has been spent on relief works of one sort or another. The way to get rid of that type of very undesirable and unproductive expenditure is to get the country to take a new turn and to get the mind of the country bent on an increase of production and the undertaking of new enterprises. <Col N="2222" /> I think, apart from the direct benefits we will get from cheap light and power from the Shannon, the psychological effect on the country will be most important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point to which I must refer, as I was led into it by a remark when Deputy Hewat was speaking, and that is in connection with new industries.  I said at least three times in this House that the scheme does not necessarily depend on new industries, that it could pay its way, and that all the power necessary to give revenue could be absorbed for the current use for ordinary household purposes along with the present amount used by the tramways in Dublin.  That statement has been distorted, and I have been criticised for an allegation that no industries would be encouraged by having cheap power.  I do not think that I said anything of the sort, unless my interjection to Deputy Hewat to-day might be taken to mean that.  I have always said that it is not necessary that there should be new industries started to make the scheme pay its way. I have been criticised, amongst other papers, by the &ldquo;Journal of the Associated Chambers of Commerce,&rdquo; which held that it is ludicrcus not to encourage existing and the starting of new industries.  Deputy Hewat, apparently, is out of touch with the Chambers of Commerce when they say that.  If I am asked my belief as to new industries &mdash;though I suppose it will not count for anything&mdash;I say that if new industries are not going to be encouraged or started with the cheap power from the Shannon, industries are hardly ever likely to grow up in this country.  If I had to found this scheme on the belief that some people have, that new industries will be started, I would say that that scheme is based on optimism.  I take the safer ground of saying that the scheme can pay its way on the ordinary consumption for household purposes and on the amount at present used by the tramways in Dublin alone. I think that Deputy Hewat will meet with general agreement in one phrase that he used.  He said that great credit should be paid to the Government and, I presume, he means also the Government <Col N="2223" /> Party, and to the Labour Party for this Bill.  I would put the credit a little further&mdash;but, in so far as he restricted it there, I agree with him&mdash; and say that credit is due to the people who started this scheme, who had the vision and courage to support it, who were not defeated, and who were not diverted by many of the jeremiads which Deputy Hewat from time to time gave forth.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gorey referred to unemployment insurance and the Minister for Finance answered him.  Deputy Gorey said a thing which people say casually and such casual statements are constantly taken up by the Press and given scare headlines and put forth as if they were reasoned views on matters.  The Deputy said that we might possibly have to face a loss of from £50,000 to £100,000.  I presume that the Deputy means at the start, and that there is not to be a loss for the next generation. I do not believe that there is going to be any loss.  I have the parting word of the experts that they believe that the partial development would never be completed, because in the constructional period we would find ourselves forced to go on with the second stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, as the Deputy said, afterwards that there would probably be no loss.  I have given many figures here, but I want to give one further figure.  I cannot say that this is an accurate calculation, but I think it is pretty near accuracy, to say that the coal bill at the Pigeon House and the tramways undertaking, in Dublin alone, amounts to between £160,000 and £180,000 per annum.  That is the coal bill alone for the production of electricity, in so far as the Pigeon House and the Dublin tramways are concerned.  There is the other calculation to which I referred over and over again.  This scheme is to provide 90,000 h.p., one horse power being equivalent to nine tons of coal. This will, therefore, provide the equivalent of 810,000 tons of coal. <Col N="2224" /> At 30s. a ton, that is £1,200,000. Capitalise that and it means £25,000,000, and we are going to spend, not £25,000,000 in one year in order to give that equivalent, but to spend £5,000,000 over a three year period, and at the end of it we will have, not these perishable commodities that come in every year, but we will have a lasting, enduring, well-maintained and up-to-date plant.  That is what people baulk at, and they think that the country is not going to rise to this occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Finance Bill.  The Second Reading is normally for the purpose of accepting the general principle of the Bill, and as I might say in the main the general principle of the Finance Bill has been already discussed and accepted by the Dáil when the Financial Resolutions were before it, I do not intend to speak at any great length at the present juncture.  There are certain new provisions in the Bill which will require to have resolutions moved before they can be considered in Committee.  There is, for instance, Section 14, which contains a declaration as to the effect of Section 69 of the Local Government Act of 1925.  Also there are sections dealing with firearms certificate duty; registered firearms dealers' duty; and salmon-dealers' licences duty.  Two of these <Col N="2225" /> clauses arise out of the Firearms Bill which has been passed by this House. And the fourth, Section 39, is inserted because it is felt by the Minister for Fisheries that a certain duty should be paid by the people who take out salmon-dealers' licences in order that there may not be a multiplicity of applications by irresponsible people. These four clauses will require resolutions. They will be moved next week, and must be passed, or the sections must be eliminated when the Bill comes up for consideration in Committee. I do not propose, therefore, to deal with these particular sections at the present moment.  With regard to the scheme of the Bill as a whole, I would like to say that we have gone as far as it is possible for us to go in the way of giving remission of taxation. It will not be possible in the Committee Stage to accept any amendment involving any substantial loss of revenue.  If we did accept, or if the Dáil were to accept such amendments, it would be necessary to consider what extended duties might be imposed with a view of making up the loss.  A certain number of matters were raised on report of the resolutions to which I promised to give consideration, and without going in very much into details at this stage I would like to refer briefly to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell had down a proposal that an allowance of £80 in income tax should be given for all children over sixteen at schools or colleges.  That was an amendment for which I felt a certain amount of sympathy, but I have gone into the cost of it since, and I find as far as we can estimate the cost would amount to about £60,000 per annum.  An absolutely accurate figure could have been got if we had time for all the Inspectors of Taxes to go over all last year's papers and find out in respect of how many children of that age an allowance should be given, and what the allowance should amount to. At any rate it is estimated that there are some 9,000 children in respect of whom the allowance would have to be given, and the average amount of tax that would be lost per child is estimated <Col N="2226" /> at about £7, and that would amount to a loss in revenue of a sum of £63,000 per annum.  The loss is so large, therefore, that it would not be possible to give the remission.  There are at the intermediate schools 8,000 children; at national schools 6,000 over sixteen years of age; at training schools for teachers 600; whole-time attendants at technical schools, about 100; and at university colleges 3,300, making a total of 18,000.  The existing allowance is £36 for the first child, and £27 for the second.  The proposal was to increase the allowance to £80.  It may be taken, therefore, that the average increase would be about £48 additional for each child.  In certain cases a person entitled to claim in respect of a child would be charged only on the balance of his income at 2/- per £.  In some instances he would be paying a tax at the 4/- rate.  We are estimating that on the average the increased allowance may be taken at 3/-, on the 18,000 children, or young people, concerned. It may be assumed that the 6,000 attending the national schools are the children of people who are exempt from income tax.  Of the remaining 12,000 we are assuming that 3,000 would come into the same category. There would be 9,000 children in respect of whom the allowance would be operative at the rate of £7 each child, amounting in all, as I have said, to a sum of £63,000 per annum.  I think it will be evident to anyone who considers the figures I put forward in the Budget statement that we went so far with remissions of taxation that it would not be possible to grant a concession of this sort, or if we did so we would have to make up our minds to look for additional revenue by new imposts.</P>
    <P>On the question of imported furniture bequeathed by will, consideration of the matter has convinced us that it would be extremely difficult to administer exemption, and that the question as to whether the furniture imported was the furniture actually bequeathed or not would create great difficulties. That view of the case would arise, and on the whole it was thought undesirable to make the provision suggested by Deputy Bryan Cooper. <Col N="2227" /> Deputy Johnson suggested we should exempt from stamp duty employees' wages receipts.  I think he suggested that the exemption in that case should apply only to civil servants.  My opinion is that it would not be possible to give the exemption to civil servants and not give it to other employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>My suggestion was that it should be deleted altogether, for in practice it applies only to civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is correct.  It is not done very much in the case of weekly wage earners outside civil servants.  In some cases it is done as the duty is collected through the Post Office by means of ordinary postage stamps.  It is extremely difficult to estimate what the cost of the concession would be.  The best attempt we can make at it is that it would be something over £10,000 per annum, and it simply becomes a question whether it is possible to give that concession or not.  If the Dáil were not to be very strongly in favour of any other concession, it might be possible to stretch to the length of this particular line, but it would not be possible to give this concession, in addition to two or three other concessions, costing a similar sum of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give us any basis for his calculation of that figure of £10,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Civil Service figure is in the neighbourhood of £6,000, and it is estimated that there will be a sum of £4,000 at least lost if the stamp duty is wiped out altogether in the case of other employees in the country.  With regard to the repeal of Section 6 of the Finance Act of 1923, the position is that we have not yet reached the state of public mind in the country where it would be either desirable or possible to do without the powers given us by that section.  That is the section which provides for the collection of income tax through deductions by employers.  During the eighteen months or so that it has been in operation we have collected through it <Col N="2228" /> a sum of about £44,000.  There is no doubt that probably an equal sum has come in because the powers under that section were in existence.</P>
      <P>We have budgeted this year for a more expeditious collection of arrears of income tax.  If income tax arrears do not come in more quickly this year than they did last year, we will be faced with a certain deficit at the end of the year.  It is not to be doubted that if we were to repeal this section a substantial amount of tax would not only not be collected this year, but would be lost altogether.  Generally, the people concerned by it are those who have no goods on which distraint could be made. The only other remedy, apart from this section, against people of that kind would be that of sending them to jail. There are, of course, very summary powers for the imprisonment of these people, but it would not be a practicable matter to imprison some hundreds of people for the non-payment of income tax.  We have, of course, from time to time sent individuals to jail. Were we to collect a certain amount of tax from the class of people affected by this by sending substantial numbers of them to jail&mdash;by keeping, say, an average of 50 of them in jail&mdash;then it would become a matter for the Minister for Justice to find accommodation for them, but that, I suggest, is not a satisfactory way of dealing with this. On the other hand, it certainly is not satisfactory to allow people who are bound to pay income tax to escape the payment of it.  It would not be satisfactory either, in our circumstances, to lose anything between fifty and one hundred thousand pounds income tax in the year.  In the course of three or four years, if people have come to realise that income tax must be paid and will be collected, if there is a better state of public opinion about, and that you will not have something like a tacit conspiracy to resist the payment of income tax such as exists in many places at present, then we might repeal this section and rely on other powers of recovery.  But we have come to the conclusion that, at the present time, it is not one of the changes we can afford to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2229" /> During the discussion on the Financial Resolutions there was a question raised as to the possibility of an evasion of the duty on bottles by sending in bottles containing water, and of getting them out of the category of empty bottles by that means.  That is a question that has been examined.  We have come to the conclusion that if people did fill bottles with ordinary water, or anything like that, corked them and sent them in, that not only would they not escape the duty, but they could be prosecuted for attempting to evade the payment of it.  I think the dangers that were feared there are amply provided against.  There is a new charging provision, which I did not mention before, in the Finance Bill.  It provides for a flat Customs duty on sugar preparations. At present a large number of articles containing sugar are taxed on the amount of the sugar content. That involves very great difficulties.  It involves a great amount of sampling and analysis, and in some cases, to avoid sampling and analysis, there is a fixing of a rate of duty for certain preparations. In order that the rate of duty may be fixed, the manufacturer has to submit a formula to the Customs authority as well as samples, and he has to agree not to vary the formula used in the manufacture.  Even in cases like that, there has to be check sampling to see that he does not actually vary the formula.  The result of that is, that there are seventeen hundred different rates, and the amount of tax collected at present from these preparations, if the law were to be unaltered, would be about £6,000.  It is estimated that the cost of the collection runs very near to that total of £6,000. Now it is proposed to charge all these duties at the rate of one penny per pound, or ten pence per gallon, if liquids.  That will mean that they will not get the full benefit of the reduction in the duty on sugar, but they will get a certain advantage.  The average duty charged on preparations heretofore was about 11/2 per cwt., while that will now be 9/4 per cwt.&mdash;the full penny per pound on sugar.  In many cases the importers and manufacturers will regard the change as an advantage, because it <Col N="2230" /> will remove the necessity for the various restrictions and for the delays in samples and wrong assessment, and the disputes which arose in the past. There is power, as a matter of fact, for the Revenue Commissioners to charge the full sugar duty under the existing Customs Acts.  If it is necessary to safeguard the revenue, the Revenue Commissioners may charge at the full rate any article containing dutiable ingredients; that is a thing containing 5 per cent. of tobacco may be charged the full tobacco duty.  All these powers are seldom or never used.  It is a reserve power that the Revenue Commissioners have for the purpose of seeing that the Revenue is not defrauded.  It is not proposed to use that power, but we intend to ask the Dáil specifically to enact a flat rate of one penny per pound on all these preparations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It deals with the preparations.  This is a power which is not used.  It may have to be used on occasions, but it is a power not used or expected to be used.  The change suggested will give an additional revenue of about £8,000, and certain savings in administration charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Budget statement I showed a net surplus, after providing for the various remissions of taxation, amounting to £11,000.  We add the amount that will be got by this particular change to that, and we get a net surplus of something like £20,000.  I propose, as I think I promised to the Dáil, to extend the exemption from entertainment tax, not only to events promoted by the Gaelic Athletic Association, but also to Rugby and Soccer and other outdoor games.  The cost of that concession will be £10,000.  There will be, therefore, unless we are prepared to impose fresh taxation of some sort, available for all the concessions that <Col N="2231" /> Deputies may desire to press for during the Committee stage, only about £10,000.  Deputies may think we should not have given remissions to the full extent of the money available in the way we did, but I think perhaps in the existing circumstances it was desirable. It might have been argued that we should have kept a margin of, say, £100,000, and that the Budget would not have been so rigid a structure in that case as it is at the present time.  We felt, however, that the first thing was that some relief in taxation should be given.</P>

      <P>I will see their propositions. No relief in taxation had been given since the establishment of the Saorstát, and we felt we were really at a point when the country is beginning to give its mind very definitely to economic matters, to the development of the resources and to the establishment of new enterprises and new industry, and that the utmost concessions should be given in the way of taxation consistent with the prospect of being able to continue the reduction, and of being in the position of not having to increase the taxation next year.  During the present year, and, say, the next year, we are going to depend a good deal upon the collection of the arrears of income tax.  At the end of the next year that reservoir will have dried up.  It is quite possible, also, that the protective duties that we have imposed will not be a yielding revenue to a very large extent.  No doubt, if they have been successful in bringing about the establishment of new industries, the increased wages paid will lead to increased yield of various taxes, and what we may lose upon protective tariffs themselves we may gain as an actual result of the stimulation of industry which they will have provided.</P>

We certainly can go no further with any safety at all, and with any certainty that we will not have to retrace our steps, in the remission of taxation that has been done by the Budget.</P>
      <P>We did set aside a certain sum to meet unfavourable contingencies, but that sum was not excessive when Deputies remember that we have got at the present time such things as a demand for assistance in connection with the losses to farmers whose flocks have suffered from fluke, the demand that comes from particular areas where there is distress, at the present time, and the possibility that relief will have to be carried out during the winter in various districts.</P>

      <P>There will be a demand and a need for expenditure in many ways.  I think I have already mentioned elsewhere the question of a compulsory School Attendance Bill.  There is no doubt that if that Bill is passed it will involve the employment of increased numbers of teachers and increased expenditure.  The increments of the secondary teachers will go up automatically.  The Civic Guards are a young body and very far from the top of their scale, and the ordinary increment the men receive annually will be an increased charge.  It will not be easy at all to avoid the necessity of new charges at the end of a couple of years.  They certainly cannot be avoided, unless there is improvement generally in the country, unless there are new industries and unless there is an increase in the productivity both in industry and in agriculture as I believe there will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the various steps that have been taken in legislation, and the various agricultural Bills passed will result in an increase of productivity.  I believe the sugar beet experiment will lead to increased productivity though it will be at considerable immediate <Col N="2233" /> cost to the State, I believe that the Shannon Electricity Scheme, and the protective tariffs that we have tried will also lead to increased productivity and, as far as one can foresee, enable us to continue the present scale of taxation to which we have got down.  I think it is the stern fact that Deputies in the Dáil must realise that there is absolutely no use in proposing changes or concessions of taxes which will involve big losses in the revenue unless those who propose them are prepared to propose measures that will give us the revenue that has been lost.  It will never serve this Government to budget the deficit on ordinary expenditure. We may budget to borrow for capital work, or abnormal or non-recurrent expenditure, but we must arrange to raise by taxation all that is required for normal expenditure.  We are going to borrow for certain things, like compensation, for the Shannon scheme, for the Barrow drainage when it is gone on with, and for other drainage works of that kind, and we may have to borrow for housing.  There are other possibilities of that kind, and we must be in the position to have the confidence of people who have money to invest. If we are not conducting our finances on sound and reasonable lines there is no doubt that the possibility of getting money on fair and reasonable terms by borrowing will disappear.  We can now get it on good terms.  It is now possible to face a project like the Shannon scheme without any hesitation or doubt, because we know we can borrow money on terms that will enable the project to pay.</P>
    <P>If we got ourselves into the position, as we easily might, where we would have to pay, not 5¼ per cent., but 7 or 8 per cent. for our money, proposals like the Shannon scheme would bear a different aspect altogether.  Consequently there is no possibility now of giving additional remissions of taxation. We may give remissions of taxation and substitute new taxes of some sort in their place; but we cannot budget for less revenue than we have budgeted for.</P>

      <P>During the debate on the Financial Resolutions I asked the Minister <Col N="2234" /> to consider one aspect of the question. It arose particularly in connection with the duty on apparel.  I pointed out, on that occasion, that there was a considerable trade done from Dublin with the North of Ireland and elsewhere and, as the tariff stands at the moment, these items coming into the Saorstát are all subject to duty.  If there is no refund of that duty when those items are sold out of the Free State it is quite obvious that we will lose that trade in the Free State.  I stressed that point particularly with the Minister, as I have said, when the Financial Resolutions were before the house.  I know that he has since received many resolutions and, I am sure, a great many deputations on this subject. He has not mentioned this important question at all this afternoon. As I pointed out before, it is a trade of very considerable importance.  The Minister has stated, and very properly, that he cannot accept any alteration of his proposals that would mean a loss of duty.  Now, let me point out that no loss will accrue in this particular instance. If the Minister must get this duty it is quite obvious that the traders will lose this trade.  A customer in the North of Ireland is not going to pay 15 per cent. more for purchasing an article in Dublin than that article can be purchased for in London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister adheres to this particular proposal, this trade coming through Dublin at the moment will be lost to Dublin.  There is no use in the Minister saying that if he makes a refund of the duty it will be money returned. It is not money returned in a sense, because the article is only passing through the Free State, and if the Minister stops the sale of that article he stops the duty that would be charged coming in, and, of course, the trader does not get the refund when it is going out.  In cutting off that trade he is really doing an injury.  He is, at least, injuring the trade of the city and of several towns in Ireland; he is even, to some extent, injuring the trade of some of the large towns of Southern Ireland and he is giving rise to unemployment. I am sure that very considerable pressure has been brought to <Col N="2235" /> bear on the Minister by those engaged in the trade during the last few weeks. I would be very glad to know from the Minister what he now proposes to do in connection with this important matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to say that I agree with every word that the Minister has stated in regard to borrowing.  I realise the difficulty of his position.  He has budgeted to a very narrow margin indeed, and he has no power to make any concessions.  I want to lay before the Minister and the Dáil one or two general considerations with reference to our fiscal system which are apposite to this Bill.  The last dozen years have seen a revolution in our fiscal system.  Some 12 years ago, in the year 1913, indirect taxation was based on the principle of taxing half a dozen articles of common use.  They were taxed mainly in bulk. Tea, coffee, sugar, tobacco, whiskey, beer and porter were the principal articles of indirect taxation, and the tax was levied mainly by weight.  They were goods handled by warehousemen and bottlers, and not, as a rule, by the ordinary retailer, and bought through a middleman.  Therefore, the collection of the tax was an easy matter.  The Revenue Commissioners had only to deal with a certain number of people, all of whom were trading on a very considerable scale and who were in the position of being readily able to acquaint themselves of any regulations that would be issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we come to 1925, when the whole basis of taxation was altered.  It was not first altered by the Minister; it was altered by the European War and by the introduction of the M'Kenna duties; but the process has grown up until it reaches its culmination in the Bill that we have before us. We are taxing a multitude of articles, not of uniform quality, but of various sizes and descriptions and kinds&mdash; articles varying intensely in many degrees; we are taxing them, not in bulk or weight, but by <i>ad valorem</i> duties, which is a more complicated matter.  It means that every single article has to be valued and assessed.  To ascertain <Col N="2236" /> the tax on tea or sugar by weight was an easy matter.  The value of a pair of boots or of a glass bottle is a much more difficult matter to ascertain, because the variety in quality is so great. I do not want to over-emphasise that, but I do emphasise that the whole thing has become infinitely more complicated during the last 12 years. Taxation has now entered far more into the life of the ordinary man than it did 12 years ago.  At that time he was accustomed to paying for certain articles at a certain price and he knew that that price varied a little occasionally, but remained stable on the whole. Now taxation enters far more into a man's life, from the time he leaves his house in the morning until he returns to it at night.  The Minister attempted to convert me.  He told me that he had taken off as many duties, almost, as he had put on.  He instanced the case of chloroform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There were five or six other articles in addition to chloroform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned chloroform and similar preparations to chloroform.  Chloroform and similar preparations to chloroform are useful enough in operations when a person may be ill; but they do not enter into the life of the ordinary individual, unless, perhaps, he be a hypochondriac, as much as boots, soap, chairs or clothes do.  Now I quite recognise that the country, and the majority of Deputies in the Dáil, are in favour of this experiment of protection.  They hope that it will develop our industries and that it will give employment to many people who are unemployed.  I am not unsusceptible to that side of the question.  I was moved very much indeed by Deputy Mrs. Collins O'Driscoll's arguments when we were discussing this matter before.  At the same time, I do think that if we make this experiment we should realise all the implications of this policy of widespread protection, because it is widespread protection.  We are still collecting our revenue with the machinery set up for the comparatively few, simple, indirect taxes that we collected 12 years ago.  We are using the <Col N="2237" /> same machinery, slightly modified, for the collection of a great multitude of complicated taxes.</P>
      <P>I do not think the officials who are charged with the very onerous, unpleasant and responsible duty of collecting taxes realise fully how the shoe pinches the ordinary individual.  They are not now dealing with the big men who imported in bulk, but with hundreds and hundreds of small shopkeepers all over the country and thousands of individuals who get their goods in by post.  I think that the machinery needs a little remodelling, and I think there are two directions in which I think we should remodel it. The first is when we are imposing a customs duty of any kind, the articles on which that duty is to be levied should definitely be specified.  We should not satisfy ourselves with a phrase like &ldquo;wearing apparel&rdquo; or a phrase like &ldquo;furniture&rdquo; and leave those phrases to be interpreted by the Revenue authorities.  That is, if I may call it so, legislative laziness.  We should ourselves lay down a schedule specifying the various articles to be taxed.  Deputy Figgis suggested such a course in regard to clothing.  That should have been made more general with regard to furniture.  We should not leave the interpretation of matters to the Revenue Commissioners.  It is an unfair responsibility to leave that on their shoulders and it means that we are shirking our own duty.  Also, it produces some very unsatisfactory results.  For instance, which of us, when the Financial Resolutions were under discussion, realised that by imposing a duty on furniture we were imposing a duty on imported brushes? There was one person in the Dáil who did not, and that was the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain, then, why he said on page 356 of the Official Report of the 24th April, &ldquo;We have all these industries clamouring for protection&mdash;brushes and brassware, iron-founding and polish-making, paper-making and agricultural implements, carriages, vehicles, <Col N="2238" /> matches,&rdquo; etc.  Then he said: &ldquo;I certainly feel that a lot of these industries have no real possibility of growth before them, and that it would be simply burthening the community to protect them.&rdquo;  He included in the category of goods he was not going to tax brushes, brasses, artificial manures and matches, and now we are told he is going to tax these brushes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>We are taxing such brushes as are included in the term furniture; we are not going to exclude many goods.  You could pick out a dozen, or a hundred things if you liked, that would not come within the definition of furniture.  We do not propose to exclude anything that comes properly within the definition of furniture.  Hair-brushes, tooth-brushes and shaving-brushes, that are not furniture, will not be taxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made my case.  How, in the name of wonder, is any Deputy to know the kind of brushes included under the term of furniture, and what is not?  Is there any dictionary that will tell us? That is my point, that we should be specific on the matter.  It is the same with wearing apparel.  I will pass away from that for the moment.  Hair-brushes are not to be taxed.  Then there is a small article called an egg-whip. It is made of metal, but it has a small wooden handle, and the value of the wood in that handle is being taxed as furniture at the present time. Did anybody imagine when we were imposing these taxes that egg-whips were to be taxed?  I believe that strainers would also come within that category.  I do not know whether children's toys or bread-knives with wooden handles come within it or not. None of us know, and, therefore, I wish we were specific on this point.  By making our duties more definite we shall gain another advantage.  We shall be able to protect industries that really need protection, and that are capable of development, without putting duties on a multitude of things that we are never likely to produce. Take these handles of egg-whips.  Does anybody suppose that any person will <Col N="2239" /> set up a factory in the Free State for the manufacture of handles of egg-whips? It is most improbable.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce made a strong case with regard to protection of ready-made suits.  I think he made his case.  He could have made an equally strong case for hosiery, but is there any reason why we should tax Deputy Good's Paris models, that are never likely to be made in this country?  The Minister has a hope that sometime we might start a fashion of our own.  The fact that New York and Chicago have to import their Paris models and have not considered it worth while to establish a factory for the production of these models, seems to indicate that it is unlikely that we shall strike out in this matter and establish a factory for the manufacture of such models.  We should say exactly what we are taxing, and we should not leave it to the Revenue Commissioners to decide what wearing apparel is.  I presume that on the lines they are interpreting the other proposals about furniture they will include boxing gloves as wearing apparel.  The Minister in his own mind does not know, nobody knows, what the Commissioners may interpret as wearing apparel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Magennis is possibly a Revenue Commissioner. We know he fulfils many functions. Possibly he is an authority, but the people do not know how these taxes are imposed.  I think we should be specific and say exactly what things we should protect.  Instead of having loose general terms we should say in detail what we intend to tax.  I am framing amendments that I hope will be comprehensive enough for the Minister to accept without loss of revenue.  The second point is that as far as possible in the collection of tax, administrative inconvenience should be done away with and if possible means should be found for meeting special cases.  For <Col N="2240" /> instance, there is the case with regard to clothes that are sent into the Free State to charities, second-hand and cast-off clothes which are sent to charities, from people on the other side and from people in Northern Ireland.  I think the case has been put to the Minister already, and I ask him to have something done whereby it would be possible for charitable societies to import these clothes duty free.  I realise that if you allow everybody to do it there would be a serious danger of loop-holes by which dealers could import such clothes free of tax.  I think, if possible, that some arrangement should be made to enable such societies as the Sick and Indigent Room-Keepers Society to accept gifts of such clothes.</P>
      <P>Then there is the case of transfer on approval of goods that Deputy Good referred to.  Under Resolution 7, as issued by the Revenue Commissioners, we shall lose a considerable amount of our transit trade.  There is one firm in Dublin which imports linen goods from a northern factory and exports them to Great Britain.  If this tax is imposed in such cases, we shall lose that transit trade because the goods will be sent direct from Belfast to England and the result will be that a certain number of people will be thrown out of employment in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were discussing this matter previously the Minister said he would like to meet any amendments put forward.  After all, the responsibility is not solely ours.  The responsibility is also the Minister's.  It is not an easy matter to draft amendments to a Finance Bill.  It is an infinitely technical matter and Deputies are under a great disadvantage and we are in the dark as to the nature of any regulations issued by the Revenue Commissioners. We do not know when these regulations are issued.  I had my attention drawn to a regulation recently issued by the Revenue Commissioners. It is not on the Table of the House.  I am sure the Minister would show it to me if he had it with him.  We are placed in a very difficult position which makes it impossible to draw up amendments.  We are also placed in a difficult position by the habit of the <Col N="2241" /> Revenue Commissioners in stating that they have no statutory authority to do anything.  When we have passed our resolutions in general terms, the Revenue Commissioners have statutory authority and it is very hard to know when you have not seen a regulation whether the Revenue Commissioners are correct, whether pressure should be brought to bear on the Minister to introduce an amending resolution or whether the Revenue Commissioners are not interpreting their powers with too much strictness and rigidity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the point I want to make is unnecessary.  The Revenue Commissioners have no power to interpret.  They have power to administer the law, and if anybody thinks that they are insisting on having a duty which they are not entitled to have, there is the remedy, and the interpretation of the Act then is made by the Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make my position clear.  I am not attacking the Revenue Commissioners for having done anything improper from their point of view.  Here we have a case of what is not the law.  The duty on clothing is not yet statutory. The Revenue Commissioners interpret it under powers given by the passage of the resolution, but they have issued regulations making concessions with regard to goods on approval.  If they have the power to make regulations at all they have power to make general regulations, not to differentiate.  We have merely passed a broad resolution with regard to the duties.  I will show the Minister correspondence if he likes to see it.  Another thing that should be done to make these Customs duties as little onerous or as little arduous as possible to the ordinary traveller is to facilitate Customs inspection in every way.  It has been suggested that the Minister should have Customs inspectors on the boats plying between Dun Laoghaire and Holyhead, Greenore and Holyhead, and possibly between Fishguard and Rosslare.  I do not know if that is practicable, but I do say that the Minister might well follow the example of the French and Swiss Governments and have the Customs examination <Col N="2242" /> carried out on the trains from Belfast to Dublin.  I believe it is practicable, the railway company considers it practicable, and that would cause a considerable saving of time and mitigate inconvenience to a great extent.  If it is possible on the Franco-Swiss frontier I see no reason why it should not be equally possible on the frontier between the Free State and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>My last point is the minimum duty of 2s. 6d. on all dutiable goods.  That may have been a very good expedient when you are dealing with goods that were almost exclusively imported in large quantities, but it is a very bad expedient when you are dealing with this heterogeneous catalogue of things, every form of wearing apparel and every form of furniture, because the result is that very often the duty levied is not 33? per cent. or 15 per cent., but 50, 70, 100 or 150 per cent. sometimes, and that duty presses most hardly on poor people who send small consignments, and who believe they are giving a small present to a relation or a friend, while the whole value of the present is destroyed by the recipient having to pay 2s. 6d. minimum duty and 6d. stamp duty.</P>
      <P>I do urge the Minister to reconsider that in the light of the fact that while it may have been justified by old-time economics, the new conditions that have been created, partly created by himself, are such as to render it hopelessly inequitable.  If you are going to tax a wide variety of goods you cannot talk of reducing your Customs entries; it is impossible; they must increase, and you must have a larger staff.  These new taxes may not increase the cost of living; the cost of living may be balanced by the concessions on tea and sugar, but I am quite certain of one thing, that they will increase the irritation of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to ask the Minister to make any remissions of taxation.  On the contrary, I am going to ask him to increase his revenue and I will try to convince the Government that it will be doing itself justice and doing something useful for the country by following the representations <Col N="2243" /> which I will endeavour to put forward. I very much regret the fact that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture is not present.  I was one of those Deputies who had the temerity to ask for certain tariffs on agricultural produce, and while I do not dispute the right of the Minister to oppose that view, I think that he did not do me justice in saying that I casually demanded tariffs without giving any reasons in support of their introduction.  There is a conception abroad that farmers, as a rule, have always been free traders.  That conception has more or less been brought about by the action of our Party since we came into the Dáil. But I maintain that circumstances alter cases, that varying conditions call for new remedies, and that consistency in politics may be very much overrated.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture himself has not been consistent.  I remember when an important resolution in connection with tariffs was brought forward by Deputy Milroy, the Minister was a confirmed free trader, but he subsequently changed to a tariff reformer.  There is an old saying which I have found by experience to be true&mdash;&ldquo;Life is merely a series of compromises.&rdquo; Changing conditions bring about new possibilities, and while we are all, I hope, actuated by the idea of doing the best we can for the country, I believe that the policy I am about to advocate would stimulate production and help our industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask what was the mentality of the farmers in the year 1846 when the repeal of the Corn Laws took place.  Were the farmers free traders then?  Were the farmers free traders in subsequent years when they saw the land depopulated by emigration, and the gradual change from tillage to grass?  Were the sons of that generation free traders?  They were free traders because the outlook was hopeless.  At that time we were combined with the United Kingdom, but the Treaty has brought about a new position.  It has given us fiscal autonomy, and it has given us the right, if we so desire, to place tariffs <Col N="2244" /> on anything that will develop industry. The conception of tariff reform was the kernel of the whole Sinn Fein movement.  I never was what might be called a thoroughbred Sinn Feiner, but I am very well satisfied with the results that that movement achieved, and I am endeavouring to take advantage of the position won by that particular body of political opinion.  I ask for a tariff on American bacon.</P>

      <P>On all imported bacon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On all imported bacon, yes.  What is the position of the bacon industry in this country?  We have an export trade of live pigs to the value of £1,200,000, and while we have unemployed here we have men engaged in Canada and the United States preparing bacon for food for this country. The importation of that article amounts to close to £2,000,000 worth, and if pigs were killed in this country it would mean the killing of 600,000 or 700,000 animals, with increased employment, and, at the same time, it would not raise the cost of living.  This industry is decaying; there is a decrease in the number of our pigs yearly since the war. Last year, as compared with the year before, the number was down in the neighbourhood of a quarter of a million and there were 30,000 less sows than in the year before.  What is bringing that about?  Competition by the Dane, competition which is rendered more keen by the fact that the Dane is in possession of a depreciated currency.  He is forcing us out of the English market. He is even landing his bacon and his butter in Dublin, and I say that is one of the trades which calls for the help which the control of our internal trade can give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to take up the argument of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture on this point.  He based his policy on a certain argument, and he said that because the farmer has £1 per cwt. in preference on his own bacon he has the advantage of a tariff, without any of its disadvantages.  I dispute that statement.  The farmer, the Minister says, sells his bacon at £4 a cwt. and he buys American bacon at £5 a cwt.  That is not the position at all; the farmer <Col N="2245" /> does not sell his bacon at £4 a cwt.  That is the dead-weight price of bacon, the dead-weight price of the carcase, which is not bacon at all.  When a carcase is turned into the resultant bacon it is about six stone to the cwt.  I will prove that.  The carcase consists of the body, minus the organs and the entrails, but including the head.  The first operation that the farmer would have to perform in order to turn the carcase into bacon would be to scald the pig with boiling water and scrape it, incidentally scraping away a couple of pounds of what the Minister calls bacon, in the shape of bristles, outer skin and dirt.  That is the first operation, and that changes the Minister's bacon into what we call mercantile bacon.  The pig has to be decapitated, the legs taken off and the backbone taken out, leaving two sides. When the farmer salts these two sides, presses them, re-salts them in a week, presses them again, and takes them out in two months' time, when they are dry, he has bacon.  He has then, out of a cwt. of pig, six stone of bacon.  I am told he will have the head and the backbone.  The work entailed in changing that pork into bacon would not be paid for by the price of the head and the crubeens.  The proof is this: if you bring a pig to a co-operative bacon factory, they will charge you seven or eight shillings for saving that pig.  If you recollect that eighty shillings in reality only represents six stone of bacon, you will find that Irish bacon to the farmer and the cottier will cost 106/8 as against 100 shillings which the Minister stated the farmer spends in buying American bacon at retail prices. That only applies to people who rear pigs.  It does not apply to the bulk of the population of this country, and is not an argument on which any policy should be based.  It is simply special pleading against the idea of protection. That is the idea I counter.  I think it is scarcely fair for the Minister for Agriculture to be specially opposed to the idea of protection instead of being a judge who should see, and show to the Dáil, the other side of the question.  He admitted that American bacon was being landed at £3 a hundredweight at the ports, and now that the pound is <Col N="2246" /> looking the dollar in the face, the tendency would be for it to be landed cheaper.</P>
    <P>The question is not the question of the price of the pig to the farmer but of American bacon as it is landed at Dublin port, as compared with the price of Irish bacon <i>ex</i> factory.  I am showing you that if you slaughter those 700,000 pigs in the country you will not raise the cost of living.  To whom will the cost of living be raised? According to the Minister's statement, eighty per cent. of American bacon is bought by the farmer.  I have taken ten minutes to show that both cost the same to him.  I say, if those 700,000 pigs were slaughtered here, you would have the offal for your poor people and the work as well.  You would have a stable market and you would not have the prices fluctuating, and you would have, by the method used in dressing Irish bacon, an amount of good food, better than the American food, for your people.  Take a side of bacon as you see it in the city.  The top portion of that, called back rashers, commands the highest price.  It is an article of commerce very much sought after and is at the disposal of Deputies when they have bacon and eggs.  It gives you the highest superficial amount of bacon without any body and is an article which shows a great deal for little weight.  It costs 2s. 2d. a pound and it is on that cut of the pig that the trader makes his profit.  The piece of the bacon on the under side of that is sold at a shilling a pound cheaper than American bacon.  It is a good food, far better than American bacon in food value.  In addition you will have the gammon end for the poorer people who can buy under the wholesale price of American bacon.  You will have the pig's head, of which I spoke to you. It should not be necessary for me to go into details of this kind, but when a case is made on a spurious foundation, and when a policy is advanced by arguments of that nature, it is necessary for me to enter on those details.  I want to put before the House the fact that if the people in this country knew how the bacon was fed in America and Canada, they would never use it as food at all. <Col N="2247" /> We heard Deputy Hennessy talk about the scandalous way in which the farmers produce butter in this country.</P>

      <P>I will tell you how they feed pigs in Canada, and it will keep you from eating American bacon.  One of my neighbours last year went over to Canada to see what possibilities there were there.  He spent a year working on a farm there and reported back.  He said: &ldquo;We cannot compete with American bacon.  I will tell you what they feed the pigs on and what happens there.  There is a large stockyard in which the cattle are fed with Indian corn.  The corn which the cattle fail to digest is deposited as dung, and is the feeding for Canadian pigs.&rdquo;  We hear a lot about sweated industry.  Do you think it is possible for us in this country to pay taxes, annuities and to support a trade which has to meet competition of that sort? I say it is an impossibility.  It is not right that we should be asked to pay our people and to feed them on good sound food while at the same time we are faced with an article brought in at 60/- and sold at a profit of forty shillings. The pigs are fed on dung.  That is a fact, and the reason why it is pressed so much is that there is such a profit on it.  I have shown you that there is no danger of a rise in the cost of living.  We hear everybody talking about the dead meat trade.  The Minister is enthusiastic about it.  He says the dead meat trade is open to us and that we have factories.  We are exporting 1,200,000 live pigs.  Why do we not kill them here?  We are only half the country, because the North exports their pigs as pork.  We are the only persons sending away live pigs, and if you do as I tell you, you will have a potential bacon factory in every city.  You will not have American bacon in the shops.  An enterprising grocer will go to the nearest cottier, will buy a pig and sell it over his counter and will not go to the factories. You will have bacon at a cheaper price. You will be doing no injustice to the poor.  You will be helping farmers to <Col N="2248" /> gain a trade amounting to over £2,000,000 per annum.  I think that is a reasonable proposition.  It is a reasonable proposition to put before a Sinn Fein Executive, and I hope it will sink deeply and that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture will not be allowed to wipe it off the slate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I advocated a tariff on oats, and the Minister for Lands and Agriculture had an answer for that.  He pretended to see a difference between oats and oatmeal.  As a matter of fact, he was not right in that.  The Minister says that two-thirds of that is seed. The fact is that there is imported £102,000 worth of Canadian oats alone, not to speak of oats from the North of Ireland.  The amount of oats imported is somewhere in the region of 700,000 barrels per annum.  Think of what that means!  There are £358,000 worth of oat products, and £150,000 worth of ordinary oats&mdash;something about half-a-million pounds worth of oats.  Worked out at 14s. a barrel, that means that the importation amounts to 700,000 barrels.  That would be the product of 70,000 acres, or an area of over 1,100 square miles. Here is an item that will not raise the cost of living.  Our oatmeal is as good as the Canadian product.  Our oats, are as good as the Canadian oats, and why a farmer in this country, who has a surplus of oats in the spring, should be forced to meet competition from Canada, passes my understanding. Oats is one of the cereals that can be grown successfully in this country.  It can be grown on the hill or in the valley, on the mountainside or in the vale.  It can be grown on good land or on poor land.  It is a hardy cereal, and grows in all kinds of climate.  We can produce as good oats here as anywhere else, or, perhaps, better, because we have a greater yield.  There are possibilities in this connection which ought to be considered very seriously. It cannot raise the cost of living.  It will stabilise the price of oats, and induce the people to grow more oats. This is the crop on which the farmer is enabled to pay his rent and annuity and taxes.  This is a proposition that ought to receive favourable consideration from the Government.  As I have <Col N="2249" /> pointed out, it cannot raise the cost of living, and nobody can object to it on those grounds.  Therefore, I urged that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture should not divide this item into two parts&mdash;grain and oatmeal.  When he was beaten, he said: &ldquo;If you want a tariff, I will give you a tariff on oatmeal.&rdquo; That is the position with regard to oats.</P>
    <P>I asked for a tariff on butter. Butter imports amount to £739,000 per year.  Some of that comes in in the summer.  The Minister said it all comes in the winter.  Is it possible to provide £125,000 worth of butter each month for the four months of winter? That is what the question amounts to. Nobody need tell me that that cannot be done.  Our people are living on the finest land in the world.  Because it is so good, they have not to work.  They have only a seasonable production of milk.  The cows calve in the spring. There is a flush of milk in the summer, when the grass is there.  When the grass is finished, there is no milk.  We farm on the system employed in the days of Methuselah and holy Job. There is nothing wrong in that.  It is exactly the system I saw in operation in wild country elsewhere.  I do not think that that is a system that ought to be perpetuated, when we are taking on schemes like the Shannon scheme. If we are going to develop this country, we ought to develop this industry.  It can be done, as I will show presently. A farmer who farms on that system has, willy-nilly, to give his cows hay.  His cows come out in the spring thin.  If he would give those cows, in addition to the wisp of hay, 4 lbs. of oats and a half cwt. of roots every day during the winter, at a cost of 9d., one-third of those cows, calving in November, and fed as I have described, would give two gallons of milk per day all through the winter.  The cows would be stronger in the spring, and they would give the same amount of milk in the summer.  The difference between the 9d. which he would expend on feeding and the 1s. 10d. which he would get for his milk, would represent the profit to him.  I know that there have been investigations made in connection with winter dairying.  I <Col N="2250" /> know that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture has gone into the subject. But I want to approach the question from the position in which the work is being done at present.  I want to show the results that would accrue from a change of system.  If you calve one-third of your cows in November and expend 9d. per day in the feeding of each of them, as I have described, you will get in the winter two gallons of milk per day from them, which you can sell at 1s. 10d.  1s. 10d., less 9d., leaves 1s. 1d.  That is the profit to the farmer, and that is good profit, as I will prove.  Everybody who has ever fattened cattle knows that if you do not feed cattle at an expense of 1s. 6d. per head per day you are going to lose.  That is the maximum of expenditure. If you spend more than that, you lose, too.  It will take three months to complete the fattening. 1s. 6d. a day for a week is 10s. 6d. Thirteen weeks at 10s. 6d. is, roughly, £7.  The man who fattens cattle has got to get back £7 before he can make 1s. profit.  If he got 1s. per day as I have offered the dairyman, he would have to get £11 11s. 0d. profit, and very few men engaged in fattening cattle for export are getting £11 11s. 0d.  If Deputy Leonard is here, I am sure he will not contradict me in regard to that assertion.  Eleven guineas to a man who ties up a beast in November is a profit any man would be glad to take.  He is taking less at present. And yet I have shown you that the dairy farmer could gain more.  There would, too, be an absolutely certain winter supply of milk, and there would be the usual summer supply.  Even if there was a small shortage in summer, it would be only at a 6d. rate, and would not amount to anything.  What would be the advantage?  We have our customers got up to October.  Then we drop our supply of butter.  We let in the Dane on a depreciated currency. We have to fight him in the spring, when we have to start again, and we have to lose money in order to get into the market.  There is a potential gain to the farmer and an absolute gain to the co-operative society in the methods I have advocated.  If the farmer continued his supply in the winter, <Col N="2251" /> this loss&mdash;which is a national loss of very serious dimensions&mdash;would be in the nature of added profit to the farmer or to the co-operative society.  I hope I have convinced the Dáil that that is sound economics.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands and Agriculture says that there is nobody in the Dáil wants a tariff on butter except Deputy Wilson.  I hope I have changed his mind.  When I asked for a tariff I was laughed at.  I suggested 2/- as the amount.  I did not look on that as a tariff; I looked on it as an embargo. I did not want a tariff; what I wanted was an embargo.  I wanted to keep the foreign butter out.  If you are afraid of an embargo in the case of butter, or if you are afraid that it will raise the cost, you can do as the French Government does in the case of other foodstuffs, take power to have the embargo raised when prices reach a certain standard.  Power could be taken to do that by Order in Council.  That is what happened last year in France in respect of another article of food.  That would be a means of inducing people to winter-feed their cows.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture is settling thousands of people on the land. He is going to put the people back on holdings.  If these people had an assured market for their milk or butter products in the winter, they would turn to that industry and not be wasting their time growing small cattle and sending them to the grazier to fatten.  That is how you could bring about increased production in the agricultural industry. Then we have the Shannon scheme.  The farmers' daughters, instead of having to work, will just have to switch on the electric current and the milk will be separated.  Then they will turn another switch and the milk will be churned.  Another switch will be operated and the butter worker will not have to injure her poor, dainty hands. The daughter of the farmer will not then be running off to sell gowns or aprons in the shops.  She will stay at home under the new conditions and she will be provided with suitable and remunerative employment.  I contend that the method I have suggested is the <Col N="2252" /> proper method.  It will stimulate production and make the country what we desire.  We do not want to see this country devoted to the growing of grass.  Go up to the hills in the country and see the remains of the ridges that were there when this was an intensively cultivated country.  What was the cause of the change?  Was it not the free trade policy pursued by England?  What qualms of conscience can the Deputies on these benches have to change with the circumstances? They have the power and why not use it in the direction of putting more people on the land?  Why not use it in the direction of giving more employment and stimulating industry on the land?</P>
    <P>The question of barley is on another footing.  There has been more demand for a tariff in respect of barley than in respect of any other product of the soil that I know.  I never stood for a tariff on barley, because barley is the raw material of another industry.  My reasons for opposing a tariff on barley are simply and solely the reasons which the Minister for Finance gave for refusing to put a tariff on piece goods. He said that they were raw material for the tailors.  Barley is the raw material of another industry.  The Minister for Lands went further; he said, why not supply pig-feeding districts with barley; why not crush the barley into meal and send it into those districts?  Lack of organisation was, he said, the cause; the farmers are no use. If the people who grow barley demand the price for barley which the maltster pays, then barley as a pig food is outside the question.  A price of 13/6 a cwt. for barley will not compare with the price at which maize can be purchased. Unless the growers of barley are prepared to supply barley for pig feeding at 10/- a cwt., then barley as a pig food is impossible.  When the Minister for Lands and Agriculture talks about lack of organisation among farmers, I would remind him that in the great milling centres of America, around the Missouri Valley&mdash;St. Louis, for example, where there is a great milling industry&mdash;the situation is that if they run short of wheat they do not get it from California.  They pay the <Col N="2253" /> tariff and take it over the border from Canada.  At the time they are doing that, Dublin millers are buying Californian wheat.  It is not a question of lack of organisation.  The transit charges in this country are abnormal.  Transit charges for agricultural products here are the obstacle and, therefore, the demand of the barley growers for malting prices for feeding-barley and the question of the railway charges are the causes which have placed the feeding of pigs by barley in this country out of the question.</P>
    <P>These are the only arguments I put forward.  I leave it to the Dáil to say whether I have not made a fair case and put forward a fair demand.  I am very sorry the Minister for Lands and Agriculture is not here.  I would like to have had his contradictions, so that I could get out some more information on this subject.  He would put forward objections, and I would have the opportunity and the gratification of countering them by giving him more information on these particular matters.</P>
    <P>The question of a tariff on bacon is a serious question.  It is a question that the Minister ought very seriously to consider.  If it is not possible this year, I would urge that the Minister for Finance ought to see a way of dealing with the matter next year.  It is wrong that we should be feeding our people with products raised in the way I have shown.  It is wrong that we should permit people to give us food when we can do it ourselves.  It is wrong to ship live pigs from this country when we could have a trade here that would make our agricultural industry successful.  It is wrong to allow free trade to depopulate our country. We should take away this free trade idea, for the free trade idea is only entertained by the grazier.  The grazier is a free trader because he has the internal consumption of this country at his feet and he thinks that if there was protection it would raise his costs.  He is in open competition in the English market at present, but he is getting beaten out of the English market just now.  Canadian cattle are, unfortunately, fetching better prices in the English market than Irish cattle.  The <Col N="2254" /> way I have outlined is the way to keep the people on the land, and if it is not the way, I would like if the Minister for Lands and Agriculture would show me a better way.</P>

It may mean the setting in motion of a body of opinion that will lead to a change of view from the agricultural population regarding their relations to finance, taxation, and to the general community.

      <P>I am quite convinced that there is need, from a strictly national economic point of view, to take steps to stimulate agricultural production quickly &mdash; not merely to wait for the development of all the Acts that have been passed, and which we hope will have a great effect on raising the quality as well as the quantity of agricultural products.  I believe, with Deputy Wilson, that what is absolutely essential is to increase the gross production directly from the soil. Unless that is done without delay the country's economy will not improve. Whatever expense we incur in relation to other necessary improvements, which mean merely expenditure having a prospect of reproduction in the distant future, but no immediate prospect of reproduction, that kind of expenditure will only be a new burden upon the State unless there is actually increased productivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the actual income is concerned, <Col N="2255" /> I believe it is absolutely essential that we should stimulate all work of the kind Deputy Wilson has spoken of&mdash;production from the soil. I will be quite prepared to incur all the odium from the urban populations of supporting a proposition which would be alleged to mean an increase in the cost of food, which might not, in fact, mean that, but would certainly increase the general national prosperity and change the balance from an urban distributive trade to an agricultural productive trade.  In that way, I approve in general of Deputy Wilson's comments, and I hope that the day is not very far distant&mdash;I hope it is going to be possible even in the coming financial year&mdash;when we shall take steps to increase agricultural productivity by giving a direct stimulus to the landholder to increase his production.</P>
    <P>I am rather surprised that the Minister has not explained more fully some of the provisions in the Bill which, so far as I can see, are new, and have not been touched upon in his previous expositions. I regret that he has not been able to accept Deputy O'Connell's proposal regarding the allowance in respect to income tax for children over sixteen who are at school or college.  I think his estimate of a cost of £60,000 is too high, and while I do not pretend to have the same amount of information that he has, I imagine that he has been over-generous in his estimate of the number of parents paying income tax who have children over sixteen at school.  However, I suppose the Minister has made up his mind definitely that this remission cannot be made, and we will have to abide by that decision.</P>
    <P>Presumably the same argument will apply to the stamp duty, but I think we ought to test the views of the Dáil upon the question of the remission of the stamp duty.  It is not merely the amount, as there is a certain matter of principle involved, inasmuch as while employees of the State are expected to pay this duty, and nominally every other employee who is paid more than £2 at a time, it is only State employees in practice&mdash;very few others&mdash;who pay the duty.  The fact that employees allow their remuneration to lie with <Col N="2256" /> their employers day after day for a week or a month should not mean that the employees have to bear the cost of this small stamp duty.  I agree it is not of very great importance to the employee in monetary value, but it is a matter of some little principle, and I think it ought not to be charged in respect to wages.  As a matter of fact, in last year's British Finance Act there was a remission of this and I do not suppose that it cost them very much money.</P>
    <P>The same remark applies to the proposal in respect to the compulsion upon employers to deduct arrears of income tax from employees.  It is time to repeal that.  It is an unjust imposition and I do not think it is fairly levied as a duty upon employers and leads to injustice and unfair charges.  Notwithstanding what the Minister said about the arrears, it is well to remind Ministers that we are faced with the fact that a large proportion of these arrears was incurred more or less both at the direct and indirect instigation of the Government of the time.  That has been contradicted and it has been reaffirmed. Anybody that had any experience at that time knows that people who were in a position to speak on behalf of the accepted national authority did instruct and urge upon people not to pay their income tax during those years.</P>
    <P>The two or three points that I feel have not been touched upon by the Minister, and that ought to have been, occur mainly in the schedule.  This method of putting a long list of items in a schedule has to be carefully watched, it is so easy to allow a repeal to be made without knowing what we are doing.  I am not quite sure, even after referring to the Acts mentioned in column 2, that I am quite aware of what they involve, but I am going to give the Minister an opportunity to put me right if I happen to have made a mistake or wrongly interpreted the meanings of these repeals.  Sections 20, 21 and 24 of the Finance Act of 1910 are proposed to be repealed.  These sections refer to the duty upon mineral rights, as I understand it, of five per cent.  One shilling out of every twenty shillings of rental is chargeable as a <Col N="2257" /> duty on all rights to work minerals and all mineral wayleaves.  That has been the law for several years and is now intended to be repealed.  I do not know what it means in actual cash annually, but there is a principle involved and I think we ought to maintain that principle. I certainly think that until the matter has been explained and a discussion has taken place, we ought not to allow a repeal of this kind to slip through.</P>
    <P>Then Section 4 of the Finance Act, 1916, is to be repealed.  There has been no mention of that in the Minister's statement, yet I expect it will excite a certain amount of comment.  As far as I understand it, I approve of it, but I think it is necessary that a matter of this kind ought to be made known to the Dáil explicity in a discussion on the Finance Bill.  As I understand it, it is repealing a provision which says that interest on securities issued in connection with British Government loans during the war, and hitherto exempt from assessment to income tax, shall be no longer exempt.  I think I am right in that interpretation, and I would support it, but I am not inclined to allow a provision of that kind to pass through without explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to be repealed by the Bill.  Apparently, it has not hitherto been repealed or it would not be proposed to repeal it now.  Then we have a provision in respect to the Income Tax Act, 1918, which probably is not a very important matter, but requires explanation.  As I understand it, the Governors of the Bank of England and the Bank of Ireland were given the powers of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue in respect to certain things.  Some returns had to be given to the Commissioners and income tax on the profits was automatically paid by the banks to the Commissioners.  That is now being repealed.  I may be right or wrong in that interpretation.  It is not easy to understand it from the phraseology used here.  It is proposed to repeal that, and I think we ought to <Col N="2258" /> have some explanation of what the repeal is, and what it involves.</P>
      <P>On the question of the entertainments duty, I am glad to see that the Minister has inserted a section in the Bill which fulfils hopes expressed in the earlier discussions.  I would like to hear his explanation for the deletion of certain words from, I think, the New Duties Act, 1916, paragraph (d), subsection 5.  As I understand it, at present any society which has been formed wholly or mainly for the purposes of educative, scientific, philanthropic or charitable purposes may provide entertainments, the proceeds of which will be devoted to such purposes by the society; and also that entertainments provided by a society or institution founded with the object of reviving national pastimes may be exempted from entertainments tax.  It is intended to repeal that portion of the section so that henceforth a society which has been formed with the object of reviving national pastimes may not provide an entertainment in furtherance of that object unless it is held out of doors. As I read it, hitherto it was possible, for, say, the Gaelic Athletic Association to provide entertainments, having for their object the raising of funds to promote national pastimes.  Henceforth, it is intended to allow such association and every other association to promote outdoor games free from entertainment tax.  It will not be possible, however, henceforward for such a society to run indoor entertainments with the object of providing funds to promote national pastimes.  I hope it is clear that that is the intention, and that the Dáil is satisfied that such a provision should be passed.  I think it is worth discussing whether we ought not to make it possible for a society of that kind to provide entertainments which may be exempted from entertainment tax, provided the Commissioners are satisfied that the proceeds are to be used for the purposes indicated. I think some of these matters ought to be explained on the Second Reading.  I hope the Minister will make clear what the intentions of these repeals are if I have not interpreted them correctly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose the general scheme of <Col N="2259" /> tariffs has been debated fully, and I am not going to put forward any objections in detail.  I think some of the points that have been raised will be worthy of support in Committee.  In the case of clothing imported for charitable purposes, or where an individual has left clothing after him and requires it to be forwarded, duty should not be charged.  Small matters of that kind might very well be dealt with on the Committee Stage, and provision made in the Bill that would allow the Minister to make remission in such cases.</P>

      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of saying how heartily I congratulate Deputy Wilson on the speech he made before the adjournment.  I think it was one of the best speeches, worked out on strict business lines, that this Dáil has heard, and I feel that it would be a very great thing, if I might venture to say so without offence to the parties concerned, for the education of this country, if that speech could be reported <i>verbatim.</i>  I welcome it all the more because I think the Minister has not done himself justice in the lines on which he has approached his arguments towards this Finance Bill. He has rather defended it to-day on the lines, that he has found it necessary to remit certain forms of taxation, and, inasmuch as the country could not afford remission at this time, it was necessary to put the money so remitted on to other articles, and so make up the total he requires.  I look at it rather from the point of view that in this Budget we are setting out for the first time to find the form of taxation suitable to the economic and fiscal needs of the country.  I have said before, and I repeat it now, we have taken over a system that was devised for the needs of another country, of another people, whose conditions are <Col N="2260" /> fundamentally different from those that prevail in this country; and, having taken that over, it was necessary that we should continue it for a short time, as there were too many things to do, especially during the early years of the establishment of this State, to think of any fundamental changes in a fiscal direction.  Now that we are beginning to think for ourselves&mdash;I congratulate the Minister on this Bill for this reason if for no other &mdash;and as we are thinking out our own needs for our own circumstances, we should do so, as far as possible, as if we had a clean sheet to write our own individual record on in the beginning. The Finance Bill bears all those characteristics.  Take the duties levied on clothing.  I asked the Minister in Committee on the Finance Resolution, if he would set out exactly the articles to be charged in a Schedule and put that Schedule in the Bill.  I repeat it now, knowing that it is probably too late to have it done this year, but these duties imposed on this occasion will be continued in, at least, one subsequent Finance Bill, and, I suggest, as soon as possible, we should give the various articles on which a duty is to be levied and let them be stated in the Schedule so that we may know where we are.  I suggest also, and I ask the Minister to consider it carefully, that even though the figures of the revenue to be got from these new taxes are provisional and subject to many rectifications, let us still have these provisional figures when he comes to review the situation at the end of the financial year.  He will have before him certain figures which will be provisional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us share that knowledge with him, also sharing the knowledge that these figures are provisional.  I ask this because I know that some Deputies have found themselves handicapped in these matters because the Minister has necessarily a much fuller knowledge than Deputies could hope to have in the depositories of his Department, but, at least, the summarised results ought to be in the possession of Deputies.  In regard to the boot tax, the clothing tax, and the furniture tax, I urge that a Schedule should be made of the <Col N="2261" /> various articles to be included under the heading of each particular tax and, then, as against each particular heading, to put in &ldquo;subject to rectifications,&rdquo; that time will make when the cost of collection can be put in on the other side of the scale, and also to put in the revenues that these particular items earn.  In that way, while we are experimenting&mdash;the Minister for Finance has said that at this stage we are doing little more than experimenting&mdash;in order to discover for ourselves that scale of taxes, that category of articles, we ought to tax without unnecessarily holding ourselves bound to the system which we have inherited. It is obvious that we are doing that now for the first time in the Finance Bill in any substantial measure; let us do that in such a way, month by month, so that the information will be in the hands of Deputies. When the next Budget comes to be considered Deputies will then have the knowledge before them in the summarised results on which the Minister will base his Budget.  Then, I think, it will be possible to go into the question which Deputy Wilson has touched on, and which is a matter of great importance. I have characterised this Finance Bill as an attempt made by this State, through its Minister for Finance, to find out those articles upon which revenue should be got.  I urged before that some of the duties should have been charged upon imports of commodities which are manufactured in this country by what is admitted to be, and what is unquestionably, our premier industry&mdash;agriculture.  Deputy Wilson came here to-day and gave full facts and details, and threshed the thing out in a thoroughly business-like way, to show what that would mean, and he found himself faced by the greatest problem in regard to all taxes on food, and, that is, whether they would or would not increase the cost of living.  I think he established that the result would not be an increase in the cost of living, at least, in the items which he chose.  In case that argument should arise, he gave an instance which I have been interested in, and which has been practised by the French nation within the last two or three <Col N="2262" /> years.  They have imposed a duty on imported wheat, and they have so arranged it that if the cost of wheat goes higher than a certain figure, which is under constant revision by the Finance Department, the benefit is automatically remitted.  Consequently, the farming community, and those who handle the products of that community, have always that figure within which to work.  That has proved practicable, and has given good results.  There has been criticism that in particular cases and in particular months it has not given such results, but, broadly, it is admitted that the result has not been an increase in the cost of living.  We need not, however, go there.  We can stay at home.  We have a magnificent example of scientific taxation on farming commodities in what was known in Grattan's Parliament as the Foster Corn Law.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for Finance, and he will find it will abundantly repay him, to make a careful examination of the administrative methods of working what is known as Foster's Corn Law, where the duty on one hand, and the inward bounty on the other hand, are so balanced that in respect of any particular commodity the imported article must always remain at the same price as the home-manufactured article.</P>
    <P>It might be thought that would not be a very great benefit to confer, that is to give the result, as I have stated it, of keeping the imported farming commodity always at the same price as the home-manufactured farming commodity. We have been reading what the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has stated in the country as to the need for greater tillage.  The result of Foster's Corn Law was that tillage increased rapidly every year, and remained constantly increasing during the whole period of Grattan's Parliament. Economic history reveals clearly that result was due directly to the incidence of this tax levied and administered in that form.  There was more than that fact.  Not only did land go into tillage, that had not been in tillage for many years, and not only did Ireland turn from being a pasture to being a tillage country more and more every year, but the pasture itself <Col N="2263" /> increased.  Lands that had been left wild were brought into pasture.  That was achieved as a result of the scale of taxes so levied that the incoming agricultural commodity was taxed, and the home-manufactured commodity protected, and yet at no period did the cost of living in respect of the food of the people increase.  If these results can be achieved, if you can still keep the cost of living for articles of food which the farmer provides at a constant level, or keep it on the down grade, or stop it at least from going on the up-grade&mdash;if we can do that, while at the same time earning some small revenue by a protective tax of that kind, and give that benefit to the manufactured article of our premier industry, then that result is well worth attaining.  Here, for the first time in a great measure, we have started to devise a fiscal system for our own needs. If the venture is a sound one, and I believe it is, it should be brought to the benefit of our chief industry, which is agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is only one other matter I desire to touch on, and that is in regard to the administration of these new taxes you have levied.  The Minister for Finance, when we were in Committee on the financial resolutions, gave an assurance to this House that the administration would be of such a kind that it would not cause an unnecessary amount of irritation.  I know that that is his intention in the matter, but methods are still being adopted that lead to very considerable irritation, and I know the cause.  It is a very honourable and proper cause&mdash; that the officers who are administering these new duties, especially in regard to clothing for incoming travellers, regard themselves, and rightly so, as in a responsible position, and they feel that it is better to be too severe than to be too lax.  I urge the Minister to see that instructions are given that irritation will not be caused.  I do not know how other Deputies find it, but within the last fortnight I had quite a number of complaints brought to me, and I have been asked to set down questions in respect of particular cases where passengers resident in this country, <Col N="2264" /> or visitors coming to this country, have been put to a very great deal of inconvenience in a way that I do not think is the intention of the duty to cause.  In fact, I know that it is not the intention of the duty, for I have cases, and I can give the Minister a definite record of them, where articles that have been brought out of this country and brought back again in three or four days, nevertheless have these duties levied on them.  I know that in the way of administration experience will bring a kindlier method of handling these duties.  That is the tendency in other countries, and it will be the same here.  I think, in view of the fact that there are a large number of visitors expected, whether rightly or wrongly, whether hopefully or unhopefully, this year, that the Minister might take steps to do what experience would bring in its natural course in a year or two, and what might be brought as a result of a definite instruction from him, within a week or two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to say very little on the Second Reading of this Bill.  I do not want to refer to the speech which has been delivered by Deputy Wilson.  It was a speech that certainly gives those responsible for our fiscal policy here food for thought. When the next Budget is introduced, it is to be hoped that more aspects of the case, than have been looked at so far, will be taken into consideration. There is one small matter that I have been asked to refer to.  It is the amusement tax which agricultural show committees are obliged to bear.  This is a tax which hits very severely all our agricultural shows in the provinces. As a rule, very large crowds do not attend the shows, and therefore the committees which promote them find it very difficult to carry on.  I have had letters from many of them in which they tell me that they have been put to the verge of abandoning their exhibitions. I am sure every Deputy in the House will agree that there is nothing more conducive to the spread of education, in all matters that tend to promote the welfare of the agricultural industry, than these agricultural shows which are held all over the country. The exhibits that are to be seen at them <Col N="2265" /> help to bring home to the minds of the people the fruitful results that up-to-date methods as applied to the agricultural industry are calculated to achieve.</P>
      <P>A number of important Bills dealing with the marketing of agricultural produce have recently been passed in this House.  At the recent Spring Show in Ballsbridge some splendid exhibitions were given, particularly in the matter of egg packing.  I wish the demonstration that many of us witnessed there could be repeated at every agricultural show in the country.  The demonstrations in butter-making at the Show in Dublin, as well as provincial shows, have also had a highly educational effect.  I am convinced myself that the demonstrations in these matters given at our agricultural shows are calculated to do more good even than the work at the agricultural colleges. The reason for that is, that the lessons to be learned at these demonstrations are brought home so directly to the minds of the people.  The agricultural shows held throughout the country are not organised for profit making purposes. Every penny made at them is devoted to the expansion of the healthy influence which they are calculated to serve.</P>
      <P>I think it should be the object of the Government to see that these show exhibitions are given plenty of scope for expansion, and I would urge on the Minister for Finance that it is not desirable to have a tax imposed on purely educational enterprises of this kind.  I am convinced that it is a form of taxation that should be remitted, and that every effort should be made to encourage these show committees to extend their splendid work.  As regards the Bill generally, our views on its various provisions have been expressed on many occasions, and I do not think there is any necessity to repeat them again.  Mere repetition is not going to carry us very far.  In conclusion, I hope the Minister for Finance will give serious consideration to the appeal which I have made to him in connection with our agricultural shows.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the appeal made by Deputy <Col N="2266" /> Gorey in regard to the tax on agricultural shows.  I have been asked by several show committees to take up this matter with the Minister.  The Minister has been good enough to take the entertainment tax off outdoor sport fixtures such as were referred to to-day. In my opinion, the agricultural shows are of far greater value to the country than these sports.  If the Minister were to remove the tax at present imposed on agricultural shows it would only mean a slight loss to the revenue.  It is probable that the total sum involved would not amount to more than a few hundred pounds altogether.</P>
      <P>On the question of income tax, I am sorry the Minister has not adopted the suggestions we have made with regard to a reduction in the basis of assessment in the case of farmers.  I do not suppose there is any use in pressing him any further in regard to that: that the farmer should be assessed on one-third of his valuation rather than on his full valuation as at present.  I would ask the Minister, however, to bear that point in mind.  I can assure him that we will not let him forget it in the case of future Budgets.  As regards the assessment of income tax on the ordinary people of the country, I would plead with the Minister that he should try to inculcate amongst the inland revenue officials the desirability of adopting different methods in the future to those which they have been accustomed to employ in the past.  It seems to me, from the experience of people who have had to deal with these inspectors, that the latter seem to reverse the procedure which the law prescribes in the case of the criminal. They seem to regard the man who is being assessed for income tax as guilty before he is proved innocent.  They apparently believe that everyone who is endeavouring to get his income tax assessment placed on a proper basis is a rogue, and as one who is trying to get the better of the inland revenue authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, owing to the complications which are daily arising in regard to income tax, and to the new arrangements which are being <Col N="2267" /> made from time to time in the basis of assessment as well as in regard to the different rates that prevail in this country and in England, his Department might consider the advisability of issuing a booklet containing, in simple language, an explanation of the income tax laws, particularly in so far as they apply to the conditions that exist in the Saorstát and in England. There are, I know, certain publications available.  These deal principally with the system as it prevails in England, but they do not explain, or at least make it easy to understand, the system of assessment as it obtains here.  The result is that people in a large way of business are obliged to employ specialists to get themselves set right on this matter.  The employment of these specialists means considerable expense to these people.  I believe they are not allowed the expense which they are put to in this respect.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Acts dealing with income tax are so complicated that people are obliged to employ specialists to elucidate their application. When the final assessments in the cases of these people come to be made they should be allowed for the expense they incur in employing these specialists. There is one point that was brought to my notice with regard to the tax on wearing apparel.  There are certain people who buy and get made a considerable quantity of clothing in Ireland by Irish tailors.  These are mostly wealthy people.  They travel a good deal, and when going from Ireland to England they bring a fairly considerable quantity of this newly-made clothing with them.  I have been asked to enquire whether, when they are returning to Ireland, they will be obliged to pay the tariff duty on these articles.  The new clothes which they brought with them from Ireland to England may not have been worn at all while in the latter country.  It is quite usual with some of them to bring a trunk full of clothes with them on the journey.  They may not wear any of these new clothes while in England, and what they are anxious to know is, if they will have to pay duty on them when returning home, even <Col N="2268" /> though the cloth itself was purchased in Ireland and the goods were made up in this country by Irish tailors.  This idea is not a creature of my own imagination; it is a real tangible case put before me by men who make clothes in this country.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention at this stage of the Finance Bill to put down amendments dealing with tariffs.  I think we made our protest in the previous stages of the Budget, and I think it would be only burdening the House with unnecessary discussion, to continue the matter further.  But it must not be thought that I, or any of the party to which I belong, have abandoned our views with regard to tariffs.  We are still opposed to tariffs.  We do not believe that they can be for the good of the general community of the country. We believe that they may do harm, and more harm than good, and we certainly believe that they will not be of any benefit to the agricultural community.</P>

      <P>Does Deputy Wilson think that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wilson has decided to take a line of his own, and apparently has sacrificed principle for expediency.  I do not believe in doing so.  I believe that principle should stand before expediency.  I do not intend to follow the lines adopted by the Government followers who have decided in favour of the tariff policy. I do not intend, at this stage, to deal with arguments put forward by Deputy Wilson.  I recognise that they were very forcible, but I am inclined to think that on a close analysis they would not be found to be sound.  I am in agreement, largely, with the statement made by the Minister for Agriculture, and that is that agricultural products cannot be effectively protected, and though you might possibly protect to a very slight extent, the advantages gained by the whole agricultural community would be so slight that they would in no sense compensate for the loss they would suffer owing to the tariffs imposed on other articles and the increased cost of living that would arise from such. <Col N="2269" /> We have not yet, in this country, arrived at this stage of general tariffs. We have tariffs only on particular articles, but the tendency will be to go in the direction of a general tariff, and I have no doubt that pressure is being brought to bear, and will be brought to bear, upon the Minister, from all quarters, to impose tariffs on this, and that, and the other thing.</P>
      <P>For my own part, I am determined to stand on the principle of free trade, and to fight protective tariffs as long as I can.  I do not believe that the small sop that could be thrown to agriculture, and it would be a tiny and infinitesimal sop, could compensate for the loss that would come to agriculture owing to the imposition of protective tariffs.  Contrary to Deputy Wilson's idea, I believe that the only agricultural article that could be effectively protected is barley.  I believe barley could be protected, and without increasing the cost of living.  I believe protection might not result in any increase in the price to the farmers, but it certainly would result in increasing the revenue of the State.  You have a big combine controlling the whole barley market in this country. That combine is making immense profits, and if it had to pay a slightly increased price for imported barley it could pay that price without increasing the cost of its product.  It would have the effect certainly of increasing the revenue of the country, but I also agree with the Minister for Agriculture that it would not have a protective effect unless you controlled the price and gave a subsidy to the growers of barley or increased the price which the barley-growers get at present for their product.  But it would be a revenue-producing tax.  Why not make it a revenue-producing tax, and make the Minister provide, by a tariff, for all branches of the revenue in this country in addition to what he is doing?</P>

We have members of the same party in different parts of the House according, at any rate to the last speaker, advocating different principles in regard to tariffs.  The last Deputy said that he was with the Minister for Agriculture in regard to his policy in that direction, and almost in the same breath he told us that the Government were formulating a tariff policy.  We have Deputy Wilson advocating his tariff and a further increase, and extra tariffs, and we have Deputy Heffernan saying that he is going to stick to the principle of Free Trade.</P>

      <P>Has Deputy Captain Redmond read the speech of the Minister for Agriculture on this question of tariffs?  Because the Minister said then that after due consideration he had decided that no benefit could accrue to agriculture from the imposition of tariffs upon agricultural products.  Although the Minister is with the Government in proposing tariffs for other articles, he does not see that any benefit could accrue from the imposition of tariffs on agriculture. On that point I agree with him, but I cannot agree with him in regard to the imposition of tariffs on other articles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we have it that Deputy Heffernan is an out-and-out staunch free trader to the backbone, and not in favour of any tariffs of any kind.  We know where we are. <Col N="2271" /> Deputy Wilson is in favour of tariffs where he thinks that the situation has arisen and that circumstances have so altered that tariffs are beneficial to the country.  We have the Minister for Agriculture in favour of certain tariffs according to Deputy Heffernan, and not in favour of others.  I think that is an ideal state of affairs, because, as I said, we have the Deputies from different parties advocating different policies in regard to different tariff proposals, and that, to my mind, is the proper position for us in this country to-day.  The idea of suggesting that we, belonging to any party, or to no party as some of us do, should bind ourselves as Deputy Heffernan does, hand and foot, to a stereotyped policy of free trade upon the one hand, or to a policy of tariff reform on the other, in the circumstances, and the conjuncture in which we find ourselves at the present moment is, I think, nothing short of idiocy.  I take my stand, if I may be allowed to do so, with Deputy Wilson.  I think the speech he made was one on which he deserves congratulation from all quarters of the Dáil and the country.  I think it was a forcible speech and well reasoned and certainly a courageous one, and I hope that other Deputies, not agreeing, perhaps, with all the members of their own party, will have the courage to come forward and say so, and advocate the course to be adopted, not upon the mere ground of principle, but upon what I consider the high ground of expediency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening statement in regard to the Second Reading, told us that he had only the narrow margin of £10,000 to work upon.  A narrow margin that is indeed.  He also said that he would have to take up the position&mdash;the sphinx-like position which, I think, he has been rather accustomed to taking up and, if I may say so, that he has been very successful in taking up for some time past&mdash;of resolute and determined opposition to anything in the nature of any further or, as he called them, any big remissions being made.  With his point of view I do not think that any of us could quarrel; I do not think any of us <Col N="2272" /> could quarrel with him upon that score. I was very glad indeed to hear him qualifying his remark about refusing any amendment in the nature of a remission.  What he did say was that any amendment involving substantial loss of revenue would have to be opposed by him.  I am not with Deputy Wilson in this.  I am not going to propose that there should be any further imposts, or that new duties should be placed upon new articles.</P>
    <P>I have the temerity to get up and to suggest to the Minister that with the sum of £10,000 at his disposal he might make a remission in regard to two particular items.  Those two items I will deal with as shortly as possible and I think I will be able to show that they will involve a very small amount indeed of loss to the revenue.  In the first place, this time last year I took the opportunity of appealing to the Minister and of pointing out the existence of both an Excise and a Customs duty upon cider.  I reminded the House that this duty had been imposed in England, partly, if not entirely, as a war measure and that it had been since then removed.  I also reminded Deputies on that occasion that as far as we are concerned in the Saorstát there is only one cider producing factory and that, in effect, it was a one-man tax.  I do not believe that tax amounts to more than about £1,000 a year.  The tax is not only a Customs tax, but also an Excise one, and surely it stands to reason that it would not only be very little loss to the State from the point of finance or revenue, but that it might be quite a considerable gain to encourage the manufacture of this healthy beverage by remitting at least the Excise duty thereon.  Keep the Customs duty there by all means.  Give a chance to this small and, in spite of everything, thriving industry.  Encourage the growing of apples in the neighbourhood of Clonmel and Dungarvan, where they are grown at present, though not to the extent that they might be.  If that is done, it would be a benefit to the community amongst whom the factory exists, and certainly it would be no great loss to the Treasury, and it might eventually be a benefit to the country at large.  Twelve <Col N="2273" /> months have elapsed since I spoke on this matter before, and I hope that by this time the Minister has considered it and that he may be able to give up some of the £10,000 in that respect.  I do not think that is a large demand.  I think it is certainly a well-grounded one.</P>
    <P>Of course this Bill, being a Finance Bill, must be bristling with anomalies. Perhaps some of the anomalies it bristles with might include brushes. We have two taxes, one a tax on furniture and the other a tax upon wearing apparel.  As Deputy Cooper said, neither of these was defined to the extent that anybody knew what the tax was on.  I do not know what we do to-day. I have received correspondence from various parts of the country asking me whether there is a tax upon this or whether there is a tax upon that. One correspondent asks me whether a tooth-brush is to be considered wearing apparel or furniture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Capt. REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that.  The correspondent asks me whether a chimney sweeper's brush is to be considered furniture or wearing apparel.  Perhaps the Minister can tell?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">

      <P>Neither.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither?  I do not want to get the Minister out in that because, as a matter of fact, I have in my possession a letter informing me that chimney brushes, imported, as they are, from Belgium, have actually been declared by the Revenue Commissioners to be articles of furniture. These brushes are not made in this country.  They are not made of hair; they are made of some peculiar product manufactured in Belgium.  I am very glad to hear from the Minister now, and I hope he will confirm his statement, that chimney brushes are not to be taxed as furniture.  There are many other anomalies, but, as I have said, they were only to be expected.  I am sure when framing Sections 18 and 19, which deal with duties upon bottles, and when the Minister made a provision whereby empty bottles which <Col N="2274" /> were imported into this country, then exported and re-imported, would not be subject to a second duty, he did not mean that what are known as containers, namely, full bottles, should be treated otherwise.  That is as the matter stands according to the Bill we have before us.  The position is this: that before this present Bill there was no tax upon containers; that is, upon full bottles.  The tax now proposed to be placed upon them is a tax&mdash;not an <i>ad valorem</i> duty, mark you, but a tax. I do not know how it was arrived at. It seems to me it was arrived at in an arbitrary fashion.  There may be some grounds for the figures arrived at.  The tax, at any rate, is a tax of 3d. per dozen upon bottles under five ounces, and 6d. per dozen upon bottles over five ounces.</P>
      <P>Now, what is the position, say, of the importers of mineral waters?  When I say mineral waters, I mean waters which cannot and are not produced in this country.  Take waters like Hunyadi, Apollinaris, Apenta water, and Vichy water.  I could go through a long list of those natural springs whose water is bottled at the source and imported into this country.  The position, according to this Bill, is that they will have to pay, in the first place, 8d. a gallon duty, which they have, of course, paid previously, and they will also have to pay this tax of 3d. a dozen on smaller bottles and 6d. a dozen on larger bottles.  According to the section, there is no provision made whereby they shall be enabled, when they import those bottles, to export them and re-import them without having to pay a second duty.  It comes to this: every time these mineral waters are imported in these bottles they will have to pay a separate duty.  That, to my mind, does not seem fair in regard to the provision made for empty bottles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course it may be said that this may be something in the nature of protection. Protection for what?  It certainly is not a protection for the opening of mineral water springs in this country.  It may be a protection for the manufacturing of artificial waters, which these are not.  It is not a protection, I venture to say, in regard to the glass industry, because when these <Col N="2275" /> bottles are imported they are usually exported to be refilled, and if this duty is going to be such that it will have to be paid upon every occasion of the importation of these bottles, the result will be that these bottles will be imported here, that they will be dumped in the country, and that instead of being an encouragement to the glass and bottle industry, which we all hope to see revived and thriving shortly, the duty will mean that it will be a discouragement. I hope, therefore, the Minister will be able to see his way to modify this Section 19 in the same manner as Section 18 has been modified, and if I might respectfully suggest to him, he has merely to repeat the provisions made in Section 18 sub-section 3 (d) in regard to empty bottles.</P>
    <P>As far as the loss of revenue is concerned, I suggest it would be infinitesimal, if any, because there might be much more loss of revenue on the losses occasioned through the non-production of Irish bottles owing to the dumping of these foreign ones, than if this duty were not charged, over and over again.  It does seem certainly rather ridiculous that the same duty has to be paid upon any size bottle over five ounces.  That is to say, as much duty will be charged upon a dozen soda-water bottles as upon a dozen champagne bottles.  There is no basis, I submit, shown here for the duty that is sought to be imposed.  It is not an <i>ad valorem</i> duty; it is not a protection duty, because it would be hardly fair to say that the Minister would make such a dishonest proposal as that he would endeavour to secure protection for Irish mineral waters under the cloak of placing a duty upon imported bottles.</P>
    <P>I do not think that would be a fair comment to make, and not being an <i>ad valorem</i> duty, not being a protection duty, and certainly as no great revenue accrues to the country, I think that the Minister might favourably consider my suggestion and place the people in these trades in the same position as those who are engaged in importing empty bottles.  Of course it may be asked, where is the necessity for these mineral waters at all?  There <Col N="2276" /> is something in that argument, but, after all, they come from great natural springs.  Some of them come from our friends the Germans.  Take Apollinaris. Some come from France, such as the Vichy water; others come from Austria and Hungary, and they are products which we cannot produce in this country.  That being so, I sincerely hope that the Minister will see his way to accede to my request.</P>
    <P>The Bill as it stands has been altered in a few respects, and in the respects in which it has been altered from the original resolutions I heartily concur, especially in regard to Section 27.  I think the Minister's action is highly commendable in that regard in doing away with the entertainment duty upon all classes and all kinds of outdoor sports in the country.  I only wish that his example will be followed in other quarters and that Irishmen of all classes and of all shades of politics will be allowed to attend all kinds of sport, no matter what nationality that sport may come from.</P>
    <P>The Bill we are asked to give a second reading to contains, as Deputy Johnson stated, a long list of enactments repealed under the Third Schedule. I must confess that I agree with the Deputy that I would find it very difficult to say anything about almost any of these enactments.  It does require a little explanation, and it is hard to expect Deputies to pass a proposal like this without having in some respect at any rate, the faintest notion of what they are passing.  There are some of these enactments which are fairly intelligible, but I must say in regard to that income tax proposal of 1918, I confess I am entirely in the dark, and I hope the Minister will be able to enlighten us on that.  The Bill will now be passed and will go through its Committee Stage.  I do hope that even during the Committee Stage the Minister will be able to consider, even within this small margin of his, this modest request, if I might humbly say so, that I have made in regard to the cider duty and in regard to the duty on bottles.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Redmond expressed very aptly indeed <Col N="2277" /> the necessity for differences of opinion on the question of free trade and protection.  The fact of the matter is that I do not think it is possible for anybody to say that he is a whole-hogger as a free trader or protectionist. From the very essence of the subject it is necessarily a matter of discussing the effect of tariffs on each particular industry or otherwise.  You cannot possibly generalise on a matter of this kind.  I do not propose to waste the time of the Dáil at this stage, after such a long discussion, in going into the general question of tariffs and their desirability or otherwise.  I am sorry Deputy Heffernan has left, because I would like to convert him in one respect.  He referred to the desirability of a tax on barley and he stated that barley was one of the subjects that could be sufficiently protected.  To my mind he is utterly wrong in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Heffernan used the word &ldquo;taxed,&rdquo; not &ldquo;protected.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephEgan" hpid="Mr. P.J. EGAN Mr. P.J. EGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>He said &ldquo;protected,&rdquo; I think.  Then he proceeded to say that the effect of a tariff on barley would be to produce revenue. It is necessary to have clear thinking on this topic.  You want to decide definitely as to whether or not you are imposing taxes for protection, or simply for the purpose of raising revenue, because you are discussing utterly different things if you are not quite clear on that matter.  With regard to a tax on barley the position is, as I have on previous occasions informed the House, that by such a tax you would tax the raw material for our biggest industry, the Dublin stout industry, and as Deputy Wilson very properly pointed out, the total amount of imported barley is valued at only £187,000.  No matter what tax you put on, that amount of barley will come in, and it will not have any effect at all towards protecting barley grown in the country, whatever merits it might have in regard to raising revenue.  So that really, when discussing the question of a tariff on this substance, we ought to be perfectly clear as to whether we are discussing it from the point of view of <Col N="2278" /> the barley industry or from the point of view of providing revenue.</P>
      <P>There is one thing that I might call a blemish on an otherwise perfect Budget and that is the Minister's making a present of £600,000 to the farming community in the form of an agricultural grant.  It must not be considered for a moment that I disapprove of the farmers getting every reasonable help possible, because I, unfortunately, have a very keen personal knowledge of the difficulties of farming and of the desirability of encouraging agriculture in every shape and form.  My particular quarrel with this grant is the form in which the Minister gives it. I think it would have been very much better for him to give assistance to agriculture in such a form as would provide for some contribution of industry on the part of the farming community itself; but this grant is given alike to tillage farmers and grazing farmers.  The people who go in for grazing will get this money to help their industry without any contribution of industry on their part.  I think it would have been decidedly better if that £600,000 could be concentrated to give encouragement, or relief, to the tillage part of the farming industry, because, personally, I have very little use for the grazing industry. It does not employ enough people; it does not go any way at all towards relieving the tremendous number of unemployed, and I would have preferred to see the Minister give the bonus to tillage farmers, or to any other farmer who put extra land under the plough and who kept it under the plough.  That money would then be utilised for giving work to our people, which I consider is the greatest problem we have to face to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter on which I have already expressed an opinion, and that is the Minister's failure to lower the spirit duty or the beer duty; I more particularly refer to the spirit duty.  Temperance is undoubtedly very desirable, but I wish to make the point that the Minister's failure to lower the spirit duty is encouraging poteen-making and encouraging intemperance. The present duty on spirits is £3 12s. a gallon, and it will naturally <Col N="2279" /> be seen that there is a tremendous temptation to people to manufacture illicit spirit when they can make so much money out of it.  A hatful of whiskey costs £3 12s.  There can be no question of doubt that illicit distillation has not yet been got under proper control.  I know of my own knowledge that considerable quantities of it are being made.  It came under my notice quite recently that there was very considerable pilfering of malt in various districts.  I actually heard in one case of a cartload of malt having been taken in broad daylight out of a certain malthouse and distributed secretly to people manufacturing illicit spirits.  It must be remembered that every barrel of malt so stolen is equivalent, if it is used alone, to about nine gallons of proof spirit, and if on top of that you allow for the fact that it is mixed with three or four parts of other material for producing spirits, one can see that any considerable quantity of malt finding its way in that direction would mean the manufacturing of a great deal of illicit spirit.  I am quite sure that medical Deputies will maintain, as I do, that the consumption of illicit spirit has a very serious effect on the health of our people.  To begin with, it is badly and crudely made; fusil oil and other injurious ingredients are not removed from it, and, above all, it is sold at an extraordinarily high strength, which undoubtedly does serious damage to the health of the people.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the thing is that our old Irish pot-still industry is dying fast; there can be no question or doubt about that.  I am quite certain that officers of the Customs and Excise will corroborate that statement.  The Irish pot-still industry is certainly dying, and that has its reflection on the farming community.  That is an aspect of the Budget to which I am sorry the Minister could not see his way to give consideration, and I certainly hope that if he prepares the Budget next year he will try to give some relief in that direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Redmond devoted a considerable portion of his remarks to this <Col N="2280" /> tax on bottles.  As far as I could gather from the general tenour of his remarks, he objects to the tariff on bottles coming in with Apollinaris and other foreign waters.  I would like to remind Deputy Redmond that Apollinaris and other continental waters that are imported are interfering with the consumption of Waterford cider and with the consumption of mineral waters, the manufacture of which gives employment here.</P>

With regard to the general matter of the tax on bottles, there has been some misapprehension, and I hope that the Minister will devote a few words to elucidating the points to which Deputy Redmond refers, because a great many of us are not perfectly clear on it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy did not, perhaps, understand me.  I did not object to the tax on Apollinaris or upon mineral waters.  Neither did I object to the tax on the bottles containing them.  What I did object to was that these full bottles were placed in a different position from empty bottles, because empty bottles have only to pay a tax once; they can be exported and re-exported.  Provision is made in Section 18 to that effect, but there is no provision in Section 19, and I maintain that the containers should be treated the same way.  I am not objecting to the tax at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Good referred to the question of the trade in apparel with the North and outside the Saorstát.  I think the arrangements for transit without payment of duty and for the warehousing of goods in bond, are such as will permit that trade to be carried on.  At any rate, deputations representing the trade have been seen, and while naturally they are not very keen on providing warehouses, <Col N="2281" /> I think they are satisfied that the arrangements are such as will allow the trade to be carried on in the future. The question of transit of linen goods to which, I think, Deputy Figgis referred, is covered in the same way.  I believe people will have no difficulty in carrying on any trade that has existed.  There may be certain expense to be added on.  Expense such as warehousing cannot be avoided.</P>
      <P>I have not examined the matter of charity clothes fully, and I do not know whether it is necessary in that case to make any arrangements or not. There are occasionally coming to this country charity clothes which perhaps are not wanted.  I heard a story recently of a consignment of goods having been sent to some village in the West following a scare which arose some months ago, consisting of all sorts of garments, old dress suits, top hats and so forth.  The inhabitants of the village to which they were sent put them on, paraded the town and made a bonfire of them.  There may be a case for charity clothes, and it may be possible to admit them free to certain organisations.  It is a matter which I will have to look into, and on which as yet I have not been able to come to any conclusion.  It is impossible to define the subjects you are to tax in such a way that no question of doubt can arise as to its scope.  If we were to prepare a schedule we would find we excluded things we did not mean to exclude, or included things we did not mean to include.  It might be possible after years working of a tax to prepare a complete schedule to cover exactly the ground we meant to cover and no more or less.  When we are initiating new tariffs, I think it is impossible to be aware of every consideration that is likely to arise.  I do not think any serious question can arise as to the scope of the tariff in wearing apparel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of furniture is a little more difficult, but I think soon we will be in a position to issue a comprehensive schedule that will enable any member of the public to know clearly on what he may expect to be charged duty and the articles that will be <Col N="2282" /> exempt.  Even in the matter of brushes the thing is not so difficult at all.  The brushes that are part of the furniture of a house, that may be found in any ordinary house for household use, are taxed as furniture.  Brushes intended for personal use are not taxed.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy leased a house he might expect to find a hearth brush but I do not think he would expect to find a chimney sweep's brush. There are one or two categories of brushes which it is difficult to decide on and about which we are obtaining legal opinion; brushes which from one aspect might be looked on as brushes for personal use and which, from another, might be looked on as part of furniture of a house.  Boot and clothes brushes are important from the point of view of people who make brushes in this country.  They are border line cases and we are seeking advice as to whether they come under the term furniture or not.  In general, there is not much difficulty in deciding whether those articles are taxable or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision for a minimum charge of 2s. 6d. is not one we can afford to waive.  We have had a very close connection with what is now part of a different economic unit.  Large quantities of retail parcels have been imported.  Each of those, if it contains dutiable goods, demands attention of a fairly highly paid staff.  It does not pay and it imposes an undue and unnecessary charge on the Exchequer to employ a Customs staff examining parcels which only yield a penny or two pence or three pence duty.  It is most desirable from that point of view that we should try to decrease importations of those small parcels of dutiable goods.  If people will send in and import small parcels of dutiable goods, <Col N="2283" /> I think they have no great amount of complaint if some such reasonable figure is charged.  It would mean that those new duties would entail an enormous increase in our staff and in our work if we did away with the minimum duty, because the number of parcels coming through the post and otherwise would be very much greater than with the minimum.  Each of those parcels would have to be examined, calculations would have to be made, forms would have to be filled up and the expense to the State would be quite considerable.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the agricultural aspect of our tariff policy has been discussed a great deal.  I agree with those who say that some direct stimulus to agricultural production is necessary.  I agree with Deputy Johnson and Deputy Egan.  I do not feel satisfied that the best way to give relief or assistance to agriculture is the agricultural grant in its present form. I think during the coming twelve months the whole question of the basis on which the agricultural grant is allocated should be examined.  I know that the Minister for Agriculture agrees with me in that.  We felt some assistance was necessary for agriculture in this present year.  We were not able to arrive at any other basis of assistance except doubling of the agricultural grant.  It seems to me that the sum of £1,200,000 given to agriculture, produces a singularly poor result for such a large sum, and if we got a better basis of distribution which would appeal to the country as reasonably fair it would be better to abandon the present system altogether.  I promise Deputies so far as the agricultural grant is concerned, that we will during the year, examine the whole question and see whether we cannot get a better basis than the one we have whereby the grazier who lets his land lie there gets as much as the man who employs others in the tilling of his fields.  The question of tariffs for agriculture, I believe, is an extremely complicated and difficult thing.</P>

      <P>The question of tariffs for agricultural produce is an extremely complicated and difficult one. In conjunction with the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, I gave a great deal of attention to it during the year. We examined this question of tariffs on foreign bacon, butter, and oatmeal, and at one stage we were very much disposed to impose a tariff on some of them.  We finally decided against that, with a certain amount of hesitation and reluctance.  The difficulty seems to be that in the case of bacon, there is an exportable surplus.  It is very difficult to see how you can get better prices for agricultural produce so long as a surplus has to be exported.  Home prices will tend to be the prices that can be got for the surplus that must be exported.  Other results might be obtained&mdash;results of very great national importance, very valuable results and such results as we should seek&mdash;but I do not think you will get such results as would directly give benefit to the farmer from, say, putting a protective tax on bacon.  Then the question of butter was considered.  If we had been able to believe that a tax on butter would have resulted in an increase in winter dairying, we would certainly have imposed it.  But we came to the conclusion that the result would not be an increase in winter dairying but simply an increase in the practice of putting summer butter into storage. That would be a small result for a tax which would undoubtedly raise the cost of living in the winter months to the people of the country and of our towns and cities.  Against an oatmeal tax we found no real objection, except that we had not thought out fully the whole agricultural aspect of the matter, and it seemed so trifling an act of assistance that we thought it was not worth while doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I said, in the Budget statement, that we were not going to impose any further tariffs on manufactured <Col N="2285" /> goods during the period of this Dáil, I made no reference to taxes on agricultural products.  We are free to consider that whole matter during the year, and to see if anything can be done.  We are agreed that any reasonable steps that can be taken to increase not only agricultural production, but to increase tillage, should have our assistance.  We might have an increase in the total agricultural production without any great increase in employment. For instance, improvement in the breeds of cattle might lead to greater production of beef.  It might lead to the production of more valuable stores and might increase the value considerably of our agricultural produce and yet give very little additional employment.  We feel that it is most necessary to increase tillage in the country.  That is one of the things that we are looking for from the proposal in regard to beet sugar.  There will be no fortune for farmers in beet sugar so far as I can make out.  When it comes to the time when the subsidy will be almost disappearing, beet sugar will not be a highly profitable crop. But this scheme will have other results. It is expected to lead to a general increase in tillage and to an increase in winter dairying.  It is with a view, not to its manufacturing results, that we are giving encouragement to the beet sugar industry, but with a view to its agricultural results.  The employment of 100 or 200 men for a few months in the year in a factory would not justify the subsidy that will have to be given, but if we can turn grass land into tillage land on a very considerable scale, then the subsidy will have justified itself.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Egan about the question of a tax on barley.  I think that so long as Farmer Deputies or Farmers' Associations put up a proposal for a tax on barley, it shows that they are entirely muddle-headed on the question of protection.  The views of any association that puts up a proposal like that are not deserving of any consideration.</P>
    <P>I need hardly refer again to Deputy Johnson's statement in regard to the arrears of income tax and the responsibility <Col N="2286" /> that people in the Government may have had for withholding payments in the past.  At any rate, the tax is due.  It is due to the Saorstát. All reasonable time will be given to the people to pay.  I think that people who show a disposition to pay will never be treated harshly or have any cause for complaint.  On the other hand, when people take up a stone-wall attitude and are determined not to pay, they must be coerced into paying.  I believe that a far greater dislocation of industry and far more trouble between employers and employed would be caused if there were a large number of arrests and imprisonments.  I also think, leaving experience out of it, that there is no more easy way for any person receiving salary or wages to pay income tax than through deductions. The people who get their salary paid without the tax being deducted, and who spend it and then receive a demand for income tax, find it very hard to pay; but if a few shillings are deducted every week or month, the thing does not seem to be a very serious burden at all.</P>
    <P>With regard to the schedules to which Deputy Johnson referred, I did not think it necessary, at this stage, to go over the Bill clause by clause, or to take all the items in the schedule and to explain them.  All the major matters in the Bill have already been dealt with, or were mentioned by me this evening.  The matters to which references were not made were really quite minor matters, which I thought could be adequately discussed in Committee.</P>
    <P>With reference to the repeal of Sections 21 and 24 of the Finance Act of 1910, those repeals do away with the mineral rights duty which is all that remains of the famous land value duties.  This tax during the past few years has, for about 47 assessments, given an average revenue of £119.  It does not pay.  It is not worth the cost of collection, and it is felt that because it practically gives no revenue, while it gives a certain amount of work and trouble, it ought to be repealed.  It is a duty that is of some importance in England, but it is of no importance here.  It is scarcely of more account than the old Excise duty on playing <Col N="2287" /> cards.  If there were to be discoveries or developments here that might make such a duty a matter of importance, this duty could be re-imposed, but at present we do not think it desirable to continue a tax which gives trouble and for all practical purposes gives no revenue.  The repeal of Section 14 of the Finance Act of 1916, is a repeal that should have been made last year. The section which then dealt with the exemption of these securities from income tax was repealed, but the other sub-section, dealing with super-tax, was not repealed.  The result was that a certain anomaly was created.  Section 48, sub-section (2) of the Income Tax Act of 1918, provided that interest in these cases should be assessed to super-tax as if the amount actually received by the taxpayer represented the balance remaining after deduction of tax at the highest rate.  For example, when the rate was five shillings, £4 of tax-compounded interest was treated for super-tax purposes as £5 16s. 0d. We now tax the interest as it arrives for income tax purposes, and it is only correct that we should treat it in the same way for super-tax purposes.  That is to say, the income tax exemption having been repealed, the provisions in relation to calculation of super-tax, which were based on that exemption, should also be repealed, and it should be assessed for super-tax in the ordinary way.  That is a repeal that should have been made last year, when the other provision was repealed, but it was overlooked.</P>
    <P>The question of the change in the Section relating to exemption of certain entertainments from entertainment duty is, as I think Deputy Johnson said, a matter that we could discuss more fully in Committee.  As a matter of fact, I think that really no entertainments promoted by the G.A.A., if the law were being enforced, would really be exempt if that part of the section which is being repealed were retained.  It would be better exempt than have confusion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not an option left with the Commissioners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; but certain <Col N="2288" /> duties which that Association has been liable in law to pay, have not been collected. A certain confusion of mind in regard to their rights has arisen, and it is desirable that there should be nothing that can be argued about.  It would be a very arguable matter if the old exempting section were to remain as it was heretofore.  This is a matter with which I will be prepared to deal at length when in Committee.</P>
      <P>The other repeal to which Deputy Johnson referred, dealt with Section 68, sub-section 2, paragraph (b) of the Income Tax Act of 1918.  That is to remove what we regard as an anomaly. Under the Income Tax Acts&mdash;it dates very far back&mdash;the Bank of England and the Bank of Ireland were their own assessors.  There may be some reason for continuing that privilege to the Bank of England, because it is a bank which occupies a very peculiar position, and which has peculiar relations towards the Government.  But the Bank of Ireland here is not by any means in the position that the Bank of England occupies in Great Britain.  It seems to us that there is no reason at all why the bank should not be assessed in the ordinary way by official assessors.  As a matter of fact, in strict law, if the Bank of Ireland cared at the present time to assess its profits at £5, we could do nothing except bring in legislation.  We propose that, for the future, the power of acting as its own assessor should be taken from the bank.  The authorities of the Bank of Ireland itself recognises this anomaly, and have no objection to the change being made.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson referred to the case  person who left his coat behind and wanted to import it free of duty. That individual would be allowed to have his coat in free of duty, but, of course, he would have to satisfy the Revenue Commissioners that it was his coat, and that it was left behind.  That always creates difficulties.</P>

      <P>Difficulties as regards proof will always arise in such cases, and I do not see how they can be got over.  Deputy Gorey raised a question <Col N="2289" /> in regard to entertainment tax on agricultural shows.  That tax is only charged where a band or something like that is provided.  The position is that the people have to choose whether they will have a band or whether they will escape the entertainment duty.  I will examine the matter, and see whether we can make a concession in that respect.  There is no doubt that a certain amount of rigidity has to be observed in these matters or you would have all kinds of entertainments escaping duty by bringing in a lecture or something else that was exempt, and claiming entire exemption for the entertainment.</P>

If we decide to give any exemption, we shall have to leave it fully in the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners to decide whether the show is a <i>bona fide</i> one or not.</P>
      <P>Deputy Heffernan said something about the Revenue authorities looking on every income tax payer who was disputing anything with them as being potentially a rogue.  The Revenue Commissioners cannot be expected to believe all they are told.  I do not think we have reached that stage of public morality where people tell the truth spontaneously and without pressure as an invariable rule when dealing with income tax matters.  The Deputy spoke about the issue of a pamphlet couched in simple language, explaining the income tax laws.  It could not be done.  The income tax laws are very complicated, and any attempt to explain them briefly and in simple language would only lead people astray.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Redmond suggested the exemption of cider from Excise duty.  It is very difficult to see why cider should be exempted if lemonade and ginger ale and similar drinks are taxed, and we certainly could not afford to drop the Excise duty on mineral waters.  If <Col N="2290" /> we are going to retain the Excise duty on mineral waters, it is very difficult to see how cider can be exempted.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows that cider in certain cases is taken as a substitute for beer or ale, which might be made from Irish barley.  It is really difficult to see how a special case can be made for ciders except, as the Deputy says, that it is a one-man duty and would be a one-man remission. But if it is wrong to have a one-man duty, it is probably wrong to have a one-man remission.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not re-consider the matter, in view of the fact that this tax was imposed during the War in England, and that it is only in force here because of that.  It has been remitted in England, and there is very little revenue derived from it here.  I am not suggesting that the Customs duty should be removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will promise to consider it.  It is not a question of money so much as the difficulty of making a distinction.  The distinction between bottles imported as containers and bottles imported empty in regard to their export and re-importation afterwards, was made advisedly.  We allow bottles which have been imported empty, and which have subsequently been exported containing, say, beer, whiskey, or mineral waters, to be re-imported free of duty, because we wish to encourage and assist an Irish trade, but we have no particular interest in encouraging the import of manufactured articles from outside.  We have actually to stretch the ordinary Customs <Col N="2291" /> law to enable bottles which are first imported empty, or are made here, to be exported and re-imported free, because strictly speaking, the bottles that are re-imported should be identified with the bottles which were exported. We cannot do that, and what we do is, we keep a running account with certain traders.  If they export so many bottles full of some commodity, we allow them to re-import the same number of similar bottles empty. That is a stretching of the law, but we think it is legitimate.  It is the only way that that particular remission can be allowed.  We do not feel inclined to stretch the law in the way we would have to do in favour of people who are actually outside manufacturers producing and sending in goods here in competition with home - produced articles.  It is necessary to have the tax on containers in order to prevent commodities being imported in containers for the sake of having the bottles brought in free of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that we can manufacture the natural springs from which Hunyadi, Apollinaris or Vichy water is produced?  Does he suggest that it is not advisable for medicinal and other purposes to import these?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know much about them really.  In any case, what happens is that there is a tax, if the bottle contains over five fluid ounces, of one halfpenny per bottle.  That corresponds to something like the tax that the Irish producer of anything that might compete with these natural waters would have to pay if he imported the bottle, and he certainly would have in the present circumstances to pay something of it, if he bought bottles produced here.  If these bottles are now collected and sent out again for refilling, they will continue to be sent out in spite of this tax.  If it still pays to collect bottles, take them out of the country, and refill them, it will pay them just in exactly the same way, as they will have to pay one halfpenny on each new bottle coming in, and it does not matter to them whether that bottle has been in before or not, <Col N="2292" /> whether it is refilled or a bottle that never was filled before.  There will be no ill effect on Irish production of glass bottles as a result of not having this arrangement for the free import.</P>

      <P>They would have to pay the duty still.  I do not really see what the Deputy is arguing.  It is a matter that we can thresh out more fully on the Committee Stage.  Perhaps the Deputy will put down an amendment which would embody his own ideas.  Deputy Egan referred to the question of the spirits duty and poteen-making. It is, of course, recognised that the high duty on spirits does lead to the making of poteen, but there would have to be a very considerable reduction in the spirit duty to have much effect on the disposition of people to manufacture poteen if they can.  I do not believe that reducing the duty from 72/- to 50/-, for instance, would have that effect.  If the duty were 50/- per gallon there would be still a tendency to make poteen, as there would be still a profit in the making of it, if people could do it with impunity. We could not really afford to give a reduction in the duty, even if it were socially desirable, that would make it not very profitable to make poteen. The only way that seems to be practicable for combating poteen-making is better police supervision, heavier penalties, &amp;c.  I do not think that it is within the bounds of practical politics substantially to discourage it by a reduction in duty.  We might lose £1,000,000 in revenue trying to do it.  Even if we gave such a reduction as would lead to the loss of £1,000,000 in revenue, we would not have done very much to discourage <Col N="2293" /> poteen-making, because the profit that would still be available would be very considerable.</P>
      <P>We had a limited sum to give away in remission of taxation, and we felt very definitely that it was better to give remission on articles of more general consumption than on articles like spirits, or even beer, which is a much more popular drink.  In spite of the fact that spirits would seem less able to bear the tax that is now imposed than beer, I think a better case can be made for the reduction of the beer duty.  Socially, probably, it would be more desirable to give a reduction in the beer duty.  It may be lamentable that an old industry like the distilling industry seems to be very much on the down grade.  It is difficult to see what can be done in the matter.  To my mind we cannot do much for it by a reduction of taxes.  The reduction we would have to give to revive it would be such as we cannot afford.  I take it that its revival is, socially, by a great cheapening of whiskey, not a thing to be desired.  The spirit duty is no greater here than it is in Northern Ireland or Great Britain.  The distilleries in these places seem to be doing better than the distilleries here.  I do not know what the reason is, or if the distilleries here can remedy it or not. I suggest, perhaps, that some hope for better conditions lies in the distilleries examining that problem for themselves. It is not a matter for me.  I do not say that we should never give a reduction in these taxes.  I am not taking up any &ldquo;Pussyfoot&rdquo; attitude in regard to them, but I think an article used by, perhaps, one-fifth or one-eighth of the population with any degree of regularity, should not be given the benefit of a tax remission before an article which is used by practically every member of the community.</P>

      <P>Now that these powers have been transferred to the Minister, I would like to ask him to provide some State protection for the brown trout fisheries.  At present these fisheries receive practically no attention.  There are in Westmeath the most celebrated trout lakes in Ireland.  For the past four or five years thousands of trout going to the rivers to spawn have been taken away, put into barrels, and salted, to the great detriment of fishing. If even one bailiff was appointed for the three Spring months of the year to look after the brown trout fisheries, it would be a great advantage. The Civic Guard are doing their best to help, but if one bailiff was appointed, even in Westmeath, to look after brown trout, it would be a very good thing.  There is a Fish Preservation Society in Westmeath.  It endeavoured to get into touch with societies in other counties, but found that there were very few such organisations.  I called attention to this matter last year, and I now make a strong appeal to the Minister to appoint a bailiff to look after the lakes and rivers, especially during the spawning season.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take this opportunity to impress on the Government and the Ministers the necessity for giving the fisheries on rivers sufficient protection.  On Sunday night last, I believe that Civic Guards from different barracks co-operated and made a number of raids on the Barrow, the Suir, and the Nore.  I understand that fourteen or fifteen crews, with fishing gear, were captured, with, I believe, the assistance of the military. That is the only effective way of deal <Col N="2297" /> ing with this question.  It shows also that it is useless to be depending on water-bailiffs.  I suggested on a former occasion, that there should be men attached to the Civic Guard who are trained to deal with such work.  If such men were available, they could assist in protecting fish on the lower reaches of the rivers during the spawning season. I do not believe any additional expense would be involved.  If you had such a force you would have an effective machine, and protection afforded.  I have no objection to the appointment of a certain number of bailiffs if they can be got, but if you have trained men attached to the Civic Guards the number of fish in the rivers can be very much increased.  At present it is deplorable. I saw explosives used about ten days ago in a river, and I saw the fish coming to the top and floating around.  Sometime afterwards I found hundreds of small fish lying there dead.</P>

Bailiffs are appointed by the boards of conservators, and under this Bill we have far greater powers than we had.  We have power to see that the conservators appoint the proper type of bailiff.  We have also the power to see that not alone the salmon fisheries but the brown trout and other fisheries are properly protected. We are providing the boards with better finances to enable them to supply the proper type of bailiff, and we hold the power to see that they do provide the proper type.

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know whether there is any justification for this amendment.  You are dealing with fishery laws which are peculiar, and certain authorities are set up with rather peculiar powers, and there are also special classes of offences.  I question the wisdom of allowing anybody to prosecute in respect of any of these various offences.  I think the original form is better, that somebody having responsibility should be the prosecutor, and not any person who might by chance think that his neighbour is offending.  It seems to me that an officious person, who is a sportsman and who thinks that his sport is being spoiled, may be tempted to bring a prosecution, and, if he has money to spare, such prosecution might involve a poorer man in a lot of expense and trouble.  There may be a margin between a malicious prosecution and one in which malice may be difficult to prove, but which may be malicious all the same.  I think there should be more responsibility borne by the prosecutor than by simply allowing any person to prosecute.  From the tone of the Minister's comment, I do not think that he is very keen about either of the amendments which are on the Order Paper dealing with this matter.  I think the original arrangement was much better and sounder, and we ought not invite any person who thinks himself clever to undertake a prosecution under the fishery laws.  That should be left to the proper authority.  I will oppose the amendment, both that of Deputy Cooper and that proposed by Deputy Duggan.</P>

      <P>I agree with what Deputy Johnson has said.  I think the principle embodied in the amendment is very undesirable legislation.  It <Col N="2300" /> seems to put it in the hands of a person in a district to make himself thoroughly offensive to his neighbours, and under the guise that, in being so, he is doing it for public policy.  I think it is a bad principle to give a private individual the power to bring a prosecution. Prosecution as a prosecution is a State matter, and to say that a private individual can prosecute another man is wrong.  I strongly support the objection to this amendment.</P>

      <P>As far as I know, there has been no complaint of officiousness and interference in the exercise of that right, or of upsetting the liberty of the subject.  The whole fishery policy has been to make the ordinary individual feel that he has a responsibility in the preservation of fish, and of the fisheries as an asset to the State, and bringing money into the country, and that he should help towards this development so as to make it a valuable and lucrative thing for us.  We ought to make every citizen feel that it is his duty to help in enforcing the fishery laws.  I agree with Deputy O'Connell that they need remodelling. I did not oppose the amendment by Deputy Johnson that proxy voting should be abolished.  But such as the laws are, they are entitled to receive the assistance of the people in their enforcement.

That principle is carried out in my amendment, or the Minister's.  I am not pressing my <Col N="2301" /> amendment against the Minister's.  If he prefers to have it in the terminology of the draughtsman rather than in the plain English of mine, I will not quarrel with him.  I do not know if the Minister knows Shakespeare's play, &ldquo;Measure for Measure.&rdquo;  In that play there is a public executioner, and when it was suggested he should have an assistant who belonged to a different calling, he replied: &ldquo;Fie, Sir, he will discredit our mystery.&rdquo;  When a private member proposes an amendment the draughtsman replies: &ldquo;Fie, Sir, this will discredit our mystery.&rdquo; I will accept the Minister's amendment as it achieves my object.  If Deputy Johnson forces a division I shall have the pleasure of walking out in a division in which the níl votes will be taken by Deputy Johnson and Deputy Hewat, and that will be at least an experience.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to accept one or other of the amendments. If he tries to enforce the fisheries laws with a small staff under the board of conservators the results will be deplorable.  As a matter of fact very few prosecutions take place, except those brought by servants of the board.  If the right of prosecution is confined only to the servants of the board it would be making the fishery laws a farce.  In fresh water districts it may happen that hundreds of miles are left to the supervision of two or three bailiffs, and it would be absurd to expect that they would be able to enforce the fishery laws.  Even with the <Col N="2302" /> aid of the Civic Guards I do not think it could be done in many cases.  Giving the right to prosecute to any person, might lead to abuse in some cases, although I have never known it to be abused.  No one is going to make a nuisance of himself to his neighbours in this matter.  Such a class of man does not exist in the country, but he may be found in the civilised regions of the suburbs of Dublin, where, if people hear a dog bark, they may bring a prosecution.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Cooper that we want to make the people generally feel that it is not only the responsibility of the officials appointed by the conservators to look after the fishery interests, but that it should be realised that they are a national asset, and something in which they are even personally concerned. We want to give these people the opportunity to exercise the spirit of good citizenship, and to bring a prosecution for an offence against the fishery laws. We are trying to do that in this section, and I stand over it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the question is put I would like to ask the Minister if he has given consideration to the proposal moved on the Committee Stage in reference to Section 13.  It was pointed out then that it appeared, from the section as drafted, that, when the board of conservators strike a fishery rate for a year, that the fisheries may be, or would be, exempted from liability for ten years from any county or county borough or urban district rate for the succeeding nine years as well as the year in question.  The Minister promised to look into the matter, and, if he thought it necessary, to introduce an amendment so as to make it clear that the exemption would only apply for the period, shall I say, during which the fishery rate was levied.  I would like to know whether the Minister has considered the matter, and if he has, what the result of that consideration has been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked into the matter, and I find that there is a certain amount of looseness in sub-section (6) of Section 13, to which Deputy Johnson referred on the Committee Stage. At the same time, we feel that that is covered by sub-section (4), where it is provided that if the board of conservators do not strike a rate, the Minister may strike a rate on or before the 28th February, in the fishery year.  A difficulty arises in this way, that the fishery year and the ordinary financial year do not coincide.  The fishery year starts on the 1st October, while the ordinary financial year starts on the 1st April.  I looked into the matter with a view to tightening it up as far as possible.  I was in consultation with a draughtsman.  After reading over about six times the only amendment that he could produce, I confess that I could not really understand it.  I want the Bill to be as clear as possible, so that the clerks to boards of conservators and others concerned may be able easily to grasp the meaning of the Act when it is in force.  I had an amendment drafted with the object of meeting Deputy Johnson's point, but after looking into it carefully about half-a-dozen times, I thought it inadvisable to put it down on the Order Paper.  I think, however, that his point is met sufficiently by sub-section (4).  If the Deputy desires it, I could arrange that the suggested amendment which I did not put on the Order Paper <Col N="2305" /> for to-day could be introduced in the Seanad, but personally I do not think it is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will consider this matter again between now and the date of the consideration of the Bill in the Seanad.  I would point out to him that this power under sub-section (4) is only in respect to the striking of a fishery rate by the boards of conservators, and can only be used for fishery purposes, whereas the exemption for nine years is in respect to the right of a county borough or of a county council to strike a rate.  It is the local authorities which would be the losers under the section as it stands. However, the Minister, I have no doubt, will consider the matter between now and the consideration of the Bill in the Seanad, and I leave it at that.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of this Bill.  It is necessary to provide by statute a legal method of proving acts of the Oireachtas and other official instruments. In the absence of such special statutory provision, the ordinary rules of law would apply, and it would be necessary to produce in court the original Statute or Order whenever it was required to prove same.  The <Col N="2306" /> simplest and most satisfactory method of proof is by the production of a copy of the Statute or Order purporting to be printed under the authority of the Stationery Office.  As a corollary to this, and in order to prevent abuses, it is necessary to provide penalties for persons printing or publishing copies of official documents and falsely representing same as having been printed under the authority of the Stationery Office.  On the Committee Stage, I can deal with each section as it arises.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of this Bill.  It is a Bill to enable certain ex-national school teachers to have the benefit of the increase of Pensions Act of 1920, and of the Superannuation Pensions Act of 1923.  The Bill covers the same ground as the Bill that was presented by Deputy O'Connell.  I had thought of widening its provisions a little so as to allow teachers to have the benefits of this increased pension wherever they were resident.  I find, however, that there are certain other classes of pensioners who only get the increase if they live within the British Isles; that is to say, if they live in Great Britain or in Ireland or in the Channel Islands. These are people like pensioned members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, Petty Sessions' Clerks, and certain pensioners paid from the Church Temporalities Fund, and pensioners under certain non-Government bodies, such as the Port and Docks Board and certain officials under local authorities.  It is felt that if we extended the qualification to a world-wide residence qualification in the case of teachers, it would also have to be extended in the case of these other officials.  I came to the conclusion, therefore, that we should <Col N="2307" /> have the qualification that was proposed in Deputy O'Connell's Bill.</P>

      <P>As the Minister says this Bill covers the ground of the Bill discussed here on a former occasion, and I am satisfied it meets the position I wanted to have met.  The only people excluded under the provisions of the Minister's Bill, if there be any such, would be those resident outside the Colonies or the Dominions, because the ex-teacher who goes to reside outside, the Colonies or the British Dominions is not eligible for pension at all, so these would be the only people, and I doubt if there are any such.  At any rate I am satisfied with the measure as introduced, as it meets the particular point I raised on a former occasion.  There is one small point in connection with the matter that I will raise in Committee, or perhaps I might take it up with the Minister. Beyond that I am satisfied that the Bill meets all the points.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Bill, 1925.  The Bill repeals all existing statutes with regard to patents, trade marks, designs and copyright and re-enacts with certain changes, the existing law, in this Bill which is now before the House.  As it is sought to re-establish patent law in the country it is necessary that there should be set up a comptroller of patents, and a patent office, and this is done in the early portion of the Bill. The law relating to patents, trades marks and designs is very much the same for these three things; it is almost identical.  The actual machinery is not so detailed in the case of trade marks and designs as in the case of patents, but it would run mainly on the same lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Copyright law does not follow the <Col N="2308" /> same line, but is somewhat similar.  As patent law is the more detailed and technical, I want simply to give a sketch with regard to patents, and to state the history peculiar to this Bill with regard to several knotty points that have arisen in connection with patents, leaving it to be understood that some points will arise, and will be dealt with by the same methods as in the case of trade marks and designs, and simply stating, with regard to copyright, what the new provisions in this Bill are with regard to what they used to be.</P>
    <P>With regard to patents there is a rather long and cumbersome procedure which it is necessary to provide or adopt in the machinery which is going to ensure something of a commercial value, and to ensure that the article patented has a commercial property afterwards.  There are, roughly speaking, two systems with regard to patents in the world.  One is the system which makes for long and accurate search for anticipation, so that when a patent is given as a result of such search with a definite implication that that specification has not been published before, the property is obviously of much greater value than where you simply receive an application for a patent, stamp it with the date of receipt, and leave the matter as to prior publication and novelty to be decided by a trial in the law courts afterwards.  To take an example: The French system is merely stamping the date upon the application or specification after it is received. That marks one thing only, namely, the date upon which the specification was put in.  Whether there was a prior application or not, as to something novel, is left to be determined afterwards.  All that is done is that there is official signature or sanction given with regard to the date and that only.  As to the other system, the British Patent Office system, it makes search for 50 years back, and all over the world, so that when a person gets a patent from the British office it obviously has a much higher value, commercially, than if such a specification were simply passed. We are adopting a sort of compromise, but tending towards the British system. It leans upon, and is aided by the British <Col N="2309" /> system.  In order to get a fuller commercial value of the article, it is necessary that search for anticipation should be made over a long period, and it is necessary that that search should be made with great care, and consequently you have these cumbersome rules laid down here in the first 15 and 16 pages of this Bill.  The operative date afterwards, with regard to the patent, is to be the first application, provided that the first application is followed up.  It may lapse, but provided it is followed up by the provision of this specification, it is passed and sealed.  The sealing dates back from the date of application, so that the date of application is an essential date, and the date by which priority is ruled. Now you have set out in a series of paragraphs the procedure to be followed. The application is made in the prescribed form with which there is a statutory declaration, and that is to be accompanied by a provisional or a complete specification.</P>
    <P>Supposing, as would ordinarily be the case, that a provisional specification &mdash;an application with that specification&mdash;is handed to the examiner, who makes certain investigations and finally acknowledges the acceptance of the application, then after a certain period following the acceptance of the application, a complete specification must be filed.  The provisional specification and the complete specification are then again handed to the examiner.  He compares the complete specification with the previous provisional specification to see if they agree exactly, or to see if an attempt has been made, as sometimes happens, to get into the complete specification something not previously stated in the provisional one, or to get an earlier date assigned to what is actually a later application. Provided that the examiner reports that the specifications are substantially the same, then the complete specification is examined, not now in its relation to the provisional specification, but in its relation to the question of novelty.  The question of the search then begins.  With regard to the establishment of a patent office here, the system that will really operate for the future will be this: a person filing <Col N="2310" /> a specification will have to state with the application whether or not he has filed a specification and has or has not received a grant of a patent in Britain. If the British Patent Office has certificates for some fifty years back, any certificate from them would be more or less accepted here as being final and conclusive.</P>
    <P>There will be, as from the date of the establishment of the patent office here, a new series of specifications.  They will have to be filed and scheduled here and a comparison may have to be made in the office in Dublin.  Specifications for patents existing prior to this are already in Dublin.  The National Library has a complete copy of all specifications that are at present in the British Patent Office.  While not quite up to the date of this Act, the copies of specifications are certainly up to the 6th December, 1921.  There is in the National Library a record of the specifications connected with patents granted prior to that date.  There has to be a junction as between the British system and the inauguration of the Irish system, and from this on the Irish system will to a great extent lean on British certificates.  If there is a British certificate or refusal, these two things will have a tremendous influence on the mind of the comptroller of patents here.  A search will be made here in certain cases, presumably in most cases, to follow out the ordinary run of a patent.  Provided the search for anticipation shows there is actually a novelty and that there is some invention which is to be patented, then the complete specification is accepted and an advertisement of that acceptance has to be published.  The advertisement is necessary because, within a certain period, people who hold that a prior right of theirs is being violated in the new specification will have the right to intervene and object to the granting of the patent. Provided that does not happen, the patent may be sealed.  The sealing does not give an irrevocable right to the patentee because, within a year after, a person may apply for a revocation on much the same grounds as those on which he could apply within a period <Col N="2311" /> of two months if he had any objection to the granting of the patent.</P>
    <P>That is the normal course from the first application, the search for anticipation, the granting and sealing of the patent, any possible opposition to the granting of the patent, any appeal or any application for a revocation. Leaving that out as the normal course, there is then this particular circumstance that had to be adverted to when the Bill was being introduced.  There was the question of patents that operated here prior to the 6th December, 1921, and applications for patents which had been lodged here after 6th December, 1921, and prior to the commencement of this Act.  With regard to patents that were filed and operated prior to 7th December, 1921, they will continue to hold good in the country. Certain fees may have to be paid under them, and these fees will be paid when certain lodgments of documents, etc., are made here, in accordance with our orders.  The position between the 6th December, 1921, and the date of the commencement of the Act, is this: there have been almost 3,000 applications for patents made to date either to the Minister for Economic Affairs under one Dáil, or to the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce under another Dáil.  There have been 2,300 applications for patents.  Those were dated, and the date of application will be considered in contrast with the date of any similar applications for a patent that may have been lodged in Britain during that intervening period.  The dates here, when they show priority, will be assumed to give priority.  As I say, the date of application is the all-important date.  The sealing process leads back to the date of application. There is an attempt made to protect those who did apply to the Minister here in that intervening period.  With regard to the future, the application made after the commencement of the Act will be ruled simply by the procedure established here.</P>
    <P>I leave out one section of this Bill, Section 41, because it is of a special nature, and I wish to direct special attention to it later on.  There are, with regard to the normal patents, other provisions that I need not go into, such <Col N="2312" /> as patents of addition and licences of right.  These are matters of a very technical nature, and if they are to be the subject of discussion, they would come up more appropriately on the Committee Stage rather than now. They are normal parts of patent work, but they are highly technical matters. Unless some Deputy is inquisitive, and wishes to raise the matter, I do not desire to go into those things at this period.  The rights of patents are then established, and certain regulations are made with regard to patent agents, all these things being incidental to the establishment of a Patent Office in the country.  Section 41 is an important paragraph, and it is a new paragraph as far as patent law in this country is concerned.  It is based on the recognition of the fact that the granting of a patent is the granting of a monopoly.</P>
    <P>That granting of a monopoly may be used, not so much to make articles and give services in a country, as to prevent articles from being made or services being rendered in a country.  In order to prevent that happening, there is a provision made in Section 41 to the effect that any person interested may at any time apply to the comptroller alleging, in the case of any patent, that there has been an abuse.  Certain abuses are then detailed, one of the most important being that if it can be proved that the article has not been manufactured on a commercial scale in the country, within three years from the date of the granting of the patent, then the licence can be dealt with in various ways.  It can be marked with the phrase, &ldquo;licences of right,&rdquo; which means that various people can get licenses under the patent on terms which are the same for everybody who applies.  It really is an extension of the patentees' rights to everybody.  The comptroller may get the patent and give the exclusive right to anybody in the country.</P>
    <P>I refer to that because it is very important at this moment, taken in conjunction with the Electricity Bill. With the development of electricity in this country there is bound to be a tremendous development in the sale of electric appliances.  Most of these electrical <Col N="2313" /> fitments are patented.  Unless these patented articles are manufactured on a commercial scale in the Saorstát, within three years the patent rights can be confiscated and handed over to people who will manufacture in the country.  So there is protection in that direction for any electrical industry that would be established, or, putting it the other way, there is definitely a stimulus to the production of electrical goods in the country under that section.  The other important point is, of course, the time for which the patent rights subsist.  The normal term is 16 years, but there may be an extension on good grounds put before the comptroller, such as, for instance, that the patentee has not got an adequate return from his invention.  There may be one extension for five years, and there may be a second extension for five years.  The normal period is for 16 years, with a possible extension to 21 years, and in exceptional circumstances, to 26 years or 26 years in all. That is the normal course in regard to patents.</P>
    <P>Two difficulties that arise are the question of patents that are held in the country&mdash;patents that were filed and that were granted and were operative in this country prior to the 7th December, 1921&mdash;and patents for which application has been made since the 6th December, 1921, to the date of the commencement of the Act.  After the commencement of the Act the thing runs smoothly and the position as it was prior to the 7th December, 1921, holds.  They must accommodate themselves to certain regulations here and their patent right is preserved.  As between that and the intervening period, from the date of the Treaty to the date of the commencement of the Act, it means that priority will be given according to the dates they were received.  Certain applications have been received here and they were simply dated and held.  These will have to be now considered by the comptroller and dated back to the original date of the application.</P>
    <P>That same thing with regard to the time, the difficulty with regard to fitting in these things, holds in regard to copyrights and designs.  The matter <Col N="2314" /> with regard to the identification of designs existing prior, and the identification of trade marks existing prior to new applications, runs much on the same lines.  The machinery is not so involved because the matter is simpler and the property is not looked on as being so valuable.  The question of date would vary of course.  The copyright of design lasts only for five years, with a possible extension to a second and a third five year period. Ordinarily, the period will be five years; in circumstances that might appeal to the comptroller it will be extended to ten years, and in exceptional circumstances to fifteen.  Trade marks run for fourteen years with a possible doubling of the time in exceptional circumstances.  Just as Section 41 makes a special change in the law with regard to patents, there is a special change of a different type in regard to copyright and designs and it is this.  To date, it has been possible to register such a thing as a place name in Ireland as the trade mark for goods that have no touch or no contact with the country at all.  For instance, there may be a shamrock brand of certain goods.</P>
    <P>From this onwards no one will be allowed to register a word or a place-name indicative of origin in the Free State as the trade mark of goods not manufactured or made up in the Free State.  It will not be possible to put a design of a nature such as would recall the Free State or recall Ireland to the mind of the person buying unless the goods are manufactured or made up in this country.  There again the difficulty comes in of, say, trade marks registered prior to the 7th December, 1921&mdash;a shamrock brand of something that was registered prior to the 7th December, 1921, and by the terms of this Bill carried over, having full force and effect in this country. It was thought desirable that just as no application for the registration of a new design would be allowed on any goods save such as were produced in this country, we must keep the old designs in line, and while we carry over the old designs and trade marks, there is a six months period from the date <Col N="2315" /> of registration here in which they may have to change the trade mark.  That is to say, we do not suddenly cut them off, but there is a six months' period in which they must get something else as a trade mark.  In other words, they are given effect to, but there is a six months' period after which they must make some change so as to get outside the terms that would apply to an application made for the first time in the country.  That applies to both trade marks and designs, and that is the really important provision so far as trade marks and designs go.  The date I have mentioned for the periods of designs is somewhat different to that in patents, for which I have given the details.</P>
    <P>The question of copyright is pretty much the copyright law as it at present exists, and as it existed prior to the Treaty, with certain amendments that were brought in, mainly on the basis of a memorandum which was presented to my Department by the Irish Playwrights' Union.  There are small points which will come up again on the Committee Stage rather than here.  I may allude to one of them.  Previously, the fact was that a playwright whose copyright had been infringed, had only an action against the person guilty of the infringement.  In the case of a play where dramatic versions were given it was often hard to get at the actual persons infringing.  It turned out very often that there were such things as school children giving performances of something and simply that the people in charge, either not adverting to or neglecting the question of the playwright's copyright, infringed and there was no redress.  Frequently travelling companies came and were guilty of the same offence and they had disappeared before the unfortunate playwright discovered that there had been an infringement of his rights.  For the future the onus is thrown on the lessee of the hall in which the representation is given, as being the easier person to get at, and in order to throw on that person the burden of the responsibility of seeing that the copyright is not infringed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2316" /> That is one big point.  There are seven or eight minor points in which some distinction has been made in the Bill from what the old law used to be. The period of the copyright is different from any of these other things.  Its period is the life of the author and 50 years after.  There are certain other provisions which are put in here in a form for the acceptance of the Dáil. They may have to be modified in the Committee Stage if, in the meantime, we cannot gain the reciprocity on which some of the clauses are based.  It will be found that in paragraph 175, for instance, there is a provision that the publisher of every book must within a month of publication deliver a copy of the book to the trustees of the National Library of Ireland, and a copy to the trustees of the British Museum, and such trustees shall give a written receipt.</P>
    <P>Of course, unless we get reciprocity in this matter, that is to say, that the English law will be continued so that every publisher in Great Britain will deliver copies of all books published to the National Library, we shall, of course, not proceed with this arrangement. Similarly, with regard to the second paragraph, in which there is a rather obvious mistake, where the Library of the National University of Ireland is mentioned.  The National University office is merely the administrative office of the three colleges, and there is no library in that office.  Presumably, a room could be set apart for the reception of these books, but it would not do any good to anybody, and a proposal will be made to amend this, so that it will read: &ldquo;to the libraries of the University Colleges of Dublin, Cork and Galway.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This again depends upon full reciprocity.  We propose that publishers of books here shall give copies to the Bodleian Library, Oxford; the University Library, Cambridge; the Library of the Faculty of Advocates, at Edinburgh; and the National Library of Wales, provided we get our four copies in return for Trinity College and the three colleges of the <Col N="2317" /> National University.  If this reciprocal arrangement does not work out the section will have to be modified in the best way that we can think of.</P>
      <P>In connection with the question of copyright, I do not pretend to refer now to the modified details in which the copyright law has been amended, because it is mainly on items such as are detailed in Section 178 and Section 151, provisions which are, to a certain extent, a change of the law on minor points as it at present exists.  They will come up for discussion in Committee, though they are simply accepted as being the best point of view put forward by the Minister and other bodies&mdash;the Irish Playwrights' Union. If the opposition point of view shows that they are really not an improvement on the existing law but rather take away from the effects of the present law they can be changed.  They represent the best advice given to us by those interested up to the date of the publication of the Bill.  I think that these are the only portions of the Bill to which I would desire to call attention.</P>

      <P>The comparison is given here with regard to patents alone, an initial application fee of £3 here.  Renewal fees over the period might amount to £94 10s. 0d., a total of £97 10s. 0d.  In Great Britain the total would be £130.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That I cannot give comparative figures for at the moment, because the whole question of patent agents has been raised by certain agents since the Bill was published. They have raised the point that agents registered in Great Britain should continue to be registered here, and that the fee, a sort of carry-over fee, for registration in this country should not be as high as, say, in the case of a man setting up for the first time as a patent agent in this country.  This is a point I have a memorandum about in which it is put to me that these are matters really for the Committee Stage.  I have not got a comparison between the fees in this country and on the other side.</P>
