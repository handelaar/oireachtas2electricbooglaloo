      <P>We were promised yesterday by the Acting-Minister for Finance that the Minister himself would make a statement on the question to-day.  I understood that the statement would be made at the opening of the Dáil.  It would facilitate people who have to leave early on Friday, in order to get across the Border, if the statement were made early.</P>

What we want is a definite statement from the Minister on this question of luggage unaccompanied by the passenger, so that it may go out to the balance of <Col N="1306" /> the 100,000 tourists we are expecting, that they will not be obstructed or inconvenienced by these regulations.</P>

    <P>Amendment 1.&mdash;In page 4, before Section 5, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;In paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) of Section 22 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1915, the word &lsquo;interest&rsquo; shall be deemed to include &lsquo;payment.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Mícheál O hIfearnáin.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept the substance of this amendment, but as it is drafted it would have no effect, because the particular provision of the 1915 Finance Act to which it applies has been repealed and re-enacted in the Finance Act of 1918.  To make the amendment effective, it would need to read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In paragraph (b) of the proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 187 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, the word &lsquo;interest&rsquo; shall be deemed to include &lsquo;payment.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 11, before Section 27, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  In lieu of the present duties of excise in respect of cider and perry there shall as on and from the 1st day of July, 1925, be charged, levied, and paid on all cider and perry which is sold or kept for sale in Saorstát Eireann a duty of excise at the rate of two pence per gallon.</P>
      <P>(2)  Section 6 of the Finance (New Duties) Act, 1916, and any regulations made thereunder shall apply to the duties imposed by this section in like manner as they apply to the duty therein referred to as cider duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to say that I suppose we must all be grateful <Col N="1309" /> for small mercies.  &ldquo;The quality of mercy is not strained,&rdquo; but I am afraid it is somewhat strained in this respect. When the Minister was willing to make a departure I think he might have gone the whole hog.  I do not know what is the exact amount that this excise duty brings in, but perhaps the Minister would be able to inform us.  They say that constant dropping wears a stone; I think this is about the fifth time I have had the opportunity of mentioning this matter in the House, and though perhaps I may not have thoroughly penetrated the stone-wall resistance of the Minister for Finance, it is something to know that I have made a slight hole therein.  I would like to know what the Minister considers to be the necessity for this duty at all.  The duty is an excise duty; I think I am right in saying that this is the only country in the world where there is an excise duty upon cider at present.  The duty was put on originally as a war measure for the sake of raising revenue in Great Britain; and, of course, at that time it applied to Ireland.  It has since been abolished in Great Britain, and I would ask the Minister, in view of the fact that the amount of money raised is so small, and that having accepted the principle by reducing the duty somewhat, he should now go the whole hog and abolish it altogether.  If possible, perhaps the Minister would be kind enough to inform the House of the amount of revenue that is derived from this duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised to say that it is impossible to go the whole hog on cider.  However, that is an aside.  Really, none of these table waters or drinks are free from excise duty in this country, that is, not merely are the ordinary alcoholic liquors, like beer and spirits, charged but also mineral waters, and a product called herb beer.  I have agreed to reduce the excise duty on cider to the lowest existing duty, that is the duty on herb beer. I do not see how we could exempt this particular drink from duty, while all other similar drinks are charged.  The amount of the duty would not, I think, be more than a couple of hundred pounds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say what is the amount of the duty received from all these articles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very considerable. For instance in the case of mineral waters, it amounts to £30,000 or £40,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I quite recognise the difficulty of the Minister in going the whole hog on cider but still, in view of the fact that cider is in quite a different category from mineral waters like soda water, which are not made from agricultural products or do not give rise to employment beyond their actual manufacture, I do think a differentiation might be made.  However, I do not intend to press my case now, but perhaps this time next year we may be able to get rid of the two pence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to differentiate to this extent, in the interests of agriculture, that cider produced from apples should be free from Excise duty, that is, when it is made from apples and not from chemicals?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might say with regard to the only cider factory in the Free State, that at Dungarvan, that over 700 tons of apples were used last year, all grown in the valley of the Suir, which is well known to my friend, Deputy D'Alton.</P>

      <P>The reason for the amendment is simply to make explicit in the motion the provision of the Constitution, that candidates selected for this panel for the election should be of a certain character and possess certain qualifications set out in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to oppose the amendment.  I think it is a mistake to say that it is requisite for the purpose of fulfilling the provisions of Article 33 of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Article 30 states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Seanad Eireann shall be composed of citizens who shall be proposed on the grounds that they have done honour to the Nation by reason of useful public service or that, because of special qualifications or attainments, they represent important aspects of the Nation's life.</P>
      <P>Article 33 undoubtedly says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The method of proposal and selection for nomination shall be decided by Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann respectively, with special reference to the necessity for arranging for the representation of important interests and institutions in the country.</P>
      <P>But this does not propose to make any provision in respect of the rule or proposal to provide for this special class of representation that is supposed to be contained in Article 33.  The motion is a general motion of rules confining the powers of Deputies.  The amendment expresses the aspiration that Deputies should have regard to what is alleged to be the intention of the Constitution. If it is desired to include in these rules something to fulfil the latter part of Article 33, some change would have to be made in the form of these proposed rules, something additional to the rules, so as to provide for special representation of important interests and institutions.  If that is the intention, this amendment does not fulfil the intention, but it might be held to throw an obligation on someone, probably the returning officer, to rule out any individual who might be selected, on the grounds that the nominator had not had regard to important interests and institutions.  That would be an obligation placed upon the returning officer entirely beyond reason, to ask him to be a judge upon either the character or the qualifications of the person nominated, or alternatively the motives of the nominator, whether in making the nomination he had in fact had regard to special interests or institutions.  For these reasons alone, I think that the amendment is not justified and cannot be held to fulfil the requirements of Article 33 or of Article 30.  But I wanted to add a little to that, in view of certain ideas which seem to prevail regarding the constitution of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quoted Article 30, saying that the Seanad shall be composed of citizens who shall be proposed on the grounds that they have done honour to the <Col N="1349" /> nation by reason of useful public service, or that because of special qualifications or attainments, they represent important aspects of the nation's life. It is being held in some quarters that that imposes an obligation upon Deputies, in making these selections, to think only of persons having particular associations, having had antecedents of a peculiar kind, having had a peculiar class of education, or, possibly, having had a greater share than normal of the good things of this earth.  Nobody who has read this Constitution with care, and certainly no one who was present in the Provisional Parliament which discussed it, can have any doubt that it was intended in this Article that any good citizen who had done useful service for the nation is qualified for representation in the Seanad, provided he fulfils the other obligation regarding age.  There is no provision in the Constitution which imposes upon us an obligation to think in particular directions in making selections to the Seanad.  &ldquo;People who have done honour to the nation by reason of useful public service.&rdquo; All useful public service does honour to the nation, and I hope we shall some day arrive at the general view that only doing useful service will bring honour to the nation. We must not allow it to go out that the Seanad is to be a select preserve of a particular type of citizen, but that it is open to all citizens who have done honour to the nation by reason of useful public service.  I say that the amendment is not a fulfilment but rather a restriction of the rights of Deputies, and the obligation upon Deputies in respect to Article 30, and that it would impose a responsibility upon the Returning Officer to inquire into the qualifications of persons nominated, or to inquire into the motives of the proposer or seconder.</P>

      <P>I do not entirely agree with Deputy Johnson's views as to the functions of the Seanad in future or its position, but I do agree with him that this amendment is certainly useless and possibly dangerous.  It is very right that the provisions of Articles 30 and 33 of the Constitution should be in the minds of Deputies when they receive <Col N="1350" /> the voting paper.  They should then consider what institutions are represented in the Seanad and what are not, and how we can best supply the need.  It is very fitting that these thoughts should be in the minds of the electors when the election comes on. But now we are dealing with nominations, and the effect of this amendment would be to compel every Deputy in making a nomination to consider the whole position of the country and, if strictly interpreted, it would compel each Deputy to nominate as many people as he thought would represent every interest and every profession fairly.  I do not think that is possible.</P>
      <P>We have already, in the preamble, quoted this passage.  The resolution will be considered with reference to the preamble.  I can see no necessity for the addition of these words at the end of Rule 2.  As it is, we have to satisfy ourselves, and three other Deputies, that the person we nominate is a worthy and suitable person.  I think that is a sufficient test.  I do not think that we can, in addition, satisfy ourselves as to the degree to which he represents some interests.  We have also to satisfy ourselves that he represents important aspects of the nation's life.  I do not think that adding these words does anything to strengthen that.  I think the President has all he needs in the resolution, as originally drafted, that this is unnecessary, and merely repetition, and I ask him to reconsider the amendment in that light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is proposed, so that under no conceivable circumstances could it be alleged that we are not carrying out the spirit and letter of the Constitution.  I quite admit, as far as the written word is concerned in the Constitution, that it does depend, and will depend, upon the integrity, wisdom and judgment of members, both of the Dáil and Seanad, as to how the selection of persons who appear on the Seanad panel is going to be effected.  The fact is that Article 33 of the Constitution lays down in the last paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The method of proposal and selection for nomination shall be decided <Col N="1351" /> by Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann respectively, with special reference to the necessity for arranging for the representation of special interests and institutions in the country.</P>
    <P>In formulating these rules it will have been observed that every possible precaution has been taken to ensure that, as far as the wording is concerned, we have complied exactly with the terms of the Constitution.  I will admit &mdash;I think it would be admitted by anybody who makes an examination of this matter&mdash;that whatever precautions we may take to effect the purposes of the Constitution, one can only take these precautions.  These are water-tight rules, which no person can afterwards bring into court and endeavour to prove that, in any of the proceedings that we have taken with regard to the nomination for the election of Senators, any important particular had been neglected.  A careful examination of them reveals the fact that that particular reference to the necessity for arranging for the representation of important interests and institutions in the country had not been included.</P>
    <P>The Deputy argued quite reasonably that there are certain important interests and institutions which will be attended to by the members of the Dáil or Seanad.  But it can be equally argued that they have left out one particular one, perhaps.  The fishing industry, for instance, is an important institution.  It is more than possible that you will not have a person representing that particular interest in the nominations.  At any rate, we have brought to the notice of members of the Dáil and Seanad&mdash;I believe the Seanad is doing this also&mdash;that due regard must be had to the necessity for providing for these institutions.</P>
    <P>It will be within the recollection of Deputies that when the Seanad was first set up it was suggested that I should get in touch with a great number of institutions through the country.  I did get in touch with them, and they made recommendations which I did not find myself at liberty to accept.  Most of the institutions in question recommended their own members&mdash;took the narrow parochial point of view.  We took <Col N="1352" /> a different point of view.  So far as the thirty nominations made by me as President were concerned, I sought to have represented in the Seanad a variety of important interests, and I think I succeeded in doing that.  I am perfectly satisfied that the insertion of these words will not effect the representation of important interests and institutions in the country any more than if they were not there, but it cannot be alleged against us that at least we did not take the precaution of bringing to the notice of Deputies the fact that the terms of the Constitution were, that due regard should be had to the necessity for representation of important interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I only desire to say that I incline to the opinion expressed by the President in regard to this amendment.  The wording of it is of very great importance.  It is, to my mind, in no way a mandatory proposal. It merely brings to the notice of Deputies the Articles of the Constitution which determine that, in the selection of members for the panel, regard should be had to the desirability of giving representation to important interests and institutions.  As the President said, the amendment will possibly make no difference whatever in the actual selection made.  To my mind, it is merely a pious prayer asking Deputies to bear in mind when making selections that they should make them&mdash;not that they must make them&mdash;having regard to the various important interests and institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The distinction is a very great one. It is merely asking Deputies not to lose sight of the provisions of the Constitution. That being so, I do not see what harm it will do.  It is merely elucidating and, in a certain sense, explaining and re-detailing the provisions of the Constitution.  I do not think it is in any way, as Deputy Johnson suggested, a restrictive amendment.  I do not think it imposes any limitations whatsoever, and, as one Deputy, when I am making my selection, I certainly shall bear in mind the desirability of representation of various institutions and interests. That will not make me feel that I have got to, and that I must make certain <Col N="1353" /> selections in that direction.  As it stands, I think the amendment imposes no mandatory obligation upon Deputies. It merely brings to their notice the existing provisions of the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great difference.  When you select you have the names before you, and you can realise to what extent every interest is likely to be represented.  But when it comes to nominations, how am I, for instance, to know whom Deputy Wilson is going to nominate?  One cannot go round the whole Dáil and ask Deputies, &ldquo;Whom are you going to nominate?&rdquo; and then consider carefully whether any interest is unrepresented. Deputy Redmond talks of this as a pious prayer that should be in the Preamble and not in the rule.  It is in the Preamble; we are reminded of it in the Preamble.  We acknowledge that all the President's actions towards the Seanad have been designed to make it representative of opinions that would not otherwise have found expression there.  It has been for the good of the country that the Seanad has included in it men of very different views.  The President is entitled to receive credit for that, but I think he is carrying his desire for representation on the Seanad a little too far when he endeavours to impose this duty on us.  I know he means it all in a spirit of utmost fairness; but he is asking us to do an impossible thing.  We cannot do it, because we do not know the nominations that other Deputies are going to make. I honestly suggest that the President is <Col N="1354" /> asking too much.  Admittedly, the insertion of the words will not have any great effect.  I suggest that the omission of those words will not seriously injure the resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to support the views of Deputy Redmond in this matter. I think that not alone would his argument apply to selections, but it would very strongly apply to the nominations. Many Deputies may not have read the Preamble.  When they are going to make nominations it would be well for them to have the Preamble before them.  Deputy Cooper said that if he was going to nominate some person he would be in the position of not knowing the persons other Deputies would nominate.  Suppose, for instance, Deputy Cooper knew of a very important interest in the country that it would be well and advantageous for the country to have represented, would he not take very great care to ascertain whether anyone representing that interest had or had not been nominated? If he ascertained that such a person was not nominated, he probably would nominate him himself.  There is another consideration.  Deputy Redmond said that this provision will do no harm.  I agree with him to the extent that it might prevent possible error.  Let us assume there was a very important interest in the country&mdash; take it that the nominations are all made, and that the ballot papers come before the voters in the country&mdash;and suppose 25 or 50 per cent. of the voters are anxious to have an opportunity of voting for someone representing that important interest.  They will realise that it is not possible to vote for such a person because the Dáil had not nominated such a person.  Members of the Dáil might say that that interest was not brought to their notice, and if they knew of such an important interest they might have nominated a person connected with it.  If the Government were able to point to those words in the amendment it would be very important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The President made a significant remark.  He stated the Government, and he himself particularly, <Col N="1355" /> were very anxious to see that nothing was left undone to give effect to the carrying out of the spirit and the letter of the Constitution in the setting up of the Seanad.  Everybody agrees that every interest, excepting the interest that does not recognise the Constitution, has got fair and reasonable representation in the Seanad.  However, the fact that the largest party next to the Government Party is still outside the House proves that it is impossible to give effect to the directions contained in the words of this amendment. No matter how much it is to be regretted&mdash;and it is regretted by certain members of the House, if not by all&mdash; that the Republican Party represents an interest in the country and has a following, and no matter how we may try to carry out the suggestion contained in this amendment, if it is carried, the fact will remain that the people they speak on behalf of will not be represented in the Seanad.  It seems to be the desire of the President, and with him, I suppose, the Government Party, that the same procedure should be adopted in connection with the nominations that are going to be made as was adopted in the setting up of the Seanad.  If that is so, what would be the result?  If we are going to give representation in the same proportion to the interests that got representation at the setting up of the Seanad, we will reduce to a very great extent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Deputy means the nominations that I made, or the nominations that were made by the Dáil, he ought to specify the particular ones he refers to.  He should not specify both at the same time.  In this matter I am not putting forward any views as regards the persons to be nominated other than in accordance with what is contained in the motion and in the amendment&mdash;&ldquo;a person who has done honour to the nation by reason of useful public service....&rdquo;  Other than that, I am not doing anything at all as <Col N="1356" /> regards the persons that I want nominated or that the Party I belong to wants nominated.</P>

      <P>The President is both admitting and denying it.  There are 19 members going out of the Seanad. It appears to me, having listened to a good many Deputies give expression to their views, that there is a very grave danger that the Senators going out, who represent the national interest more than any other interest, are likely to come back in less numbers as a result of the election.  It is impossible for us to give effect to the wording of the amendment in so far as are concerned the largest interests in the country, outside of the people on behalf of whom the President and his Party speak. Those other people cannot get representation in the Seanad.  That is due <Col N="1357" /> possibly to their own fault, but the fact that they cannot get representation proves how impossible it is to give effect to the amendment.</P>

There might be a candidate nominated by the Government Party to represent education, and one might be nominated from these benches to represent education. The returning officer would then exercise his own judgment in rejecting candidates.  I do not think that would be fair.  I have the greatest confidence in the good sense and judgment of our present Ceann Comhairle, but if you pass this now it will be taken as a precedent for all future elections to the Seanad.  I look upon it therefore as an attempt to filch away the rights of members, and I oppose it.</P>

In regard to Deputy Cooper's statement about it appearing in the Preamble, what the Preamble does is that it recites the provisions of Article 33 of the Constitution.  It is by the resolution that we decide that we are going to adopt and to follow the provisions of the Constitution.  Therefore I think it is not at all so unnecessary to have this amendment in the resolution as well as the setting out of the provision of the Constitution in the Preamble. One is a Preamble saying what the Constitution is, and the other is a resolution saying we intend to follow the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the old story; it is quite a new story.  Of course many a debating society or football club have done that sort of thing.  Very often we get proposals from amateur resolution-farmers including arguments in the resolutions as <Col N="1359" /> well as aspirations.  This particular amendment is an amendment to a series of rules, and it is not enforceable. But it may well impose an obligation on the returning officer to decide whether regard has been had to those interests and institutions in making nominations. To take an extravagant illustration: a certain person is nominated to represent the fried fish shop interests of the country, an important interest.  Deputy Hewat might object, on the grounds that some other interests ought to have been represented, although it may have been alleged in the nomination form that this person was entitled to represent that interest.  But if you impose an obligation on the returning officer to decide whether due regard has been had in making the nomination&mdash;as I say it is a duty you may impose on the Ceann Comhairle&mdash;it is unfair to him and quite impossible of fulfilment. Again, I think Deputy Colohan's point is valuable to this extent, that we are setting forth a set of rules now which very likely will be the basis upon which future elections to the Seanad will be made, and if you put in a rule of this kind which is of no effect and no value whatever, unless the returning officer thinks it his duty to make a decision upon the question which would be raised, and I think he would not, and it ought not to be inserted, because it would be taken as restricting the liberties of Deputies in making nominations. There are two qualifications required, and this deals with one.  Article 30 sets out that &ldquo;citizens shall be proposed on the ground that they have done honour to the nation by reason of useful public service, or that because of special qualifications or attainments they represent important aspects of the nation's life.&rdquo;  But then Article 33, which this purports to fulfil, directs that &ldquo;a method of proposal and selection shall be decided with special reference to the necessity for arranging for the representation of important interests.&rdquo; This is not dealing with the method at all.  This is not providing for the method.  This is merely expressing the pious hope that Deputies will have due regard to the Constitution.  If that is all that is intended, I want to urge that the whole clause be altered <Col N="1360" /> and simplified, and I do propose to raise this matter in the form of amendment.  I just mention it now that we should leave all out after &ldquo;who&rdquo;&mdash;that is &ldquo;the person who&rdquo;&mdash;and insert &ldquo;who fulfils the requirements of Articles 30 and 33 of the Constitution.&rdquo; That is asking nominators, seconders, and assentors to subscribe to the statement that the person nominated does, in their opinion, fulfil the requirements of the Constitution.  If we insert that, or some such phrase, we are fulfilling everything that can be claimed.  We are not leaving any possible loophole.  We are doing something practicable, and we are not running the risk that some of the rights of Deputies under the Constitution can, either at this time, or at some future time, be restricted.  However, the form of the amendment is not before us, and I would strongly urge that this particular amendment should not be inserted, because of the danger which will be, perhaps, in the way of restricting the rights of Deputies in future elections, if not in this one.</P>

Listening to Deputy Johnson and some other Deputies, one is given to understand that in their opinion, at least, the returning officer is made a judge of whether the terms of the Constitution are, or are not, being carried out, and that the returning officer is made a judge of whether the terms of this amendment are being carried out.  I want to know is there any discretion given to the returning officer in this connection, &ldquo;in making such nominations regard should be had to.&rdquo; Are not the Deputies to judge whether regard has been had?  I always took, and I take it now, unless the contrary is proved, that it was for the Deputies to judge.  The Dáil will put up a particular panel, and the Seanad will put up a panel, and once that is done, in my opinion, the returning officer has no voice whatsoever of whether due regard has, or has not, been had.  It may be that I am wrong.  If I am wrong I would like to be contradicted.  If I am right, that the returning officer is not made the judge, then the objection to this amendment goes by the board.

      <P>When this paragraph is added to Rule No. 2 it becomes part of Rule No. 2, and under Rule 6 the returning officer may reject any nomination paper which does not comply with requirements of this proposed resolution.  Therefore he has power to reject nominations.  If he thinks that perhaps any interest is represented in an exceptional manner he may cut out one or two nominations.</P>

      <P>I think Rule No. 6 brings in rather four names that must appear on a nomination paper rather than the individual person nominated. I should hesitate to think that the returning officer&mdash;the Ceann Comhairle, or in his absence the Leas-Cheann Comhairle&mdash;would allow his judgment to operate in connection with the nomination of any candidate.  I fail certainly to see how the position is improved by the amendment proposed by Deputy Johnson, which gives effect to the two Articles of the Constitution, the terms of which I set out, and the body of which he brings in.  If those two Articles of the Constitution mentioned by Deputy Johnson are included in No. 2, certainly the paragraph as it stands is not weakened.  It is a matter of taste as to how it should be expressed. We go into particulars and bring it to the notice of members that they are to have in their minds the terms of the Constitution, but as I say the discretion to the returning officer is no stronger in the amendment proposed by Deputy Duggan than it is in the amendment proposed by Deputy Johnson.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the President has not yet grasped the point of the objection.  Article 30 lays it down that the Seanad should be composed of citizens who have by reason of useful public service done honour to the nation, or because of their special qualifications <Col N="1362" /> or they represent important aspects of the nation's life.  Two categories are set out under Article 30. Both these are set out in the original form of the nomination as requiring to be subscribed to by the assenters.  So far so good.  But then we have the new proposal which is quoted from Article 33, not Article 30.  The provision of Article 33 says: &ldquo;The method of proposal and selection for nomination shall be decided by the Dáil and Seanad respectively with special reference to the necessity for arranging for the representation of important interests.&rdquo; Under that you may have had to devise ways and means of making arrangements for the representation of special interests.  But it does not impose any obligation upon the nominator that he shall, in making the nomination, have regard to the representation of important interests.  He may only have regard to the fact that the nominee has done honour to the nation by reason of useful public service.  You are now restricting the right of the nominator.</P>

      <P>I think, on the contrary, you are insisting that he shall have regard for arranging for the representation of important interests and institutions.  But I feel that the nominator does not know what is in the mind of all the other Deputies.  Must each of us go and canvass to find out what the other Deputies are going to do in the matter of nomination, or is every Deputy supposed to take into account all the various interests and institutions and have regard to all these interests and institutions in making the nomination?  Must we nominate one for every interest?  We should have a very much longer list to be submitted by the members of the Dáil than even that contemplated in the general election. In the first instance, I say you are imposing in this an obligation upon Deputies, or rather a restriction upon Deputies; you are telling them you must have regard to these important interests.  The Constitution says that you must have regard to useful public service.  If it is alleged that this is intended to fulfil the requirements of <Col N="1363" /> Article 33, I say that it does not do that, because it does not make any provision for the method of proposal and selection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me we have got into a very curious argument on lines which have complicated the whole question.  My view, so far as I can form a view, is that the Constitution aimed at providing for a representative assembly in the Seanad.  As far as the restrictions are concerned, where they deal with interests, I think it would be very hard for anybody to define what particular interests were or should be represented in the Seanad. When members are duly elected to the Seanad, I suppose they cease to represent particular interests and rather represent the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The view I take is that the rules are for the guidance of the Deputies who are nominating candidates for the Seanad, and that they have no legal <Col N="1366" /> force whatever, except in so far as they afford guidance to Deputies.  Having before them the guidance afforded by the rules, if four Deputies sign a nomination paper, I do not see how you are going to say after that, that any particular interest should be represented in the Seanad.  Deputy Johnson referred to the seller of fried fish.  The seller of fried fish, supposing he was supported by four Deputies, would be duly qualified as a candidate for the Seanad.  Whether he would be a representative of any particular interest or not is a question that nobody could really decide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that could possibly be decided at all.  I venture to say that you cannot go further when the four signatories to that document consider that the candidate represents an important interest.  The important interest might be disputable. Probably it would be disputable in every case.  If you carried the matter further than that, you would be getting into an impasse that you could not be extricated from by any body, whether of lawyers or laymen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson is, I think, taking a wrong view of this amendment.  The amendment is by no means a restriction of or limitation on the rights of Deputies.  It is an extension. Rule 7 provides that, as soon as practicable after receiving a valid nomination paper, the returning officer shall send notice of such nomination to each Deputy.  One of the Articles of the Constitution provides that those who shall be members of the Seanad shall be persons who have done honour to the nation's life.  There might be an important interest in the country&mdash;I can imagine two or three such interests &mdash;that would not be represented in the Seanad.  Take, for instance, the brewing interest.  Those associated with that interest might not have done honour to the nation, in the general acceptation of the term, but they might <Col N="1367" /> have done useful service.  Take the people engaged in the transport service. There might not be a director of railway interests in the Seanad, and it is conceivable that the framers of the Constitution had in mind some such persons as those.  It is not likely, but it is possible, that agricultural interests might not be represented in the Seanad.  There are various orders in that particular interest.  There is the farmer with 300 or 400 acres; there is the farmer with 100 acres; the farmer with 50 acres, and the farmer with 25 <Col N="1368" /> acres.  It might be reasonably contended by a member of one particular section that that particular section was not represented in the Seanad.  The information conveyed by reason of Rule 7 would enable members of the Dáil to see that particular interests were not represented in the nomination list, and it would afford them an opportunity before the closing of the nomination lists to secure nomination for those interests.  It certainly is not a limitation; it is rather an extension.</P>

      <P>I move the amendment standing in my name.  There is a slight misprint in it as it appears on the Order Paper.  It reads: &ldquo;In page 2, Rule 5, to insert after the word &ldquo;seconder&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or other assenting Deputy.&rdquo;  That should be &ldquo;or either assenting Deputy.&rdquo;  This is simply a matter of convenience, to make it possible for the nomination papers to be handed in by either of the assentors as well as the proposer or seconder, and it is simply because the time is rather short for getting these nomination papers filled up that I have put down the amendment.  It might convenience Deputies living in the country who desire to nominate or second some local individual, some supporter of their own, possibly, if they were able to get a Dublin Deputy to assent and to hand in the nomination paper.  If it is proposed to allow the papers to be sent by post, the amendment is unnecessary, but if they have to be handed in in person the time is not very long for getting the consent of the individual and the four signatories.  The Dáil will not be sitting on the day that the <Col N="1369" /> nomination takes place, and therefore I think it would be to the convenience if you could get one of the parties to hand it in.</P>

      <P>On Rule 6, I desire to raise a question regarding the position of the returning officer, who, we have now decided, shall be the Ceann Comhairle, or in his absence, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, if any question arises as to the disability or incapacity of a candidate by the Constitution or by law.  Is the returning officer in a position to give a decision as to incapacity by the Constitution, and is he to be provided with a legal adviser, who shall not be the Attorney-General? I suggest that in such an instance the Attorney-General, who is the legal adviser to the State, is not the right person to act as legal adviser to the returning officer, and that it would be necessary, in any case, that he should be provided with a legal adviser, if this rule is passed in its present form, to help him to decide whether a person is qualified by law or not.  We are authorised by the Constitution to nominate persons for submission to the country, and the rules, of course, are to be decided by the Dáil and Seanad respectively. I am a little bit doubtful as to the wisdom of passing this rule in its present form, throwing upon the returning officer the responsibility for disqualifying and the power to disqualify a person who, he alleges, is not qualified or is disqualified by the Constitution. I think I can see difficulties arising which might have to be taken beyond the returning officer, and I wonder, if we pass these rules, if we are depriving the individual of the right of access to the courts in respect of an interpretation of the Constitution. This is a matter that did not occur to me when I first read the resolution, but it occurs to me now as one that might cause considerable difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obviously the duty of some person to decide if the nomination is invalid.  The electoral law contains certain provisions regarding the disqualification of a person from being elected or sitting as a member of the Seanad:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a person who is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment with hard labour for any period exceeding six months, or of penal servitude for any term imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction in Saorstát Eireann;</P>
      <P>(b)  an imbecile and any person of unsound mind;</P>
      <P>(c)  an undischarged bankrupt under an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction in Saorstát Eireann;</P>
      <P>(d)  a person who is by the law for the time being in force in Saorstát Eireann in relation to corrupt practices and other offences at elections incapacitated from being a member of the Seanad by reason of his having been found guilty, by a court of competent jurisdiction in Saorstát Eireann, of some such practice or offence.</P>
      <P>The Constitution lays down that a candidate must be thirty-five years of age or upwards.  Then there is a certain provision in regard to disqualification. There is also a disqualification in the case of</P>
      <P>a member of the defence force of Saorstát Eireann on full pay; a member of any police force in Saorstát Eireann on full pay, and a person either temporarily or permanently in the Civil Service of Saorstát Eireann, unless he is by the terms of his employment specially permitted to be a member of Seanad Eireann.</P>
      <P>I think that these are matters on which no question of law would arise; they are questions of fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>But surely questions of law might arise as well as questions of fact?  Take one instance, full age. Between the day of nomination and the day of election there are proposed to be three days.  If A.B. is nominated, and C.D. raises an objection on the ground of age, where is the proof of age to come from, and will you only allow <Col N="1371" /> three days for the proof to be adduced? The proof of age might be difficult of access, and in the absence of proof of age you are throwing upon the returning officer the choice of saying: &ldquo;I will let you go to the country; you can be disqualified afterwards if you are elected,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I disqualify you because you have not proved age.&rdquo;  Or take another case: Objection is raised to a nominee because he is alleged to be a member of the defence force on full pay.  You may say that that is easily ascertained. It may be, but you are only allowing three days within the period of nomination and final selection to elapse, you are throwing on the returning officer responsibility for saying yea or nay in respect of the validity, and whose decision is final for all parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me put a more likely case&mdash;the question of citizenship.  I assume that any citizen who is qualified under Article 3 of the Constitution&mdash;&ldquo;domiciled in the area of the jurisdiction at the time of the coming into operation of the Constitution, and who was born in Ireland, or either of whose parents were born in Ireland and had been ordinarily resident for a certain period&rdquo;&mdash;will be eligible for submission to the electors.  A person may not be now living within the present area of the jurisdiction, but may have been at the time of the coming into operation of the Constitution and is therefore a citizen.  Possibly a question might be put to the returning officer as to the eligibility of that person purporting to be a citizen, claiming to be a citizen, who I believe is entitled to be called a citizen and to have the rights and privileges of a citizen within the area of the jurisdiction.  It might conceivably be a matter of dispute, and to impose upon the returning officer an obligation to say yea or nay on that very important legal and constitutional question, which we are saying shall be final for all purposes, raises a very important doubt and question in one's mind.  It is the kind of question that is likely to have to be decided eventually by the Supreme Court, and I think we ought not to pass a rule here which would say that the returning officer's decision in <Col N="1372" /> such a matter shall be final for all purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I have been able to examine the matter as to the Seanad elections, it is laid down very particularly what are the regulations. The question of age is one.  If a person objects that the candidate is not 35 years of age, I think that proof ought to be afforded in that case by the objector that the person is not 35 years of age.  We cannot have a roving commission to find out whether every candidate has a baptismal certificate showing he is 35 years.  If there be an objection lodged in time, verified by the necessary instrument, then the returning officer has got a very easy decision to make.  It is the same with regard to the other disqualifications.  I think he is entitled to be afforded the necessary documentary evidence regarding any of these matters.  If he has that evidence, then it is a question of fact, and he will not have much difficulty in making up his mind.  A longer time than three days would probably open up channels for objections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking for longer time.  I realise that the returning officer must be granted the right to say whether or not a person is qualified according to the regulations, but we are specifically saying here that if he rejects as invalid any nomination paper which does not comply with the requirements of this resolution, or which purports to nominate a person who is not qualified to be elected as a Senator, or is placed under a disability or incapacity by the Constitution <Col N="1373" /> or by law, the decision of the returning officer shall be final for all purposes.  That would deprive a Deputy of the right to nominate a person whom he believes to be a citizen, and the citizen of the right to go to the electorate because a returning officer is advised, or comes to a decision without advice, that the nominee is outside the Constitution, is outside citizenship, Are we, by passing this, depriving ourselves of the right to go to the courts to declare whether a resident of the city of Belfast, who was undoubtedly a citizen at the coming into operation of the Constitution, is no longer a citizen? I ask the President to be very careful in this matter, because it might involve a delicate question.  Let us not, at any rate, commit ourselves to the statement that the decision of the returning officer in such a matter is final for all purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think every precaution is taken here to ensure that the election will be carried out properly.  From our experience we have no cause of complaint with regard to the way the business is being done, but there ought to be some finality about it.  The electoral law specifies that, unless there is a very grave case made against an election which has taken place, the election should stand.  In this particular instance, any interference by the court afterwards in connection with an imperfection might involve us in a very considerable amount of money.  We must have something final, and there must be some person in a position to say at a given moment: &ldquo;That is final and conclusive.&rdquo;  It is better to have the thing definite, having taken the usual precautions to see that the discretion exercised by the returning officer will be in accordance with the dictates of common sense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not raised this point merely as a chance thought. There is every likelihood that residents from Northern Ireland will be nominated for submission to the electorate as candidates for the Seanad, and the contention is made, on very good authority, that these persons are eligible <Col N="1374" /> for membership of the Seanad, because they were citizens of the Saorstát at the time of the coming into operation of the Constitution.  It may be, and I think will be, considered of so great importance that all the rights of Deputies under the Constitution will be sought for, and the highest authority, the highest court, may be called in to decide.  I make that statement because I do not want the Dáil to bind itself in a matter of this kind, and to throw the obligation upon the returning officer to decide the matter, without due regard to all the possible implications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we take up the Estimates, I would like to say a word or two in reference to the question raised by Deputy Myles yesterday. I have not been able to find any further information in regard to the particular case he mentioned; it is being looked into.  The only thing I can say is that if it was found it was a case of personal luggage, and if there is nothing disclosed in the case he mentioned, the duty paid will be refunded. We admit personal luggage, on a very reasonable scale, free with all passengers entering, and as far as I am concerned I have heard of no complaints. In fact I have heard quite a number of commendations as regards the way the work at Dun Laoghaire and other ports has been dealt with by the Customs Officials.  It is the officer on the spot who must judge what is reasonable. That depends on quite a number of circumstances, including the length of stay of the passenger and the locality where the passenger is coming from.  A person coming from Belfast for a day or two obviously would not be entitled to bring as much luggage as an American who would be doing a European tour.  There will be no stringency in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the admission of personal luggage sent in advance of the passenger, that will be admitted free of duty, just the same as if it were accompanied by the passenger.  It cannot, however, be brought in and delivered without the payment of duty, if it contains dutiable articles.  It must be detained by the Customs authorities until the owner or some properly authorised person declares and opens it.  The Customs officials have no authority to open <Col N="1377" /> baggage; it must be opened by the owner or his agent.  Luggage would therefore have to be detained pending the arrival of somebody who would open it for the Customs officials and who would satisfy them in regard to the contents.  Normally the passenger should come, but we do not hold to that rule in every case.  We are prepared in suitable conditions to let the luggage go through with the attendance of some person authorised by the owner.</P>
    <P>I can say in general that there has been no cause of complaint.  If any particular trouble arises at any point it will be cleared up as quickly as possible. Passengers coming through need not have any fear that they will not be facilitated.  The case that Deputy Myles mentioned is being looked into. If it is found that it was a genuine case of sending on personal luggage in advance, the duty paid will be refunded. We hope it will be possible to make arrangements whereby no misunderstandings will occur in future.  If luggage is sent in advance it will simply be detained, and will be immediately released if the owner or an agent applies for it.  We will see under what conditions we can release it without the personal application of the owner of the luggage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>At what point is it customary to pay duty in the case of luggage sent in advance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>At the point of entry, or at some place where there is a Custom House.  It must be a place where there is an officer who can deal with the matter.  The normal place would be the point of entry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not familiar with the practice in those matters, but it occurs to me that it is going to cause a lot of annoyance and trouble to people who are not in the habit of paying duty when going on their holidays. It would be very desirable if it were possible to avoid the necessity of putting down money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally there should be no putting down of money for personal luggage, but luggage cannot <Col N="1378" /> go through if it is not accompanied by the passenger.  For instance, luggage could not go through to Tullamore from London unaccompanied by the passenger.  It would be detained at Dun Laoghaire until the passenger arrives. When the passenger arrives and claims the luggage which came in advance, it would go through.  We are considering whether in certain cases it might not be possible for luggage to go through without the passenger appearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. COLE Mr. COLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing that luggage were to go from the North Wall on to Ballyshannon, would it be necessary to have it examined again at Ballyshannon, or would it be sealed up at the North Wall?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That raises another problem.  If it were thought worth while by the railway company, in view of whatever traffic there might be, to provide sealed wagons, of course the luggage could then go through in the sealed vans without any further trouble.  Without a sealed wagon it would not be possible to avoid a second examination.  If there were sufficient traffic to justify railway companies providing sealed wagons, we would be only too glad to avail of those waggons for the conveyance of articles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. COLE Mr. COLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Could not the baggage be sealed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not suffice to seal the baggage only.  You could not adequately seal the baggage.  The way the matter is dealt with in the case of other goods is that the articles are put in a wagon and the wagon is sealed.  Various undertakings are entered into and the wagon is not touched in any way; there is no further examination.  The goods are not regarded as having gone out of the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister, when dealing with this matter again, consider the question from the point of view of endeavouring to secure what would be a concession and a considerable advantage to passengers?  I refer to what applies on the Continent&mdash;that there should be a declaration made in <Col N="1379" /> regard to the luggage when it is sent in advance.  The Continental arrangements are such that luggage sent from Florence or Venice, say, to London, passes through all the barriers.  Would the Minister undertake to get into touch with people who would enable that arrangement to be applied to Ireland? It would save a good deal of the trouble that arises at the present time.  Under that arrangement luggage coming from the Continent could go through Dun Laoghaire, the North Wall, Cobh or wherever the passenger would be arriving.  It is necessary, I think, that the arrangement would be made between the Governments and railway companies concerned, with the consent of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there would be anything done in that case that would not rightly be done in any case where there is sufficient traffic to justify the provision of a sealed wagon.  In most of those Continental places there is not such a big traffic as would necessitate having a sealed van sent right through.  With regard to Customs formalities, since this matter was discussed last in the Dáil I have gone into the question of Customs delays. I find that at present there is no delay due to the Customs, leaving out individual incidental cases that might occur.  The delay that is really experienced is due to the transit companies. I do not say that if they were accepting abnormal numbers of dutiable articles the Customs staff might not be hard put to it; but with the companies restricting the number of dutiable parcels that they will carry over, the Customs staff is everywhere adequate. One case where congestion occurred was in connection with postal parcels. That has now been cleared away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will illustrate some of the cases where blame was put on the Customs authorities, but where no blame was due.  A deputation which met the Revenue Commissioners yesterday instanced the case of a parcel despatched from London on 21st May.  It reached Dublin on 29th May.  The railway company, acting as the consignee's agents for the purpose of clearing the goods <Col N="1380" /> through the Customs, notified the consignees on the 5th June of the arrival of the parcel, requesting an invoice in order to pay the duty.  The invoice and the duty were sent to the railway company on the 5th June, on the same day. The railway company paid the duty on 16th June, eleven days after.  Of course the Customs authorities could not do anything until the railway company paid the duty on the 16th June, although the goods had been despatched from London on 21st May. The real position is that even before these duties the carrying companies had not made sufficient accommodation. In certain cases tremendous confusion arose, and one company had to suspend the reception of dutiable parcels altogether for a time.  At the present moment our staffs are able to deal at once with all goods presented to them.  If the companies had more accommodation it might then be that a position would exist where the Customs officials would find difficulty in dealing with all the goods presented to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible for the Minister to consult with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to consider the practicability of widening the range of routes whereby parcels, for instance, are transmitted to this country instead of all having to go through one or two ports?  That may ease the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is quite correct.  I say that from a knowledge of the actual facts with regard to the Customs.  There is no blame attaching to Customs officers or the Revenue Commissioners.  But I think the Minister could remove a good deal of the irritation and inconvenience to commercial people, as well as the loss of valuable time, if he would see that the Customs office to which people have to go were at the North Wall, convenient to the place of the landing of these parcels, instead of Beresford Place.  At present commercial men have to go down to the North Wall and spend some time there to find out where the goods are.  Then they have to come back to Beresford Place, where there is an office that is not very up-to-date <Col N="1381" /> or convenient for the purpose.  I make a suggestion which, if he goes into it, I think he will find a valuable one, particularly to commercial men, and it will save a good deal of inconvenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, that question of provision of practically a second Customs Office is one that I do not think we could agree to.  If you remove the Custom House, particularly down to the quays, there would be inconvenience to people who at the present time do not travel down the quays.  There is not a bit of reason, after goods have been despatched and people have got the invoices, why they should not pay duty before they go down to the quays.  They would save time, and if they did I believe that an amount of the congestion that there is would be removed. The practice at present is that a carrying office sends a messenger with two or three hundred entries.  If the companies, instead of sending all their work about 11 o'clock in the day would make some arrangement to spread it over the day, work would be facilitated. As a matter of fact, the staff at Beresford Place is sufficient to do all the work, but it comes in rushes about 11 o'clock.  I think that that could be remedied by people arranging to send up their business at some less inconvenient hour, or at hours when there will not be so much congestion.  The allocation of your Custom House is really a matter where you will have to consult the general convenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister in that case transfer a small number of clerical assistants, or a collector of taxes, or whatever he is, to some place convenient to the sheds&mdash;and they are <Col N="1382" /> close to one another?  A small office with a small section of the clerical staff at a place convenient to the sheds would enable an earlier clearance to be effected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>In many ports people have to go seven times the distance that they have to go here.  It is only a matter, in some cases, of employing two messengers instead of one.  As far as people other than the shipping companies are concerned, the present office is certainly more convenient than if it were further down.  This is a matter I have been looking into, and, so far, I do not see that it is strictly necessary.</P>

    <P>Deputies will be aware that this Department of Finance especially is a new Department.  The work of the Department of Finance is the work that was done by the British Treasury.  There were practically no officials in the old days who were engaged on this type of work.  Broadly speaking, all the supervisory and controlling work in connection with expenditure was done on the other side.  We are only now getting somewhere near the establishment from the point of view of numbers and efficiency that it is necessary to have, in order that the work may be satisfactorily done.  We have still a certain shortage of staff, and we still are, of course, working with men who, for the most part, had only two or three years' experience of the particular type of duty that they now are called upon to perform.  Just like in any other branch of work, it often happens that you cannot have it satisfactorily done by a beginner.  There is also the fact, like in most types of work, that all men do not do equally well at it.  In recruiting our staff, we have taken on the best men we could get and who could be spared by other Departments.  In certain cases it has happened that men have picked up their new duties and taken on the particular attitude and outlook that they should have in the Department of Finance very quickly.  Other people who were very good in their old offices have been slower in taking up the new duties.</P>
    <P>The staff which appears under sub-head (a) is 95 established people.  They have not all been obtained yet.  There were, as a matter of fact, some 61 established officers engaged in this office last year.  The number at the present time is not so very much higher than that.  Certain officers who were serving in other Departments and who were on loan last year, to the number of 5, have been transferred.  There is an increase in the number of lower executive officers; they have actually absorbed four officers in that class.  There were seven last year and we absorbed four, making eleven, from the loaned officers.  We have two staff officers who are further down in the list; two staff clerks have been assimilated. There are still four executive officers on loan who may not be required permanently. The increased expenditure of £10,603 under sub-head (a) is due to some extent to the increase in bonus. That increase in bonus is very considerable. It is not all due to the rise; it is due, in part, to the substitution of permanent officers who are entitled to bonus, for temporary officers.  It is due also, in part, to the taking over of five officers whose substantive salaries were borne on other Votes last year. That is reflected further down by a decrease of some £3,300 in the allowances to officers on loan from other Departments. There is at least one salary and one allowance borne on this vote which perhaps might be more properly borne on the vote of the Office of Public Works.  There is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Finance and an allowance to the Private Secretary to the Parliamentary Secretary of the Department of Finance.  There is also full provision this year for the salary of the Government Stockbroker.  His salary was not paid for the whole of last year.  The officers absorbed from other Departments are two assistant principals, and a higher executive officer and a junior executive officer.  There is provision here for five junior administrative officers. There are, in fact, at present, only two junior administrative officers. It is anticipated that three more will be got as a result of the examination recently held and the result of which, I think, will be declared almost immediately. When the staff shown in the details of sub-head (a) at present have been all secured and when the extra work which compensation throws on the Department has disappeared it is anticipated that we will have practically the full and normal establishment required for the office.  It may be some <Col N="1385" /> little time before the staff is exactly as it appears in the details shown in Part 3.  The work of the Department of Finance has been very heavy, for special and temporary causes, since the setting up of the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>There have been numerous negotiations with the British Government in respect of transfer services and liabilities and assets in connection with them. Various statutory funds had to be apportioned: The Church Temporalities Fund, the Unemployment Fund&mdash;even though there was a debit there-and those various funds and various assets have occasioned a considerable amount of work.  It was work that required a great amount of attention, because large sums of money were involved.  There has been a great deal of work also in connection with compensation.  It was not merely routine work in dealing with applicants.  The British Government, who had certain liabilities in respect of compensation, had also to be dealt with, and the application of the principles on which responsibility for compensation was divided between the two Governments had to be considered. There is still further work to be done arising out of the change of government&mdash;the preparation of material, for instance, in connection with any arrangement under Article 5 of the Treaty.  That is very heavy work. There has also been, as I have already indicated, extremely heavy routine work.  Then there have been very great changes in administration and very great legislative changes, the financial reactions of which have involved a good deal of work in the Department of Finance.  It has often happened in the past that matters could not be dealt with just as rapidly as one would wish, but the strain was exceedingly heavy on the new and largely untrained staff, which was got together for the purpose of discharging these responsible duties.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Ministry of Finance to examine all proposals involving new expenditure of any sort. It is not, as some Deputies might think, the duty of the Ministry of Finance to fight any new expenditure. Its duty, rather, is to see that the whole matter has been carefully thought out by the Department proposing the expenditure, <Col N="1386" /> that cheaper or more economical ways of doing what is desired have not been overlooked&mdash;in a few words, to have all avenues for doing things on a cheaper scale fully explored. It is, of course, also the duty of the Department of Finance to keep demands for money within the most reasonable bounds possible, and to urge on other Departments, which must put forward demands for new expenditure, the necessity for dropping other types of expenditure which, perhaps, are less important.  There have been suggestions of a Geddes Committee and such tribunals in the Dáil as a means of reducing expenditure.  I am sure that most Deputies realise that any such committee, going into an office and knowing nothing about its working, could be misled by anybody who desired to mislead them, with the greatest possible ease.  Without the expenditure of an amount of time which no such committee could possibly afford, the committee could get nowhere.  Economies in public administration can be effected, in practice, only by having your Treasury Department sufficiently and efficiently staffed, and giving it a reasonable amount of backing in the discharge of its duties.  Deputies are aware, from amendments that have had to be made, that it often happens that Bills that are passed have not in every respect the effect which it was anticipated in the Dáil they would have.  The great amount of legislation that we have had since the setting up of the Saorstát has only in very few instances, involved expenditure greatly in excess of what was intended, or has caused a great loss of revenue that was not anticipated.  Accurate results can only be achieved if you are able, in advance, to give a sufficient examination to legislation from the point of view of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I feel that we are building up a very good Treasury Department, which will enable the Dáil in future to be sure that there is adequate supervision and that adequate weight is given to the financial aspect of all proposals that are put forward.  As I said, most of our men have only been a year or two years at their present work, but I am satisfied that the efficiency and grasp of the staff is steadily improving, and <Col N="1387" /> we hope to be able to do all the work of a Finance Department as well as that work can possibly be done.  The first tendency very often with people who see things wrong&mdash;whether in the sphere of agriculture or elsewhere&mdash;is to spend more money or to make a new appointment.  If you have not a Department whose outlook is the keeping down of expenditure or the keeping of expenditure within bounds, you will find that new enterprises will be undertaken or that new avenues of expenditure will be opened up which, perhaps, are not strictly necessary, or perhaps that things are done merely with the view of getting some quick result, whereas the speed may not compensate at all for the extra cost.  I think that is a matter which, perhaps, was not realised in the beginning on all sides. But I think it is now realised that there are very definite limits to the activities that we can undertake at any one time and that there must be enforced by some Department which has not an immediate interest in any spending service the very strictest scrutiny of the cost of services or proposals to be undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Vote, which is on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, may be taken as indicating the general financial policy of the Government.  The Minister has turned down any proposal for a Geddes Committee in connection with the cost of administration of the various Departments. He says&mdash;possibly, properly&mdash; that no Geddes Committee could go into these offices and do any effective work, without the expenditure of an undue amount of time and labour.  Incidentally, he says that such committee might easily have the fingers of the Minister or the officials of his Department put in its eye.  That may be quite so, and probably is so to a large extent; but the proposal for the appointment of the type of Commission known as the Geddes Commission must have arisen from the belief that it was necessary that expenditure should, if possible, be cut down.  This Ministry has been inflated, as compared with last year, from a staff of 61 members to a <Col N="1388" /> staff of 97, with the expenditure running up somewhere about £10,000.  It is quite true that it is impossible for any person not conversant with the working of the office to say whether the work to be done justifies the employment of a staff of 61 or of 97.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Even on the Minister's showing it would seem that there is justification for the claim for a reduction in numbers, because, as the Minister points out, and as we all must fully recognise, the last couple of years has been a period of exceptional strain on the Ministry of Finance, both in regard to the taking over of services and the control that it was very necessary to have exercised over other spending Departments in their work.  On that ground alone I think that it is not unreasonable to say that the present, and much more the future, work of the Ministry of Finance is, and will be, such as to permit of a very considerable reduction in staff.  After all, we are now in a more settled condition of affairs, the different Departments are more conversant with their work, and are accounting in a much more satisfactory <Col N="1389" /> manner than they had been doing.  That relieves the Ministry of Finance of a very considerable amount of work.  As regards the Ministry itself, it is perfectly obvious that, as the controversial matters between the Free State and Great Britain become settled, the work will be very much lightened, and that a staff of the present size would contain a very considerable number of redundant officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the general criticism might be applied more particularly to this Ministry, that the expenditure on departments of State to-day is out of proportion to the amount of revenue collected or the amount of taxation that this country can bear.  I say that emphatically, after looking through the Estimates.  I say that the House must concentrate on the demand for reductions, that the State services for a population of about three millions cost an excessive amount, and an amount that is more than the country can bear. Ministers may say that the work cannot be done for less; that may be a matter for controversy, but my view emphatically is that the whole scale of administration will have to be examined in the light of the ability of the people to bear the strain that is put on them.  There is no use in shirking the fact that Ireland to-day is vastly poorer than it has been, that an uphill fight will have to be made to resuscitate the industries and the general prosperity of the country, and I think that that must be done by means of greater individual effort, more particularly in a lessening of the spending of the people as a whole.  But the Government should set a headline and give an example, and though these Estimates may be justified by the amount of work that is done in the various offices, I make the broad criticism that the amount of money spent is excessive, having regard to the country and especially having regard to the ability of the people to pay taxation. That is very broad criticism, and it is criticism in advocacy of the setting up of a Geddes Committee, a proposal which the Minister turns down as being ineffective.  If such a Committee is not set up I say that there is greater responsibility <Col N="1390" /> on the Minister for Finance and on the Government as a whole to look carefully into the expenditure of this, and of other Departments as well, with a view to ascertaining whether staffs are not very considerably redundant for the effective working of the administrative machinery of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On the main question I want to give the Minister an opportunity to explain the present position regarding the Civil Service Compensation Committee.  A number of statements have been made at different times with respect to the Committee, owing first to the resignation of Mr. Justice Wylie, and secondly, to a case in the courts culminating in an expression of hope, but not a definite promise, a few weeks ago, that the Committee would be re-established shortly. I invite the Minister to tell the House what the present position is and by that means relieve the minds of certain people from anxiety and doubt, people whose future is dependent on the decisions of this Committee.  Whether we like Article X. or not, whether it is wise or not, it is part of the price promised to be paid for the Treaty, and presumably has to be agreed to.  There is no need to enlarge upon that.  The Minister is fully aware of the grievances and the complaints that are being made, and he is in a position to state what the present view of his Department is, and the present position of the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am tempted to follow Deputy Hewat, but I do not want to be taken either as denying or confirming his general statement.  There are a few small departments which we have thought desirable to criticise in the matter of expenditure, but I think we have not had Deputy Hewat's support. But, in the main departments, my difficulty is in seeing where expenditure can be cut down to any great extent, apart from the general supervision in respect to economy.  Following the Minister's opening statement, I could not help reflecting upon the demands that are made from many quarters&mdash; very serious and responsible quarters&mdash; for a change in the method of check; <Col N="1391" /> claims that the system which we have adopted for checking expenditure by means of a Department of Finance should be superseded by Departmental responsibility for expenditure.  I gather from the Minister's statement that he at any rate, is quite convinced that the method of checking expenditure through a central department is much more effective and probably more economical. I take it his view is that it certainly ensures better co-ordination. But, undoubtedly, the other view, that all departments, or certain departments, should be allocated certain sums of money for them to expend under the direction of the Minister, and be responsible for seeing that the money is expended properly, without having to refer so frequently to the Minister for Finance for sanction, is one that attracts, as I say, people of responsibility. My observation and thinking on this matter lead me rather to incline to the present system as being much more effective in ensuring the right expenditure of public monies.  I am not sure whether to deduce from Deputy Hewat's frequent statements an inclination towards departmentalising responsibility for expenditure, but I feel that the general statement of Deputy Hewat, and such general statements, regarding the necessity for reduced expenditure &mdash;that the country cannot afford the present expenditure and so on&mdash;while they are likely to satisfy taxpayers for the moment, are not doing much more than exciting hopes and, perhaps, exciting a spirit of criticism of the Government responsible for the time being.</P>
    <P>Usually this plea for economy finds expression in a desire to cut down rates of pay.  I think that we ought to see that any exercise of economy should be in the direction of having the money spent wisely, rather than cutting down rates and getting less value, and certainly not in the direction of reducing expenditure on essential and useful services. Unless I am in a position to point to particular items or groups of items, I am slow to urge reduction of expenditure, and I think not much advantage can come to the country or <Col N="1392" /> administration by that particular kind of demand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be egotism on my part, but I fancy that portion of the Minister of Finance's opening speech was intended for me. The French have a saying: &ldquo;That animal is wicked; it you attack it, it will defend itself.&rdquo;  The Department of Finance is a wicked animal to-day. The Minister devoted a great deal of detail to the exposition of what is the correct and legitimate attitude of the Department of Finance to expenditure. It is not to check expenditure, he explained, in the bad sense of preventing the flow from the Exchequer into channels of productivity.  It is merely to see, where there are new departures intended, that these have been carefully and duly considered, and that they are wise enterprises, not risky adventures. I should be glad if I could take that view of the relation of the Department of Finance to the spending Departments. I quite agree it is the ideal relation, so long as we continue to practise the British procedure.  But I do not like this British procedure, not because it is British.  So long as anything is excellent and works well I do not care what is the latitude and longitude of its place of origin.  But this is an arrangement by which, while we have the pretence of democratic Government, one Department out-tops the rest, whereby it is possible&mdash;I do not suggest it always happens&mdash;that permanent officials can dominate the policy of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I am quite with the Minister and with Deputy Hewat in their plea for economy, but, as Deputy Johnson has just pointed out, there is economy and economy.  Cheeseparing is not economy.  Getting the greatest value for your expenditure of £1 that £1 can give, is economy.  I said some time ago that under the guise of checking waste, of restraining ardour on the part of spending Departments, the Ministry of Finance is able to control policy to the extent of preventing things being done in other Ministries which ought to be done.  I am not so sure that the Minister is not himself conscious of that. Otherwise, why the plea persevered in, <Col N="1393" /> repeated three times a day, not to shoot?  Do not shoot at the Ministry of Finance; it is doing its best.&rdquo;  That was the plea.  &ldquo;We have had great difficulty in creating this Department; it is a new thing that had to be set up; we had to draw upon other public Departments for the most suitable men to staff this new Department; some of them have got into their stride very quickly, others have proved inefficient; but we hope in time to have the sort of staff that such an important central Ministry demands.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister would not have dwelt upon that so persistently if he was not conscious of there being something that is vulnerable.  I will use no stronger word than that.  He knows perfectly well that as regards the settlement of this long-drawn-out and most unpleasant contention with regard to Secondary Teachers' Salaries, it is the Ministry of Education that is blamed by the country at large, whereas we in this Assembly know it is the Ministry of Finance that is the culprit.  Similarly, we know perfectly well that in embarking on this policy of a subsidy for beet sugar the experiment, if it be an experiment at all&mdash;and it is only in one direction an experiment&mdash;would be carried out properly were it not for the Ministry of Finance, which is afraid of seeing a decrease for a year or two in the annual amount of revenue extracted.</P>
    <P>If one were so minded, and if there were time available, it would be quite easy to show that democratic government and the inheritance of a Ministry of Finance that controls, and in an arbitrary way exercises the control, are quite incompatible.  I am altogether with Deputy Johnson in this, that we really must try to conceive of some other method of dealing with public finance than that which we have taken over.  I do not accuse or attack anyone for the present incompleteness and consequential inefficiency, so far as there is an inefficiency.  It is a <i>damnosa hereditas,</i> and we are making the best of things in a transition period.  I am speaking now, partly because I think we have got sufficiently advanced to be able to put before the public that we have another scheme, another conception, <Col N="1394" /> of administration besides that which belongs to another people with another history.</P>
    <P>It is rather unfortunate that we should have to take over under the Treaty so many institutions, some of which we do not require, some of which are not suited to our peculiar situation. There is a danger here of routine taking control; there is a danger of our accepting the arrangements of administration merely because they are.  To pass to Deputy Hewat's criticism, there is one type of critic: he is the only type of critic who can make himself unhelpful by his criticism, and he is the man who says that something must be done. He does not tell us what the something is that ought to be done.  We hear from the representatives&mdash;as they are styled&mdash;of business, the representatives of the business community, time after time, sometimes a wail and sometimes an indignant protest about expenditure. Have we ever had one constructive suggestion?</P>

      <P>What did the Geddes Commission do in England?  It increased expenditure.  As between a Geddes Commission and continuing the practice of the Ministry of Finance, which is to exercise continuous supervision over the spending Departments, I vote for the Ministry of Finance arrangement. Of two evils I would choose the lesser.  I do not believe a body of outsiders without experience such as the Civil Service possesses, could be able to examine into a Department and decide on the minimum expenditure allowable for it.  It sounds <Col N="1395" /> well.  It is one of those plausible things which an English newspaper can write leading articles about from time to time, and the man in the street or the man in the train who reads the paper says that it is an excellent idea.  In practice it is not an excellent idea.  I think I have already indicated the directions in which I have fears with regard to control by the Ministry of Finance.  Anyone who has ever read the novel of Mrs. Riddell, called &ldquo;The Senior Partner,&rdquo; will remember the contrast between the old Scottish merchant who believed in old steady plodding methods of business and who got left, and badly left, by competitors who realised that courage as well as wisdom is necessary in business.  Rather I should say courage is a manifestation of wisdom.  I do hold that all checks upon the useful spending of money are in restraint of prosperity.

      <P>When this Vote was under consideration a few months ago much the same arguments were used as have been used this afternoon.  I am not sure that the suggestion of a Geddes Committee was not even pressed more strongly 12 months ago than it is to-day. The Minister's answer on that occasion will be remembered by many Deputies.  He told us that under that he supervised every Department of State.  In fact, I think he went so far as to say that no temporary additions could be made to the staffs of these various Departments without his approval and sanction.  That was his answer.  In other words he says, &ldquo;I am doing the work thoroughly, and there is no need for any interference.&rdquo; I am satisfied there is no Minister who has tried to do more and, may I say, has been more successful than the Minister for Finance, but there are limitations to what one man can do, even though he be the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Looking back on the amount of time absorbed by Parliamentary work and preparation for Parliamentary work during the past 12 months, I am quite satisfied any man who has had that serious responsibility in connection with this House and the discussions in it has had very little time to devote to what may be called Departmental work.  That, to my mind, is one of the most unfortunate positions.  Why that is necessary I do not know.  A great deal of the time of the officials of State is taken up in connection with work of this House rather than that of the Departments. I am satisfied that if less of the Minister's time had been taken up in connection with the work of this House we would have, from our point of view, a more satisfactory estimate from his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry the Deputy who has just spoken has left the House.  He has taunted as business men, as he does almost always when he addresses the House, that we never put up any constructive proposal.  I think we, business men, turn our minds in the direction that criticism, without any constructive proposals, cuts very little <Col N="1397" /> ice.  The remedy of the difficulty of the amount of time taken up by Parliamentary work might be seriously diminished if we had fewer speeches of two hours and ten minutes.  I think that is a constructive proposal, and I am sorry the Deputy is not here to listen to it.</P>
    <P>In the details of this Estimate the Minister has explained that there is an increase in the total amount.  That is rather unusual because the amount of money that will be administered in the current year is less than the amount of money that was dealt with last year. On the total estimate for the current year there is a reduction altogether of something between six and seven millions.  Therefore the amount of money to be administered is considerably less, and in view of that fact one would imagine that while the <i>status quo</i> would have remained as regards the number of officials, on the other hand we find there is an increase in the number of officials.  Doubtless there may be an explanation for that.  The Minister has pointed out that there has been an increase in what you might call the more responsible officials.  That is not exactly borne out by the details of the Estimate given to us.  First of all, let me say the reduction in the amount of money is not very large.  The Estimate of this year is £1,000 less for the temporary clerical staff than it was this time 12 months.  On the other hand, on the permanent staff there has been no increase at all in the numbers of what may be called higher officials.  I see there is, amongst the assistant principals, an increase of from 6 to 9, but the largest increase that one notices is amongst the lower executive officers. They have increased from 7 to 14, while the lower clerical officers have increased from 14 to 29.  The shorthand typists have increased from 6 to 11.  I think I am correct in saying that the increase in the number of officials has been more or less amongst the lower officials.  It would lead one to think that possibly a little more inquiry into the necessity for this large increase amongst what might be called the lower staff might have resulted in greater efficiency and greater economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister has turned down on <Col N="1398" /> this occasion a proposal for a Geddes Committee, largely on the grounds that the members of that Committee would not have the knowledge essential to enable them to judge of the work, turned out by a particular staff in a particular Department.  I am not very conversant with the arrangements that led up to the appointment of the Geddes Committee on the other side, but I am rather inclined to think, from what one has learned, that the Geddes Committee had before it, as the basis for its work, the report of a Departmental Committee, and that this Committee used its judgment very largely in inquiring into the findings of that Committee. Possibly that line might be a useful one for the Minister to consider. Doubtless to bring in outsiders to express an opinion on the staffing and the work turned out by the staff of the Departments is not possible in all cases, except the Commission is one composed of persons competent to judge of the particular work under consideration. It is in many cases a difficult commission to make up.  If, leading up to such a commission, we had a report of a Departmental Committee, from men who would really have spent their lives in this particular work, with a thorough knowledge of all that came before them, then we might be in a position to consider whether the work of that Committee might be referred to such a commission as the Geddes Commission. That might achieve the same end on more business-like lines.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling throughout the country, as very definitely expressed by Deputy Hewat, that our Government and the Departments are largely overstaffed, and that we are called upon to spend a larger sum on the administration of the affairs of the State than is essential or necessary.  Notwithstanding what the Minister may say as to the incompetence of a Geddes Committee to deal with such a subject, I am afraid that that view is so deeply embedded in the minds of the taxpayers of the country that until some such step is taken &mdash;such as inquiring into the working of these Departments and reporting&mdash; this question will constantly crop up. The feeling is deeply embedded in the minds of the taxpayers that they are <Col N="1399" /> paying far more than they should be called on to pay.</P>

      <P>I am gratified to find, at long last, that I am making converts to the idea of a committee to overhaul Government expenditure and machinery.  Personally, I would like to agree with Deputy Good, though I am not particular as to the form of the committee.  I would prefer an outside inquiry, but I will take a departmental committee as a first step.  I would even take a committee of the Executive Council to review and overhaul existing expenditure.  That is the method adopted, I think, this year in England.  It is common knowledge that Ministries vary very very much in efficiency and staffing.  It is inevitable, I think, where we have a new Ministry doing new work that there must be certain variations. I should like to see Ministries which are more extravagant or, shall I say, less economical, which, perhaps, would be less offensive&mdash;doing their work with, perhaps, more friction and delay in acknowledging letters to the public&mdash; levelled up with the good Ministries&mdash; and there are good Ministries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Good, as well as other Deputies, has reviewed the expenditure. I think there is one point I would like to emphasise, and that is the extraordinary increase in the number of typists on this Vote.  Last year 7 typists were enough, but this year 17 are required.  Last year a little over £500 paid their salaries, but this year £1,200 is needed.  There is a certain decrease in the temporary clerical staff. Whether that consists entirely of typists or not, I cannot say.  This is one Ministry where we here must scrutinise these things carefully, because, though the Ministry of Finance would check such an increase in any other Department, there is no check over the Ministry itself.  There is an old saying that if you want an efficient gamekeeper you should get a converted poacher.  What happens when the gamekeeper himself turns poacher?  While the Ministry for Finance checks increases in other Ministries it is possible to increase its own staff, both in numbers and in salary. We must inevitably give some care and <Col N="1400" /> attention to this Vote, not because the Department is inefficient&mdash;it is not&mdash;because I think it answers one of the tests I suggested, by dealing promptly and efficiently with correspondence.  The Ministry of Finance, being by law over all other Departments, and not subject to the check of other Departments, a careful and detailed scrutiny of its accounts is one of our most difficult and most responsible duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>My feeling about the matter, as to the method of controlling expenditure, is very much like that of Deputy Johnson.  I do not say that it necessarily follows the method we have taken over from the British is the best method, but, certainly, I have heard nothing that would convince me that any of the alternatives suggested are nearly as good.  I certainly believe that you can do nothing on the lines of rationing Departments.  In other days an attempt at rationing was made.  Endowments of statutory sums were made for each Department.  We found they exceeded these sums and entered into commitments for new work that was required.  They then found they were already committed to the full amount of their income, and new sums had to be provided.  I believe you would find it impossible to keep each Department to the sums allotted to it, as a public clamour for some new work would make it necessary to exceed the ration. You would have the position arising whereby Departmental control, based on limits of income, would be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had experience in a small way of working on a system where there was no Treasury control.  Under the old Dáil there was no Treasury, as it is understood now.  The Ministers pretty well decided what they wanted.  They applied to the Minister for Finance and the money was supplied automatically. My little experience, using very small sums of money, for a year or two, convinced me that it was not a good system.  Ministers had very different ideas of the rigidity with which they ought scrutinise expenditure.  They had different ideas of the salaries that ought to be paid.  Certainly, in my opinion, there is nothing in which example is so demoralising as in the <Col N="1401" /> matter of the expenditure of money. If one Minister is allowed to be lavish in any particular direction, you find that other Ministers are driven against their own wishes to a similar state of lavishness.  There is again the question of conditions of the staff.  You must have a certain amount of uniformity, and, I say, in spite of the remarks of Deputy Magennis, that no system matters that would not satisfactorily replace the present system.</P>
    <P>You might have establishments like the army where you could have different systems of accounting, if you had an army big enough to make that worth the cost.  But with an army so small as ours, and with an army which will be smaller, it is doubtful whether accounting costs would not be too great to justify any change.  So far as the other Departments are concerned, the work of these Departments is so different that you cannot compare the work of any Department with the work of another Department.  You cannot go to the Department for Justice and say: &ldquo;Your average official costs so much, the Local Government average official costs so much.&rdquo;  That would be wrong. You have different volumes of work, and you may require different sorts of staffs.  It seems to be that there is no method in which you can control public expenditure so well as the method of the Treasury Department that would sanction expenditure and be in touch with the spending activities of all Departments, and will try to regulate them in the best way it can with a view to keeping the expenditure as low as possible, without stultifying departments or preventing necessary work being done.  It may be that possibly the opposition to certain expenditure offered by the Department of Finance prevents many things being done.  You must remember that if we tried to do all these things at once it would put burdens on the country it would be impossible to bear.  Everything that everyone desires to be done at once cannot be done.  I do say this, that a matter that is put up with full consideration by a department, a matter which can be justified, and which will get support from other people concerned with the Government, will never be resisted, and will be delayed no <Col N="1402" /> more by the Department of Finance than is necessary to ensure a proper scrutiny.  In these cases it is simply a case of cutting the cloth.  There is expenditure which the Department of Finance must turn down.  But there are appeals from that.  If any Department is not satisfied with the line taken by the Department of Finance there is an appeal to the Executive Council, and the whole matter can be settled there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson made a point to which I will refer with regard to the Civil Service Compensation Committee. I have already spoken about that once or twice.  Deputy Johnson asked a question on that.  The work was at first held up by the resignation of Mr. Justice Wylie.  Then there was some delay about finding a successor to Mr. Justice Wylie.  Finally, an action was brought into the courts, where it was sought to declare that there was a justiciable right under the terms of the Treaty.  The court before which it was brought, in the first instance, decided in favour of the civil servants.  An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court decided that these rights were not justiciable rights.  I took steps to have the Committee reconstituted.  I actually interviewed a judge who agreed to act.  I feel it necessary that we should have a judge.  This is a matter that really might be the subject of negotiations between this Government and the British Government in case there was default to be found.  It is a question of implementing and carrying out the Treaty.  We feel very strongly that the whole matter should be submitted to a person having the status of a judge, a man of high standing and competence.</P>
    <P>For various reasons which I need not go into here, I think it would not be possible at all to have a resigned or retired judge to do the work.  It is very difficult for an existing judge to do it.  It means a sacrifice of leisure time to him.  None of the judges can leave his court.  They are there fully occupied, and it must mean that during the vacation, or in the evenings, or Saturdays and other times like that, when the judge would have leisure, that <Col N="1403" /> he would serve on this Committee and go through a large number of cases.  I had found a judge who very kindly agreed to give a considerable amount of time to this work.  Just as I had succeeded in getting this judge's consent to act, the Attorney-General advised me that an appeal to the Privy Council had been lodged by these two civil servants, so that the matter is still <i>sub judice.</i>  I think that the judge who is willing to do this public service does not feel that he should proceed in the meantime with what might turn out to be useless labour.  I do not want really to give the final word, but I am afraid that as the position is now, it will not be practicable to have the Committee reconstituted, until the Privy Council has either refused leave to appeal or until it has decided to appeal.  If it gives leave to appeal I appreciate, with Deputy Johnson, that it is unsatisfactory that these cases, which are pending, should not be dealt with.  But it is not a matter that is really within my control.  I certainly would not think it a satisfactory arrangement at all to act without a committee and simply by myself, with the help of my officials, to determine the pensions in these particular cases.  I do think that there is not a satisfactory way provided, that the rights are justiciable rights and are rights that would not be dealt with diplomatically in cases of disputes.  The only way to deal satisfactorily with them would be by a tribunal presided over by such a judge as Mr. Justice Wylie&mdash;that a judge should be chairman. I do not think that, generally speaking, it can be said there is any overstaffing of Government departments. There may be cases of individual departments or a section of an individual department being overstaffed. Continual and frequent inspections are carried out by the Department of Finance. Reductions have been demanded where necessary, and they have taken place.  Reports and returns on the actual amount of work carried out in each department are supplied.</P>
    <P>I think as a general statement it may be rightly said that there is no over-staffing of departments, and that the staffs of the departments cannot be appreciably <Col N="1404" /> reduced, except by the reduction of work.  As a matter of fact, the things that we have been doing here in the Dáil, and rightly doing, have tended to increase the number of the staff.  All these very valuable Acts that have been passed have thrown additional work on the departments, and this has led to an increase in the staff.  For instance, such Acts as the Housing Facilities Act, the Dairy Produce Act, and all legislation of that kind have generally led to an increase in the staff.  Certain changes permit of certain activities being dropped.  It does not mean that we have a continuous increase of staff all the time.  Generally speaking, all the overdue legislation has a tendency to increase the staffs.  As a matter of fact, with the departments getting into their stride, and complying more satisfactorily with the requirements in regard to financial procedure, a great deal of additional work has been thrown on the Department of Finance.  For instance, the number of files opened in 1922 by the Department of Finance amounted to 4,483; the number of files opened in the year 1923 was 7,757, and the number of files opened in 1924 was 9,798.</P>
    <P>The Departments are getting into their stride.  New things are being done.  New acts are being put into operation, and that has naturally resulted in a very great volume of departmental work coming along to the Department of Finance.  Certain other work, like that arising out of the negotiations with the British Government have shown a tendency to fall off, but the other work of the Department has continued to increase.  It would seem that Deputies who are in favour of a Geddes Committee are being practically converted by me and my opposition, because there is a sort of idea that a Geddes Committee would be for the purpose of throwing dust in the eyes of the public.  At any rate, it has been suggested that a Geddes Committee could not do its work unless the entire field had been surveyed and the spade work done.  That is what I have said all the time about a Geddes Committee, that if there is a certain expenditure that the Department of Finance wants to cut down and <Col N="1405" /> the other Departments do not agree, the Ministry can bring in a Geddes Committee, and with the imprimatur of this Committee this demand can be effected.</P>

      <P>There is no use in people talking about expenditure in the way certain people do.  In countries that are proportionately no richer the proportion of expenditure is a good deal higher.

      <P>Proposals came along to my Department from the Minister for Agriculture for an increase in the money for cow testing.  It would be easy to say we could not bear any new expenditure, but obviously that would be expenditure that would give a return. It is difficult to see how there can be any great decrease in expenditure. With the legislation we have in existence and the various services that exist, the thing we can try to do is to get the best returns for them.  There are services many people declare to be useless, but which are undoubtedly misunderstood, such as the National Health Insurance, to which there is a great popular opposition that is not justified. You cannot cut off services like that that may be a bit unpopular, unless you see that the complaints against it are justified.  We cannot take the line, as I said, in connection with the Budget on the Report Stage, and say: &ldquo;We will reduce expenditure regardless of results.&rdquo; It would be possible to say that <Col N="1406" /> parents must pay for the education of their children and that &ldquo;We were about the Estimates for Education, and we will wipe out the Education Estimates, and that people should provide for sickness and so we will wipe out the Insurance Estimate.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest to the Minister, without criticising in detail the system at present in operation, that there is overlapping in all directions. For instance, there are certain inspectors doing work that might be done by the Civic Guard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Civic Guard are there in any case, and they do work that officials are specially appointed for. In other cases, where special inspectors are necessary, you might get rid of the duplication that exists on lines like that. That would tend towards a more effective working of the machine, but as to clearing out, root and branch, the services that exist, I do not see how that could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not, and no one would suggest, without examining the whole position, that economies could be effected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt certain economies could be effected, and they have been effected.  These are matters that are being pursued.  If it were steadily the view of the Finance Department that certain things ought to be done, and that there was great resistance being put up by those engaged on them, and no change could be accomplished, then, presumably, there will be a case for a committee or something else to decide in the matter.  On the question of the increase in the number of typists, to which Deputy Major Cooper referred, that is explained by the figures I gave in relation to the <Col N="1407" /> number of files.  The subjects dealt with, and their compliance with financial requirements, has led to a great increase in work and inter-departmental correspondence.  There was a time when the Army expended money without asking for sanction.  That did not involve correspondence, but now they apply in advance for sanction before spending the money, and that entails correspondence.  It is the same with other Departments.  The very fact that there is normal procedure carried out means that there is an exchange of letters, that there are questions, and so forth.</P>

      <P>I would like some information in respect to the position of the Government consulting engineer. His salary is £1,050, inclusive.  I think the same appointment was held last year.  What I desire to know is, what is the relationship between that consulting engineer and the Department of Finance, or the State in general; whether this is a fee or a salary; whether it is an estimate of what the fees would amount to in the course of the year; and whether there is an addition to this £1,050 in office staff.  The position of consulting engineer is one that I think requires a little more explanation.  We know that there was a consulting engineer appointed to deal with certain expenditure in consequence of the destruction during 1922-23, or for the purpose of reconstruction.  I am anxious to know whether the position of this consulting engineer is the same to-day as two years ago; whether, in respect of any purchases that are made affecting engineering affairs, the consulting engineer, as the vetoing officer, is the person who exercises a check upon any of the Departments; whether the consulting engineer receives a commission on purchases made according to these specifications, or whatever the technical term may be.</P>
      <P>In a general way I would like to know what the position of the consulting engineer is and what his duties are in return for this £1,050 and whether any change has been effected in the personnel or duties of the office this year as contrasted with two years ago.</P>

      <P>The position of consulting engineer is at the present moment under consideration.  As a matter of fact, I am of opinion that there is not going to be any work that would justify the continuation of the arrangement which appears in the Estimates. As a matter of fact, the position is even more indefinite than that, because, although the offer of that sum was made to the gentleman who was acting as consulting engineer, he never accepted it.  He asked for a fee of £1,500 and consequently this is a very tentative figure.  There were various sorts of work being done by the consulting engineer.  First there was the construction of railway bridges for which he was being paid on the basis of 3½ per cent.</P>

Then there was a scale for purchases on behalf of the Government in England on the ordinary Crown agent's scale.  Then for advice on other matters this fee of £1,050 was suggested in August, 1923.  It was offered, but as a matter of fact, as I say, it was never accepted.  That fee was for all other advice that he might give to the Government in connection with electricity supply works or any other things.  Various things occurred which made it impossible or undesirable for the Government to avail of the services of the particular engineer. So far he has received altogether for work done the sum of £8,150.</P>
