      <P>The report of the Revenue Commissioners for the year 1923-24 is being prepared, but it is not possible to state precisely when it will be ready for presentation to the Oireachtas.  It is hoped, however, that it will be ready by August.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if three distinct Press announcements and three sets of regulations in connection with the examination to be held in 1925 for Junior Administrative Posts were issued; and if so, whether he can state why the various changes were necessary, and if he will take steps to prevent in the future the necessity for changing regulations as issued, and the expense incurred in making such changes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Press announcements <Col N="195" /> and regulations for this examination were reissued as stated in the question.  The first reissue was made in order to remove a doubt on the part of some intending candidates as to the conditions of eligibility for admission to the examination.  A further modification became necessary because of a decision to admit women as well as men to the competition.  The circumstances were exceptional, and I do not anticipate that the need for similar changes in regulations issued will arise again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether his attention has been called to the fact that passengers embarking on vessels of the Cunard-Anchor line at Moville are obliged to undergo a very much stricter medical examination and inspection than those embarking at Glasgow and Greenock; whether the United States Immigration Regulations discriminate between passengers coming from different countries; whether these regulations as to medical inspection should be applied to American citizens, and whether, in view of the fact that the character of this examination may deter Americans from visiting the Saorstát, he will instruct the Saorstát representatives in Washington and New York to approach the companies concerned with regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="MINISTER for EXTERNAL AFFAIRS (Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald) Desmond FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for EXTERNAL AFFAIRS (Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Steamship Companies as well as being heavily fined in each instance are obliged by the United States Government to bring back to the port of departure, at their own expense, all immigrants suffering from disease or ill-health who have been carried on their vessels to American ports.  The examination is therefore necessarily a strict one, and if the character of the examination varies from one port to another it arises only from the varying interpretations put on their instructions by the doctors employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> American citizens, for whom the companies have no particular responsibility, are either examined cursorily or not examined at all, and consequently the examination is not such as would deter Americans from visiting this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that American citizens are being put through exactly the same examination as anybody else, and that on one occasion after two immigrants' hair was examined with a comb the same comb, without being cleaned, was put through the hair of an American lady? And is he aware that at Glasgow people simply walk on the boat showing a card; while at Moville the examination is of a particularly drastic character?</P>

      <P>While I have not definite information it is not unlikely that wages have been discontinued during absence owing to illness.

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The President has asked me to make the following statement to the Dáil.  At present before the Oireachtas there are the following Bills:&mdash; The Local Government Bill, which is in the Seanad (Report Stage), the Live Stock Breeding Bill in the Seanad (Report <Col N="207" /> Stage), the Police Forces Amalgamation Bill, Final Stage in the Dáil; the Local Authorities Combined Purchasing Bill, Committee Stage in the Dáil; Dáil Eireann Courts (Winding Up) Bill, Third Stage; Defence Forces Bill, Second Stage; Sedition and Treason Bill, Second Stage; Prisons Visiting Bill, Second Stage; and Pensions of Judges (Dáil Eireann Supreme Court) Bill, Second Stage.  The shortage of work in the Dáil at present is due to the fact that we have not as yet reached the Committee Stage of Bills introduced since the opening of the Session.  When we get to this Stage we will probably find that there will be full business. The only way to prevent a recurrence of this in the future is to have Bills passed through their Second Readings before the adjournment of the Dáil, so that these Bills may come up on Committee immediately the House reassembles. We have this object in view for future adjournments.  It is probable that the Dáil will have completed the consideration of all the above Bills by the end of March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to these there are four Bills of an urgent nature which have not yet been introduced, but which it is very desirable should become law before that date.  They are:&mdash;The Central Fund Bill, which is essential, but which will not be ready for introduction until about the 20th March; The Firearms Bill, the urgency of which is due to the fact that the temporary Bill expires on the 5th April; the Summer Time Bill, and the Land Bonds Guarantee Bill.  We cannot at the moment specify the exact date of the introduction of the three last named measures, but it will probably be next week.  We have also in various stages of progress a number of Bills which will probably be ready for introduction about the 31st March, but which it is not anticipated can be completed in the Dáil at that date.  They are as follows:&mdash;The Army Pensions (Amendment) Bill, the draft of which is now being considered by the Finance Department; the Documentary Evidence Bill, the Statutory Rules and Orders (Publication) Bill, the Censorship of Films Bill, the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Bill, <Col N="208" /> the Cork Reconstruction Bill, the Dublin Emergency Provisions (Amendment) Bill, the Street Trading Bill, the Fisheries Bill, the Industrial and Commercial Property Protection Bill, the Barrow and Owenmore Drainage Bill, and the School Attendance Bill.  A number of these will be introduced shortly, and only require final touching up before their introduction.</P>
    <P>It is the intention in future so far as possible to devote the Summer Session almost entirely to financial business.  We will not be able to follow this course altogether in the present year.  The three finance matters that will be before the Dáil after the 1st April will be (a) Budget Resolutions, which we hope to introduce immediately after the Easter Recess; (b) the Finance Bill, and (c) the Estimates and the Appropriation Bill.  The proposal regarding Estimates would be to allocate two days a week for them, which would give about ninety hours.  We will ask the Dáil to indicate in what order they desire the Estimates to be taken, and we will ask them to agree that when the time allowed for the Estimates has been used up any remaining Estimates will be put from the Chair.  The Budget Resolutions and the Finance Bill, judging from previous experience, will take about thirty-five hours of Parliamentary time.</P>

      <P>There is just one point arising out of the statement made by the Minister for Justice.  He indicated that it was the intention of the Executive Council to introduce a Bill dealing with the Barrow and Owenmore Drainage.  I take it from what he has read that it will not be possible to introduce that Bill before the 31st March, and from the 3rd April to the 21st there will be an adjournment.  If the Bill is not dealt with before the 21st April, there will be very little time to do the work, which must be done at a time when these rivers are not flooded. Do I take it, therefore, that it is the intention of the Executive Council to proceed in any serious way to deal with that question during the coming year? That is not what I take from the statement read by the Minister, and I would like that to be contradicted if I am wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised this question in the hope that we shall be able to get from the Minister responsible a complete statement of the position in the Saorstát in regard to the exceptional distress arising from failure of the harvest, in some respects, and shortage of fuel, and also to obtain from Ministers as far as possible, a complete statement regarding the steps that have been taken to meet that exceptional distress.  The matter, of course, has been brought to the attention of the Dáil, to the attention of Ministers and the country by Deputies since it began in September or October last, and it is known to members of the Dáil that the Government has been attending to this matter, inquiring and making provision to some degree at least to meet it.  Despite the information that Deputies have had from the Ministers, we are all aware of the fact that there has been in the last three or four weeks, a very widespread and persistent campaign in the English newspapers and also in Irish newspapers in regard to this exceptional distress in the West.  Counter statements of a kind rather minimising some of the scare reports of special correspondents, who are adepts at this kind of thing, have been issued by people in responsible positions in the areas affected to show that while there is want and need there is no justification for the rather exaggerated, or apparently exaggerated, reports which special correspondents have published.  This conflict rather creates in our minds some question as to whether the Ministry is taking adequate steps in the direction of co-ordination of such voluntary agencies as have been acting&mdash;and acting, as I understand, with some effect&mdash;<Col N="211" /> to relieve distress, and whether there is any need for a special vote to add to the work which the Government is doing in this matter.  I think it will be generally accepted that if that distress is exceptional&mdash;and we all agree and know that it is&mdash;that the resources of the country should be made available to deal with it.</P>
      <P>It is not, I think, a very happy thing to find that the sufferings of the people are being exploited, even for purposes of charity, and possibly for other purposes besides charity, in other countries.  We are all aware to our sorrow that distress in many of these areas is endemic, continuous and ever-present, and we believe from statements made by Ministers and by Deputies from the areas affected, and from our own knowledge, that the failure of fuel and potatoes has, as a matter of fact, increased in a very sad degree the ever-present semi-hunger and poverty of these areas. I want to suggest that the steps that have been taken by the Ministry may not have been sufficient, and that an increase in the amount available for distribution for immediate cases of need especially amongst children, and an increase in the amount available for the provision of work, should be made at once.  I think that Ministers should tell us, in as detailed a manner as is possible on short notice, what kind of organisation they are using to assist in alleviating the distress in those areas, and further, whether they are attempting to co-ordinate the work of the voluntary agencies which are actively engaged in giving assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Special correspondents of newspapers and others who are more or less expert, if not professional, in such matters, usually find two or three districts upon which to concentrate, and they all concentrate on the same districts, usually with evil results, leaving perhaps more needed cases in other districts without assistance.  I have the view that notwithstanding all one's criticism of State organisation in many respects, where we have the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Local Government acting together and in touch with voluntary agencies, there ought to be a possibility of completely covering in a satisfactory way all the cases of need arising <Col N="212" /> from this exceptional poverty.  It would be a satisfaction to us all, I am sure, if we could have some information from the Ministry which could be tested by Deputies from the areas concerned, that the work of relief and assistance, public work for the relief of unemployment, is being promoted, and that the possibilities of still further distress in the coming two or three months will be obviated entirely.  It would be, I am sure, a satisfaction to every Deputy and to the country generally, to know that the Ministers are taking such steps as will avoid the necessity for this propaganda, the showing forth to the world the sores of Ireland, when possibly in many places to which appeal is being made, equally horrible and lamentable distress might be found.  I hope the Minister will be able to give us a full and complete statement which will satisfy all Deputies in this matter.</P>

Ach in a theannta sin, bá mhaith an rud da dtiochfadh leis an Riagaltas a thuilleadh oibre a sholathar doibh.  I think Deputy Johnson has done a public service in raising this question.  We, especially Deputies coming from the West of Ireland, are well aware of the great distress that exists in that part of the country, and I must say that matters would be very bad indeed at the present time except for the prompt way in which the Government came to the assistance of the people.  There is, on the whole, pretty general satisfaction throughout the districts in the West at the way the Government is coping with this problem of distress.  There are, no doubt, districts here and there where the people think those works of relief might be more extended.  I have received complaints from two Islands along the West Coast of Galway, the islands of Lettermore and Inishnain.  It has been explained to me that while <Col N="213" /> work has been started for the benefit of people in surrounding districts no special works have been started to relieve the distress in those two islands. I have brought this matter before the Land Commission, and I must say the Land Commission act very promptly on representations coming from myself and other Deputies as regards distress along the western seaboard.  I hope that the grants made available for the Land Commission will be largely increased, because I think it is necessary that this work of relief should be carried on into the summer months, and I would add a word of praise on my own behalf and on behalf of the people of Galway to the Land Commission for the very prompt way in which they have come forward to meet this question of distress.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with the tenor of Deputy Johnson's remarks, and I will try to give whatever information I can give at such short notice, but possibly there will be some details which I am not in a position to fill in.  It is an undoubted fact that Press correspondents are exploiting this question for their own reasons.  That has been done for a long time and is still continuing.  I do not know what those reasons are, but that it is a fact is perfectly clear.  There is no abnormal distress in the West this year.  I say that definitely and deliberately. There is always distress in the West, as Deputy Johnson has pointed out, but the distress this year is not, taking the whole congested districts into account, particularly unique. There might be perhaps small areas this year within the congested districts in the West in a worse condition than they were last year.  On the other hand there are areas in a better condition than they were last year, but on the whole the distress this year is nothing more acute than the normal distress in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We tried to envisage this problem as a whole at the beginning and we endeavoured, when tackling the problem some months ago, to co-ordinate the work of the various departments.  For that reason the Minister for Local Government <Col N="214" /> and myself summoned all our officials here to Dublin, got them all into the same room and got exact information as to the various districts which needed relief for one reason or another.  We prepared maps showing acute poverty.  On the same map we coloured in the failure of potatoes and the turf supply.  Moreover, we prepared other maps shaded differently showing whether there was partial or three-quarters or one one-quarter failure of turf, potatoes and of crops generally.  We did the same for poverty where there was acute poverty, poverty less than acute and something which you could hardly describe as poverty and could not describe as comfort.  We had that information and we are satisfied that that information is accurate and that the areas were defined accurately, and that we had reliable information on all those questions.  We knew exactly where there was real poverty and acute poverty, where the turf and potatoes failed, and where there was unusual distress.  We then, on that information, made definite schemes, first, to provide work, second, to provide fuel, coal and timber as an alternative to turf, and third, to provide seed potatoes.</P>
    <P>There is never real famine in the West unless there is a failure of potatoes, and there was no failure of potatoes this year, except in one or two limited areas, and in those limited areas because Champions were sown. The only potatoes that failed this year were the Champion and the Irish Queen. We have been trying for years to get the people in the congested districts to grow other potatoes than Champions and Irish Queens.  We took full advantage of the fact that the Champion had failed to get in other varieties.  The failure of the Champion did more to change the mind of the small farmer who is fond of that variety than any propaganda our Department could do. We spent practically £30,000 on the best of seed, and that seed is being distributed where it should be distributed, first of all in the areas where potatoes have failed, in a small part of Mayo and limited districts in Kerry and all over the congested districts.  £30,000 worth of the best varieties of potatoes, <Col N="215" /> Kerr's Pink and Arran Victory, will go a very long way, and has resulted in productive work.  They will increase and multiply, moreover, and be there the year after.  It will bring large supplies of fresh imported seed into those districts, and will do a considerable amount towards preventing famine and distress in so far as it can be prevented in future years.  The only regret I have is that we are not able to get in bigger supplies.  It is not an easy matter because Government buying puts up prices, and you had to buy carefully and distribute carefully.  Potatoes were bought and sold at very reduced prices indeed, especially in cases where there was real poverty.  A similar amount of money was spent on fuel.  We have not provided fuel for every district where turf had failed.  We could not do it, and it was not necessary.  In some districts where turf failed there was not acute poverty, and in some there was no poverty at all.  We took out the districts where there was acute poverty, and at the same time where the turf failed.  We provided fuel for those districts. We bought fuel reasonably, resold it at a small price, and gave credit wherever credit was necessary.  The arrangements for the distribution of seed have been made by the Department of Agriculture in those areas, and the arrangements for the distribution of fuel are in the hands of a small committee under the supervision of an officer of the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>One hundred and seventy thousand pounds approximately was voted for relief works in those districts.  The schedules of those works were not prepared suddenly, they were not a lastmoment decision.  We foresaw this six months ago, and the Land Commission had ready various works which they would have to do in those districts, in any event.  They had them scheduled, and were ready to begin, and they began them promptly. We took into account, in placing those works, the factors that I have mentioned&mdash;poverty, failure of fuel, and failure of the potatoes.  We tried not to place those works in areas where we had given relief of another kind.  There <Col N="216" /> has been co-ordination in regard to those three main varieties of relief, and I say, deliberately, that with the relief given by the State this year, the conditions in those districts are not worse&mdash; if anything they are slightly better&mdash; than they ordinarily are.  That is the exact position, as far as I know it, and I think my information is accurate. There is never famine in those areas except there is failure of the potato crop, and in some of the really poor districts the potatoes were better this year, strange to say&mdash;considering the weather&mdash;than they have been for the last five or six or ten years.  There was a better crop than the average in Donegal this year.  I hope there is a Donegal Deputy listening to me.  The crop there was better than the average crop for the last ten years.</P>
    <P>We had very little difficulty in selecting the counties to be examined.  They were the counties with congested districts, and, in addition, the County of Cavan.  Of course, we had the elections to help us and, judging by the remarks of some Deputies on this question, we should have refrained from doing anything in Connemara this year, because there were no elections.  We should have taken the same course in Kerry and in Donegal, according to these Deputies.  But I pass from that question. We picked out the counties.  They were very well known.  Everybody knows them.  We examined those counties carefully in respect of the three matters I have mentioned&mdash;poverty failure of fuel, and failure of potatoes. The work of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Local Government has been co-ordinated, and the work of relief is going ahead promptly.  The money voted is being spent, and it is meeting the case.  In addition, there is, I think, £3,000 set aside for a very useful scheme for providing meals for school children.</P>
    <P>With that provision for relief, there is less distress in those areas than there was in 1912, 1913 or 1914, when all our Press correspondents were silent and when all the other benevolent people were silent also.  I should say that there are a good many voluntary agencies doing useful work&mdash;they have always been doing useful work in those <Col N="217" /> districts&mdash;and the Government has already set up a committee to co-ordinate that work.  But, on the whole and in the nature of the case, the work the Government can do itself through the Land Commission and the Local Government Department is, of course, far more considerable than could be done by the best intentioned and best organised voluntary associations.  At the same time, there is a committee endeavouring to co-ordinate the work of those bodies and I do not think there is any cause for anything like anxiety on this question at the moment.</P>
    <P>As we are talking about congested districts, what has really happened is that we are spending money on those areas for the purpose of keeping people there next year to spend it on them again.  That has been the position for 30 or 40 or 50 years.  Deputies will have to face the problem and a big decision will have to be taken to deal with certain well-defined portions of the congested districts, which we all know and which we can all envisage at the moment.  They can be dealt with partly by land purchase, but only partly.  If we succeed in dealing with half the congests&mdash;I say this as a result of close examination of the figures&mdash; by the exercise of the powers we have to acquire land under the Land Act, if half the congests in certain areas adjoining the sea coast can be dealt with, then you will have done as much as you possibly can by land purchase. You can do a lot more, you can go another quarter of the distance towards solving the problem&mdash;giving all these men hard work, hard work which will enable them to live decently and rear their families decently&mdash;by schemes of drainage and reclamation.  A big lot can be done in that way, but when drainage is finished and land purchase is finished there will still be a residue which will have to be dealt with.  But this is not the time or the place to discuss how it will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>That generally is the position in regard to the congested districts, and these are the possibilities and the potentialities, as I see them.</P>

      <P>I do not want to deal with those areas in which, as Deputy Johnson says, poverty is endemic. Any propaganda founded on the condition of those areas reflects not on the Government of the Saorstát but on the British Government, because the British Government had 120 years to cure those conditions and the Government of the Saorstát has had less than three years.  I dislike and I repudiate propaganda of that kind in the strongest possible manner. But I want to call the attention of the Minister to those districts which are normally fairly prosperous and which are now considerably distressed&mdash;districts like Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon, where normally the farmer makes a fairly good living and lives in fairly comfortable conditions. This year the farmer in those districts is suffering not extreme and acute distress but some degree of want and inconvenience. The Minister mentioned three things to be met&mdash;want of food, want of fuel, and want of work.  With regard to the first, I think the Government are fulfilling their function admirably. With regard to the second, I will not say the Government are too lavish, but there is not sufficient check on the method of distribution of coal brought into those areas.  There are a great many fairly strong farmers getting coal at 6d. a bag who could afford to pay for it.  They consider they are justified in that, because their fuel has failed.  They are in a worse position than they would normally be, and in some cases they are taking advantage of this distribution of coal.  I know that the Government has had to improvise machinery for this work and that such machinery cannot work perfectly.  In some places, however, there is a lack of supervision over the distribution of this coal, and people have got it who were not entitled to get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is enough coal to spare, I will not quarrel with their getting it, but I hope the Government will see that the poor do not go short of coal in <Col N="219" /> order that the comparatively prosperous will get coal.  The third need that the Minister spoke of is the greatest and most urgent of all, and that is the need of work.  A director of one of the railway companies, not unified, told me recently that within the last month he had over three hundred men coming to him trying to get work in that railway company.  These were mostly young men and strong men, many of them farm labourers, and some of them of the farming class.  They told him that the farm could not support them under present conditions.  I know very well it is impossible for any private concern to give all the work that is needed, and it is equally impossible for the Government to give the work that is needed, because the Government work in the nature of relief work is, to a large extent, wasteful.  It is such work as consists in the making of roads not urgently wanted, and they have to be maintained when made.  I would urge the Government to look upon this as a problem not only to be solved by the distribution of land, but also by the creating of industries in those areas.  To my certain knowledge, within the last three or four years, a number of mills and factories have been closed down.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when administering the Trades Loan Guarantee Act, to be indulgent with regard to the West especially, because one little industry in a district makes an enormous difference. If it does not employ the men it employs the women and it means the circulation of money.  We all regret how recent fashions have turned away from Donegal tweeds and Banada lace. These and other small industries in the congested districts are affected.  If the action of the Government, coupled with the action of private individuals and societies, could result in reviving some of these industries, they would give a living to a great many people and a great deal would have been done to cope with the problem of distress.  I urge that, because in that way you will not be putting all your money on one horse, and so, when the harvest or <Col N="220" /> potato crop fails, the country will have something else to turn to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcFadden" hpid="Mr. McFADDEN Mr. McFADDEN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McFADDEN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to the rosy outlook in Donegal. I will not deny that a great part of Donegal has had a good crop of potatoes. I do deny that there is famine in Donegal.  But there is a long sea-board where there used to be a great deal of fishing in good years, and they have not caught any fish there for the last two years.  I regret to say that the reports of the inspectors sent down have not taken these areas into consideration.  I regret to say that the amount of the grant allocated to Tirconaill is small in proportion to the other counties, that is taking into consideration such a very large area as there is along that sea-board and which is nearly always in distress.  I would therefore appeal to the Minister to increase the grant so that the various parishes along the coast there would have their needs attended to.</P>
      <P>I deny altogether the reports that have appeared in some of the English newspapers to the effect that there is famine there.  There is want in individual cases, and I know that in these cases the people need work, not relief. They do not want anything for nothing. They want work along this coast until this period of stress has passed over. I sincerely hope the Government will increase the grant and that the Land Commission will carry out the work that they have already started.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked me what I have done in regard to the cases mentioned by him where distress was caused by the Shannon flooding and where certain people were driven from their homes.  Deputy McFadden spoke of certain areas in Tirconaill where the people were also, in his opinion, in need of relief.  You have the whole problem there.  Everybody thinks that his particular district is the district that should be attended to.  Naturally he sees the conditions in front of him, and he does not compare them with the conditions elsewhere. Everybody will appreciate the difficulties of meeting problems of this sort. You have to do it after getting all the <Col N="221" /> facts in connection with the distress everywhere.  We have first to give relief where there is the greatest poverty. None of us are millionaires.  Many of us want relief ourselves.  It is a question of dealing first with the cases that are most pressing for relief and where the conditions are the worst, and we have to do that in a rather ruthless, impersonal way.  While everybody appreciates the condition of people who have been driven out of their homes temporarily by the flooding, still you must remember that you cannot divert for that purpose money that has been already voted and allocated for the relief of real chronic distress.  If the Deputy were in my position he would find that he could not do it himself.  You will find here and there people who, as a result of an extremely wet season on the Shannon, are suddenly plunged into distress owing to the flooding.  That may be for a short or for a long period.  These things are inevitable, and no State machinery that could be devised could deal with them.  We find ourselves that we have to deal first with those areas that mostly need relief, and we are trying to deal with these.  There is a certain amount of work done.  There has been seed supplied.  No one will deny that that is money well spent if it will be productive.  There has probably been seed supplied to people who themselves could buy good seed and could afford to buy good seed.  And the same thing applies to the distribution of coal. With regard to coal, that was one of the things in the distribution of which the people co-operated.  We tried to get good working committees in all these districts.  There has been rather a sound scheme devised with a certain amount of supervision, and each of the districts are getting the benefit of that supervision.</P>
      <P>Deputies will have to make up their minds that in the matter of relief there is certain to be waste, but I can claim with regard to the moneys voted here, that there has been the minimum of waste.  I do not wish to paint a rosy picture of things in Donegal.  What I did say was that the potato crop other years was better than last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the people in the West of Ireland are suffering from conditions that are <Col N="222" /> common, not only to Ireland, but to all other countries.  I really hope that Deputies will remember this problem when we come to deal with the question of land purchase, and I hope that they will agree with me then that the right way in which to administer the Land Act is to deal with the matter of congestion first.  I hope they will agree that it is essential to bring the congests out and place them where we can give them land.  I hope Deputies will not be coming to me heading deputations and saying: &ldquo;We are not going to allow anybody into our parish.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Of course, there is always some reason; there is always some red herring drawn across the trail.  We are frequently told of this terrible problem of people living in small holdings and unable to earn a decent livelihood. I say we can deal with that problem partly by land purchase if we can get the co-operation of every Deputy in his own area, and if every Deputy is not afraid to face the odium in his own district and declare, irrespective of the feeling that may be created: &ldquo;I stand for the division of the land amongst the congests; but I also stand for the migration of congests after all the local congests have been dealt with.&rdquo;  Unless we have the co-operation of Deputies&mdash;the co-operation of members of the Labour Party, the Farmers' Party, the Independents and the Cumann na nGaedheal&mdash;we cannot deal with that huge problem.  I hope Deputies will remember all this when they come to me heading deputations and protesting against the bringing of outsiders into their districts.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to let us have a little more information regarding the work of voluntary organisations and their co-ordination with Government organisations. I feel that the appeals being made, if they are going to be responded to, and if the money is to be spent through overlapping agencies, will result in harm, and the good that might be done will not be done.  Can the Minister tell us if there is any provision for the pooling of various funds?  Provided <Col N="223" /> the associations controlling those funds have confidence in the work that is being done through and by the assistance of the Ministry, I am sure there would be no difficulty in establishing a pooling system.  If the various schemes could be pooled, and a single scheme of assistance could be arranged, then there would be avoided the danger of simply pouring into one area or district, which is well advertised, whatever assistance there may be available.  It would be well if there could be some system of real co-ordination between the voluntary agencies and whatever systems of relief are in progress under the Ministry.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Lands and Agriculture pointed out a few moments ago that Deputies go to him on deputations in connection with the division of land, and he mentioned that they ought not to be jealous if congests are sent to different districts.  It would be an almost impossible situation, in my opinion, for representative from any area to go home and meet people there who are landless, and say to them they permitted, without protest, people coming from other districts into the lands that their own constituents were actually reared on; where their fathers toiled to rear them, and from where perhaps, their forefathers were once evicted.

      <P>I would like to touch upon one matter that Deputy Johnson has referred to.  A special Committee of the Ministry has been set up to get in touch with the various charitable organisations that have already collected money for the purpose of mollifying distress in the West.  I am not on the Committee myself, and I cannot say if it has actually got into touch with charitable organisations.  It was set up to deal with certain moneys which have come to the hands of the President through one of those outside agencies.  That Committee will endeavour to co-ordinate the work done by those outside charitable organisations. The Minister for Lands and Agriculture asked that Deputies would, in their own constituencies, co-operate in any relief and other works, and particularly in regard to endemic distress in the West.  If I might take a phrase used by Deputy Johnson, I would like to comment upon it.  He spoke of professional agitators of distress in this country, people who agitate distress for their own purposes.  He referred to those who were expert in this matter, although they were not professionals. I would appeal to those who are expert in this matter, if they are Deputies, not to agitate for any purpose other than charitable purposes.</P>

      <P>Mr. Whelan's claim appears to be for the issue of the gratuity amounting to fourteen days' pay and allowances formerly granted to soldiers upon discharge.  The order under which this issue was authorised ceased to be effective as from 1st October, 1924.  Soldiers whose discharges were dated on or after that date are therefore ineligible for the allowance.  Mr. Whelan's period of engagement expired on the 24th September, 1924, but on several occasions he made application to have his services extended. Every effort was made to facilitate him. He was, however, rejected on medical grounds and discharged from the Army on 4th November, 1924.</P>

The deponents expressed their belief that the claimant was over 70 years of age, but they made no mention of his position in the family as compared with a younger sister or brother, whose birth certificates might possibly be available in the Ballinahown Church, the records of which would appear to have been kept after the year 1855.
