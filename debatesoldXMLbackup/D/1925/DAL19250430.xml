Arthur Guinness, Son &amp; Co., Ltd., to their shareholders who are resident in the Saorstát, and if it is the case that the Revenue Commissioners refuse to make any refund to claimants whose total income would be less than the figure at which they would be liable to pay Income Tax, and, if so, whether he will give directions that a refund be made to such people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  I am not satisfied on the evidence placed before me that Mr. Hourihan's resignation from the R.I.C. in November, 1918, was caused by his national sympathies, and as I have already caused the Deputy to be informed, <Col N="593" /> I regret that I cannot see my way to issue a certificate under Section 5 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, which would render him eligible for a pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to consider new evidence of a responsible nature to prove that his reasons for resignation were because of his national sympathies, and that his actions, subsequent to his resignation more than proved his national sympathies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>If I got important evidence I would be always willing to consider it, but I believe that in this particular case the reasons stated by the man when resigning were the true reasons.  He stated, when he resigned on the 13th November, 1918, a period before things had become hot and before there was any reason why he should state falsely, that he resigned to attend to a business house and farm of land.  I would require very substantial evidence before I would reconsider that case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am not satisfied that the man resigned from patriotic motives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that information has already been conveyed, that the reason for the refusal of the Minister to grant a pension in this case is because the man was dismissed from the Gárda Síochána, and is it not a fact also that, as a result of information supplied to the Minister, other members <Col N="594" /> who have been dismissed from the Gárda Síochána have actually received pensions under the authority of the Minister.  Will the Minister say, in view of these facts, why he has refused to grant the pension in this case, and will he also say whether this man's dismissal from the Gárda Síochána was either previous to, or subsequent to, the issue of regulations by him under the Superannuation and Pensions Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always difficult to know what a man's motive was.  But sometimes you can be helped in judging the motive in a particular instance by a man's subsequent conduct.  This man's subsequent conduct, when he was a member of the Civic Guard, convinces me that it was not patriotism that caused his resignation from the R.I.C., but, as you might say, irregularism in advance of the times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to state, in view of the information at his disposal, if it is not a fact that this man was one of the very few men who refused to take part in the mutiny at the original establishment of the Civic Guard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know, but what I do know is that he was dismissed from the Civic Guard for failing to report for duty, for being drunk and assaulting his sergeant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that statement should not be allowed to go unchallenged. The facts are, that this man was refused permission to attend the funeral of his sister.  He went away without permission, and that was the reason for his dismissal from the Gárda Síochána.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>

Tarpey for payment of a pension under the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923; if this claim was submitted to and passed by the Committee of Inquiry which was appointed to investigate such claims, if in view of this man's pre-Truce record and activities he will now agree to issue authority for payment of a pension, or state the reason why he is unable to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons are much the same as the reasons I gave in regard to a previous question.  I am not satisfied that this man resigned from patriotic motives.  I think he was a troublesome man.  His dismissal from the Civic Guard was due to insubordination, drunkenness, and a general neglect of his duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not within the Minister's knowledge that this man was one of the three men who organised the Police Union within the R.I.C., the <Col N="596" /> Union which assisted to bring the R.I.C. into opposition to the Conscription Act passed by the British Government.  Is the Minister also aware of the fact that this man volunteered his services to the Free State when the trouble broke out in June, 1922, and that he offered to give his services in any capacity that the State might be willing to use them. Is he also aware of the fact that the reason given for his dismissal was that he expressed sympathy with and a hope that one of his late colleagues would not be allowed to die in an internment camp in Kildare when he was on hunger strike.  I think these facts should be made known to Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not the least interested in the information.  I am satisfied that this man was a troublesome man and a man who has no claim on us.  As I said before, it was more a case of irregularism in advance of the times than anything else that was wrong with him.</P>

      <P>No special provision has been made for girl offenders similar to the Borstal Institution for boys, and no such provision is contemplated.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the reasons for not granting a blind pension to Miss Higgins, Parkbawn, Gorey, Co. Wexford; whether he is aware that the applicant furnished three medical certificates certifying that she was incapable of any work for which eyesight was essential; that one of the certificates was from Dr. Connolly, Fitzwilliam Street, Dublin, an eminent eye specialist; whether these certificates should not fulfil the statutory requirements, and whether, under the circumstances, and in view of the fact that the local Pension Committee granted the pension, and that this woman, who is sixty-eight years of age, is destitute, her home help having been withdrawn, he will consider a new application from her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>A detailed examination of the claimant's eyesight was made on the 1st of November last by the Department's medical inspector.  On consideration of the medical evidence, including the inspector's report, which expressed an opinion that she had useful vision in her right eye, it was held that the claimant did not fulfil the statutory condition of blindness, and was not eligible for a pension under the Blind Persons Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some additional medical evidence was afterwards furnished and was submitted <Col N="600" /> to the medical inspector, who advised that there was nothing therein to show that the condition of vision of the claimant had so deteriorated since November last as to bring her within the Statute.  He mentioned that she suffers from general debility.</P>
    <P>It is extremely doubtful whether it would serve any useful purpose to make a new claim now for the blind pension.  The applicant may do so if she wishes, and should the case subsequently come up on a fresh appeal a reexamination of the eyesight would be made by the medical inspector.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the claimant might renew her application to the local home assistance officer for an allowance pending the grant to her either of the Blind Pension or Old Age Pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>At the commencement of a new benefit year on 26th March last 44,568 claims to benefit were lodged.  Of these it is estimated that 10,269 will be disallowed.  Of the <Col N="604" /> remainder, 34,299, it is estimated that 8,854, or 25.8 per cent., are entitled to benefit for 1 to 30 days, 7,541, or 22 per cent. for 31 to 60 days, and 17,904, or 52.2 per cent., for 61 to 90 days, the full allowance.  Having regard to the season of the year, to the measures taken in the Budget to stimulate employment, and to the present state of the Unemployment Fund, I think it difficult to argue that these figures necessitate any present extension of benefit. The persons who have exhausted their rights are persons who have had relatively few contributions paid for them, that is, relatively little insurable employment, in the last four and a half years, and in having had their actual contributions multiplied already five times they have exhausted any reasonable claim to be provided for out of the Unemployment Fund.</P>

If I argue from the fact that a number of people have been continuously out of employment for a certain time, there might be another interpretation put on that as to whether these people would ever be likely to come into employment if employment was offered to them.  I have the fact before me that considerable vacancies still exist in the Army, and that in regard to domestic service, advertisements for servants bring very few replies, and while these two great classes of employment are open and not filling up, I cannot say that the people who are not in employment are necessarily without employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather lost touch with this matter in the period in which I was ill last summer when something was done.  I know one reason why the increases were not given here that were given on the other side was that the people in control of the fund were not willing to give them that without our assent, pending some financial arrangement which we were hoping for a long time, and until that comes we are unwilling to assent.  It is a matter largely of finance.  We do not want to take over the running of the Irish Lights for the mere honour and glory of the thing, and we can only take it over when fair arrangements are made in regard to the finance of them. The light dues paid by the ships that benefit by these lighthouses come into the General Lighthouse Fund, and until some arrangement is made I do not think we can very well agree to an expenditure which might fall heavily upon our shoulders if we had to take over the lights under an unsatisfactory agreement.

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FISHERIES (Mr. Fionán Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The gross Estimate for my Department is £106,580, less £45,805 Appropriations in Aid, giving a net total of £60,775.  That is a net increase on last year of £5,747.  This increase is practically spread over every sub-head in the Vote.  It will be observed that two new sub-heads (h) and (i) have been introduced.  The increase under the sub-head of salaries, wages, and allowances amounts to £1,191, and is due partly to the addition of six clerks and four minor officials, and partly to the ordinary incremental additions to the salaries of the existing staff.  The additional clerical staff was necessary to deal with the accounting work of the Rural Industry section, which was transferred to my Department last year from the Land Commission.  Travelling expenses look very high, but when you consider that 20 per cent. of the staff of my Department is continually, in the course of their duties, in the country, or sometimes at sea, it is not really abnormal.  The sum provided last year for travelling was £2,500, and it proved insufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head E Fishery development includes provision for the various activities in connection with the sea and inland fisheries undertaken by the Department.  The sum asked for under the service is £39,225, and in connection with that it should be borne in mind that I hope to recover in the same year the sum of £14,155, as will appear by referring to items 2 and 4 in sub-head J, page 224.  The main schemes carried on under sub-head E are as follows:&mdash; Fish curing, £2,000.  This is a sum that may or may not be spent.  It is really a stand-by in case of necessity.  For inspecting and branding cured mackerel for export there is a sum of £500.  For providing fishery requisites for sale in remote stations there is a sum of £2,000.  For building boats and maintaining fishing vessels in the Department's hands there is a sum of £6,200.  There is a subsidy to the Arran Island steamer of £1,100.  Insurance of motor-boats comes to £3,000.  Instruction to fishermen in motor-driving, fish-curing, barrel and net-making, and boat-repairing, amounts to £2,250.  We have three places situate in Galway and also Killybegs, and Baltimore. Dredging fishery harbours comes to £1,000.  Experimental fisheries, scientific investigation, the erection of kippering-houses <Col N="617" /> at Dunmore, and various other schemes, cost £2,075.  Collection of statistics amount to £550.  The upkeep of various fishery stores, curing stations, etc., on the west coast, £1,200, and fishery loans come to £7,000.</P>
    <P>Those schemes, so far as I have mentioned, relate to sea fisheries, and the amount of the Vote is £28,875.  This sub-head also provides a sum of £10,350 for services connected with the development of inland fisheries.  It includes grants to boards of conservators, £6,000.  Salmon hatcheries come to £1,500.  Management of State fisheries costs £1,700, and scientific investigation £1,150.  It is unnecessary for me to tell the House that our sea fisheries are in a very unsatisfactory condition.  The crews to man our large motor drifters are fewer than they were 10 years ago. The sons of the old fishermen are not going into the fishing business.  Many of those vessels are in poor repair.  In almost all cases the gear is old and ineffective, and the motor engines for the most part need overhauling.  The fishermen bought their boats in the boom years of the war, in 1917 or 1918, when prices were very high.  At the present day they are unable to pay the instalments on the loans advanced to them by the Department of Agriculture and the C.D.B.  Many owners in Donegal, West Cork and Galway became disheartened, and neglected their boats and engines.  My Department was forced to take possession of the boats, and we had then a very serious loss on our loan accounts.</P>
    <P>Small boat fishing in the inshore waters has fared somewhat better and is able to pay its way, and the drifter men on the east coast also can be said to have turned the corner.  It is, however, idle to expect anything in the nature of a big expansion in the fishing industry and the maximum exploitation of our seas as long as the essentials of industrial activities are withheld from the business of catching, handling and marketing the fish. In our opinion, these essentials are capital, labour, and industrial organisation. Outside the capital advanced by the State and one or two fishing companies, comparatively speaking there is no money invested in fishing in Ireland. <Col N="618" /> Our deep sea fishing is really trifling in comparison with other countries situated as favourably as we are.  The labour is on the sea board, but the men would, of course, require considerable training to make them accustomed to the hardships of deep sea fishing and to accustom them to staying away from their homes as long as is done by deep sea fishermen in other countries. Another thing is, the industry and the units engaged in it are not organised. Markets are wanted at the ports where the fish are landed.  There are good fishing centres in the Free State.  You have boats, fishermen, and good harbours. Owing to bad organisation for selling and marketing, which result in low prices and weak buying, the boats are compelled to go to other ports, and in some cases altogether to stop fishing. The drifter fishermen are not organised, and concerted action by the fleet of drift net boats is needed in order to locate the shoals.  One boat going out on its own may spend a great deal of time before it locates the shoal of herring or mackerel, as the case may be.  If the boats act in concert they are more likely to come on the shoal in a short period.  That is done in other places.</P>
    <P>These are some of the things the State cannot do.  I have not the funds at my disposal to capitalise the fishing industry.  I have done as much as I could to encourage organisation among our fishermen.  So far, although the work has been pushed forward a bit it has not been very successful.  Greater interest in our fisheries must be shown by the citizens of the State as a whole before we can hope for any great development in the industry.  There must be greater enterprise and people who have capital must be encouraged to put it into the business.  Also the fishermen must face the fact that they have to be prepared to work harder than they have been doing in the past.  They have to look after their gear and engines better, otherwise any marginal profit may well be swallowed up in the losses sustained through neglect.  As I mentioned, I have only £7,000 available for those loans.  That is barely sufficient to meet the needs of the inshore men.  We have, of course, several good <Col N="619" /> up-to-date motor vessels on our hands which we can lend out apart from that £7,000 to drift-net men if they get sound securities.  These are not easy to get, because in the places where those men are known it is hard to get persons who could be taken honestly as sureties.  They are usually very poor people in the district.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we supply the nets as well.  We usually have nets in stock. Regarding the other scheme for sea fishery development provided for in the Estimate, they are really for the purpose of carrying on.  One thing needs mention: that is mackerel branding. Our pickled mackerel is not getting the show in the American market which it should get.  It is selling at six or eight dollars per barrel less than the Norwegian mackerel, and the Norwegian is taken frequently side by side with ours.  It may be captured off Baltimore or Valentia Island.  The handling makes the difference.  They are able to command a better price to the extent of six or eight dollars a barrel on the American market than our mackerel. We hope by this brand to remedy that to some extent.  The object of the brand is to afford the American buyer a guarantee as to quality.  There are strict requirements to qualify for this brand.  It is optional to apply for it, but it is expected at any rate that most curers will be anxious to get it in a short time when it is proved that branded mackerel will command a better price than mackerel without the brand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It will be done administratively. The use of the brand is optional.  It is not like the provisions of the Dairy Produce Act.  The Vote asked for fishery development includes £6,000, grants towards the <Col N="620" /> Boards of Conservators.  I look forward to the operation of the Bill, which had a Second Reading a few days ago, to reduce these grants considerably. In that event, I hope to have money which I can give more generously than in the past to the voluntary associations that were mentioned on the Second Reading of the Bill.  I referred to the up-keep of State fisheries.  At present, the management of four rivers is in our hands.  Last year, these fisheries brought in revenue which almost met the outlay on them, in spite of the fact that estuary fishing last year was very poor because of the floods.  This year we expect that the rivers will be better, and the rod-fishing has, in the case of all of them, been let on very good terms, from our point of view.</P>
      <P>Sub-head F deals with Rural Industries. The control of the industrial work of the former C.D.B. was taken over by my Department about twelve months ago.  The work in these various depots or classes is generally done by girls, but some male labour is required, especially in the making of toys.  The work turned out included machine-knitted clothing, crochet goods, articles of silk, lace, embroidery, and toys. There are 34 of these depots altogether, the principal places in which the work is done being the poorer parts of Donegal, West Mayo, and Galway.  The value of the products marketed in these depots for the year 1923-24 was £32,074. Of this sum, the workers received £18,601.  When my Department took over the service last year, it was found that the volume of work being turned out at six of the depots was too small to justify the keeping on of the classes. I, therefore, closed down these classes. They were not being patronised by the local people.  No interest was being taken in them, and it was really waste of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system of marketing the products of these industries is being considered at the moment.  The present system is not satisfactory.  As a matter of fact, the classes are competing, as it were, amongst themselves, and they are, therefore, not getting the prices that they may get if we can formulate a scheme by which we will have a central marketing depot in Dublin. <Col N="621" /> The amount provided for running the industries is set out as £30,723. That includes £17,000 for the purchase of the raw materials&mdash;yarn, silk and stuff of that kind.  These materials are either sold to the workers or the cost is recovered on the sale of the manufactured article.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head J (Appropriations-in-Aid) is included a sum of £20,500. That includes the sale of raw materials to the workers, as well as a percentage deduction from the earnings of the workers, which goes to recoup the State for running the service.  That percentage deduction for this year is expected to yield £4,000.  It is, I think, a 10 per cent. reduction.  The estimate for salaries and upkeep of premises, etc., is £12,000, and, setting off this sum of £4,000, expected to be recovered, the nett cost to the State of running these depots will be only £8,000.  It has to be borne in mind, in dealing with this Estimate, that these industries bring money into the very poorest districts of the country.  They give employment to girls where there would be no possible chance of employment otherwise, and are of very great benefit in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>It represents sales of manufactured articles.  Sub-head G deals with the fishery cruiser.  The cost of running is estimated at £9,500.  The amount voted last year was £8,500. This sum proved insufficient, the reason being that the boat was trying to patrol as far as possible the whole coast.  The coal bills were, therefore, higher than they were expected to be.  Last year I dwelt a good deal on the necessity for protecting our inshore fishing grounds. These grounds afford a means of livelihood to a large number of fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are at present 234 sailing trawlers and at least as many small line boats giving a rather precarious living to about 1,500 men and their <Col N="622" /> families.  Unless the steam trawler is kept off these inshore grounds, these persons will be put out of action with consequent hardship, and, I might say, consequent starvation.  The extent of line to be patrolled in Saorstát waters is about 1,000 miles.  It is obvious that this work cannot be effectively done by one ship.  Scotland has five or six patrol boats.  England has not quite so many, but the Navy there gives great assistance, from the point of view of fishery protection.</P>
    <P>Last year I approached the Minister for Finance to secure sanction for a second cruiser.  The cost of a new ship, designed for this work, was considered too high, and I was told to look around and see if I could not find some boat that would be suitable.  I was able to locate a certain type of ship&mdash;there were three or four ships of the same type across Channel&mdash;which I was advised would meet the requirements, being sufficiently speedy and sufficiently seaworthy.  Some months ago I laid the matter before the Minister for Finance, in the hope that provision would be made in these Estimates for the purchase and putting into commission of this ship, if it was found suitable after inspection.  I am, therefore, rather disappointed to find that the Minister for Finance has not yet been satisfied as to the need for a second ship, and that he has, consequently, not made provision for it in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>Sub-head H is a contribution to the International Council for the Study of the Sea.  That Council consists of representatives from the various maritime nations of Europe, interested in the study of commercial fish and the physical conditions governing their movements, propagation and so on. The work of the Council, we feel, deserves the support of all countries interested in sea fisheries.  Therefore, I got financial sanction for having this amount included in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Sub-head I deals with Minor Marine Works.  I am glad to say that I have succeeded in getting the Minister for Finance to provide £1,500 for the smaller type of marine works, such as minor improvements to existing fishery harbours and, in some cases, building small slips and landing piers along the <Col N="623" /> west coast.  I have referred already to the appropriations-in-aid and I need not add anything concerning them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisMByrne" hpid="Mr. C. BYRNE Mr. C. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad if the Minister, when replying, would tell us the amount spent on sea fisheries last year, as distinct from river fisheries; if he would tell us also how much of that amount, spent on the development of sea fisheries, went towards salaries, repayment of interest on loans and insurance, and how much was actually spent on the development of the sea-fishing industry.  I would, also, take this opportunity of reminding him that the last commercial fishing fleet we have in Ireland is the Arklow fleet.  I think it would be very unfortunate if anything happened that would cause the Arklow fleet to disappear. At the moment, the men are complaining that they are being pressed by the Deparment for repayment of loans and that they are being threatened with penalties.  I think the Department is aware that the great majority of the Arklow fishermen are honest men.</P>
      <P>I think they would be only anxious and willing to pay.  The reason they are not able to pay is because of the depressed state of the industry.  I would urge the Minister, therefore, that every effort should be made to help them.  It is to the benefit of the Saorstát and the future development of the industry that we should keep the Arklow fishing industry alive.  If something is not done to help it it will disappear, and I hold that that would be very unfortunate not only for the people of Ireland but for the future of the industry.  I would impress on the Minister the necessity for doing everything possible to help them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has explained that he has allocated £28,875 for the development of sea fisheries as distinct from inland fisheries.  I believe that a thousand pounds for dredging is not sufficient.  The harbour at Arklow is almost sifted up, and that is the place where you have the principal fishing fleet on the eastern coast.  I was down there recently, and they complained very bitterly of the inactivity of the Government in not having the approach to the harbour properly attended to.  In addition, the quay wall has almost become undermined.  I am sure the Minister knows the circumstances. The dredger, which costs £6,000 a year to the Board of Works, and which I am told is lying idle, could have been working there.  I hope he will use his energy and his advice in getting the Board of works to give him that dredger.  A thousand pounds is certainly, in my opinion, too small for a service of that nature.  With regard to sub-head (J), I want to ask the Minister what is the meaning of &ldquo;local taxation, Customs and Excise.&rdquo;  It is a grant of £10,650&mdash;an appropriation-in-aid of a considerable amount.</P>

      <P>I think it is a pity that the Minister, or whoever was responsible for preparing this Estimate, did not set out very much more detailed information under sub-head (E) than simply the words &ldquo;Fishery Development.&rdquo;  In telling what these fishery development schemes were, he enumerated 12 or 14 headings. I was not able to take them down, or <Col N="625" /> the sum attached to each, while he was reading them out.  But I suggest it would be very much better if those headings appeared under fishery development in the Estimate&mdash;these various schemes and the manner in which the £39,000 is proposed to be allocated during the year.  I think it would be well if that were done in future.  It would enable us to compare what has been done from year to year under each particular heading.  We see that there is £39,000 this year for fishery development as against £34,000 last year.  I suggest it would be more useful if we were able to compare what was spent last year with this year under the various headings that are here.</P>
      <P>As regards the general question of fishery development, there are, as the Minister stated, many ways in which this development might be brought about.  I think it was mentioned here last year that one of the greatest difficulties in this matter was the question of finding not foreign markets but markets at home for fish.  It is a pretty generally accepted fact that people in the inland areas, not perhaps to the extent which they should, but to a considerable extent, are anxious to have fish.  The fish are caught by the fishermen in the western and north western areas and they are anxious to dispose of it.  Still the fact remains that the inland people cannot get the fish and the fishermen cannot dispose of their fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would seem to me that much more might be attempted, as the Minister has stated, to organise markets for fish; in fact, to create, if necessary, a taste for fish, to have something in the nature of a publicity compaign, calling attention to the advantage of fish as a food, and doing something whereby the funds, or some of the funds, at the disposal of the Department might be used to organise markets, and to get the fish which is caught off the Arran Islands, the Galway coast, and other coasts, to the inland districts not more than 50 or 60 miles away.  I know many areas, especially in the inland portions of Galway. Mayo, and Roscommon, where people say they cannot get fish, and they are anxious to get it. At the same time, the fish are <Col N="626" /> caught, and they are not disposed of at anything like a rate that would give a return to the fishermen.  Under one of the headings that were read out by the Minister was a subsidy of £1,100 to the Arran steamer.  I would like to hear very much more from the Minister as to how that subsidy develops the fishing in Arran.  I am not satisfied that the country is getting the value it ought to get for the payment of that £1,100.  I think it is a matter that ought to be investigated, because the complaint I hear from the people of Arran generally, is that they cannot get their fish into the markets in time, owing to the fact that there are only two sailings in the week&mdash;on Wednesday and Saturday&mdash;and by the time the fish that are caught are shipped on the steamer and got away to the markets they are not in a saleable condition.  I doubt if some better scheme could not be devised than subsidising this steamer.  That is, so far as the development of fishery is concerned.</P>
    <P>I think it was on the Estimates last year, or on some occasion on which we had a fishery debate, that I called attention to the fact that there was an alternative route from Arran, if such a route could be taken up by the Minister. Galway is over 30 miles by sea from Arran; that is the route taken by the steamer.  There is a port nine miles from Arran which is not, of course, such an important place as Galway, but it is on the Galway Coast.  It is called Coshla.</P>
    <P>The fishermen in Arran tell me that they would be quite prepared to run their boats across and land their fish at Coshla if arrangements were made by the Minister to have the fish carried by road to Galway.  I suggest to him that he might find a way, if this question were gone into, whereby this £1,100 subsidy could be very much more usefully expended in connection with the other scheme.  As it stands, at the moment, the fishermen derive practically no benefit from the steamer, or very little benefit, in any case, and they complain that it is a cause of delay and a cause of loss of fish on many occasions when they are unable to have them shipped in time.  That is all I have to say on the matter of sub-head (E) at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> With regard to the inland fisheries, I spoke, on the day we had the Fishery Bill under discussion, on the matter of voluntary association.  I do not think the Minister mentioned that there was any sum available on this year's Estimate for giving grants to voluntary associations.</P>

      <P>I desire also to join Deputy O'Connell in complaining about the general manner in which these Estimates have been presented. Only in regard to sub-head (a) and sub-head (j) have we got any information as to the means whereby this money is to be or has been expended. The sub-heads are explained in identically the same terms as they are given in the main Vote, and I would suggest that in the future we should deal with this Vote as others are dealt with in other portions of the Estimate.  I certainly would like to sympathise with the Minister for Fisheries in regard to the niggardly treatment that has been meted out to him by the Minister for Finance, but while sympathising with him, in that regard, in respect of portion of this Vote, I certainly cannot sympathise in respect of items A, B, C and D.  As the House will see, of the total sum of £60,000, which is the estimated expenditure for the coming year upon this Department, no less than £25,000 is to go in salaries, wages, allowances, travelling and incidental expenses, telegrams and telephones. The Minister for Finance is certainly not niggardly in that respect.  I only wish he could have been more generous, or equally so, in regard to the subject matter of the expenditure.  The total amount that will be expended <Col N="628" /> under the other sub-heads is about £35,000, as against £25,000 for salaries and expenses.</P>

      <P>Yes, but of that £45,805 represents appropriations-in-aid. If the Deputy likes to be more accurate, the total amount to be expended, including appropriations-in-aid, is £106,000.  For the expenditure of this £106,000 the State has to pay £25,000 by way of salaries, wages and other incidental expenses.  That is a very large sum.  It seems a very high proportion.</P>

      <P>I think, as I said this time last year, upon the occasion of the discussion of the Estimates for that year, that it would be far better to have no Department of Fisheries, no separate Department at all, but to have the Department of Fisheries part of, say, the Department of Agriculture. In that way we would be able to save a certain amount&mdash;if not all of this £25,000 certainly a portion of it&mdash;and the amount so saved could be allocated to the subject matter of the Vote itself. There is no doubt that one fishery cruiser would hardly be sufficient to keep away the pirates from the waterways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>As my friend aptly puts it, they should have done more.  At any rate they have done something, and for that I give the Minister credit.  The kipper industry is a great industry in Scotland.  I understand a great many of the Scotch kippers originated around the coast of Ireland before they became kippers, and while in the nature of herrings they were caught not very far from Dunmore itself.  I think it is a very good thing that the Minister is expending some of his meagre resources on this object.  I am afraid the whole tenor of the Minister's speech was not a very optimistic one and I do not blame him for it.  He has been most candid with the Dáil.  He has shown the difficulties in his way and they seem to be very great. The fishing industry in this country is undoubtedly in a bad way.  It should be one of our greatest industries.  How that end can be realised is not so very easy to say.  As the Minister stated, capital is required and labour is required, and to get the necessary capital I admit in the present state of the finances of the country is not such an easy matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I think that having a <Col N="630" /> separate Minister for Fisheries, which again I deprecate, and having had at his disposal only such a small amount by way of aids and grants, I do not see what very much more the Minister could have done.  I do think that at any rate in next year's Budget there should be some effort made, though Deputy Johnson seems to think it should not be run as a business concern, to see that an expenditure of £106,000 gross should not bear a salary sheet of £25,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Redmond's views of the functions of the Department of Fisheries are interesting. Whether he is thinking that we are already living in the days when the Department of Fisheries will be a centralised authority for conducting the business of the fishing industry I do not know, but may I tell him that that is not a fact.  So far as I can read the Estimates the Department does not pretend to buy fish and sell it.  The Department is supervising fisheries.  I just noticed certain items in these Estimates which the Deputy will be interested in from the point of view of his criticism.  We voted last night £870,000 for public works and buildings, and salaries, wages, travelling and incidental expenses amounted to £100,000 of that.  Is that excessive? On the same ground you might well claim that the Department of Public Works might be criticised because the great bulk of its expenditure was on salaries, wages and incidentals.  So in regard to the Revenue Department. Out of £713,000, salaries, wages, telegrams and travelling expenses amounted to £629,000.  Similar criticism might be levelled there.  I cannot understand the Deputy's repudiation of my statement that this is not a trading department by saying it should not be run on business lines.  Is it only trading departments that should be run on business lines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the impression that Deputy Redmond is following the kind of criticism of several of these Departments that has appeared in certain public prints daily and weekly in regard to the amount expended <Col N="631" /> on salaries, wages, etc., as though it were essential that the money voted should be spent in material, although the Department is not dealing in material at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might be allowed to interrupt the Deputy for a moment.  As far as following the lines of certain dailies and weeklies goes, I am merely following the line I took up last year, namely, that in my opinion there should be no separate department for fisheries, and that all these salaries of officials would be saved if the Department were merged into the Department of Agriculture, as is the case in England and Scotland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy know what the cost of the Department was when it was conducted by the Department of Agriculture?  Would he be surprised to hear that when the Department was divided between the C.D.B. and the D.A.T.I., that the cost of administration was just as high as now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy would like us to infer from his statements that the persons engaged in the work of the Ministry are only working half time, that they used to work full time, or that there are idle men and women in the Department of Agriculture who could spend their time in doing the work of the Ministry of Fisheries?  I do not think that is a fact.  So far as I can judge, any time I visit the Departmental offices, I may say I get the impression that they are all very well occupied, at least actively occupied, well or ill, I cannot say, and they are certainly not idling.  It never seems to me when I go into public offices that the public servants are not working with assiduity.  I think that the criticism of these Departments should not be on the ground that so great a proportion of the total estimate is for salaries and wages.  Surely we should rather consider whether the salaries and wages are being paid to persons who are devoting their time and attention to work that is really productive and good for the country. The Fisheries Department is undoubtedly <Col N="632" /> a difficult one, because of the awful conditions in which we find the fishery industry.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Redmond suggested, the Minister's speech seems to be rather of a pessimistic kind.  He did not seem particularly hopeful of the industry at the moment because of the want of capital, because of the lack of gear, and difficulty of access to markets.  I think I made a suggestion on several occasions before, that probably the most important consideration, thinking of the future, is that the Minister should find himself in collaboration with the Minister for Education and through technical instruction classes, combined with the publicity campaign, as Deputy O'Connell suggested, there should be developed a demand in this country for fish and a training in the method of preparing fish for table.  It is undoubtedly a fact that this country is a bad country for fish consumption; the people do not take to fish.  That is very well known in the fish trade, that the Irish market is a bad market for fish, comparatively.  I think it is a bad market for fish because there has been in years gone by the difficulty of access to the consuming areas, before the rapid means of communication developed, and the taste for fish was destroyed because fresh fish could not be obtained.  I think that is the way the prejudice against fresh fish developed. It is undoubtedly a prejudice that will have to be overcome by extraordinary measures.  I agree that something is now needed in the way of a publicity campaign to try to develop, very considerably, the local markets.  That, of course, will not help to catch fish, but it will help to sell all these fish which are caught.  I think there is a good deal of misapprehension, too, with reference to what is possible in regard to the fishing industry, say, on the West Coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A comparison has been made with English, Scotch, and French trawlers. It has been said that, if the State would only come forward and provide money for the fitting out of Irish trawlers to compete with the foreign trawlers, by that means you would save the industry and develop a prosperous country-side. I am rather dubious of that.  The fact <Col N="633" /> would be that, if you had Irish trawlers and no market in Ireland, these trawlers would simply have to do exactly what the English, Scotch, and French trawlers do&mdash;take their fish to England, Scotland, and France.  They would take their fish to these countries and fit out their vessels in them.  Their crews would also spend their earnings in these countries.  The crews would come home, perhaps, once a month, but the only real return given would be the possible profit and the possible saving that might come to the owners and the crews; not their spendings to any great degree.  As a matter of fact, the fish would go where the market is, and the crews would spend their money in fitting out their vessels in the port where they landed the fish.  That would not be an Irish port so long as there is no Irish market.  I have the view that it is much more likely to be a profitable development to develop the smaller fishing boats for local markets, and to work from the local markets to a larger Irish market.</P>
    <P>I think it is much more likely to be profitable to have the small boats developing a local market.  I do not think that is going to be done by the provision of highly capitalised steam trawlers, or by large motor vessels.  The need of the day, of course, is for drift-net boats, and to have them steam or petrol or oil driven.  The main purpose of that, of course, is to enable the boats to fish more often and to reach the markets more promptly.  I think that the Minister should devote his attention, as far as possible, to developing a trade in the local markets and to the distribution of the surplus beyond the local demand into the larger areas inland.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to hear from the Minister that he has been unable to persuade the Ministry of Finance to provide sufficient money for a second cruiser. The people who are suffering from the depredations, shall I say, of the foreign trawlers are the fishermen and their small boats with whom I have dealt.  These men are trying to supply the local markets, and their fish are caught nearer shore than would be normal in the case of a big and a <Col N="634" /> powerful trawler.  It is commonly accepted&mdash;whether truly or not I am not going to be dogmatic&mdash;that the trawlers do, as a matter of fact, destroy the fishing ground, whether for ground fish, or for fish such as herrings and mackerel, which have different habits from the ground fish.  I think the Minister ought to be supported by the Dáil in his demand, or in his request, shall I say, to be dealt with more kindly by the Minister for Finance, in the matter of further assistance for another cruiser.  It is not merely that these trawlers destroy the fish, but there is no doubt that very often their boats also destroy the gear of the fishermen.</P>
    <P>In respect to the contribution to an International Council, the Minister has told us a little about this, but did not tell us a very much.  I think we should have a little more information as to what this International Council is, how it is convened, and who comprise it, how the cost is apportioned, and whether it is a Council comprised of representatives of States, or whether it is a voluntary organisation of people interested in fishing from the commercial point of view, or what else it may be.  I think we should have some information as to how this £400 is arrived at, and also as to what the Council is and not merely what its functions are.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down perhaps I may ask the Minister if he can tell us anything in regard to rural industries.  What is the course followed by the persons who have gone through these schools? What are the outlets after expending, say, 25 per cent. as a State charge&mdash; that is, 25 per cent. of the total selling price of the goods.  Is that continuous, and does it apply to the same people year after year, or is it a preliminary to commercial development and a self-supporting industry.  I think if there is a continuous contribution to the industry of 25 per cent. of the selling price of their commodities, and if that is the proportion which is continuous year after year, the whole question will probably have to be considered in the light of the cost to the state of these industries.  I think that there must be some further information in regard to the finished products in the way of the trained industrialist: the <Col N="635" /> person who has been trained in these school or who passes through the various grades of these schemes should come to some end where the industry is somewhat like self-supporting.</P>

      <P>I think that the amount specified in this Estimate for fishery development is altogether too small.  During the past few years the fisherman has had a very hard time, and it would take a much larger sum than is provided for in this Estimate to put the fishing industry on a fair basis again.  The Ministry, no doubt, has accomplished a good deal according to the slender resources at its disposal, but more might be done to help towards getting the fish taken at a quicker rate than at present to the market where fish is disposed of.  Unfortunately, as Deputy Johnson has remarked, there is very little consumption of fish at home.  In the West, on Arran Islands, for instance, the despatch of the fish for the market is often delayed for many hours.  I think it would improve the position of the fishermen there if the fish were taken to Coshla Bay by motor boat, and from thence to Galway by motor lorries.  We have in Roundstone and in Cleggan, in Connemara, which is very far away from the markets, a high average as regards the catches of fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An effort ought to be made to get the fish conveyed at special rates to the markets, because if the demand for fish increases, that will mean increased supplies, and hence it would pay the fishermen to devote more time to the fishing industry.  One of the great drawbacks we have in Ireland at the moment is that we have very few real fishermen in the country.  Most of the people engaged in the fishing industry are small tenant farmers, who have to spend a considerable amount of their time on the land.  They have to do this <Col N="636" /> because, unfortunately, the fishing season in Ireland is a very short one. That, I understand, was the case in Norway some years ago.  The fishermen there had only a two-months' season, but, with the introduction of large fishing trawlers, they were able to do a good deal of deep-sea fishing, with the result that they are now able to fish during practically the whole year.  I wish to support the demand made by Deputy Johnson for more money for the fishing industry.  I think that the long sea coast-line we have in Ireland cannot be properly protected from foreign trawlers by the one boat that we have at the moment.  You would want at least three or four boats to protect the coast of Ireland, and I hope that in next year's Estimate more money will be provided for the Ministry of Fisheries, because I believe that with more money the Ministry would be able to do a great deal more to help the industry along.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that whatever nasty things I have to say about this Vote will ricochet off the Minister for Fisheries and strike the Minister for Finance, because I believe if the Minister for Finance gave the necessary means to develop the fishing industry in this country a mine of wealth, at present undeveloped, and lying idle, would be added to the resources of the nation.  Many suggestions have been made as to how we might develop the fishing industry, but perhaps before we follow out any of those lines it would be well to see what at the present time it is that is hampering the fishing industry and preventing it from developing.  First of all, there is a real lack of funds for which the Minister should make a demand, and ask the Dáil to support him in demanding an increase in the funds available for his Department.  The Minister said on many occasions that he cannot carry out the schemes put before him, that he cannot give the necessary gear or grant loans for the necessary gear, he cannot give the necessary loans asked for, and that he cannot make the necessary provisions for carrying out any of the projects put before him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, we have the international pirates and poachers, and he is not in <Col N="637" /> the position to deal with these.  They come in close to the western seaboard, and they take away what is in reality the property of the fisherman along these shores.  If at any time a foreigner came into this country and drove away the farmers' flocks and some of their herds, what would happen to that foreigner?  He would find himself in one of our jails, and rightly so.  But what happens on the occasions when some of the crews of these trawlers are caught?  What is the amount of the fines put upon them.  I am sure the Minister for Justice would have something to say to that also, because it is the duty of his department to see that people caught poaching within the territorial waters in this country are dealt with as people who poach in other matters are dealt with.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister for Finance and other members of the Executive Council read the daily press.  There they will find how poachers in other countries are dealt with, and what fines are imposed upon them, and what happens to their gear if they are caught in some countries like Norway.  Perhaps it would be no harm if a little of that medicine were dealt out to the French, Scotch, Belgian and English poachers that come to this country, and perhaps it might have the effect of keeping them nearer to their own country.  That is one thing that might be done.  Then there is the question of transport. That was dealt with to some extent by Deputy O Máille.  No provision is made to get the fish easily and cheaply to market, and of course no provision is made to get fresh fish to the markets in the country.  Instead of that, and of trying to get the fishing industry developed on practical lines, we find the Minister for Fisheries is endeavouring to impose an increased licence duty upon people who are trying to make their living by drift nets, and endeavouring to put more fishermen out of the way of making a living.  In reference to the Bill, he is at present putting through the Dáil, he did not, as far as I am concerned at least, justify that position.  I pointed out to him then, and I would like him to bear it in mind, that some ten years ago the cost of a drift net was about half what it is now.  The cost of the transport of <Col N="638" /> fish and the carrying of fish was about one-fourth of what it is now, while the price of fish, of salmon let us say, was about what it is now.  It has not proportionately increased with the cost of transport and the cost of drift nets, yet instead of reducing expenditure for the fishermen, and enabling them to make their living with their drift nets, the Ministry of Fisheries, for some reason or other, I suppose it is not for revenue, is putting on this increased tariff.</P>

The farmers, of course, will not agree, but they have an increased agricultural grant to meet increased rates to help to develop the farming industry. We have a tariff on other goods coming into the country to develop the home industry which produces these goods, but what has the Minister done to develop the fishing industry and to see that it is put on a proper foundation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming down to minor matters, and they are not so minor either, we come to the question of the destruction of fish by seals.  I endeavoured to bring that matter before the Minister on several occasions.  His Department evidently clings to the idea that the proper way to destroy seals is to follow them into their haunts and club them. I have discussed that matter with practical fishermen, and they differ entirely with the method advocated by the Minister.  They believe it is impracticable. The Minister told us that a Bisley marksman was sent down somewhere on the western coast and that he fired as many as one thousand rounds of <Col N="639" /> ammunition at something and that he thought he killed one seal.  Well, if the Bisley marksman was such a bad marksman as that he deserves the title that someone gave him as being a beastly marksman.  Surely it is not fair to allow the fish to be destroyed wholesale, as is being done by seals in different places without putting into the hands of the fishermen some means of disposing of these pests, and I think the Minister would be very well advised in harking to the advice of these people as to the real practical way of destroying these pests.  I do not think that his Department has considered the matter fully in all its aspects if he says that the proper way to destroy seals is to club them in their haunts.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters in connection with this Vote, but the main drawback in the development of the fisheries is the fact that the Department has not got sufficient funds.  Until something is done, and until some subsidies for the development of the fisheries are voted I think it is useless to ask the Minister to do more than he is doing with the funds at his disposal.</P>

      <P>I am entirely with Deputy O Máille in what he says deprecating the very small amount of money placed at the disposal of the Minister for Fisheries for the work he has got to do.  Considering the importance of the fishing industry to the country I think perhaps it is as important as the land if it was properly developed.  The fishing industry ought to be next in importance at least to the land.  It seems to me that whatever money there has been has been expended almost entirely upon deep sea fishing, so that the amount that is spent upon the inland fisheries, which really might, if properly developed, be a great source of income in the country, is so small that it looks as if nothing at all was being done for them.  I think there is something spent on them, and I think the Minister said that an increased sum was being given to the conservators.</P>

      <P>I think it would be money very well spent if spent in the development of the inland fisheries, which have been to my mind scandalously neglected in the past.  No one could travel through the country and not observe the lakes and the rivers that locally have great names for fishing and that are practically not used at all.  If people on the other side, and if Americans knew about these, and if there was proper accommodation for them, I am sure a great lot of money would be brought into the country, and I hope it will be possible for the Ministry of Fisheries and the Tourist Development Association to work together and ginger one another up in that direction, because I think in that way a vast amount of money could be secured for the country in the development of the tourist traffic.</P>
      <P>There are lots of places where the fishing is good, according to the local people, but there is no place for anybody to stay at.  The humblest abode is not available for tourists.  Something ought to be done.  We ought not to go to sleep, but we ought to see that something is done.  It is most unfortunate something is not done.  The neglect of these matters means the loss of hundreds of thousands of pounds to this country.  There are lots of places to be developed.  I think it is to our interests to see that more money should be at the disposal of the Minister in order that the inland fisheries may be developed.  When we hear people talking of fishing, it is generally deep sea fishing they are thinking of; the inland fishing is forgotten.  I think that three or four millions might safely be anticipated as a return from it.  Hotels, railways and so on would gain very large sums of money if this thing was properly done and if there was proper development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could quicken up the Tourist Development Association on the matter.  Something ought to be done.  There are lakes in Westmeath&mdash;I do not know whether they are being developed or not&mdash;that ought <Col N="641" /> to be a source of great revenue.  In the western districts all those rivers and lakes seem to me to be going to waste, and that ought not to be the case.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister what is being done to put down poaching. What are the conservators doing? There is no doubt that want of proper supervision in the past has been the cause of the deterioration in the river and the lake fishing.  There are a great many riparian owners.  Some take no care and the others take only a moderate care.  The consequence is that the rivers are neglected.  The Ministry ought to have a firmer hand over the rivers and lakes.  I do not want to suggest a plan, but something should be done.  I would like to know from the Minister, when he is replying, what has been done about the rivers and lakes. Is there any improvement from last year.  Matters should be quickened up, and I would like if the Minister would let us know what the conservators of the rivers and lakes have been doing during the past year.  What has been the result of their efforts, and have they any further schemes in hand for the future development and improvement of the rivers and lakes?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Fisheries referred to the loans made by the Department during the war period, and said that at the present time it was impossible to get either the interest or the principal of the sums outstanding; that, as a matter of fact, prices ruled high at the time, and inasmuch as a great decline has come in the value of the catches, that those persons to whom the loans were advanced are now unable to pay either the loans or the interest thereon to the Department. At the present time it would be well to review the loans in the light of the conditions prevailing.  As a matter of fact, while you have a certain nominal sum supposed to be an asset, the material sum represents exactly a certain market value.  It has depreciated in the hands of the fishermen through causes over which they had no control whatever.  I think that perhaps the best thing at this stage to be done is to come down to the present worth, and to strike a new loan and a new rate of interest.  That may seem somewhat <Col N="642" /> of a revolutionary proposal, but I am taking the view of it that the service of this Department is more or less benevolent.  It is more benevolent even than the Department of Agriculture or the Land Commission, because the Ministry of Fisheries has to deal with a much poorer section of the community. Those hard and fast principles which may obtain in Government departments are scarcely applicable here.  I think Deputy Redmond put forward the contention that the Department should be organised on more or less commercial principles.  I have to disagree particularly in the case of the Ministry of Fisheries.  You must take into consideration the function of the Ministry of Fisheries.  I submit that this Ministry has three functions.  It is educational in the first place, advisory in the second, and ameliorative in the third. The Department cannot accomplish miracles in a day or even over a long period of years.  You must take into consideration the human element they have got to deal with.  There is no doubt whatever that, owing to the poverty prevalent in the west of Ireland for generations, and the hardships the poor people there have had to endure, they have become disheartened.  This loss of manly spirit to some extent has become chronic, and the Minister and his Department have to face a very difficult and trying situation.  They have to educate people first in better methods of development.  They have to deal with people without spirit, who are badly educated, who have not the proper outlook on life.  The situation is very depressing.  It will take years, perhaps generations, before you can get a virile spirit instilled into the seafaring population of the western coasts. They are so broken in spirit through continual poverty that I fear for years to come it will take the greatest effort of the Department of Fisheries to deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is said that at the present time they were not even willing to go to sea. You have to re-create that desire&mdash;the seafaring instinct as it were.  You have got as well to put before them the technical side of fishing.  To what extent that has been done the Minister perhaps can tell us.  You want schools <Col N="643" /> and lectures in those areas.  Again you have to advise them as to the best market conditions.  Having got them to go far afield you have to instruct them as to the best market for the disposal of the fish.  This will make for amelioration of their position.  I submit, in endeavouring to give cheap gear and loans to solvent persons at a reasonable rate of interest, and above all in giving some protection on the ocean, you will improve the industry.  Very serious complaints have been made as to the persistent poaching by foreign trawlers.  It is not alone the catch they take away but the damage they do when they come inshore to the spawning beds that matters.  I am told that in several bays along the west the fish no longer spawn there, but have gone elsewhere.  The shoals no longer strike that part of the coast.  The law should be amended.  Nothing short of confiscating the trawler and the gear, and, in addition, imposing a stiff fine on the owners, or alternatively, giving imprisonment to the crew can meet adequately the situation.  I am sorry the Minister for Finance has held out against the granting of a second fishery cruiser.  As I said at the beginning, the ordinary principle of business cannot apply here.  The object must be to protect the living of hundreds of thousands of very poor persons.  This question of saving on all sides, or economising, has got to some extent to be relaxed in dealing with this question of the protection of fisheries on the western coast.  I hope that next year, or even before the fishery Estimates are introduced, a supplementary estimate will be introduced making provision for this cruiser.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wolfe raised a question with regard to our inland fisheries. Under the Land Act of 1923, the fishing rights of estates purchased automatically became vested in the Land Commission. There are a number of rivers throughout the Saorstát which are free. I do not think the Ministry of Fisheries has taken to heart the need of restocking some of those rivers and lakes with trout.  It is a question which could be very well considered.  To meet the influx of tourists into this country we <Col N="644" /> should, as far as possible, provide good fishing for them.  I think in many cases even the Government could, perhaps, take up those rivers on which the fishing exists and restock them and hold them as a National demesne.  That is possible.  I do not believe it will impose a very great charge on the Exchequer. The licences and permits for fish will more than pay for the maintenance. It would bring numbers of tourists into this country.  It is a question of prime importance to us.  If we are to have this country, as we are often told, a playground for Europe or for America, as Switzerland is, we must do those things.  In the poorest districts of the Scottish Highlands immense sums are paid by persons interested in angling.  I am told the owners of those rivers make tremendous profits annually from their fishery rents.  Is it not possible to do the same here?  There are rivers in the West and Midlands equally suitable for trout or salmon if we can only preserve them.  The Minister must take this question in hands in the near future.  I should like the Minister to state what is the original amount of those loans, and how much remains out on interest to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McBRIDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to follow Deputy Hogan in his theoretical views on fishing, particularly sea fishing. I am not at all surprised at the pessimistic tone of the Minister in introducing his Vote, because I can very well perceive that he is up against a dead wall.  The policy of this Government, as was the policy of every other Government in Ireland before, is practically opposed to the development of sea fisheries.  The policy of this Government is the creation of uneconomic farms.  The farmers do not mind as long as you spend millions and millions on the farmers and create and re-create small farms until one generation is actually eaten up by the following generation.  That is the policy of the Government.  No doubt, there are fish in the sea.  Within a short distance of the west coast of Ireland, there are three very rich fishing grounds.  One is amongst the richest in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is said that you have no sailors, and, therefore, that you cannot have <Col N="645" /> fish.  You can find sailor fishermen in any place, and as long as their home ports are in the Free State, it does not matter.  Deputy Johnson made reference to the spending of their money by these fishermen in foreign ports.  The Scotsmen do not do that.  They take millions of pounds from Central Europe, and I do not suppose that they spend 10 million farthings there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McBRIDE</NameTxt>
      <P>No; but they send their fish there&mdash;millions of barrels of them.  As far as patrol is concerned along the coast, there is more made about these foreign trawlers when they are caught than it really counts for. One fellow is caught trawling within the limits.  There is a lot about it in the papers, and he is fined £100 and has his gear forfeited.  But that might be only one case in six months.  One ship cannot patrol the coast effectively. If the Government cannot afford to procure the larger boats, three or four motor launches might do the work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMacBride" hpid="Mr. McBRIDE Mr. McBRIDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McBRIDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it has in some instances.  The Ministry of Fisheries should have at least £600,000 to subsidise the fisheries.  Capital, they say, is shy in every country, but it is much more shy in Ireland than in any other place.  You want energy and enterprise to make the industry a success.  So far as fish for consumption in inland towns in Ireland is concerned, that was killed by the Dublin economists.  In order to get fish marketed in the inland towns, you must have middlemen to buy from the fishermen.  They cannot sell themselves in these districts.  There have to be buyers who will send the fish away.  But the Dublin political economists put an end to that years ago.  They wanted to do everything themselves.  Buying and selling is a special trade, just as catching the fish is a special trade.  There is every opportunity to catch fresh fish in the three miles limit by the inshore boats, but the difficulty is to get rid of the fish.  There are no buyers.  Deputy <Col N="646" /> Hogan, of Clare, was exercised about a method of getting rid of seals.  He can get rid of them by poisoning one salmon and throwing it out.  It will kill more seals than a Bisley marksman. This is really a scientific Department, and though Deputy Redmond is anxious that it should be carried on as a commercial department&mdash;</P>

      <P>They all give you credit for saying so.  It earns its dividends by the results&mdash;the results from the scientific research carried on by these men all over the country.  I wish there was more scientific research.  The sea fisheries in Ireland are only value for about £300,000.  The Scotch fisheries are value for millions of pounds. The Scotch fishery patrol consists of six boats.  One of them is a lame duck, and another is engaged in scientific research. Of course it does the patrol work now and again, but it is fitted up for scientific research.  If the Dáil is inclined to expend as much on fishery cruisers as the entire value of the fishing industry, I will not object.  There are a certain number of unemployed men who will be employed if that is done.  There will also be a certain circulation of Free State money, but it will be like feeding the dog on his own tail.  If every man in his own district, instead of talking about poaching and trawlers and the theoretical development of fisheries, would do the work nearest to his hand as well as possible we would get on somehow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. EVERETT Mr. EVERETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the appeal made by Deputy Byrne on behalf of the Arklow fishermen.  The Arklow fleet is the premier fleet in the Saorstát, but I regret to say that a number of the boats are idle.  That is not because it is necessary to create a desire amongst the fishermen to go to sea.  It is simply because of the bad harvest in the fishing industry.  Owing to that, the Arklow fishermen, while paying the instalments due to the Government, have been unable to provide themselves with nets. Nets are required by them.  They made an appeal to the Department, and I am informed that the Department replied that they would be prepared to grant <Col N="647" /> them loans on the security of two sureties, but they stipulated that the sureties should be under 50 years of age. While the men were willing to get sureties, the men under 50 years were in the position of the men making the application.  The men with property were over 50 years, so that the fishermen were debarred by red tapeism of the Department from getting sureties. The Arklow boats, with their crews, have helped to promote the fishing industry, and while I give credit to the Department for assisting them on previous occasions, I would ask the Minister to waive these conditions, and not confine the sureties to men under 50 years of age.  Although there is only a small amount at the disposal of the Minister, I would appeal to him to consider the claim of the Arklow fishermen. There is a large number depending on the earnings of the fishermen, and there is a very small grant allocated to the benefit of the fisheries.  I would also support the idea of Deputy Connor Hogan when he says that the terms of the loans should be revised, or that the price of the ships should be put down at their present market value. Some years ago these men borrowed a large amount for these ships, and, through the fall of prices, depreciation has taken place to such an extent that these ships are not worth half the price which was paid for them.  If a certain sum was allocated for depreciation, the reduction in the amount required in repayments would afford some relief to the fishermen.</P>
      <P>There is £1,000 allocated for dredging.  Arklow Harbour would take that amount alone, not to speak of another harbour in the same constituency&mdash;Wicklow&mdash;which requires a very large grant at the present time. The condition of the quays and walls practically prevents boats coming into the harbour.  Deputy Wilson supported this claim, and Deputy Gorey will, no doubt, be surprised to learn that there is no division between Farmer, Government, or Labour Deputies on the question of giving a grant to Wicklow Harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister, when replying, to give us an account of the <Col N="648" /> moneys spent last year on the sea fisheries&mdash;how much was spent on salaries, insurance, and interest on loans.  I sympathise with the Minister in the treatment he has received from the Minister for Finance, and I agree with the other Deputies that one boat is not sufficient to patrol the coast at present.  At least three boats would be required, and I hope a vote will be taken on the question of assisting the Department by providing at least three boats for the protection of the fisheries of the Saorstát.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephMcGoldr" hpid="Mr. McGOLDRICK Mr. McGOLDRICK">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard a Deputy make the suggestion that Fisheries and Agriculture should combine. I do not agree that that is the best combination that could be made. I think fisheries should combine with Industry and Commerce, if they combine with any Department.  We have done something for agriculture.  We have pledged the credit of the State to emancipate the farmers from the thraldom of landlordism.  We have gone a certain distance on that very desirable road.  But here we are dealing with the second industry in importance in the State.  And here we have the Minister only permitted to set down a sum of £39,000 for its development.  I would ask if that is sane statesmanship? Does it suggest a sensible outlook on the situation?  Is it satisfactory to have the second most important industry in the State treated in such a fashion?  If developed, this industry would bring a revenue to the State that would be of more importance, perhaps, than all that is going to come to us through industry and commerce.  In the latest Budget we have industry and commerce subsidised to a certain extent, and protected, in order to enable them to put their house in order and develop that important branch of national activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While both these important elements in the country are being treated in this way, why is this particular service, or industry, to be strangled or starved?  It is a service that the small farmers and the poor people are most interested in. These poor people on the sea coast are perhaps the most excellent fishermen that could be had in any country.  They are not to have any consideration beyond the fact of an expenditure of <Col N="649" /> some £39,000 for development whatever it may mean, and it can only mean a fraction in connection with an industry of such importance and such scope.  I suggest that any financial view of the situation, that presumes to proceed upon lines such as these, is not a sound or a sensible way of dealing with a national situation of such importance as this.  There is no other industry, to my mind, with such prospective advantages from the point of revenue and employment.  Combined with the small farms which they hold, it will enable poor people on the coast-line to live at home and at the same time it will mean an inestimable revenue to the State.  I think that any financial outlook that surveys a national situation in this way is not at all a worthy one, and I would say that it should be taken up seriously by the Dáil and that all elements in the House should concentrate in order to rectify the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say, at the outset, that I have no sympathy at all with the view put forward in various quarters that the Ministry of Fisheries should not be a separate department, because I consider the development of fisheries is one of the most important things that the Government has to face in this country.  Prior to the establishment of our own Government, we heard a lot about fisheries from every platform, no matter of what political persuasion the speakers were.  I do object, at the moment, to a separate department, because of the fact that this department has not sufficient money at its disposal to do a proper job, so far as fisheries are concerned.  I think everybody will agree that £39,000 is not sufficient to develop fisheries as they should be developed, in order to aid them properly and put them on their feet.  I would like to have more information from the Minister as to what development here really means.  To my mind, it is merely a recurrent expenditure, with no result, year after year.  Nobody knows actually what is done with the money, and a great deal requires to be done.  What is being done is another matter, and whether there is sufficient money given in order <Col N="650" /> to have such a thing done is another matter too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, I think, has stated that a certain amount of depression prevails amongst the fishermen in various parts of the country.  Personally, I am not surprised at that, because very many of them have a loadstone around their necks in the shape of payment of interest and principal on the loans they had to get from the Ministry in order to secure boats.  I agree with Deputy Connor Hogan when he said that there should be a revaluation so far as these boats are concerned.  Business men all over the country, since the war, have had to cut their losses, and the Government will have to do the same thing sooner or later.  The sooner they approach it from that point of view the better.  It is very hard for men to plough the seas if they feel that most of their earnings will have to go to the Ministry of Fisheries.  I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider this position in so far as it affects the fishermen. I was very sorry to hear from the Minister once again that the Minister for Finance had refused to supply him with a patrol-boat, because, to my mind, one cruiser patrolling this coast is only wasting her time.  It would be necessary, I think, to have at least four cruisers, and unless the Minister for Finance does something in that direction during the year the money that is set down here for that purpose is merely wasted.  Day after day we have steam trawlers at our doors taking away the best of the fish and destroying the fishing grounds.  We have been told, from time to time, that while this is illegal for them inside a certain limit, they use nets that are illegal and take away the small fish along with the large fish, and there is nothing to prevent them.  The men in the Fishery Department know the requirements of the industry.  Yet we talk about being in earnest as regards the development of our fisheries.  We are not in earnest so long as the Minister for Finance refuses to place at the disposal of the Department at least two more cruisers to enable them to protect the fishing. I would like to ask the Minister what is being done, if anything, in connection with the oyster beds of this country. <Col N="651" /> So far as we can hear, the oyster industry was a big industry some years ago.  It is a very small industry now, except in a few places in Ireland.  I do know if there are oyster beds in other places to which no attention at all is being given.  I think the Minister will agree with me that if the oyster beds were looked after properly they would be a great source of revenue to this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has talked about curing stations.  He has satisfied Deputy Redmond, in giving a certain sum of money for a curing station in his constituency. I would like to appeal, on behalf of my constituency.  In the extreme SouthEast there is not a curing station at all. I do not think there is any curing station between Howth and Dunmore, with the result that I have known it to happen in Country Wexford, when there was a big catch of herrings or mackerel, they had to be thrown into the sea again, no station being available for curing these fish.  I would ask that some attention be paid to that particular area during the year.  Further, I would ask the Minister to make a strong representation again to the Minister for Finance, and I am sure he will have a majority of the Deputies with him, with a view to procuring an extra cruiser, or two cruisers, to enable the coast to be patrolled properly.</P>

      <P>In the debate on the Fishery Bill, the other evening, a statement was made that the inland fisheries in the Saorstát were potentially worth ten millions of money. I made a statement myself that the potential value of the sea fisheries might easily be fifteen millions, and that it would come next to the staple industry of the country&mdash;the great farming industry. This is the second time&mdash;once on the Estimates and once in a debate in 1923&mdash;that the question of fisheries has been discussed in detail by Deputies. Not one single advance has been made in providing a scheme to develop deep-sea fisheries, which are, admittedly, in a state of chaos.  The Minister for Fisheries has brought in a Bill which I hope will be successful in preserving the inland fisheries and developing their potential wealth, but in the <Col N="652" /> last eighteen months he has brought forward no proposals of a comprehensive kind to develop deep-sea fishing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Captain Redmond suggested that the Ministry of Fisheries should be amalgamated with the Ministry of Agriculture. Surely, if a Ministry of Agriculture is required, and undoubtedly it is, for the purpose of the agriculture of the country, the great industry of fishing, undeveloped as it is, requires a Ministry to look after it.  That goes without saying.  I think Deputies would be acting unwisely if they agreed to any such amalgamation.  I am perfectly aware of the difficulties that the present Minister for Fisheries has to contend with.  He inherited a large share of the chaos that exists in the industry. He meets with a natural stringency in the Finance Department.  At the same time, I think we have reached a stage now when the inland fisheries are to be developed, and when the deep-sea fisheries should be dealt with in some comprehensive way, and when a scheme should be either put before the Dáil or put into operation by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell and other Deputies who criticised the Minister's statement referred to matters which really had no bearing on this question. Deputy O'Connell advocated a publicity Department, to urge the value of fish as a food and to induce the Irish people to eat fresh fish.  We have not the fish, and why spend money on such an undertaking until we get our fish? The first thing is to obtain the fish, and for that purpose a scheme must be put forward that will enable the Minister and will enable the fishermen to obtain the fish and to have the trade properly developed.  Deputy Johnson, in advance&mdash;it was something prophetic probably&mdash;criticised the scheme which is at present before the Ministry.  It is very strange that in all parts of Ireland that I have recently been in, the views expressed by Deputy Johnson were expressed by the longshoremen who are battening on the chaos in the fishery trade, that the deep-sea fisheries developed by trawlers would not be a commercial success.  I hope Deputies will impress upon the Minister, if they agree with the scheme, that it should <Col N="653" /> be put at once into force in some practical way.  Six months ago, I think, the Deputies from the coastline constituencies of Ireland met privately in this House.  They discussed this question and obtained all the information obtainable about it, and they appointed a sub-committee to draw up a scheme that they might place before the Minister for his acceptance.</P>

      <P>They were practically from the congested areas, but there were Deputies from other places too.  The number of Deputies concerned was, I think, 30 or 32.  However, a sub-committee was appointed, and they drew up a scheme which is now in the hands of the Ministry of Fisheries.  I might tell the Dáil what the nature of that scheme is.  We found out that the system of fishing prevailing in this country was not altogether dependent on the equipment or upon the administration of the Fishery Department, but that the failure of fishing was largely due to the want of knowledge of the fishermen themselves.  It is manifest that any equipment which would be placed at the disposal of men who are unfit to use it will not improve the position.  We think that is justified by what happened in the case of loans. The Minister has explained that where a loan was given for equipment, it did not improve the fishing.  We, therefore came to the conclusion that a larger scheme, a scheme that would get rid of these difficulties in the way, would be necessary.  We found out, each in his respective area, that the deep-sea fishing was being pursued in our seas by Englishmen and Scotchmen, and even by Belgians and Frenchmen. We found, time after time, these trawlers coming hundreds of <Col N="654" /> miles off, as far as the coast of Arranmore. We assume that these men did not come for a change of air, that if it did not pay them they would not come such long distances, and that if the fish were not to be obtained there, they would not be there.  They are still coming.  For the last month I have been watching from the headlands of Donegal right along the coastline, and they are still fishing there.  They carry back their catches to their own country, where the money they realise is retained for the wealth of that country.  It is obvious that if we had the same opportunities of obtaining these fish for Irish ports, we would bring a great source of wealth into the Irish State.  Many of our fishermen are trained enough, probably, to follow trawling, but the great bulk remains to be taught yet.  The proposal we put forward would solve three or four things and it would solve them by way of an experiment without imposing on the Ministry of Finance any great expenditure.  We propose to charter from six to twelve modern English trawlers with equipment.  We would bring on these boats and charter them for a limited period&mdash;six to twelve months&mdash;and the scheme would be further developed.  We would bring with them a trained skipper and an engineer of the boat, and the rest of the crew would be put up from our own districts.  By that method we first would ascertain whether the fish are there, as everyone believes they are.  We would next ascertain whether they could be obtained in commercial quantities, and thirdly we would set up a system of transit by which it would be unnecessary to go into English or Scotch ports.  Deputy Johnson suggested a publicity campaign, but in my opinion it would not be necessary to organise a publicity campaign to tell the Irish people to eat fish, because, contrary to the general opinion, I believe the market can be found at our own doors.  Whether it can or not, we would set up a system of transit which would ensure that the value of this fish would be realised.  The object of this scheme would first be to train our fishermen; secondly, it would prove that fish were there, and could be made a <Col N="655" /> commercial success; and, thirdly, to set up a system of transit that would remove one of the biggest causes of chaos that exists in the present inshore fishing. Now, I gave a good deal of attention myself to getting expert and scientific information in the matter.  We find that in the herring fishing, which is the chief seasonal fishing in Ireland at present, and the chief source of wealth in fishing, the trouble is that the small boats cannot go to meet the shoals.  They have to wait inshore until the shoals break, and then they fish with what are called ring-nets. Ring-nets are like playing a game of pitch-and-toss.  One man with group-nets may ring the fish.  His next-door neighbour gets none.  In fact, it is considered an unholy way of fishing herring, and the proper and the scientific way is drift nets.  If we had our trawlers in the herring season, no trouble would exist in taking off the trawl and putting on a drift net so that we would meet all the herrings in the deep-sea shoal and get our full catch before the shoals broke.  We would help the inshore fishing in that respect, too, by diverting the fish inwards. Besides, there are several other consideration which I need not dwell upon.  One of them is that a very valuable fishing industry existed at one time, that is, line fishing.  On the coast of Galway, in patches, and away beyond Arranmore for ten miles, and round the coastline away to Rathlin, there are what are called sandbanks, on which a vast quantity of round fish, like cod and ling, are to be obtained.  That was such a valuable fishing at one time that I remember, when I was growing up, seeing local people bringing ten or twelve loads of these fish for sale on Sunday, and every one of them was sold.  The prices were small, but in those days everything else was of little value. Since the herring fishing began, this branch of the industry has been neglected altogether.  We propose on these trawlers, if these schemes take place, that we should place two or three men from the usual crew with long lines, to revive that branch of fishing.  In six, or eight, or twelve <Col N="656" /> months' time the experiment may be determined and we will make it a very small cost.  The cost will not be really over £5,000, even if the whole thing turned out a failure.  You will determine whether your deep-sea fishing can be made a success in Ireland or not, or whether there is money in the scheme.  At all events, we will be doing something to develop the value of our fishing industry, something to get it out of this chaos which has been existing, and does exist at present.</P>

They will have to be on shares on these boats, and they will remain out fishing, a thing they never did before.  There will be no half-week and they will have to remain out as the Scotch and Englishmen do.

We will have certain checks which will be announced later, so that everything will be carried on in a regular way.  We will make arrangements with the railway companies to get fish rates such as are given in England, that is, where we require the use of railways.  We will make it a condition that a certain amount of the catch will have to be disposed of or offered, at all events, to the districts through which the railway passes.  That is to say, in every one of the small towns right up to Dublin, if Dublin were our objective, they would be provided with fresh fish daily.</P>

      <P>I desire to ask the Minister, with all the force at my command, to endeavour to meet the proposals of this Committee which you have heard from Deputy O'Doherty. These proposals have been under discussion by this Committee of Deputies for some time, for six months I am sure.  The proposals have been put before the Department of Fisheries, and nothing has come out of them yet.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. WHITE Mr. WHITE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>You will pardon me; I was misled in that.  The suggestions that are put forward are such as should receive consideration from the Minister and from his Department, and should receive it at once.  There is another matter with regard to the provision of protection from the inshore fishermen. On the last occasion that these Estimates were debated, I put up a suggestion&mdash;I think it was backed by Deputy Cooper&mdash;that instead of providing a cruiser at a huge expense for the purpose of protecting the fishing grounds, motor boats with local crews provided on the same principle as the life-boat service, should be adopted. We believe along the Donegal coastline that that is a practical suggestion, and that if acted upon it would be a very effective means of checking poaching by these foreign trawlers.  There would not be such a huge expense involved in the provision of these motor boats, manned by local crews, as perhaps in spending £10,000 or £15,000 on the provision of a cruiser.  I understand the <Col N="658" /> present cruiser has been laid up about a fourth of the year getting repairs done.  I just noticed in the Estimates that £18,000 has been spent on the maintenance and the overhauling of the fishery cruiser for the past two years. The present cruiser has been laid up, I would estimate, for three months of the year.  She is ineffective during that period, and during that period thousands of pounds' worth of fish have been stolen by these foreign pirates who have invaded the inshore fisheries of the coastline of the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe, and other men who have more experience in the matter agree with me, that motor boats manned by local crews, organised somewhat on the lines of the life-boat service, would be far more effective to deal with this evil than a cruiser.  The expense involved in organising such a motor-boat service would not, I think, be very great, but even if it were not a great success, I think it would be worth the while of the Minister to try the experiment. Such a service could, I suggest, be effectively employed along the Donegal coast as well as on the Galway coast where, I understand, the poaching is just as fierce as it is up our way.  The scheme outlined by Deputy O'Doherty has great merits, and is well worthy of being considered by the Minister and his Department.  As the Deputy told the House, the sum involved in the scheme that he put forward is only £5,000, and even assuming that the scheme did not prove to be a success, I think the money devoted to it would be very well spent.  There is another matter to which I wish to direct the attention of the Minister.  I refer to the inadequate fines imposed by District Justices in cases where convictions are obtained against the masters of these foreign trawlers.  I would like to hear from the Minister what proportion of these fines has been collected.  I have been told that several fines imposed on these people have not been enforced at all, though considerable expense was incurred in instituting proceedings against them.  I have met some of the captains of these trawlers and they simply mocked and laughed at the fines imposed on them. What do they care about a fine of £100. <Col N="659" /> That is a very small sum to them, as they could make it in one night.  I would ask the Minister to tell us what proportion of the fines imposed on the captains of these foreign trawlers has been recovered.</P>
    <P>Deputy McBride, in the course of his speech, seemed to minimise the depredations that the foreign trawlers carry out along our coast-line.  I do not see any diminution or any decrease in the depredations which they are carrying out.  At the present time there are as many foreign trawlers working off the Donegal coast as there were two years ago.  They are still poaching along the coast with as much energy as they showed twelve months ago.  As regards the cruiser owned by our Ministry, I do not know anyone who ever sees it along the Donegal coast.  It paid one or two visits to the waters between Lough Foyle and Lough Swilly, but since then we have not heard anything about it.  It certainly has not been along our coast during the last three or four months.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cottage industries, there is now a great opportunity for developing, in the congested areas, a knitting industry.  I would strongly urge on the Minister that a big effort should be made to develop and to extend the knitting industry in the congested areas through Donegal, Galway and other parts of the Saorstát.  The development of this industry would provide much-needed employment for girls and women who at present have nothing to do.  I suggest that this could be made a most profitable industry, and that instructresses, familiar with its requirements, should be sent down to these congested areas to teach women and girls the use of the various machines that are employed in the manufacture of hosiery.  As a result of the tariffs imposed on wearing apparel by the Budget passed in this House last week.  I suggest that there are great possibilities before the knitting industry in this country.  I ask the Minister to give this matter his very serious consideration, so that the instruction of women and girls in the congested areas may be undertaken at once.  If that is done, I believe a great <Col N="660" /> amount of employment can be given in the manufacture of hosiery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. MURPHY Mr. T. MURPHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise merely for the purpose of drawing attention to one or two matters in connection with this question of illegal trawling.  It is probably over twelve months ago since a number of persons were caught carrying out illegal trawling in West Cork, in Bantry Bay and Dunmanus Bays. The discovery was made by the local people after a great deal of trouble and at much personal risk to themselves. The matter was reported to the Ministry, and after some time prosecutions were entered upon.  I am informed that now, owing to some irregularity in the summonses, the prosecutions were dismissed. I think it is unfortunate that, when an opportunity occurred of making an example of some of these foreign trawlers who had been captured by the local people, this failure on the part of the Ministry to secure a conviction should have taken place.  I am not saying that the fault was due to the Ministry, but I would urge on the Minister that if an opportunity again arises of bringing a prosecution against these foreign trawlers he should see that the preliminary steps are carried out in a proper way, and that there will not be a repetition of what occurred in the courts on the last occasion, when, on some technical objection raised by the defendants, the summonses were dismissed.  When the local people assist in capturing these foreign trawlers, it is surely the duty of the Ministry to see that the subsequent legal proceedings are properly instituted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the development of the fishing industry, I desire to make an appeal to the Minister for Finance.  He is not here at the moment, and I suppose it is useless to speak to the Minister for Fisheries, who has not quite a free hand in the matter of finance.  When one thinks over the potentialities of the fishing industry there are a few facts that force themselves on one's attention.  In this country, fish as a food is used to a less extent than, I suppose, in any country that we know of.  For instance, kippered herrings are only used to a very <Col N="661" /> small extent in this country.  I believe that the Minister is trying to start a curing station for kippered herrings down at Dunmore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a station there already for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>The curing of kippered herrings in this country could, I suggest, be developed into a great industry.  Under the Budget introduced last week we were asked to subsidise industries to the extent of £600,000 or £700,000. Here is an industry with bigger potentialities, one which can be made productive of more wealth, and which will employ more people than any of the industries on which we have cheerfully decided to spend more than half a million of money, and yet nothing is being done for it.  The food value of herrings is not understood by the great majority of people in this country. When I was a boy, and the same is true of to-day, it was considered an insult if you put a herring before people for a meal.  I remember the time when men actually left their employment because herrings were put before them for their dinner.  Even educated people do not realise the value of herrings as a food.  I know it for a fact that there are people who would consider it a degradation if they were to be seen by anyone eating herrings for their dinner.  It is not in every hotel in England where you can get kippered herrings.  As a matter of fact, you can only get them in the best hotels, and as most people will agree, I think, they are the very nicest things you could get for breakfast.  You will scarcely get them in any hotel in Ireland. You may in Dublin, but in the country you will not get them, and in the country no one will ask for them except, perhaps, a commercial traveller or someone like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There, I say, you have one big field for development.  A considerable amount of money goes out of this country to foreigners for food stuffs. I suppose millions go out every year, and yet, here at our own doors, we have a most valuable article of diet absolutely wasted and not appreciated.  If <Col N="662" /> an industry were set up in this country for the curing of herrings it would provide a vast amount of employment and would bring a degree of wealth into our country that would help us to set our national balance sheet right.  You cannot promote a big industry of that kind by merely spending a few hundred pounds on it. There is no use in tinkering at the subject.  If curing stations for kippered herrings are to be a success and are to bring us the wealth that is potential in the development of the industry, we must do things in a big way.  Stations properly equipped with machinery should be set up in every area where there is a field for their employment, and the most up-to-date methods should be adopted in the curing of the herrings.  The people of the country generally would also need to be educated as to the high food-value of these kippered herrings.  The instructors employed by the Country Committees of Agriculture should be given directions to lecture to the people as to the food-value of fish.</P>
    <P>If we are going to have protection for deep-sea fishing or for incoast fishing let us have it, but we are not going to get protection by having merely one cruiser.  It is only a joke to say that a single vessel could afford adequate protection.  Everyone knows that it could not do the work.  I am not an authority on the matter, but I venture to suggest that the work of protection could be more effectively done by motor boats than by the cruiser we have.  The motor boats, I think, could deal with all the enemies that we and the fishermen have to contend against.  There is no doubt but that the motor boats could get to places which cannot be approached by the cruiser.  The motor boats would help to deal with such pests as seals, and I think they could also be employed effectively to deal with the poachers.</P>
    <P>Inland fisheries, such as Deputy Wolfe referred to, have been almost destroyed during the troubled times. As I stated in this House before, gangs went along the rivers, from village to village, wherever they could get accommodation, and used dynamite and gelignite and killed all the fish, little <Col N="663" /> and big in the different reaches of the rivers.  When they had finished in one place they went on to another, five or six miles down the river, and carried on their work there, with the result that salmon spawn and trout of every description were killed wholesale. Trout of any size were taken away. The little fish were left to rot, as food for crows and magpies which I have, myself, seen eating them.  It may be that a proper examination will have to be given to those rivers, not to the larger rivers where there is a good flow of water which prevented them being treated in this way.  It was only the smaller rivers that were made the happy hunting-ground of those people.  Things may have righted themselves in some rivers, but efforts should be made to ascertain the position.</P>
    <P>With regard to fishing tourists, there is accommodation provided in some centres that cater specially for them, such as Killarney, the Shannon district and the Blackwater district.  But in numerous other cases there is no catering at all.  If a fisherman wished to visit those places, in addition to his rod he would also have to bring with him his hotel.  I want to impress on the Minister for Finance what I said before, that this is much more important than any other industry you can protect.  The development of the fisheries will mean more than any other industry.  Thousands of people are asked to subscribe, and will have to subscribe, in connection with readymade clothing, and when you take into consideration the amount in regard to boots, the sum will run well over £1,000,000.  I say that is mis-spent money compared with the amount of money that can be realised by building up the sea-fisheries.  But it is no use merely wasting money on the matter, and you have been wasting money on it up to now.  A different scheme will have to be put into operation.  You have been only tinkering with it up to now.  Deputy O'Doherty has outlined a scheme, big and worth talking about, something to be developed on a big scale instead of talking about the price of boats and the amount of loans. <Col N="664" /> You never will get anywhere if you do not try to meet this fishing question, as other countries have met it, in a big way, and not to be tinkering at it as you have been for years past.  I hope the Ministry will realise the bigness of this and other resources which are at hand, if they only get to work and develop them.  See what it would mean in our national food bill.  See what it would mean in national wealth. See what it would mean in providing employment for the people of the country.  These are three or four aspects of this question that cannot be neglected in the development of this industry which will give a more splendid return for the money spent.</P>

      <P>In order to emphasise the arguments which Deputy Gorey put forward, I wish to give a few figures to show the possibilities of one little part of Buncrana in Tirconnail, from the month of January this year.  For the month of February 4,928 crans of herrings were taken and were sold for £3,870 3s. 0d.  In January there were 3,413 crans sold for £5,217 11s. 7d., and at the same time there were sold 11,611 cod fish, and 8,095 coal fish, making a total of 19,706.  Now, the value of all these amounted to something over £11,000. It shows what you can get in these two periods of January and February, and what a possibility there is in this particular industry, if we only look after it not from a narrow point of view, but envisaging it as it should be envisaged, as a most valuable industry.</P>

      <P>Just one word about something that has not been spoken of yet in this connection.  We have heard about the need for having the fisheries developed.  I would remind the House and the Minister that there is a big population of fishermen without boats and without money at the present time.  As the Minister has only received £39,000 for his Department, I do not suppose that he would make much loans out of that.  The <Col N="665" /> mackerel and herring fishing starts on the west coast now, and it is the most important fishing on the west coast. The people who usually engage in it are not in a position to engage in it at the present time on account of the bad seasons of the last few years.  I appeal to the Minister to do his best with the Minister for Finance to see that these poor men get loans on the easiest terms possible.  What I mean by the easiest terms is in regard to the securities they have to get.  These men are required to get others to go security for them when they want loans, but they can only get these securities in the districts where they live, and one man is as badly off there as another, and will not be taken as security for another.  I ask the Minister to go into this and plead for further grants for his own Department. Otherwise he will not be able to help these poor people.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that it has been put to the Executive Council in this discussion that they should either abolish the Fishery Ministry altogether or should take it up in earnest and make an attempt to give this great industry a chance.  Certainly the Minister might be afraid to go into too much expense, but could he possibly get better encouragement than he has received in this discussion? I was delighted to listen to the speech of the leader of the Farmers' Party. The farmers, as we all know, pay most of the taxes, but when they see the possibility of a big industry being developed they are usually not afraid to pay taxes.  What better encouragement could the Executive Council or the Ministry get than the advice given to them by Deputy Gorey to go ahead and try and develop this great industry? I am sure many Deputies in this House read, as I did, that very interesting pamphlet issued recently by a good Irishman, Lord Dunraven.  He has always taken a great interest in the Irish fisheries.  He pointed out the great possibility of the development of the Irish fisheries and he goes on to give figures to show what is realised from fisheries in Ireland and in other countries, and the contrast would be <Col N="666" /> enough to make an Irishman blush if he did not know the historical reason for our present humiliating position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take Spain.  Spain has not a reputation for being a great industrial nation, but Spain makes £17,000,000 a year out of its fisheries, while the Free State does not make half a million.  I hope the Executive Council and the Minister for Finance will be more generous in supporting the Ministry of Fisheries.  On the other hand, I do not think that a great deal of expense can be indulged in at once.  The Irish fishery industry unfortunately is in a poorer way than most people realise and it cannot spring into great strength all at once.  It will have to creep before it walks.  The position of the fishing ports along the western shore is very deplorable.  They are lacking in equipment, lacking in boats, and lacking in other things, and it will take a long time to build up the industry to any sort of a decent level.  I cannot understand those who talk of abolishing the Ministry.  Certainly if there was any Ministry which has its work cut out for it it is the Ministry of Fisheries.  We want the Department there to go on thinking of this great industry and planning for it and working for it.  It will take years.  We only export fish to the value of three or four hundred thousand pounds.  Our imports of fish, also, are remarkably small.  It appears we only import about £100,000 worth of fish.  That supports the argument put forward by Deputy Gorey when he told us that we are not a fish-eating people, although we have Fridays and more fast days than most other people.  There are great possibilities in this industry, and fishermen realise it, and I am sure that if there is money given to the Minister for Fisheries he will make good use of it. It is very humiliating to read about the foreign trawlers coming to our shores, and then getting away free after doing damage.  That is not what they do in Iceland; there they take proper measures and they lock up the offender in prison and keep him there until they bring him to trial.  If that was done here it would be a different story.  Why should such an offender not be put in prison until he pays the fine?  I think <Col N="667" /> the £100 fine in a case of that kind should be given to the captor, and even that fine should be increased.  It is a shame to see these poachers getting off with impunity.</P>

      <P>Like most of the Deputies who spoke on this Vote, I am of opinion that the amount allocated to the Ministry of Fisheries is inadequate, and I think the Minister for Finance should be approached to increase that sum.  Almost every phase of the fishing industry has been referred to by the Deputies here this evening, but I think an important phase has escaped notice; that is sprat fishing.  I think that would concern the southern coast principally.  Large quantities of sprats are taken there throughout the fishing season, and it invariably happens that they have to be thrown back into the sea, as there is no transport available to take them to a suitable market.  I suggest, in connection with that, that some sort of canning station should be established at a suitable point.  The waste of food I refer to occurs at Passage East, in the County Waterford.  If it is not possible to erect a canning station there, perhaps one could be erected in connection with the kippering station in Dunmore, and the cost of transport from Passage East to Dunmore would be slight.  I would like if the Minister would again consider that matter and see whether it would not be possible to do something in that line and either have transport facilities afforded for conveying the sprats inland or an arrangement made whereby they would be utilised in some way as human food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the loans for equipment.  There is great necessity for proper equipment.  The equipment is, at the moment, quite inadequate and is responsible to a great extent for the hopeless condition of our fishery business.  It will continue that way unless the Minister for Fisheries is prepared to give suitable loans to the fishermen.  In addition to that, I suggest also that a suitable course of <Col N="668" /> instruction be given, because while these men are sincere about following their trade or business, they have not sufficient knowledge of up-to-date methods of fishing.</P>

      <P>Before I address myself to answering the different points raised, it is due to me to express my gratitude for the way Deputies have dealt with the Estimate of my Department. Their criticism of the Department has been extremely helpful, and all I regret is that the Minister for Finance was not here during the whole debate.  However, I will take steps to bring all that has been said under his notice, because I think it is absolute proof that there is a demand from the whole country, and even from every class in the country, that more money should be made available for our fisheries. At any rate, it is perfectly clear, from what has been said from the different parts of the House, that there is a general demand for at least one other fishery cruiser.</P>
      <P>Coming to the different questions asked, Deputy Byrne and Deputy Everett wanted to know the amount of money spent last year by the Fishery Department on sea fisheries, as distinct from river fisheries.  The figures are, for sea fisheries, £20,051 and £9,041 for patrolling.  They asked, secondly, how much was spent on salaries, insurances and interest on loans.  No salaries are included in that.  Wages only are included.  I have not the exact figure, but insurance cost £5,172 and the interest on loans was nil, as the Department does not pay interest.  They asked what residue, if any, was spent in actual development work and in what manner.  £14,324 was spent on development work.  Loans came to £3,294.  Purchase of nets and sale of barrels came to £3,284.  Repairing boats and engines came to £1,618 Instruction in fisheries, etc., came to £2,298.  Dredging of harbours comes to £783.  That answers the point made by Deputy Wilson, because that £783 was spent in dredging Arklow Harbour. Various small schemes come to £3,047.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Deputy Byrne and Deputy Everett referred to the pressure by the Department on the fishermen in trying <Col N="669" /> to collect outstanding loans.  The demands go out automatically at certain periods of the year for payment of instalments.  As a matter of fact, we have not been anything like harsh with any of the borrowers in any part of the country.  Dredging, as a whole, is a matter for the Board of Public Works.  The £1,000 for my Department is merely where dredging is done specifically for the fishing industry. Dredging of harbours is done for ordinary commerce as well as for fishing, and where dredging is not done specifically for the purpose of helping the fishing industry, it does not fall on my Department.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Redmond took exception to the way&mdash; perhaps with a certain amount of justification&mdash;in which the items in the Estimates were set out.  There is no reason why they should not be set out in greater detail.  I think the objection was the greater cost of printing. Next year I can have the items set out in more detail.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell also raised a question as to the development of the home markets.  In considering the development of the inland markets, one has to take into consideration the fact that here we have a scattered population.  We have not the big centres of population that exist in England.  Our population is scattered and, therefore, the inland market will be limited.  No matter what you do it will be always a very difficult thing to get at.  We have been trying to do something about it.  One of our superintendents has been round seeing the possibilities in certain towns and trying to get the better type of shopkeeper to take up the sale of fish.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell raised the question of the Arran steamer.  It seems strange that this should appear under fishery development.  It is not, in any sense, an item for fishery development.  It is an inheritance from the Congested Districts Board.  They contributed towards this steamer, which was more for helping communication between the islands and the mainland than for any specific fishery purpose.  The Coshla scheme is under consideration.</P>
    <P>I think I need scarcely refer to <Col N="670" /> Deputy Redmond's point, that because we had only £106,580 to expend, £23,412 was entirely too much to spend on salaries.  Deputy Johnson, I think, dealt with that effectively.  The ratio of salaries to the total vote does not arise, because Government Departments, administering ordinary Government duties, cannot be judged by their turnover on the money spent.</P>
    <P>I have been in communication with the Department of Education in connection with publicity and instruction in the schools.  A good deal could be done in the schools by devoting some of the time spent on object lessons, and matters of that kind, to little lectures on fish as a food.  During the present year something will probably be done in that direction.  With regard to general publicity, that is being tried in America and in England at present. There is an &ldquo;Eat-more-fish&rdquo; campaign there, and when we see the result of it we will probably take it on here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson says, with a good deal of soundness, that we might succeed better by concentrating on helping the inshore men with the smaller type of boats than in going in for big schemes of steam trawling. I will deal with Deputy Doherty's suggestion later.  There is a great deal in Deputy Johnson's point of view, but at the same time we must remember that these small boats used on the west coast are necessarily restricted in their operations, because of weather conditions, and are often not able to get to sea.  Then, they are more used as a sort of supplement to a little holding.  They are used by the half-farmer-half-fisherman, and, in themselves, they hardly enable a person to make a livelihood.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson asked me about the constitution of the International Council for the Study of the Sea, for which £400 is provided as our contribution in the Estimates. It is composed of representatives of States.  Each State appoints a representative from its Fishery Department to sit on this Council, and the State contributes to the cost.  The bigger countries pay £500, and the smaller countries something less.  A member of the scientific staff of my Department is a member of the International Council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> Deputy Johnson also raised a question as regards rural industries and what they were exactly.  I am not quite clear as to what exactly he wants to find out.  When started first, we take it for granted that they will be a considerable charge on the State, but we work towards making them eventually self-supporting.  Some of them are actually self-supporting.  Others, for various reasons, are not.  As I have pointed out, last year we closed down six, which the turnover did not justify us in continuing.  I am rather inclined to continue that policy of closing down, if they are not being properly taken advantage of.  Deputy White referred to the extension of these classes in certain places where there is a general demand. If we find in any district that there are a number of girls who would attend these classes and avail of the advantages which they offer, we are prepared to start classes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan, of Clare, raised three or four points about the loans.  I have provided £7,000 for inshore men for the year.  That is, of course, subject to financial control.  Except in the case of very small loans, we have to go in each case to the Department of Finance for sanction to the issue of a loan. Some Deputies raised a question as to securities.  I am not prepared to advocate any change in the present policy &mdash;that is that two solvent securities be required for each loan.  If a man is not able to get two persons to come along and back him with their names, it is fair for us to assume that that man is not reliable, and that we would not be justified in giving him State money. Deputy Hogan raised again the question of shooting seals which I dealt with on the Second Reading of the Fishery Bill, and also in reply to a question that day.  Where the fishermen think that shooting is the best thing, well and good.  Whenever fishermen apply for a permit for a rifle to the Department of Justice and let me know that they have done so, I always recommend the Department of Justice to grant a permit for the rifle. That has been done in a great many cases throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>The fisherman himself will have to buy his rifle and ammunition. I merely recommend the Department of Justice to give him a permit for a rifle.  If he thinks it is worth his while to go to the expense of shooting one seal, that is his business.  Deputy Wolfe raised the question of inland fisheries, and whether any money was being spent in that way.  As I pointed out in my opening statement, £10,000 is being devoted to helping inland fisheries in various ways.  Furthermore, the Bill which was read a second time a few days ago, is entirely directed to that end.  We have, I think, done a good deal towards encouraging tourists to come to this country by the publication of the <i>Angler's Guide,</i> which is being bought a good deal in Great Britain, Belgium, France and other countries.</P>
      <P>The Deputy wanted to know what the conservators are doing to put down poaching.  I think myself that a great advance has been made in the past year in that direction.  Every day cases are before the courts and pretty stiff fines are being imposed for infringing the fishery laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say what number of prosecutions were successful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say, offhand. Normally they are successful.  The Fishery Bill will help to tighten up things in that direction.  It will give the conservators more funds to employ a better type of bailiff, or a greater number of bailiffs, while at the same time it will give me authority to supervise the working of the boards.  Deputy Gorey raised a question regarding the protection of inland fisheries.  The same answer applies to both.  Several Deputies raised the question of the <Col N="673" /> outstanding loans.  That is a question I do not quite like to deal with.  It is a matter that is under consideration.  I do not like dealing with it here, because it may result in the holding up of the payment of instalments.  It is a matter, of course, that will have to get very careful consideration by the Finance Department, because a considerable sum of money is involved.  Outstanding, at the moment, there is about £140,000, of which about £70,000 is in arrears.  I agree that in many cases these arrears are due to the fact that the boats and gear were bought in the boom years at prices beyond their real worth, and I am satisfied that the boats that we have at present on hands should be re-valued and brought down to something like their present-day value.  They should not remain at the value that we have them at in our books.  We have boats in our books priced at £2,000 and £3,000, whereas if they were put on the market to-day they would not realise more than £300 or £500.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connor Hogan wanted to know what was done in the way of restocking rivers with trout.  We do not do very much in that way, but we get some trout fry from Scotland, mostly for the Westmeath lakes.  He suggested that the revenue from the licences for trout rods should be devoted towards that.  The fact is that there is no licence for trout rods, as I pointed out the day before yesterday.</P>
      <P>Most of the Deputies directed their remarks towards the point that there should be more finance in the Department. Of course, I agree with that. As I pointed out when I started to reply, I am sorry that the Minister for Finance was not here at the time. Deputy Corish asked us if we were doing anything with regard to the oyster beds.  In the past year we have given certain assistance in the Shannon, Galway Bay, and the Lee Estuary. The technical advice and help of the staff of my Department are always available for persons interested in the oyster industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out, I only received Deputy O'Doherty's scheme this morning. Of course, it is a matter that we will have to carefully consider.  I am <Col N="674" /> certainly not going to commit myself to an acceptance of it at the moment, but it is a thing that I will go into with the Deputy, or anybody else on this Committee.  I can see considerable difficulty in the way of this thing being a success, but perhaps these things had better be discussed with the Committee when they come before me some time next week.</P>
    <P>Deputy White, Deputy Gorey and some others, suggested that small motor boats at different parts of the coast would be more effective than, say, another fishery cruiser.  They certainly would be a great deal more expensive if you have to pay the wages of the men engaged on them.  It would run into a considerable sum.  I do not agree with the suggestion, for the reason that a boat that has got to deal with these trawlers must be able to go out to sea in weather in which the trawlers are able to go out, and small motor boats would not be able to do that.  Some of the places where there is illegal fishing are considerable distances from the shore.  They are not always within the three-mile limit.  We have extraterritorial waters where fishing is prohibited, extending out perhaps, 10, 12 or 15 miles, and some places more.  You have such places in Waterford and Donegal Bay.  Small motor boats would not be able to go out these distances in rough weather. There is no use in their seeing boats illegally fishing if they are not able to go out to take sufficient soundings, and so on, to prove their case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so, in the light of the fact that they would not be able to go out to sea in the weather in which trawlers would be able to fish.  At any rate, I want to concentrate at present all my energy in trying to get the Finance Department to give me another cruiser.  I believe that three are really necessary to do the work efficiently, but I would be thankful even for the extra one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy White raised a question of considerable importance, that is the question of fines.  A legal difficulty has arisen over the collection of these <Col N="675" /> fines, fines imposed on boats caught fishing in those places I mentioned outside the three-mile limit, but within by-law areas.  The matter is still in the hands of the Chief State Solicitor, and I am informed that there are certain very involved questions connected with the subject.  It needs, therefore, very careful consideration. Certain fines, of course, have been collected in respect of vessels like French lobster vessels.  These are arrested, and they pay before they are allowed away.</P>
    <P>I answered Deputy White already about an instruction class.  The number of our instructors is very limited, but where there is a general demand we will, as far as possible, try to establish some more of these classes. As regards the question of sprats, the markets in the south are poor.  The catches are intermittent and small, and canning would hardly pay unless larger and more constant supplies can be assured.  The instruction of fishermen is undertaken by the Department.  A sum of £2,250 is provided.  I mentioned that in my opening statement. The more modern methods of fishing followed in other countries should be studied by our fishermen.  We issue, experimentally, types of gear that have been tried in other countries.  A type of gear that is successful in one country may not always be quite as successful in another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMacBride" hpid="Mr. McBRIDE Mr. McBRIDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McBRIDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask if the Minister would consider the suggestion of Deputy O Máille in relation to the running of a steamer between Kilronan and Coshla.  The Galway Steamship Company receives £1,100 a year, practically £20 a week.  That pays a good portion of their expenses, and I presume they also receive a subsidy from the Post Office for the carrying of mails.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH.</NameTxt>
      <P>I actually dealt with the Galway steamer business, but the Deputy was not here.  It is a thing that I inherited from the C.D.B. and it has nothing really to do with fishery development.  It was something that was done by the C.D.B. to open up communication with the Arran Islands, <Col N="676" /> to bring their stock to the mainland, and so on.  The Coshla Bay scheme is still under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>It might help the discussion on this Vote if I make a short preliminary statement.  There are in use throughout the State, eight prisons and one Borstal Institution.  The daily average of prisoners in some of the country prisons is comparatively small. In the year ending 31st March last, the average for Dundalk was 37, for Galway 45, for Waterford 49, and for Limerick 54.  These were the daily average population.  In these prisons which I have named, Dundalk, Galway, Waterford and Limerick, it is necessary to maintain a governor, a medical officer, chaplains, and a staff of warders.  It might be considered that it would be a saving, in addition to the convict prison at Maryborough, to have one large prison for each province, say, Mountjoy for Leinster, Cork for Munster, Sligo for Connaught and Donegal.  On examination, that would not work out as an economy.  The population of the State is scattered and the railway facilities are not always convenient. The hardships of conveying prisoners long distances in winter and in inclement weather are obvious, and it was found, on examination, that against the saving, not a very large saving, in establishment, the cost of a large increase to the Gárda Síochána for escort purposes would have to be put to the cost of conveyance.  Then, in the case of remands for short periods, and committals for trial, it would be difficult for prisoners to arrange for their defence if sent far away from their friends and legal advisers.  That is one of the points urged against the reduction of prisons before several Prisons' Commissions. Then there is the case of short sentences, from seven to fourteen days, for minor offences and where persons cannot or are not prepared to pay fines and prefer to serve a term of imprisonment. Naturally, the Justice would consider the hardship and expense of sending prisoners long distances for short terms in the absence of a convenient local prison.  In that way a situation would be brought about where there would be almost immunity for lesser infringements of the criminal law.  That would be a serious matter because it is often through small beginnings of that kind that people graduate to more serious forms of crime, and anything in the nature of immunity or comparative immunity for small offences would react badly, I believe, on our general social welfare. This matter was discussed before a Commission and there was only one remedy suggested, that is the establishment of police lock-ups throughout the country.  There was considerable opposition to that proposal Mr. Parnell and the late Dr. Sigerson both <Col N="679" /> opposed it strongly before the Commission and pointed out that there were serious objections, and I think there are serious objections, to untried persons being left in the care of police while awaiting trial.</P>
      <P>Considerations of that kind led us to believe that there is really very little room at present for the reduction of prison establishments, but reductions will be made wherever and whenever it is considered feasible.  The number of warders employed on the nine prisons in use at present has increased from 223 in 1914 to 259 in 1925, although the daily average number of male persons in custody in these prisons is 802 as against 1,002 in 1914.  That increase is due to the introduction of the 8-hour day in 1919, previous to which the warders' working day was ten hours.  The industrial argument, that you can get as much done in eight hours as in longer spells of work, does not apply to the special work of prison warders, because the warders must be on duty or the prisoners must be locked up for longer periods than would be justifiable.</P>

      <P>No, there is no standard output.  I just want to touch briefly on a matter that we were urged to consider and that is the question of a prison at Letterkenny.  Certain Donegal Deputies had an idea that a good deal of money is wasted sending Donegal prisoners to Sligo jail.  We did consider the question of establishing a small prison at Letterkenny last year, and the following conclusions were arrived at.  The daily average number in custody would probably not exceed fifteen and the following staff would be required as a minimum:&mdash;a chief warder, four warders, three wardresses, one medical officer, and one chaplain.  The saving under the heading of escort and conveyance on the establishment of such a prison would be about £284 per annum.  The approximate annual cost of the proposed new establishment would be about £1,400 per annum and the project was dismissed on these grounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>I thoroughly approve of the Minister's decision with respect to the establishment of a prison at Letterkenny, seeing that it is not an economic proposition.  I am prepared to accept the Minister's assurance that the economy is on the other side and I do not, therefore, wish at the moment to press for the establishment of a prison at Letterkenny. However, there is another matter to which I wish to refer.  There is some difficulty under the Judiciary Act under which, when persons are arrested for certain offences, the Peace Commissioners have no authority to give bail.  The result is that if the District Justice is not available the person has to be sent to jail.  In our county which is very scattered, the District Justice may be sixty or seventy miles away or more, at a Court, when a man is arrested.  It would be impossible for him to attend to consider the case, consequently, the man has to be brought before a Peace Commissioner. That Peace Commissioner can only detain him twenty-four hours, but he cannot admit him to bail.  Therefore he has to be sent a distance of seventy miles in some cases to the prison at Sligo, at the cost of a motor service, and he has to be brought back to be tried by the District Justice.</P>
      <P>I think there is some defect in the Act when it is not permitted to the Peace Commissioners to exercise a discretion in these cases and take bail when the next court day is near at hand. If the Peace Commissioners were given that discretion, the expenses incurred and, in my opinion, unnecessarily incurred, in conveying prisoners on remand to Sligo Jail, a distance of 70 miles, and in bringing them back the next day or two days later, could be avoided.  That is the point that I wish to impress on the Minister, and I suggest that big economies could be effected if what I ask were done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister has not finally closed his mind with regard to the question of the amalgamation of the jails.  A good deal has happened since the Commission sat which inquired into the suggestion before <Col N="681" /> Motor cars are used more freely now than they were then.  I think the instance which the Minister himself gave about Letterkenny, and the facts that he gave about it, are in themselves a strong argument in favour of amalgamation. I did not catch all the figures which the Minister quoted, but from what he did say he has failed to convince me that there will not be a great saving in doing away with a lot of these smaller jails.  I think it would be an advantage to the localities in which these smaller jails are to have them removed altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>When you think of the staff, the cost of lighting and heating and their upkeep generally, it must be admitted that these are very expensive establishments.  Under a scheme carried out during the last two years or so, hospitals and unions have been amalgamated. The central hospitals that have now been established are provided with motors, and why should not the large jails have a number of motors attached to them.  A shilling telegram would bring a motor from the jail to the town where the court was being held.  The escort could travel in it, and take the prisoner back to the jail. A scheme of that kind would, I believe, effect a great saving of public money. It would be better, too, for the prisoner. The only thing that weighs with me is the point that the Minister made, namely, that the prisoner would be away from his solicitor.  The suggestion is, that the prisoner would not have an opportunity of consulting his solicitor or his friends.  That is a point certainly against the reduction of the number of jails, but I think that point could be met by bringing the prisoner to the local barracks where he could meet his solicitor some time before the trial took place.  Certainly, a great saving could, I think, be effected by doing away with these smaller jails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think also, though this is a big question, that the Minister should give some thought to the reformation of those jails.  The system carried out in them is a very old one.  It was conceived at a time when people revelled <Col N="682" /> in punishment.  It is a debasing and a degrading system.  Other countries have devoted a lot of thought to prison discipline and prison treatment.  They have softened it down and humanised it.  Our system, which we have inherited from the British, needs a great deal of softening down and of humanising. It is simply awful the way some prisoners are treated under this system. A lot of these offenders are men not of very strong mind.  Imagine, therefore, these men spending most of the day and the night in a cell by themselves. Weak as their minds are before they go in, this treatment tends to drive them to insanity.  I spent unfortunately a good many months listening to their talk, and I certainly came to the conclusion, from listening to them, that the jail system, as at present, needs a great deal of improvement. The Minister up to this had a great many things to attend to, and I admit had no time to inquire into reforms in the present system.  I do hope he will keep it in mind, and that our system in the Free State will be brought up to date and on a level with the more humane system which prevails in other countries.</P>

      <P>There is only one matter that I think it advisable to raise now, and I am doing so in order to give the Minister an opportunity of stating exactly what the position is.  I refer to the rumours which have been going around during the last few weeks as regards some trouble at Portlaoighise prison.  Stories have been told as to trouble having arisen there out of the reading of an Episcopal pronouncement in the prison chapel, and as to what happened afterwards.  Perhaps the Minister would avail of this opportunity and tell us exactly what the trouble was, and what the position there is now.</P>

      <P>As regards sub-head (h)&mdash;Rent, I would like to have an explanation from the Minister as to that. What, I ask, does rent signify?  I understood that all prison property was State property.  I would also like to have an explanation as regards sub-head (o), which makes provision for an expenditure of £11,500 for the maintenance <Col N="683" /> of criminal lunatics in district mental hospitals.  There is a foot-note at the end dealing with this sub-head, which states: &ldquo;The provision under this sub-head includes the estimated cost of maintenance of soldiers and sailors committed to mental hospitals in Ireland under Section 91 (2) of the Army Act of 1881.&rdquo;  The note goes on to state that these soldiers and sailors, although they have committed no crime, are classed as criminal lunatics in consequence of a mistake in the drafting of the section of an Act of Parliament.  What I want to know is, how it comes that these criminal lunatics can be sent to Ireland, where they have to be maintained in our mental hospitals at the expense of the Free State?  It appears that that is due to some error in the drafting of an Act of Parliament.  As the Minister is of a legal mind, I would have thought that he would have rectified that error before now.</P>

      <P>&mdash;as to looking into the present system and so on, with a view to arriving at a more humane stage, that is something which I have certainly, and without any apology, put on the long finger.  It is not a serious matter; it is not an urgent matter by any manner of means, and in the order of taking things in perspective, it would be quite a long time before we would expect to reach the stage when anything could be done in that direction.  I am not just satisfied without examination that very much could be done, keeping in mind the fact that prisons are not meant to be either particularly comfortable or particularly pleasant places.  If they were, one possible result would be an increase in the prison population.  Certainly, the conditions in Maryborough Prison, where men sentenced to long terms of imprisonment, three years and upwards, are detained, must be extremely <Col N="684" /> pleasant indeed.  Extracts I have seen from the letters of prisoners there have led me to regret that my short period of detention lay in Belfast prison, rather than in Maryborough. People seem to wax enthusiastic there after a short stay, and to write out letters in very high terms of the conditions, the food and the fresh air.  They speak of a rapid improvement in their health, and a rapid increase in their weight shortly after arrival.</P>
      <P>In reference to Deputy O'Connell's question as to rumours of recent trouble in Maryborough Prison it is, perhaps, just as well that I should give to the Dáil a concise statement of what actually occurred in view of the fact that rather blood-curdling stories are being set on foot.  A letter appeared lately in the papers stating, I think, that nine or ten prisoners were to be flogged on Wednesday last, or some few days ago anyway, and a telegram was sent to one of the bishops to that effect.  There was no truth whatever in that statement&mdash;none whatever.  There have been certain troubles in Maryborough prison, but there was never any question at any time of corporal punishment in connection with those troubles.  Since the establishment of the Free State, since, in fact, the setting up of the Provisional Government, corporal punishment was only inflicted on one prisoner, and that was in the year 1923, for an assault of a very serious nature on a warder.  Now, the exact occurrences in Portlaoighise prison are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>On Sunday, the 29th March, thirty-seven convicts, out of 220 attending evening devotions in the prison chapel, stood up and left the building as a protest against the Pastoral Letter of Dr. Foley, which was being read by the chaplain from the altar.  A sworn inquiry was held on the 1st April, when charges of gross insubordination were preferred against the thirty-seven convicts.  The facts proved at the inquiry were shortly as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the afternoon service, which consisted of devotional exercises and sermon, the chaplain proceeded to read the Bishop's Pastoral Letter, when twenty-one convicts stood up and <Col N="685" /> walked out.  These were removed to their cells.  The priest had to discontinue his reading until they had left.  Searcely had they departed when another batch, to the number of sixteen, stood up and walked out, but, refusing to return to their cells, remained in the vicinity of the church. This batch returned to their seats upon the chaplain concluding the reading of the Pastoral.  The remainder of the convicts, to the number of over 180, kept their seats and maintained a reverential demeanour throughout.  To the officer in charge the convicts guilty of leaving the chapel stated that they would not stand for the preaching of politics from the altar, whether inside or outside the prison, and from their protestations in the matter the natural inference must be drawn that their action was preconceived and predetermined.  At the sworn inquiry the charges were proved.  With the exception of four, the convicts did not hesitate to admit or seek to qualify what they had done. In fact, their demeanour was defiant and they all adopted the attitude that in similar circumstances they would repeat their misconduct.  One convict from East Galway, possibly not unknown to Deputy O'Connell, stated that he &ldquo;would tear the priest off the altar the next time&rdquo;; another convict stated that he &ldquo;would not go to Mass any more as it was no church where politics were introduced&rdquo;; another stated that &ldquo;the priest insulted him by alluding to robbers and murderers&rdquo;; another, who had been convicted of the robbery of a bank, stated that &ldquo;he wished to make restitution, but that his conscience would not let him when a priest had called him a murderer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, four convicts who expressed regret for what they had done, and a determination not to misconduct themselves in the future, received punishment as follows:&mdash;Three days' confinement in their cells and bread and water diet.  The remaining 33, who adopted a defiant attitude and expressed a determination to repeat the offence on any available opportunity, were punished as follows&mdash;Six months' close confinement, six months' separate <Col N="686" /> confinement; dietary scale as prescribed for prisoners pending decision.</P>
    <P>Of the convicts concerned, 25 are serving various terms of imprisonment for armed robbery, four for burglary, four for larceny or receiving stolen goods, two for forgery, one for attempted murder, one for unlawful possession of firearms, one for demanding money with menaces.</P>
    <P>The morning after the inquiry fortythree other convicts refused to work out of sympathy with the thirty-seven convicts already mentioned.  These were dealt with by the governor under the prison rules as follows:&mdash;In nineteen cases he awarded (a) three days' No. 1 punishment diet and close confinement, (b) forfeiture of fourteen days' remission of sentence, (c) forfeiture of the privilege of newspapers and library books for three months.</P>
    <P>In twenty-three cases, where the governor considered that the convicts concerned were led away by the others, he admonished them and, in one case where the governor considered the convict to be weakminded, he advised him.</P>
    <P>The twenty-three convicts admonished by the governor and the one advised by him immediately returned to work as did seventeen of the nineteen cases immediately upon their doing their punishment. Two convicts of the nineteen joined with some twenty-eight of the thirty-seven convicts for the offence of leaving the chapel, in going on hunger strike.  This hunger strike was of rather short duration&mdash;some abstained from food only for one day; others for two, and others for three, and a few remained on strike for nine days when the whole thirty had resumed taking food.  In addition to going on hunger strike some of the thirty-seven convicts, convicted in connection with the breach of discipline in leaving the chapel, engaged in breaking the cell windows.  Since the abandonment of the hunger strike, however, every single convict who had been guilty of misconduct had individually apologised to the chaplain, and the governor for his misconduct in leaving the chapel, and those who were guilty of wilful damage such as breaking the windows had made good the cost.  In view of <Col N="687" /> these apologies and the restitution made, the dietary punishment has been remitted and the question of the restoration of the marks for remission will depend on how far the future conduct of the convicts concerned shows the sincerity of their repentance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter was raised in connection with the Vote for the year before last.  It appears the matter has been the subject of a discussion <Col N="688" /> between the Department and the Ministry of Finance, with a view to an alteration in the law.  As was pointed out here, the responsibility for keeping in the prisons persons who are sent out of the British Army or Navy to Irish prisons because they are lunatics, is, as a matter of fact, on the Irish Exchequer.  The responsibility lies upon the Irish Government, because of a fault in the drafting of an old Act.  Really, it is important to note that just as a matter of carelessness in drafting, the word &ldquo;prisoner&rdquo; is transcribed as &ldquo;person&rdquo; in the original, and then in subsequent Acts it appears to have been copied as &ldquo;person.&rdquo;  Because of that little blunder, we are being made to bear the responsibility.  Now, that should be a warning to the Dáil as to the necessity for being very careful in passing legislation.  We may put upon some authority in the future a responsibility that we have no desire to put.  It seems that there are quite a number of people who have been detained as lunatics, not criminal lunatics, who have never been charged, and never been tried.  There are persons who have been transferred and kept in Irish prisons as lunatics at the charge of the Irish State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a few, probably three, four, or five, since the establishment of the Free State.  Others were sent, and they are still detained.  They were sent before the establishment of the Free State.  It is still the law, as I understand, that the British Army and Navy authorities may recruit Irishmen, and may not be too particular as to the treatment of these men, or these men may not be too sound in their mentality, or by some other means they may be declared insane, and then they may be sent over to be detained in Irish prisons without trial; and we have no remedy.  It is said that certain representations have been made in that matter to the British authorities, and that it is not likely that the practice will be continued, but I think that we should legislate in such a way as to prevent that sort of thing happening, and that we should not be bound to be maintaining prisoners sent here in those circumstances.  I do not know what the position is, if the prison officer <Col N="689" /> declares a prisoner no longer insane.  I do not know what becomes of the prisoner, whether he must be sent back to the British Army or not.  But the whole matter is important enough.  It is very important in principle, and it has a certain importance in matters of constitutional relations, it has a certain importance in regard to expenditure. I would ask the Minister to look into it with some care and to consider whether it is not necessary to legislate to prevent the continuance of this practice.</P>
    <P>I was rather hoping that this Vote would not come on to-night, because there were certain matters that I wanted to raise in connection with the position of warders in prisons, and the representations that are alleged to have been made, but about which I understand the Minister does not know anything. There is a good deal of dissatisfaction in the prisons regarding the new relationships that have become prevalent between the warders and their superior officers, which are apparently not as conducive to good discipline or to general satisfaction with their functions as officers of the prisons as they used to be.  I think it will be reasonable to ask, in view of taking this Vote out of its place, that we should not pass from it to-night but that we should be given an opportunity of raising this question when we come back to the Estimates.  I promise not to go over other matters, but only to raise this question regarding the position of the warders, this question about which, apparently, the Minister has now no information.  In answer to a question the other day the Minister said that no applications had been made. My information was to the contrary. Applications had been made, and I had intended to produce certain information which had been placed in my hands; but the papers are not here, and I cannot deal with it now.

    <P>I spoke last night on the first resolution, as to a distinction between conventions and recommendations.  In this motion I am dealing with six conventions, and I do not want to make any pretence that anything very abnormal is being done with regard to the ratifying of these conventions.  It really amounts to a clearing up of the position with regard to certain conventions which were passed at a time when we were not members of the League of Nations, and consequently were not members of the International Labour Organisation.  If I might refer to the resolutions in bulk, the position that we wish to achieve is something like this: Since the beginning of the International Labour Organisation seventeen conventions have been passed at the conferences held in Geneva, of which the Saorstát has ratified two by resolution in this House and in the Seanad. There are, therefore, fifteen outstanding, and I am moving to-night to add six to the two, which would leave nine outstanding.</P>
    <P>One of these, No. 7 in the list, as they are numbered in the official Labour publications, is a question of the prohibition of white phosphorus in matches: but the law prohibiting white phosphorus in matches, which was passed in 1909, is in force in this country, so that as far as the effective application of that is concerned, we are doing all that is necessary.  I am not moving to ratify that convention to-night, because there was a convention which was afterwards <Col N="693" /> adopted by the International Labour Organisation, and there is a distinction about which I am not too clear at the moment as to the formal method of ratification, or adherence. We can do what is requisite immediately we discover what is the proper method to adopt towards it, as we have legislation actually effecting what is necessary for the purpose of the convention. On the formal point of adherance we are actually in line with it, but we are not moving to adhere to or ratify it to-night.</P>
    <P>That leaves eight outstanding.  Of these eight, four&mdash;two passed at the second Conference of 1920 on Unemployment Indemnity, which refer to seamen and employment for seamen, and Nos. 16 and 17 passed at the third Conference in 1921, setting out the minimum age for the employment of trimmers and stokers, and the question of compulsory medical examination to be repeated annually for young persons employed at sea&mdash;are being left over because they fall to be discussed and will come more properly within our province when we deal with the merchant shipping legislation which will be brought before this House either in the autumn of this year or early next year.  That leaves four, about which I am making no motion this evening, one of these being the question of hours which was agitating Deputy Good last night.  Another is what is known as the Maternity Convention, No. 3 of the Conference of 1923, and No. 14, dealing with the use of white lead in paint, and No. 15, which entails a weekly rest of twenty-four hours in industry.  The situation, therefore, will be this, if these conventions are put through to-night, that of seventeen conventions we have already ratified two, and we are moving to ratify six to-night.</P>
    <P>There is one to which we in fact adhered, having legislation in force, that is No. 7, and there are two sets of four which we are leaving over.  One set deals with questions connected with seamen, and that four will more properly come up to be dealt with at the time when merchant shipping is discussed. Then there are the other four <Col N="694" /> about which we are taking no action at the moment.  As to these four, the question of hours is one which we are leaving over because we do not think it proper that a country like this should ratify a Convention which has more application to a highly industrialised country.  It seems absurd that we should ratify it while the highly industrialised countries have not yet proceeded to do so, particularly those which are nearest us and with which we are in competition.</P>
    <P>The Maternity Convention we do not propose to ratify at the moment, because certain regulations in force here under the National Health Insurance Act, and other Acts, set out a series of provisions on the same point which, to a certain degree, are better than what the Maternity Convention has proposed, but in certain points are not so good.  But to pass this at the moment would entail a rehandling of the National Health Insurance Act, with other Acts, and we are not prepared to enter upon that at the moment.  That Convention is, therefore, being left over for future consideration.</P>
    <P>The question of the white lead prohibition with regard to paint is not being dealt with at the moment.  There is such a harrowing series of statistics with regard to fatalities from the use of white lead that undoubtedly there is a prima facie case made for its prohibition. Suggestions have been made as to whether or not the danger could be eliminated by certain preventive measures, and there is an objection as to whether paint without white lead could really be as effective and as good as paint of which white lead is a constituent.</P>
    <P>Inquiries have been and are being made, but they have not yet been sufficient for the purpose of making a decision.  We will soon be in a position to deal with that matter so far as Saorstát affairs are concerned.  The question of a weekly rest in industry is one which we must leave over, not because we object to the principle of the Convention, as the principle is actually in accordance with the way life runs in the Saorstát.  There is practically everywhere this 24-hour <Col N="695" /> rest from work on Sundays.  In that respect we are completely in line with what the Convention seeks to establish. There are certain clauses with regard to compensation periods for people who work during the week and who are forced to work on Sundays. This would cause serious disturbance here to make it effective, and until we see how these clauses work in with our system of industry, we are leaving them over.  I want to emphasise the position with regard to these eight.  There are three about which we say nothing. As regards white lead, about which we say there is a prima facie case, we want to make inquiries to see how far the prohibition can be made effective. There are four others with which legislation in some way dealing with them will be introduced, either in the autumn this year, or early next year.  With regard to the six which I am now moving to adopt, I would like to point out that no new legislation is entailed by the first five.  One is a convention concerning unemployment and the legislation to give effect to what is aimed at by the Convention is in force here by the Labour Exchange Act of 1909, and by various Acts passed since 1920.  Legislation concerning the employment of women and young persons on night work, and children in industries, and the fixing of a minimum age for the employment of children at sea is effected by the Act dealing with women, young persons and children which was passed in 1920.  So far as these are concerned, no new legislation is required.  The sixth requires new legislation.  It concerns the age regarding the employment of children in agriculture.  I am willing to adopt that.  In this case the Convention is completely in line with the Compulsory School Attendance Bill which is in draft, and which will see the light shortly.  The age established there is that referred to under this Convention. I do not say that this particular School Attendance Bill will pass without certain objections from some Deputies on the Farmers Benches. With those objections I may afterwards have some concern as an individual, but as moving this International Convention <Col N="696" /> I have no interest in them. As between the Minister for Education, the Minister for Agriculture, and the farmers' representatives, there may be a conflict, but whatever may be the result of that conflict this international Labour Convention is in line with the proposals of the Bill, and as far as age is concerned, I cannot see how the proposals of the Bill are to be defeated.</P>
    <P>If they are defeated, I believe it will be contrary to Government policy, and in so far as this represents Government policy we are moving it because the Bill which is to follow fixes the age which is in accordance with the Convention. There is another point, and that arises in connection with Schedule F, Article 2, which says: &ldquo;For purposes of practical vocational instruction, the periods and the hours of school attendance may be so arranged as to permit the employment of children on light agricultural work, and in particular on light work connected with the harvest, provided that such employment shall not reduce the total annual period of school attendance to less than eight months.&rdquo;  In moving that clause, I may say that it is in line with the Government policy as reflected in certain provisions of the Compulsory School Attendance Bill.  Article 1 speaks of children who may be employed outside the hours of school attendance. It admits that that is possible, but it holds that such employment shall not be such as to prejudice their attendance at school.  I expect on that a question will be raised as to whether the school hours will be arranged so as to allow children to be employed in agriculture during seed time and harvest time.  That is a matter to be fought out on the School Attendance Bill between the farmers' representatives and the Minister for Education. Whatever be the result, I do not think that the Convention will be changed, because such a dispute would circle round the question of what are school hours, and whatever school hours are fixed the result will be in line with this Convention.  There may be quarrels about the hours at which children may be employed at a certain period. It will not affect the Convention.  We <Col N="697" /> are not prejudiced as regards that question, and we will not take away from the farmers' representatives the chance of conflict which they will have afterwards.  We are not tying our hands in any way.  The one thing in which we are tied is with regard to the question of the fixing of the age at fourteen. That is the age to be fixed by the Compulsory School Attendance Bill.  If it is something higher, it will be all the better.</P>

      <P>The Convention established the age of 14 years, and there is to be introduced a Bill which does not fix the age at less than 14 years.  I do not want to make any explanation about the Conventions.  I think the titles and schedules to which the motion refer have been pretty definitely explained.  So far as five of them are concerned, they are covered by legislation in force, and in regard to the sixth legislation will be introduced, that is when we come to the Compulsory School Attendance Bill.</P>

      <P>I am a little puzzled at the explanation the Minister has given with regard to the effect of future legislation.

      <P>I do not say we will not accept it.  The Minister may misunderstand the farmers' attitude if he thinks we will not accept that.  I am not speaking for the Farmers' Party.  We have had no opportunity of considering the matter, and we may be more broadminded than the Minister anticipates.  I object to his anticipation of legislation, and to the statement that apparently this is Government policy, and that if we do not accept this to-day we are, in effect, passing a vote of want of confidence in the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I must confess I am almost as wise as I was when I began.  If that is so, the Minister's elaborate explanation was hardly necessary.  With regard to the general aspect of the matter, I dealt somewhat with it last night, and referred to the effect of these conventions and recommendations, and the advisability of adopting them.  The Minister says that four of these Conventions have been embodied in this Bill, and only one involves fresh legislation.  There is a possibility that there may be conventions which would involve very radical legislation.  We are told that these Conventions were passed by the International Labour Organisation.  That organisation will place those Conventions before the Governments of the different countries, and these Governments have power to ratify or reject them.  Has the International Labour Organisation power to insist that legislation is carried out, and to punish if it is not?  I noticed, in looking up one of the blue books of the International Labour Organisation that the more obscure a country is, and the more unsettled, the more likely it is that legislation will be passed in that country in regard to school attendance, hours of work for children, and regulations of that kind.  They simply pass that legislation, place it on their statute books, and do not enforce it. I hope it is the intention of this country to see that all the legislation that is passed is enforced.  I think there is a danger that we, being a new Government, and quite filled up with ideas of carrying things out in first-class order, may not take full account of the State affairs in other countries, and we may bind ourselves to conditions which we intend to carry out in an honourable and straightforward fashion, and which other countries may not carry out in a similar fashion.  That is the main objection I have to accepting these Conventions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know <Col N="699" /> with regard to these conventions, how many agricultural countries took part in them, or were represented at them, and by whom they were represented. Who represented agriculture in this country at this particular convention, and how many small peasant organisations in any country were represented? It would come very badly, I think, from us to object to education in agriculture, because it is one of the things we need, but there has also to be taken into consideration the peculiar circumstances of the peasants of the country who have to rely on their own labour.  Further, you must take into consideration the mind of the young person who has been more or less away from agriculture until he is fourteen years of age.  The difficulty of reconciling him to spend his life on the land, at very disagreeable labour, and with little attraction&mdash;if he has not acquired a taste before fourteen years of age for that work&mdash; penal servitude, as Deputy Wilson calls it&mdash;is very great.  To get a boy back to the land who has been at school for any time, particularly a high school, is a very difficult matter.  We ought to be careful about this, and should think of the best way of getting our young men at the best age interested in agriculture, and prevent them from thinking too much about other matters, and too little about agriculture. The tendency of every young man is to leave the land if he can. Some of them will enlist even.  In the British army times some of them would not stay on the land.  If we have to do as Deputy O'Connell suggests we will never get them on it. We should educate them on the land. I would like to know how many representatives of agriculture have agreed to this convention and who is the representative of agriculture here.</P>

      <P>What about Britain and America?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Britain has not formally ratified this.  America is not represented at the International Labour Conference.  Let us not be misled by the rather formidable phraseology used.  All this convention means is that those countries which approve are prepared to legislate so that children in agricultural areas shall not be exempt from going to school.  It does not mean that they cannot work on the land, but that they shall not be exempt from going to school before they are 14 years of age.  I do not think Deputies need have any fear whatever about almost any of those conventions when one remembers that they are conventions drawn up and accepted by the least forward of the nations.  It is an attempt, in all those cases, to raise the most backward somewhat towards the level attained by the most forward.  I suggested that particularly agriculturists in this country should welcome every movement of this kind if it is going to help the more backward countries to move a little way towards the level of the most forward ones.  It certainly reduces the handicap, if there is a handicap, arising out of what is called social legislation.  I think there is very considerable importance to be attached from the international point of view, to our ratifying these conventions.  I have in my hand a chart which is circulated to all the countries periodically showing how the various conventions are being received, and what point they have reached in the procedure of <Col N="701" /> ratification and embodiment of legislation. Up to now the Free State looks very sick on this chart.  There will be a Conference in Geneva within the next month.  I, for one, would like to see the Free State's record very much better by the time the Conference meets, than to have only two conventions ratified, even if it is only to encourage the others.  As a matter of fact, that is the most important practical value of this, and if all those various conventions accept the point, there is more or less a formal indication that the Dáil approves of fixing 14 years as a school leaving age.  Apart from that there is nothing in those conventions that is not already embodied in the law, and if we approve of them to-night, it will at least be made clear for the other nations represented in the Conference, that the Free State is moving forward and taking its part actually and with decision in the work of international social legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have liked to have seen some of the other conventions on this list.  I would like to have seen the Hours Convention on the list.  That is another case where the Danish Parliament has approved of the Washington Convention.  However, the Minister is not prepared to bring that forward now so I will not go into the matter.  With regard to these placed before us, I hope the Dáil and the Seanad will agree to notify to the League of Nations International Labour Office that we have ratified them and, in so far as they are not already embodied in legislation, that they will, at an early date, be so embodied.  As an illustration of the importance of dealing with those conventions, or similar ones, there is a paragraph in to-day's paper dealing with a judgment in the appeal courts with respect to a workman's compensation case.  That is not the subject of one of these particular conventions, but this question of workmen's compensation and international arrangements will arise at the forthcoming Conference in Geneva.  If there can be agreement at that Conference regarding reciprocal arrangements, then it will be incumbent upon Great Britain and ourselves, if we approve to legislate, to prevent the <Col N="702" /> possibility of such a case as this arising. That is to say, there will be an obligation more or less imposed that there shall be reciprocal arrangements made whereby a seaman sailing on an English ship, who happens to be an Irishman living in Ireland, will not be debarred, except at very great expense, from compensation, and that there will be some means whereby he can sue in his own country. That is a little illustration of the kind of thing that can be got over by international agreements of this kind.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has followed the course of legislation will realise that where countries move together with regard to legislation, any opposition to such legislation in one particular country is minimised, because the argument that that country is handicapped by adopting the more forward policy cannot be put forward.  I support the motion of the Minister, and I hope the Dáil will agree unanimously to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that any proposition that has to do with social legislation demands, at all times, very careful consideration from any legislature.  This motion, we are agreed, is in the nature of social legislation. While the social conditions of this country are not all that we might desire, we might, perhaps, say that our social conditions are regulated by other countries, and, perhaps, by countries where the conditions are worse than they are here.  If it is possible to have an International Convention, whereby regulations will be formulated to raise to equal status the conditions in the different countries, I do agree that it is incumbent on every State to consider such a convention, and if at all compatible with national safety, to accept its provisions.  Whatever other countries may think of doing respecting this convention, it is right, if we believe that social conditions ought to be improved, that we should set the example and accept what the International Labour Convention has set out.  It would be an example to other countries, and I do not think that we could suffer by acceptance.  My conviction is that we are suffering to-day because, bad though conditions be in this country, other countries will not try to raise <Col N="703" /> their social conditions to our standard. That disadvantage is not confined to any particular industry in the Saorstát.</P>
      <P>As regards the point referred to by Deputy Heffernan and by the Minister, respecting the age for compulsory school attendance, while we may accept this at the moment, when the Bill comes before us we will have an open mind and we reserve the right to say whether we will accept what is contained in the Bill or not.  While agreeing that it is right that children should be compelled to attend school up to the age of fourteen, and perhaps, as Deputy O'Connell says, beyond it, conditions have to be taken into account and we are not going to prejudge what the Bill proposes to do. On that matter, I say we must have an open mind, and though this limit be accepted at the moment, it will not be binding on us or determine our attitude when we come to take a decision on the provisions of the Bill.</P>

I agree with him, that that is highly advisable, but I am not quite sure that Deputy Gorey did not intend to convey by that, that going to school until they were fourteen years of age prevented them acquiring a taste for the land.  I would be sorry to think that he intended to convey that they were to acquire that taste at the expense of their attendance at school.  He said he thought we <Col N="704" /> should not get them away from the land.  If the matter is closely examined, I am afraid it will be found that the person who grows up with the greatest distaste for the land, is the child who is made a drudge on the land at eleven or twelve years, when he should not be employed on the land or working to the extent he is asked to work at that early age.  I think it will be found that those children who go to school until fourteen or fifteen years of age, and do whatever light work they are required to do on the farm outside school hours, grow up with a stronger inclination to stay on the land than those who are kept at home from school to work on the land.  There can be no objection, I am sure, on the merits of this convention, and I hope it will be accepted unanimously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <P>They have accepted the convention but reciprocity does not exist, because &ldquo;terms have not been agreed&rdquo; between the members concerned. If I may reply to a few of the points made in the course of the debate, I hope I have not misled the Dáil, as I appear to have misled Deputy Heffernan, with regard to my remarks on the Compulsory School Attendance Bill which, as I said, is in draft.  The regulation with regard to draft conventions is that the member&mdash;that is the State member&mdash;of the international organisation presents the recommendation or draft convention before the authority or authorities within whose competence the matter lies, for the enactment of legislation or other action.  If, in the case of a draft convention, the member obtains the consent of the authorities, he will communicate the formal ratification of the convention to the Secretary General and take such action as may be necessary to make effective the provisions of such convention.  If I had known that there was a School Attendance <Col N="705" /> Bill which set a minimum age of, say, 12, obviously then there would be no good in my proposal to ratify this convention, because I could not get legislation which would make effective the provisions of the conventions.  But when I had discovered that a School Attendance Bill proposed to establish compulsory school attendance, at least as far as 14, then I felt I could move in the matter.  With regard to anything else, whether or not children may be employed at harvest time, that will be a matter for decision on the School Attendance Bill.  If school hours are so arranged that children under 14 will be free for work at harvest time, then the convention will be in line, because the school hour is what rules.  If, on the other hand, school hours are so arranged that children will not be free for agricultural work, the convention will also be in line.  As long as we do agree in this way to the age of 14&mdash;it may be higher, as Deputy O'Connell seems to wish&mdash;but so long as we agree to that age or as long as I knew that there was legislation coming which set out to establish the age of 14, then I felt I was free to move with regard to this convention.</P>
      <P>Deputy Heffernan has spoken to-night, as he spoke last night, of certain backward nations which put their hand to certain conventions, apparently not meaning to carry them out or which are not, in fact, carrying them out.  He asked about certain countries.  I do not know if Denmark, which is often thrown up as a model of what is desirable from an agricultural point of view, is one of the backward countries which had more or less accepted this type of convention. I do not know if Italy can be called a backward country.  There are certain other countries, the names of which have been given by Deputy Johnson, which I do not think can be said to be backward countries, and which have ratified conventions such as this.</P>

I cannot conceive of any social legislation about which the Deputy might gather facts from the International Labour Publication that was not either the subject of a convention or recommendation, and I do not know of backward nations which have ratified most of these conventions or adopted recommendations not meaning to carry them into effect.  Great Britain has been spoken of.  Deputy Johnson did not reply to that.  The Minister for Labour in the English House of Commons stated that they were in favour of ratifying this Convention No. 11, but that there were certain exemptions required on account of the Scottish Education Laws and they want to get such an amendment of the convention as would allow them to permit a local type of exemption as would be necessitated by some peculiar results of certain Scottish Education Laws.  Their legislation, in fact, carries out everything required by this convention.  That explanation was made, I think, that that was the only thing that prevented them from formally ratifying the convention&mdash; that there was this question of the Scottish Education Authorities.</P>

Are these meant to be examples of the backward nations which have ratified and do not intend to carry out, or are they examples of the agricultural nations prepared to carry them out?  If you <Col N="707" /> want an example of an agricultural nation, Denmark has ratified it.  While I was very glad to hear the remarks that fell from Deputy Baxter on this question, he introduced his remarks with the preamble that before we embark on social legislation we should definitely consider the subject matter of it.  In this series of conventions we are not considering social legislation, in so far as approaching the introduction of such legislation.  Legislation is here.  We are moving after the event to ratify some convention which, in fact, we have carried out by our legislation, with the single exception of this matter of the age at which children should be employed in agriculture, or the question of school hours and agricultural employment.  I cannot see how anybody could vote for this convention and proceed simply on the basis of the age to object later to the School Attendance Bill.  There may be other incidentals to the age, but I cannot see how anybody can vote for this convention to-night, with the idea of objecting to fourteen years being set as a limit for compulsory school attendance when the Bill comes forward.  There is a definite acceptance in voting for this convention.  There is a pretty clear acceptance of the idea that fourteen years is the acceptable age, on the downward grade, at which to fix the age for compulsory school attendance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>At question time to-day I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce was he yet in a position to declare his policy with regard to the unemployment benefit exhausted during the last benefit year. I received a lengthy reply, saying that out of 44,568 claims which were received at the various exchanges throughout the country at the beginning of the benefit year, 10,269 had been disallowed, and that 8,854 were entitled to benefit from 1 to 30 days; 7,541 were entitled to benefit from 31 to 60 days, and 17,904 from 61 to 90 days.  I think the answer given by the Minister to-day will be received with disappointment all over the State.  I think when Deputy Johnson and myself questioned the Minister immediately before the adjournment he gave an answer from which the unemployed might reasonably draw the inference that the Government was at that time considering the question of bringing in a new Bill in order to <Col N="709" /> renew the benefit which had lapsed for a great number of people in the last benefit year.  I think they will be also disappointed when they read in the Press, if it is reported, that the only thing the Government has to offer the unemployed is that they should join the Army.  I think that is a serious answer for a Minister to give to a question of this kind.  The Minister denied of course that we had drawn the right inference when we stated that this was conscription by hunger. But I do not see any other name by which it should be called.</P>
      <P>The Minister refers in his answer also to the fact that they have given protection, that there were measures taken in the Budget to stimulate employment. I am in agreement with the protective duties, and I want to congratulate the Government on them.  I am in agreement with the tariffs they have brought forward in the Budget, but at the same time I think&mdash;and everybody else in this House will agree&mdash;that it will take a certain time in order to find out what stimulation will be given to employment by these tariffs that have been introduced.  In dealing with these figures the Minister stated that 10,269 have been disallowed altogether, and that 8,854 persons would be entitled to benefit for from 1 to 30 days.  We do not know what number of these 8,854 are entitled to only one day or even three or four days.  We are entitled to think that 8,000 of them might be only entitled to one day or one week, and that would make the number of those people who are not entitled to draw benefit up to 20,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has heard me answer as many as eight or nine questions a week in reference to unemployment insurance.  Of the nine or ten cases, the explanation in six, perhaps, is that the applicants were not unable to obtain suitable employment, and never once did suitable employment refer to the Army.  The inference is drawn now which was never drawn before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the figures here, which indicate the number of unemployed all over the State without any reference being made to any particular district.  I take it the Minister will be in a position to find out whether certain districts were unduly affected by unemployment more than others.  I know one town in my own constituency where 1,300 people were paid benefit during the last benefit year, and 700 of these have been rejected for the present benefit year.  That is the greater proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I am entitled to ask the Government what they propose to do for those people.  Again, speaking of protection, I want to say that these people want work.  Representations were put forward on behalf of that town asking for protection for the manufacture of agricultural machinery. There is a plant in that town which is capable of manufacturing sufficient agricultural machinery to supply the needs of the Free State, and it was refused protection.  Some people, of course, will hold up their hands and be very gratified because the Government has stopped what they call the dole system.  I want to say that we here on those benches do not want to perpetuate the dole system any longer than it is needed.  We want employment, and the people themselves want employment, but until the Government is in a position to give that employment they should do something for the unemployed by way of the dole or by way <Col N="711" /> of anything else you like.  Only this morning I was looking at a poster in Dublin, put on the walls during the last bye-election, and at the top of that poster were the words: &ldquo;Vote for O'Connor and Leonard and stability.&rdquo; It is all very well to talk about stability, but where is the unfortunate man who has been out of work for the last three or four years, and who has been disallowed benefit at the Labour Exchange during the last three or four weeks, going to find that stability.  You wonder when the elections come off why people do not come out to vote, but when these unfortunate men cannot get work or cannot get anything to support them, they have very little interest in bye-elections, and the sooner the Government realise that the better.</P>
    <P>I do not want to use platitudes or indulge in rhetoric in any way, and I do not want anybody to think I would be absolutely against the Government in their bye-elections.  I want to see the Government winning any time they are up against people who do not want any Government in the country, but I do think when the bye-elections are over, that they should not forget their promises and that they should try and do something for the unemployed. We had a clamour in the country for the last two months for the abolition of income tax, and the people who are calling for the abolition of that income tax have got a good reduction.  The unemployed will wonder if the Government are able to do that why they cannot do something for them.  I recognise that the Unemployment Insurance Fund, as such, has been overdrawn and that we have had to call on the Central Fund to provide unemployment insurance for the last three or four years, but, be that as it may, the Government of the day will have to look after its unemployed. Conditions are abnormal in this country. We hope that conditions will soon become normal and that the tariffs brought in by the Government will have the effect of stimulating employ ment.  Until that time arrives, the Government will have to set about doing something for the unemployed <Col N="712" /> by bringing in some new legislation in order to provide for them, as they have done in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support Deputy Corish.  I am prompted to do so by the fact that on yesterday week there was a parade of the unemployed of Fermoy and district, with band and banners.  Fermoy has been very hard hit, as the military used to employ something like 1,000 men.  The building trade also, which used to employ a lot of men, is not giving any employment. The result is that many men are now on the &ldquo;dole&rdquo; and many others cannot even get the &ldquo;dole.&rdquo; Some of them complain that they do not know why they have been refused it.  The fact remains that many are unemployed in Fermoy, also in Cobh, owing to the closing down of Haulbowline dockyard, and in Buttevant.  After the parade in Fermoy, in which banners were carried, some with threatening and some with appealing inscriptions on them, the unemployed held a meeting. The meeting could not be described as a defiant one, but rather, one of appeal to the Government for help.  On their behalf I ask the Government to recognise the terrible plight of these people and to come to their assistance.  About four months ago a grant of £750 was made to ex-National Army men in Fermoy, but through some fault, either of the Government Department, or of these people in Fermoy, the grant could not be availed of.  The grant was not carried over to this year, but I hope, as a result of my appeal to-night, that that grant will be released as the first instalment of relief for the town of Fermoy.  In asking for relief for Fermoy I should like to couple Cobh and Buttevant with it. In about two months' time a sum of £400,000 is to be spent on the roads of County Cork.  That looks a very big sum, but when it is remembered that County Cork represents one-sixth of the area of the Saorstát, it is not such a large amount.  I would ask the Government seriously to consider releasing this £750.  It is in the Exchequer and really belongs to these unemployed men, who are very hard hit for different reasons.  The flour <Col N="713" /> mills in Fermoy are only working quarter time.  Mills that used to be kept running day and night are now only working two or three days a week. As the opportunity arose, I felt compelled to avail of it on behalf of these starving people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the views of Deputy Corish and to express my regret that the Minister should have repeated&mdash;what he has said once or twice&mdash;the suggestion that because men did not enter the Army they are not ready to undertake work that is offered.  I do not know whether the Minister really meant to say that, but it is certainly fair to draw that inference from his statement. We are told that 25 per cent. of the total number of claims allowed are only entitled to from one to thirty days' benefit, and 22 per cent. from thirty to sixty days.  We know that a large proportion of these have been continuously unemployed for a long time.  Having passed one period of thirty days since the beginning of the new benefit year we shall find a very rapidly growing number of men and women who are entirely without benefit and cannot give any benefit during the present benefit year&mdash;that is, until August or September.  Apparently no provision has been made or thought of on their behalf, and I think the matter is becoming serious.  The numbers may not be very great at present, but they will increase very rapidly from now onwards.  I did hope, from the words that fell from the Minister before the Easter adjournment, that at any rate he was preparing the way for the introduction of legislation to deal with people who are out of benefit, if necessary on the system which he endeavoured to get away from, of uncovenanted benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was speaking to a man to-day who told me that he had been for fifteen months idle.  He is a man of 47 or 48 years of age, a skilled tradesman, a teetotaller, steady, and a fairly well-educated man for his training; earnest and enthusiastic and ready to take up anything within his competence.  He has been fifteen months idle for the reason that the particular trade he was trained for has been practically wiped <Col N="714" /> out by developments in industry.  He is one of many hundreds, and he is going to be in the position before very long of not having any benefit coming to him.  That is an illustration representing a very large number. There are others who cannot claim to be skilled tradesmen, or claim all the virtues that I am claiming for him, but who are equally entitled to maintenance, as they cannot get employment. I think it is reprehensible to suggest&mdash;perhaps the Minister went beyond his intentions&mdash;that a man must lock himself up in the Army for a few years&mdash;an occupation which he is unfitted for by temperament or anything else&mdash;or that if he is not prepared to accept the offer that is open to him to join the Army, it is an indication that he is not willing to work. That suggestion is one which, if seriously intended, is likely to cause a great deal of resentment.</P>
    <P>Similarly in regard to domestic service. I think the general experience is that it is a comparatively small number of women who are qualified to take domestic service, or who would be received as domestic servants by employers. I hope it is not the practice to say that if a person is not prepared to accept domestic service, who has never done anything of the kind in any house beyond her own, such a person is not willing to accept employment, and is thereby disqualified.  I would most earnestly plead that the Minister should not allow this gradually increasing, and what will become a rapidly increasing number of people, to fall out of benefit entirely, and to have no prospect of having any payments between now and the end of the benefit year.</P>
    <P>The prospect of employment, I hope, will rapidly improve, and the more rapidly it improves the more certain it is that the provision made for unemployment will not be required.  Do not let us, however, be without provision for unemployed men and women.  I think the Minister might give us some reassurance on this matter, that he is contemplating at a very early date introducing legislation which will make it possible for unemployment pay to be given to men to keep them from utter <Col N="715" /> hopelessness when they cannot obtain employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. EVERETT Mr. EVERETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Corish and to appeal on behalf of two thousand rural workers who are unemployed in County Wicklow. Through no fault of their own these men are unable to get home help or out of work pay.  I have received a resolution from a meeting of these men, stating that the grants given by the Government were not sufficient to absorb all the unemployed in Wicklow. They tell me there are over five hundred men with dependents, and they ask the Government to remove the restrictions on the unemployment grant or otherwise to provide work for them. At the same time they suggest that consideration of the Shannon scheme should be adjourned, and that the Government should put into force recommendations of the Reconstruction Committee by starting road-making and re-afforestation works.  That would absorb larger numbers of the unemployed than the Shannon scheme, and be more benefit to the people.  In making any recommendation, I would certainly urge the Minister to consider the case of the rural workers who, up to the present, have been deprived of unemployment benefit.  The protection that has been talked about will not benefit the constituency I represent, in any way.  In Bray there are one thousand unemployed men, in Arklow 500, and in Wicklow over 400.  Many schemes have been put forward by local bodies to try and cope with the unemployment, and I trust that the Government will at least grant some relief or that those willing to work who cannot get it, will get a donation from the State.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish has taken my figures of to-day and made certain deductions from them, to which I have already indicated I dissent.  It is estimated that 10,269 will be disallowed.  That is as far as my information goes, but I cannot stand over its accuracy.  It is a hurried estimate.  To start with, less than half of these will be disallowed <Col N="716" /> because they have no contributions. As to why people should be disallowed for reasons other than not having a contribution, I dealt with the question of not being able to obtain suitable employment, and that has been queried by Deputy Johnson, who seeks to tie it on to a remark of mine about the Army.  I do not know a single case where a man has been turned down, on the grounds of not being able to obtain suitable employment, having had Army service pointed out to him as suitable employment. The Deputy knows the Unemployment Insurance Acts well enough to realise that suitable employment is subject to definition, and that the definition may be enlarged by managers of Exchanges. But there is always the right of appeal in these things, and that appeal is generally taken where the officer seeks to go outside the old practice.  Personally, I do not think that Army service can be brought under the term of suitable employment, because it means suitable employment inside the whole code of the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  The claims of people have been disallowed because they were not unable to obtain suitable employment. Let me give an illustration.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy suggests I am hinting that Army service should be looked upon as suitable employment, and therefore claims should be turned down, I disavow that. I am not giving any indication; I did not seek to give it.  I do not believe it is possible even if I were to give an indication, that it would pass.  Cases occur very frequently of this type.  A man with a certain amount of land which he is not working applies for unemployment benefit, and the claim is refused on the ground that there is a prima facie case that he is not unable to obtain suitable employment, having a holding of his own which he does not work.  If I am asked the number of these cases brought forward is it going to be retorted that this is agricultural conscription, seeking to <Col N="717" /> drive men to the land who would rather be in industry?</P>

It cannot be agreed that this is a question of conscription by hunger, because I simply say this.  A plea is put to me that men are out of work and are starving.  I say I am quite ready to receive, and give the greatest sympathy to, claims put up with regard to men out of work here. When it is realised, as I do realise, that there are numbers of men out of work for a long period, there is one fact that must be taken into consideration.  It is that there are certainly a couple of thousand unmarried men between the ages suited for Army service, and of such physique and of a general type as would be welcomed in the Army. Yet, these 2,000 men will not join the Army.  Am I to take it that the phrase &ldquo;work or maintenance&rdquo; might be further defined?  Am I to take it that it is work we must select or maintenance? When that cry is used, with the implication on work or maintenance, I do not want to go far, because I may be quoted as saying that there are Army posts for which men cannot be found.  There are some thousand men&mdash;let me take 50 per cent. of the number I have mentioned&mdash;for whom posts are available.  These thousand men will not take the particular posts that are vacant, posts that will give good pay.  I heard to-day of a phrase quoted about a lady looking for employment for her three sons, and they were all of the Army type.  The Army was mentioned, and the retort <Col N="718" /> came that it was a hard life and they would not accept it.  Again, do not let me be taken as saying that that applies to a tremendous number of people.  I do not want any great generalisations taken from my remarks.  I talked about the Army for a certain purpose. I talked about domestic servants. Deputy Johnson did not apply the phrase &ldquo;conscription for domestic servants.&rdquo; That might easily have been retorted.</P>

I have not heard anybody indicating that the period which service in the Army would cover is one likely to see such a recrudescence of industry in the country as will lead to the employment of all the unemployed at the moment.  In other words, a man going into the Army now would not bar himself from a chance, which appears a reasonable chance, of getting employment in industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain care of how statements of mine are taken in the country.  Where there are <Col N="719" /> obvious misrepresentations, it is very easy to know them.  I do not think anybody here can believe that the phrase was used with that intention. Deputy Johnson said, with regard to domestic servants, that it cannot be said that everybody is qualified for domestic service.  I think he said, in fact, that there was rather a high degree demanded in this direction.  I cannot claim much experience in the matter of engaging servants myself, but I know the conditions under which they are engaged, and I have always been told that the best policy is to get a girl who is untrained and who has no degree of qualification, no extraordinary degree.  No particular degree of experience or qualification is required in such cases, I am told.  Those are the outstanding facts.</P>
      <P>To-day I heard one thing indicated in reference to a branch of work to which people were rather averse.  Five minutes later I heard that denied, so I am not going to make use of what I heard.  I believe that there are branches of work to which people show a distinct aversion and I cannot believe, with those things in front of me, that there is any tremendous urgency about this problem.  I can hardly believe that when I realise certain figures that are laid before me with regard to employment generally.  I think Deputy Corish made a remark about some people who would heave a sigh of relief on hearing that the dole had been stopped.  Again, I do not suppose that we are quarrelling with the word &ldquo;dole.&rdquo;  We have both often agreed that it is a misused word, or has been so during the last benefit year.  If it is to the specially extended benefit that the Deputy is referring, he is then correct. In the sense that there was something that has been stopped, he is correct.  We are in the position now that there is nothing except the normal course of unemployment benefit.  The position we are now in is that a special Act, which was further specially amended, has now run its course without any further special amendments. That was the special Act which supplied contributions for the fifth time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> On that matter I want the terms of my answer to a question put by the Deputy to-day attended to carefully.  I gave certain figures, and I stated that, having regard to the season of the year, the measures taken in the Budget to stimulate employment, and the present state of the Unemployment Fund, I thought it was difficult to argue that these figures necessitated any present extension of benefit.  It is said in regard to the protective measures taken that some time will elapse before they can have any effect in the way of increased employment.  But there are other things.  We had a clamour for the abolition of the income tax, and the suggestion that that would lead to increased industry.  Even if the whole tax were not abolished, the reduction that has been made is already stated to be tending towards an increase in industry. The Budget statement of the Minister for Finance showed certain calculations based on increased activity arising out of the reduction.  That is a thing that should show itself pretty soon.  Taking things all round, the present season of the year is one that should show an immediate return.  I do not pretend that everybody is catered for; but if Deputies put up as an argument to me that as long as there are a thousand men without employment who are not eligible to receive benefit from previous contributions, there should be some special provision made for them, I fail to meet that point of view.  There is no good in trying to pretend that everybody is being catered for, but yet something is being done.  Let there be no mistake about that.  It is not right to think that because there is no extension of benefit nothing is being done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be right to say that there are practically twenty thousand people out of benefit now?  I am only taking your own figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an estimate, and it may be a correct estimate, but I would first have to get it examined. I know for a fact that five thousand out of ten thousand persons have been disallowed because they have no contributions.  So that supposing <Col N="721" /> you take it that there were five thousand and that even a larger proportion of those 8,800 had exhausted benefit by this time, you have certainly 10,000 who have no claim to benefit. Similarly, you have the agricultural labourers that Deputy Everett spoke about who never had any claim to benefit.  And if it is put to me that as long as there is one thousand or five thousand, that then there must be something by way of extension of the benefit, then, of course, I fail to meet that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a fair way of putting it.  Ten thousand or five thousand spread over the whole State would not be much, but that number in a small district is another matter.  I prefer to stand by the Minister's figure that there are 20,000 out of benefit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  From the beginning of the benefit year over thirty days have gone, and that benefit is exhausted, so that will make up 20,000 or 18,000 but practically 19,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me continue my argument.  Whether it is a relative figure of 10,000 or 20,000 does not matter.  I took 10,000 as an example, and when it is said that nothing is done that is what I am trying to attack. There is a provision for benefit, not for these people, but there is a provision for others, and if there was no provision, and if the old provision was withdrawn, and we actually stopped all benefit other than that accruing on foot of contributions, then that 20,000 would be multiplied three times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, everybody is aware of that, but what benefit is that to the unfortunate 20,000 people who have not a bit of bread to eat because <Col N="722" /> the situation is as bad as that. The situation is abnormal to-day and the Government must bring in abnormal legislation to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is put to me that the situation is abnormal and that I should look at the history of things for the last couple of years.  I was inclined to believe that, but then I got down to these other facts I have spoken about.  I cannot believe now that men starving, as Deputy Corish put it, would refuse to come into the Army, and that women in a similar position would not accept domestic service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably not. But coming back to the other points, the season of the year and certain things arising out of the whole scope of the Budget should lead to immediate benefit of these men, and if it does not would you note the conclusion, particularly adding in the third item, that the present state of the Unemployment Fund renders it difficult to argue that the figures necessitate any present extension of the benefit.  Then there is the further fact, that the majority of those who exhausted their right to benefit are people who have had relatively few contributions to their credit.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy gives me the names we can have these cases investigated.  I am here as the guardian of this particular fund, and <Col N="723" /> this has to be repaid by industry.  I think we have got to the point when we must make up our mind that, as far as that fund is concerned, all further extension is closed.  The conclusion I gave in my answer to-day is one that I must abide by, that there is no argument at present for any further extension of the benefit.  The fund is overloaded with a debt to the extent of £1,300,000, and that must be repaid. No further addition can be made, and it must be repaid by industry in the country.  There was a tremendous number of people put on who never were engaged in industry, and the multiplication of benefit five times has put a very severe strain on that fund. The Deputy put a question as regards getting certain figures for the localities.  That can be done, but it takes time.  The Deputy will remember that when he asked some questions about unemployment matters before the adjournment I said it would take considerable time to get the figures. The Deputy retorted that in four or five days we could easily get them.  My answer was that the figures I had led me to a different conclusion from what the Deputy came to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this point of localities and the trouble in certain districts, I received a very peculiarly-worded telegram from Cork, which says: &ldquo;At a public meeting in the Coliseum, Cork, to-day, it was unanimously decided to notify you&rdquo;&mdash;and then there is the peculiar phrase&mdash;&ldquo;that 17,000 adults in Cork are confronted with life or death.&rdquo; That is a situation we are all confronted with, though it is obvious to see what the meaning is.  I quote that figure as an example.  There are, as far as we can discover, 6,000 unemployed <Col N="724" /> in Cork, of whom nearly 3,000 are in receipt of benefit, and yet the meeting in the Coliseum speaks about 17,000 adults unemployed.  I have a responsibility towards the people on whose behalf the Deputy raised this matter, but I have also a responsibility to the people who pay into the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  I must get the figures checked before a decision can be taken.  I think the Deputy would agree that, in connection with the Unemployment Insurance Fund, there is no reason whatever for putting any further charge upon it.  The question of relief is another matter, and it must be brought up in another way.  I do not see at the moment the figures are such that they warrant an immediate approach to that relief.  If there is to be relief now when the season is so favourable, what is to happen in the autumn and the winter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to exaggerate the matter.  We in our own constituencies get as much annoyance as the Minister gets.  When we come up here the people think we can do what we like.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the answer I gave to Deputy Corish at question time is a quite sound answer. It may not be one in accordance with the Deputy's desires, but I think if he examines it he will agree that it is a reasonable answer.  Taking certain things into consideration, there is no great case made for a present extension of benefit, particularly of benefit that has been multiplied five times already.</P>

In the present case there is no explanation of his failure to apply to the Committee, and there is the additional complication that he was discharged as medically unfit from the force with a gratuity in July, 1916.</P>
