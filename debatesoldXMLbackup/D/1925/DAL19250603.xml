        <Col N="142" /> I would refer the Deputy to the answer given to a question asked by Deputy Tomas MacEoin on this subject on the 19th December last.  I have not been able to secure the agreement of the Governments of Great Britain or Northern Ireland to reciprocal arrangements.</P>
      <P>In regard to the persons resident in the Saorstát who were employed by the Belleek Pottery Co.  I have to refer the Deputy to paragraph 5 of the reply given by me to Deputy Tomas MacEoin on the 19th December last.  I have been unable to bring the Government of Northern Ireland to any arrangement to remove what should not present a serious difficulty.  The contributions in respect of the employment of these persons by the Belleek Pottery Co. were paid into the Unemployment Fund of Northern Ireland and are, therefore, not available for benefit here.</P>

The re-opening of the business depends on the result of these negotiations and other financial arrangements necessary for the carrying on of such an enterprise.  The syndicate interested in the matter has made an application under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, and this application is at present under consideration by me and by the Minister for Finance.  In regard to the concluding part of the Deputy's question, I do not consider that the present is an opportune time for going into the matter in greater detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that yesterday evening we got into a discussion on other matters which had not a very direct bearing on Deputy Johnson's amendment, and that we more or less lost sight of the main object of the amendment.  I would like to support Deputy Johnson's contention that this Vote should be referred back for the purpose of having the grant increased. I take it from the discussion yesterday that the £115,000 now proposed to be voted is largely in the nature of a revote of money that was not expended within the last financial year.  Deputy Johnson, Deputy Morrissey, and others have called attention to the position of those who are unemployed because of general slackness of work, and they drew attention to that class of people who might be called irregular labourers.  The Ministry must know, and I am sure the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;who I am glad to see in his place to-day&mdash;does know that in the West of Ireland especially there is a class of men who never go on any unemployment register, a very large number of men who are, generally speaking, out of employment because they have not sufficient work to employ them on their little holdings or farms.  They cannot be called labourers in the strict sense of the word; they call themselves small farmers, but anyone who knows the conditions must be aware of the fact that for the greater part of the year these men are looking for work.  There was a market some years ago, especially before the war, for their labour. They went each year to England or to Scotland and did agricultural work there.  To a very large extent, practically entirely, that market is now shut off from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable portion of the money voted last year was spent in these congested areas in ordinary land improvement work, but I think that the Minister <Col N="148" /> will agree that this season is a more appropriate time for engaging in that class of work, and the argument cannot be adduced that employment is more plentiful in those districts in the summer.  There is not that employment such as we know of on farms in the midlands, the southern, and eastern portions of Ireland.  There is no opening for these men, and it is at this time of the year, and not later on, that a good deal of work, in the way of drainage especially, could be usefully done. I suggest that instead of waiting for two, three or more months, and then asking the Dáil for a further sum, as will be the case without any doubt&mdash; anyone who knows the conditions must anticipate a need for an increase in this grant before the end of the financial year&mdash;that the grant should be increased now so that work which was attempted last winter, and was done in some of these districts, could be usefully continued now.  These men have not an opportunity of working in the English harvest fields now.  They are on the spot to engage in this work if the money is available, and if schemes are put up.</P>
    <P>I think anyone familiar with the conditions under which those people exist knows there is not sufficient labour to employ them on the farms.  They and their sons are anxious to get work, and the work is there to be done.  There is a vast amount of improvement to be done in the congested areas.  Bog roads have to be made; bogs and rivers have to be drained.  That class of work can be done now in the summer time.  Those three months, from now to October, are the lean months in the country, and I strongly support the amendment of Deputy Johnson.  It can be more advantageously done now than later on, and I hope the Minister for Agriculture, who knows the conditions quite well in those areas, will use his influence with the Minister for Finance to have this amount increased rather than we should wait till the close of the financial year and the coming of winter.  The Minister yesterday practically admitted that it would be necessary towards the end of the financial year to come to the Dáil again for an increase in this vote.  People who <Col N="149" /> know the conditions in the western area well, will support the suggestion that now is the time to get those works started.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughColohan" hpid="Mr. COLOHAN Mr. COLOHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Johnson's motion.  I think the Minister for Local Government will agree that I kept this question of unemployment constantly before him for the last two years.  Last year my efforts were rewarded with some degree of success, but this year, from the point of view of employment, conditions are worse than ever in County Kildare.  The Board of Health and the other local authorities in Kildare sent up on the 14th February last a deputation to the Minister for Local Government.  Since then they have not had any satisfactory replies from him with reference to the views put before him on that date, and they complained very bitterly of the discourtesy of the Minister.  On the 22nd April I enclosed letters to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and the Minister for Industry and Commerce from the three secretaries of our union in Athy, Newbridge and Naas.  Beyond a reply from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and a grant from the motor taxation fund of £11,562, we have had nothing.  The grant, when spread over the county, is very small.  In that letter to the two Minister I said:</P>
      <P>I enclose letters from the Secretaries of Athy, Droichead Nua and Rathangan branches of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, giving the numbers of unemployed in their branch areas&mdash;954 in Athy and about the same number in Droichead Nua.</P>
      <P>In North Kildare all the towns and villages, including Naas, Sallins, Johnstown, Kill, Clane, Straffan, Rathcoffey, Celbridge, Maynooth, Leixlip, Kilcock, Rathangan, Allenwood, Broadford, Johnstown Bridge, Enfield, Moyvalley, and the large rural area of Carbury, have a large quota of workless men, numbering over 1,000.  This brings the total number of unemployed in the county to well over 3,000.  Add to this the number dependent on their labour and you have at least 10,000 people in a state of semi-starvation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> The deputation which waited on you from the local public authorities in Kildare on the 14th February last pointed out to you the condition of the county generally, and suggested several schemes to relieve the situation, viz.: road improvement, land drainage and improvement, including afforestation, the re-opening of Ballymore-Eustace Woollen Mills and the assisting of Leixlip Flock Mills in providing employment for a large number of hands by imposing a tariff on foreign fibre, also the providing of new and the subsidising of existing industries.</P>
    <P>I have called your attention to this lamentable state of poverty on many occasions recently knowing that you feel for the unemployed in their hardship and suffering.  Therefore, I would earnestly ask you to give this problem your immediate and sympathetic consideration and do all you can to have a large grant allocated to the county so that all areas may receive a share of employment. I would strongly urge on the Government the necessity of starting the sugar-beet industry in County Kildare.</P>
    <P>South Kildare is a large tillage district. I think it has a good claim on the Minister for the starting of that industry.</P>
    <P>On the 19th May last I wrote to the President.  He said he would see what could be done in the matter.  I sent him the following note:&mdash;</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in our conversation to-day, the Ministers for Local Government and Industry and Commerce have full particulars as to the amount of unemployment and distress in Kildare in my letters to them on the 22nd ultimo.</P>
    <P>We have fully 3,000 unemployed in the county, making with their dependents 10,000 people in a state of semi-starvation.  I would appeal to you on their behalf to have a sum of at least £15,000 forwarded to the county council, so that they may be able to relieve some of the destitution that exists.</P>
    <P>We have heard nothing since.  If the Government does not start some work <Col N="151" /> immediately we will have many deaths from starvation in the county.  A clergyman told me yesterday morning that he was surprised at the queues waiting outside the community kitchen, begging for food.  Last night a man whose business brings him in contact with most of the workers in the Newbridge area, said he could see from the pinched, drawn faces and wasting bodies of the children, that they were short of food and were slowly pining away.  This is not an overdrawn picture. I know many respectable working people in the town where I live, and they are actually starving in silence. I would urge the Government to make this money for road improvement available at once.  There is no use putting it off from month to month.  We heard from the Minister for Agriculture last year, just before the elections, that he was introducing those schemes, and that he would have work started in fourteen days.  I want to inform him that some of the work promised at that time has not been started yet.  I would earnestly press upon the Government to increase this Vote so that we will have employment all over the county, and not alone on the trunk roads, because we must get into the rural areas where the people are starving in their cabins.  I make this appeal, and possibly it will be the last one, because up till now such appeals have had very little success.</P>

      <P>I, too, have a grievance as regards the County Cork.  Deputy Colohan speaks of Kildare as being very hard hit.  Kildare was a great British military centre and the removal of the military has left a legacy of unemployment which cannot be got over for a long time.  Now, Buttevant almost owes its existence to a large barracks which formerly accommodated 1,200 or 1,400 British soldiers. When these soldiers left, the people around Buttevant set to work and they claim that they were the pioneers of the sugar beet industry in this country, which we now hear so much about. The Deputy was wasting his sweetness on the desert air when he spoke about establishing a sugar beet industry in <Col N="152" /> any other district, because such a proposal was never heard of until some brainy men from Buttevant thought of it.  You cannot beat the County Cork people.  In Fermoy also there is a legacy of unemployment owing to the departure of the British soldiers. Thanks to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government, small grants have been made to that district lately, and I am grateful to the Ministers for them.  Cobh has also been very hard hit by the departure of the British soldiers and sailors, and there are thousands of people idle there. Worse still, other labourers in the county are now going to be deprived of a lot of money that used formerly be spent on the by-roads.  Some of the by-roads are very important roads, because they are the roads that are generally used by the ratepayers who pay for the upkeep of all the roads.  I am told that where £60 was spent on a by-road last year only £20 will be spent this year, and that the other £40 will be spent on the main and trunk roads for the benefit of the motor lorries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently there is to be no regard for the people who have to drive to Mass on a Sunday on the by-roads, and for the people who are working on the direct labour schemes in the country districts.  I should like to know if it is a fact that there is to be a reduction in the money allocated to the by-roads.  If such a reduction is in contemplation, I ask that it should not be put into force this year when there is so much unemployment and distress, and that the full money should be spent on the by-roads. I ask the Minister for Local Government to allow the same amount of money that was spent previously on the by-roads to be spent on them this year. The Minister can increase the grant for the trunk roads if he likes&mdash;that would be necessary, too&mdash;but whatever he does he should not forget the by-roads. They are not by-roads in the real sense of the word.  They are called by-roads perhaps because they are not the main roads running directly from Cork to Dublin or some other large centre.  They run from the different towns and villages to the houses of the ratepayers and are the roads which the ratepayers <Col N="153" /> use for markets and fairs.  It would not be economy to reduce the amount spent on these roads, because if they are allowed to go into disrepair this year it will cost three times as much next year to put them into repair again.  I ask the Dáil and the Minister to remember that there is terrible distress in County Cork owing to the causes I have enumerated.</P>

      <P>The debate seems to be travelling into by-roads.  I do not want to talk about Cork or Kildare and, to be even more original, I do not want to talk about my own constituency. I want to support Deputy O'Connell's plea for some special consideration to be given to the West.  This Estimate for the relief of distress was, very possibly, adequate when it was framed.  It took final shape, presumably, about the end of March.  In the West of Ireland the month of February, to a certain extent, and the month of March, to a great extent, were both fine months.  There was fine weather at a time when it was least needed, and conditions looked fairly hopeful for the summer.  Since the beginning of April there has been practically incessant rain.  I do not want to exaggerate, but a great part of the work on the land has been at a stand-still.  Whether it be the labourers, the small farmers, or the large farmers, they are faced with a very serious situation unless there comes an almost immediate change in the weather.  I think the Minister for Lands and Agriculture will probably bear me out in that.  The situation is the more serious because for the last two or three years farmers in all parts of Ireland, but particularly farmers in the West, have been living on their accumulated resources.  The profits that were made during the war are practically vanished, and the prospect of a third bad summer in the West is a prospect of a situation that will place a terrible responsibility on the shoulders of every Deputy and, in particular, on the shoulders of responsible Ministers.  I think the Minister for Finance will admit that I am not an alarmist, but all I have heard from the West does frighten me profoundly.  We seem to be faced with one of these cycles of bad weather <Col N="154" /> and distress that come from time to time, that came in 1846, in 1879, and I think it is very questionable whether the reduced amount provided in the Estimate will be adequate to meet the distress that arises.</P>
      <P>I should like to say a word particularly for the county Leitrim.  Leitrim is, I think, almost the poorest county in Ireland, because, while it shares the bad land and the unfavourable uneconomic condition of every western county, it has none of the resources of the other counties.  Tirconaill and Galway are poor, but they have fishing.  Connemara has tourist traffic, and Tirconaill and Sligo have tourist traffic.  In these and the other congested counties something has been done to establish cottage and rural industries, but in Leitrim very little has been done.  There is only about four miles of seaboard, no fisheries, and very few rural industries. It is not one of those picturesque counties to which large numbers of tourists go and bring money.  It has very little to offer in the way of sport.  I think some greater provision than is allotted in the Estimate will have to be made for the congested counties as a whole, and for Co. Leitrim in particular. Therefore, I shall support Deputy Johnson's motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance dealt with the case to some degree last night and attempted to show that there were moneys in the Estimates which would go a long way to relieve the situation in the towns. He pointed to certain increases in the Vote for Public Works over last year of about £200,000; that certain sums would be spent for drainage, some of the moneys being in respect of Bills that have not yet been introduced, the moneys that he hoped would be spent before the financial year is out&mdash;that is, some time during the winter&mdash;in respect of sugar beet proposals.  He also mentioned a figure of £500,000 or £600,000, which he estimated would be spent this financial year&mdash;between now and the end of March next&mdash;in relation to the Shannon electricity proposals. We are all very glad to hear again this year that these large sums are to be spent in the employment of labour on <Col N="155" /> constructive works.  We hope that this year they will be spent, but there is no promise in any statement made by the Minister that work will be available for any large proportion of the men at present unemployed during the next three months.  Not many men and fewer children can live without food for three months.</P>
      <P>I want to put that to the Minister as almost the most serious problem that has to be faced.  We have the numbers who are registered as unemployed, stated to be about 50,000 more or less. We cannot check the figures accurately. We have a very large number in addition who are not registered, but I am prepared to base any case I have to make on the registered unemployed and to reiterate that a large number of these have been unemployed for a very long time, and that a large number of these are the class who up to two or three years ago were in constant or fairly regular employment and who cannot be accused of being shy of work.  I do not mind the figures. Figures are not of the utmost importance. I say if you have 1,000 out of 50,000 in that position, and if they are deprived of unemployment insurance by virtue of their long period of unemployment and have exhausted all benefits from Trade Unions and savings of any kind, these men are now absolutely without resources.  You deny them insurance benefit, and we demand that you must provide work.  It is no use talking of what is going to happen during this financial year and hoping that in the winter certain sums will be spent and that labour will be absorbed in employment.  The nearer to the truth that statement is the more reason there is for reinsuring.  The greater the possibilities there are of general employment the less charge there will be on any insurance fund that may be reestablished. If you refuse to re-establish an insurance fund, and if you refuse to bring these men into benefit, then there is no other alternative, if you are going to fulfil your function as a Government, but to provide something in the nature of public work, and more particularly, public work of a useful character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="156" /> The £115,000 in this Estimate has been allocated.  It is mainly the residue of works that were contemplated or begun last year.  The Minister can rightly say that he does not want to have voted a large sum of money for relief schemes without any schemes.  It is not our fault that there are no schemes.  There are schemes.  Minister after Minister has submitted schemes. They have not been brought to the Dáil. We know that Departments have submitted schemes and that what is required is money.  I say unless we are going to see that something is done for the unemployed men during these months the chances of making any big hole in the number of unemployed in the winter are not anything like so great as the Minister would suggest.  It is not usual to find public works begun in the winter in preference to the summer. It is very unusual.  Miracles happen, and it may be that the Ministry will go as far as they can to the performance of a miracle next winter.</P>
    <P>I press with the utmost earnestness upon the Ministry that they are bound to enlarge this Vote and to provide moneys for public works of such a nature as would absorb large numbers of the unemployed during the summer. If that is not done, then I say the Ministry are failing utterly in their responsibilities and I will not continue to be responsible for even maintaining silence or to act as a check upon agitation in the country, which may assume any proportions and any form which I know not of.  It is pitiable to get the letters and communications that one gets daily in respect of men who never knew what hunger or semi-hunger was.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister for Finance and other members of the Ministry have had some experience&mdash;if they have not actually seen it at close quarters&mdash; of the state that a workman gets into when there is long continued unemployment. They have had experience I am sure, of how his whole life becomes miserable.  His wife and children become ill from half-feeding; the family belongings begin to leave him, and he is utterly depressed and utterly useless in the world.  He feels himself useless and in fact he becomes useless, whereas hitherto he was a self-supporting, <Col N="157" /> capable citizen.  Are you really going to make large numbers of men utterly depressed and useless as citizens or are you going to give them an opportunity of retaining their self-respect and becoming better citizens?  This proposition has not been met as seriously by the Government as it ought to have been.  Each different Ministry has had its own problems, but as far as I can see there has been no attempt made to meet this problem as a whole. It has not been said: &ldquo;Here are large numbers of men we will have to find work for, and how best are we to do it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There has been no attempt at coordinating Departmental responsibilities, and facing the necessities of the situation.  I maintain it is the bounden duty of the Government to take this matter up without further delay, and to set in operation the works of which they have the plans.  Each Department has one or several plans of public work, and the obstacle lies in the unwillingness to find the finance.  If we do not find finance for this work it will have to be found for something else which will not be of much credit to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHenrikBeamish" hpid="Mr. BEAMISH Mr. BEAMISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BEAMISH</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard this plea of unemployment.  We are all agreed regarding the problem of unemployment, but we have only heard up to the present one side of the question. Only one part of the picture has been described.  We have been told by Deputy Johnson that if the Government do not find some solution immediately all kinds of horrible things are going to happen.  The threat is at once put forward in regard to horrible things, organised meetings, and so on.  Deputy Johnson has perfectly fairly pleaded the cause of unemployment, but I think it is up to him to show what his side is going to do provided the money is produced by the Government.  The plea that has been put forward is a perfectly fair and honourable plea, and it was put extremely carefully and well by Deputy Johnson.  At the same time, I think the State requires a little more than the statement that people are starving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State ought to demand from the <Col N="158" /> leader of the Labour Party a clear understanding as to what is going to be the attitude of the labourers whom he pleads for, and whom he says ought to be given some work to keep them from a state of starvation.  The pressure in that respect from his side is all right, and his demand is a proper one; but there are always two sides to every account, as far as I understand bookkeeping methods, and we cannot put on one side an extra £100,000 without having it balanced in the matter of value from the point of view of work received. In certain circumstances it is perfectly reasonable that £100,000 should be spent in order to alleviate starvation in the country.  We ought to demand, however, on behalf of the State, that in return for the £100,000 we should get good value, fair and honourable value.  The money ought not to be voted by the Dáil without having some obligation on the part of those towards whom it is voted.  We are bound in the interests of the State to ask Deputy Johnson, the leader of the Labour Party, to let us know concisely what value we are going to get if this money is voted.  That is only a reasonable demand.  It means, in other words, that we are seeking a proper day's work for a proper day's pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BEAMISH</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that the average employer in this country demands rather better efficiency in the matter of work.  I am not accusing the Labour leader, Deputy Johnson, of anything.  I am only asking him to assume a position in which he will state, if this money is passed, that we will get full value for it.  There have been complaints.  Everybody knows about them, and all the members of the Labour Party know that, too.  Do not let us humbug ourselves by flinging words across at each other.  We do not want to do that.  I hope we are all friends.  We want a definite and a clear understanding that if extra money is spent for the alleviation of starvation&mdash;and it is a perfectly reasonable thing that that should be done&mdash;a certain amount of value ought to be attached to it.  That is not an unfair demand for the Dáil to make.  It is not an unfair question to ask of Labour. We want value for any money that is spent.  I can quite understand the temptations that exist.  Where there are great numbers of unemployed, the men who are employed are naturally anxious to get the unemployed at work. That is perfectly clear and I can quite understand it.  My attitude, however, is that where we are asked for an additional sum in order to alleviate the troubles of the Labour Party, Deputy Johnson should state that if the increase is granted by the Minister for Finance there will be a fair return by way of work; at all events we must have some guarantee that we will get an average day's work.  In spite of members of the Labour Party jumping up, I do not think they are against that principle themselves; I do not think they would be against anything <Col N="161" /> like that.  If they want to give a good day's work they will agree.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the amendment put forward by Deputy Johnson.  I want to say that I consider that the speech delivered by the last Deputy is an enigma, so far as I am concerned.  I really do not know what it means.  He alleges, or he uses, words which would permit of anybody inferring that this party, representing the workers directly here, are advocating a ca' canny policy.  I think it has been stated from these benches time after time that we have always advocated, and will continue to advocate, that there should be a fair day's work for a <Col N="162" /> fair day's pay.  I take it now, as I have made that statement, that Deputy Beamish will stay in this House and vote with us on this amendment, because in essence that is what he says&mdash; that if we declared our policy, in so far as he was concerned, he would vote for the amendment.  He has gone further and advocated that every Deputy in the Dáil should do so.  A few weeks ago I asked a certain question in connection with unemployment benefit, and I was given certain figures.  Last week Deputy Johnson put down a question something on similar terms, and received the same answer.  I want to state here now that, so far as I know, these figures are absolutely inaccurate. I do not mean to say that either the President or the Minister for Industry and Commerce has consciously given inaccurate figures.  They were the only figures at the Minister's disposal.  He gave the figures as he found them in the Unemployment Exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are hundreds and thousands of people walking the streets of our towns and the roads of our villages day after day who have never been registered in an Unemployment Exchange, and who are slowly starving to death.  I would ask Deputy Beamish if he makes any endeavour when he goes home to his constituency at the week-ends to get into touch with these unfortunate people, or has he a better environment to live in than they have? In our constituencies we have to listen to the same pitiful tale of woe.  There is no necessity for us to listen to it, because we see in the faces of the unfortunate men, women and children in the country week after week when we go home that they are slowly starving to death.  I say it is the duty of the Government, even if there was only one thousand unemployed in the State, to do something to relieve distress.  So far as the dole is concerned, we have never advocated it as such, but so long as work is not provided it is the duty of any Government to provide for the unemployed.  We heard before we got a Government of our own that the unemployed and the workers were to be the first charge on the State, but we are sorry to say that such is not the fact.  In England and the North of <Col N="163" /> Ireland the dole system in its entirety is continued.  Uncovenanted benefit prevails in these two areas, and one would expect that in a country with such a written democratic constitution as we have the workless and the unemployed generally would be better looked after.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beamish has talked a lot about the inefficiency of the workers, and says that it is generally admitted that there is a slacking policy prevalent all over the country, so far as the workers are concerned. I do not think that is the case.  There may be places where some workers pull a little now and again.  I suppose that is only human nature.  I do not countenance, nor, I am sure, does anybody on these Benches countenance, such a policy. Deputy Beamish told us nothing at all about the inefficiency of some of the employers in this State, although he professes to speak perfectly fairly as far as everybody is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beamish, the next time he goes to Cork, should go amongst the people and find out the actual conditions, how they are living, try to help them, and come back here to the Dáil and give a true reflection of the actual conditions.  That is the duty of every member of the House, no matter what party he belongs to.  I ask the Government do they seriously try to realise the situation that prevails in this country? I ask the Ministers to go down to their constituencies this week-end and endeavour to find out what conditions the people are living under.  Possibly if they do that they will come back to the House, to urge unhesitatingly upon the Ministry to put up a large sum of money, not as a dole, but to reconstruct the roads of the country.  That is badly needed.</P>
    <P>I do not think we are asking too much.  We are merely asking that the workingmen should be given the right to work and live in their own country. I resent the silence, and I am rather sorry for the silence that prevailed up to this amongst the members of the Government Party.  I do think they should make themselves felt in their <Col N="164" /> own Party ranks with a view to bringing pressure to bear on the Government in order to relieve the destitution that prevails at present.  A sum of £115,000 is down here for the relief of unemployment.  Most of it is allocated, which is tantamount to saying that it is already spent, or almost spent.  Last year we had the Unemployment Insurance Act in operation.  Various people were drawing relief, and on top of that there was a sum of £500,000 voted for distress.  This year the Unemployment Insurance Act, to all intents and purposes, for the great majority of the people, has been discontinued, and we have only £115,000 voted for relief of distress, some of which has been either allocated or spent already.  I would appeal to the Government to tackle this thing seriously.  At the present moment the unemployed are the greatest menace to the State.  They are susceptible to the influences of people who are trying to undermine the State and are being used with that object by these people.  In the interest of the stability of the State itself, it is absolutely essential that the Government should get into touch with the situation and tackle it fearlessly.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the amendment, and in doing so I want to call attention to a matter which I reported to the Minister for Lands and Agriculture in January last. It is with reference to the flooding out of their homes of 40 families from Portumna to Shannon Bridge on the Galway side of the Shannon.  The Minister promised to send down an inspector to inspect and report on the conditions then existing.  He did so, and as far as I understand, that inspector promised to make a report in favour of the making of a road in a place called Reisk.  Since then nothing has been done to relieve the people in their distress.  I will now read a letter which I received this morning with reference to the sad state of affairs existing there at present:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Right">&ldquo;Reisk, Eyrescourt, Co. Galway,</P>
      <P Just="Right">1/6/'25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir,&mdash;We have again to bring to your notice the condition of this place at present.  It is just the <Col N="165" /> same as you saw it last January, all flooded to the doors.  Rents and rates had to be fully paid, and all crops were lost last year.  This year seems to be the worst of all.  Our grazing and meadow will be useless this year. We now appeal to you to speak to the Minister for Lands and Agriculture and see if it is his intention to do anything to relieve the distress existing in this place.  We were told by Mr. Gamble and Fr. Leahy that a new line of road was to be made through Reisk and Carty.  If that was done it would relieve the present distress.  Let me know by return what is to be done, as it is the intention of the people to leave the place altogether if something is not done.  I can assure you there are a few families in the place in a very bad state, and they cannot exist much longer if something is not done.  I am asked by the people to demand an immediate reply from you, if you can do anything.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;Yours respectfully,</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;JAMES NEVIN.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Lands and Agriculture will do something to remedy this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am called upon to corroborate the statement which Deputy Colohan has made as to the position in County Kildare.  I do not believe that he has exaggerated the conditions in the least.  When it is considered that in the centre of that county there were three or four very large military establishments, which often accommodated from 20,000 to 25,000 men, we can readily understand how within a pretty wide radius of these military establishments there grew up a large population composed mainly of skilled and unskilled workers, who earned their living either directly or indirectly from these establishments. That, however, is nearly all gone now, though, of course, there is a small military establishment at the Curragh, but it is nothing compared with the former establishment.  These people have been very hard hit.  They were not agricultural labourers to any extent, and they have been deprived of <Col N="166" /> their employment, with the result that some have gone on the dole and others have received home help.  The amount of home help dispensed in County Kildare has assumed alarming proportions. It is a matter of great importance to have work given to these people, and I am sure that they would much rather earn a day's pay for reproductive work than to have recourse to the dole or home help.  I regard it as a great pity that the drainage of the Barrow has not been set on foot, as it would give a large amount of work, or, if not the Barrow, then some other schemes which are equally badly needed, and which would give great employment.  I am sure the Minister realises that £115,000 would not meet the situation. I think it would be well if he reconsidered the position, and, in view of the statements, perfectly genuine and honest statements, made here, he might perhaps see his way to increase the Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to put too much stress on a narrow technical point, but I do not think it is a procedure which can be adopted, namely, to have estimates which are put forward in the normal way referred back, or refused to be passed, by the Dáil simply because they may not seem to meet the circumstances of the particular moment when they come up for consideration. All these estimates have to be prepared in February or March, and, as a matter of fact, if we were actually up to time in their preparation, they would be prepared in January.  It would not be proper to send them back, because there had been changes since the time of their preparation.  Where it turns out that there is an estimate in excess of the amount required, the sum in excess is surrendered, but attempts should be made to make it no more than is necessary.  If the amount turns out to be less than that required, there is the method of supplementary estimates. We have had many supplementary estimates during our period of office and we never hesitated to come forward when money was actually wanted.  This particular sum was provided <Col N="167" /> really to enable works, either undertaken or sanctioned, to be carried out.  The idea was not to provide money at large for relief schemes, but to give employment as far as possible by other means.  I indicated those other means last night.  There is a considerable sum down in the estimates which will be spent by the Board of Works on buildings. We will, for instance, have a considerable number employed before long in Dublin on the reconstruction of the Post Office and certain reconstruction works in the Four Courts, and we will have in nearly every county men at work on the rebuilding of Civic Guard barracks.  There will be a very considerable sum spent on the Shannon scheme.  There is a sum of something like £200,000 in the Land Commission Vote for improvement works which will be spent in giving employment in various counties, especially in the poorer districts where land will be taken and divided up.  There is a very big sum to be spent out of the resources of the Road Fund, mainly on trunk roads.  That sum amounts at least to £750,000, if not more.  There is, at least, £100,000 available for the improvement loans to farmers, and that will result in employment.  Improvement loans are now being taken for drainage schemes under the Drainage Maintenance Act, the work on which will begin immediately. In the case of Owenmore, there is a sum of about £12,000 available. There will be housing grants all over the country.  There will be money spent on a sugar factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although a certain amount of time must elapse before the benefits from the protective duties show results, they certainly will begin to give some increase of employment before the lapse of any considerable time.  We have given notice to the Dáil also of the introduction of an estimate for the purpose of giving advances to credit societies as a means of relieving distress caused by fluke.  As the Minister for Lands and Agriculture said to me, it might be necessary to meet that in at least one other way.  It is very difficult to find a method of dealing with such a thing so that the State can properly <Col N="168" /> enter on it, but, as has been said, the one way that distress can be met without the State being involved in transactions which might lead to results both in expenditure and on public opinion that might not be good, would be to do something by way of suitable works in certain districts.  We might have to do that.  If this season were to be like last season, the sum passed last year would not suffice.  It would be necessary, in my view, to pass, not alone this sum of £115,000 or £100,000, but very much greater sums, if the weather this year were to correspond to that of last year.  It seems to me the only possible way to deal with it would be by a supplementary estimate.  It is possible to find money for schemes, other than those which have been sanctioned, for this £115,000 will not be spent for a considerable time.  Some of the works on which it is designed to expend money are works which will extend over a considerable time, and the last of these will not be required for some considerable time.  It is possible, so far as the money is concerned, actually to do the works at once where there is an extreme need for them, and where the actual details of the works are ready.  What I would suggest to the Dáil on the question of this Estimate is that the proper way to meet the situation is not by refusing to entertain this Vote now, and by referring it back for consideration, but for the matter to be taken up with a view to seeing whether a supplementary Vote is required before the Dáil adjourns, and if it is required, what amount it is going to be, because if the weather conditions were to be good, for instance, it would certainly be very much less than what would be required if the weather conditions were like those of last year.  It seems to me that a good deal of the discussion here was based on the idea that we should have a big distress vote, no matter what provision was made elsewhere for giving employment by way of relief work.  I do not think we should get into the position of stereotyping a big Vote for relief work.  I would rather have a small Vote for that purpose, or no Vote if possible.  It often happens that <Col N="169" /> money spent on relief works has not the best results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying to provide for that.  We have development work, such, for instance, as the Shannon scheme, and we are trying to get ahead with the Barrow scheme.  We have sums running into £37,500 for actual drainage works under the Drainage Maintenance Acts, and on particular drainage schemes we have £100,000, or so, down for drainage by loans under the Land Improvement Act.  There are considerable sums down that are calculated actually to give employment during this year, and in certain cases to give employment immediately, as in the case of the Shannon. Undoubtedly there is an element of delay, and there will be some time in which no employment will be given.  It seems to me that it comes down to the question at the moment of the gap that must exist before some of these things can be got going&mdash;before building operations are started under the provisions in the Board of Works Vote, before the Shannon scheme is started, and before the scheme in connection with the trunk roads is settled, and the money is being sent out by the Local Government Department.  If, on further examination, it seems to be necessary that there should be a supplementary Vote the Dáil has something like a month still to go before the adjournment, and there is ample time for the introduction of a supplementary Estimate, when we can have in view all the facts that we can gather in regard to the situation.  Even a lapse of three weeks might have a considerable effect on the view that has to be taken, and the amount required.  Three weeks of steadily-bad weather would cause an entirely different view of the necessities of the case to what would be taken if we had three weeks of excellent weather.  We will have some idea within that time of the employment that is going to be given immediately as the result of Budget changes, but if we are going to refer back Estimates in the light of developments that occur from <Col N="170" /> week to week after the publication of the Estimates, it becomes somewhat farcical to publish Estimates at all, for nearly every one of them can, in a greater or lesser degree, be shown now to be capable of modification.  At the appropriate time of the year we simply must make the best calculation we can as to the sum required, and we must issue our Estimates and bring them forward, and have a discussion on them. If it is found that amendments of these Estimates are required by way of increase, that can be done by way of supplementary Estimates.</P>

      <P>We hope to do some work on the Barrow this year, but the Parliamentary Secretary has explained that there is not a detailed scheme for the Barrow.  When we got our engineers at work we found that there is still a considerable amount of work to be done before we are in a position to have the Barrow scheme as advanced as the Shannon scheme.  The big work of the drainage cannot be undertaken this year.  The most that will be undertaken is the preliminary work, and we have available in the vote of the Board of Works a sum of about £50,000 for doing that work on the Barrow.</P>

      <P>This vote is for a contribution towards the relief of unemployment and distress, and it refers to miscellaneous schemes.  We are not asked for a vote for any special scheme. This is to vote a lump sum for miscellaneous schemes which might be brought forward at any time.  The Minister has played a good deal with the terms relief schemes and relief work. There is no other way, so far as I know, of expressing the views of the Dáil as to the necessity for immediately putting these schemes into operation, and not waiting until the autumn, than by referring this vote back with a view to increase.  I say that with this proviso, that if the Minister will tell the Dáil now that he does not confirm the position taken up by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce that there can be no replenishment of the Unemployment <Col N="171" /> Insurance Fund that would put a different complexion on the matter.  I am taking this line, because of the statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that there will be no replenishment of unemployment insurance funds to meet the necessities of the situation and the needs of those out of benefit.  As a consequence, there must be something in the way of work, and if the ordinary schemes are not going to be made operative for several <Col N="172" /> weeks, perhaps months, even perhaps years, then other schemes are required, schemes which have been submitted to the Minister for Finance and which only require money.  The plans for these are available.  I ask the House to send this Vote back, understanding that it is for miscellaneous schemes which the Ministry have in hand, and for which money can be found if the Ministry of Finance will agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not finished with this.  I want to move, at this stage, that this Vote be now reduced by £100.  I am not going to cover the ground I covered last night.  I am going to see if I can give a few more reasons as to why I am asking for this reduction.  My main point is because of what I may call the mal-administration of these moneys during the last financial year.  I have here the Official Debates of the 5th December, when this estimate was under discussion.  I had not at that time anticipated anything like what afterwards occurred. I did feel, perhaps, that there was a possibility of districts not getting fair play, apart from political considerations altogether.  I did not honestly think that political considerations would weigh, but I did fear that districts would not get fair play according to the distress that existed and the number of unemployed.  I suggested then to the Minister for Lands and Agriculture that there was a danger that the best would not be got out of these moneys.  I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" />&ldquo;I do not know whether it is proposed to spend the money through the county councils or what the method will be, but this is a point of view that should be kept in mind, and if it were possible it would be right to go as far as trying to ascertain through the present clerks of district councils or some other way how many people there are in town and country who are prepared to work, and who want work, before any scheme would be devised for the relief of distress in any district.  If you have a thousand men who want work in one district it would not be fair to spend the same amount in that district as where there are only 200 men.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the view I put forward.  The Minister, in his reply, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I want Deputies to remember also that the Land Commission could not guarantee to find work in every district where there are unemployed. Deputy Baxter suggested that we should get a census of the number unemployed and give work to them in strict proportion.  Deputy Cooper made a suggestion that we should go in for drainage work like that at the Owenmore, but any farmer will tell you that you cannot work on a drainage scheme in winter, and especially in this month (December). On the other hand, you have Deputy Cooper's suggestion that we should concentrate large sums of money in one particular district, and, on the other, Deputy Baxter's, that there should be an exact census taken of the unemployed, and that the money should be divided accordingly.  We can do neither.  The Land Commission can only spend money where they have work.  They will take into consideration as far as they can that a certain area is poor, and that, consequently, money should be spent there, if we have work there.  But they cannot do it in that entirely accurate and scientific way that Deputy Baxter suggests.  Neither do they propose to do it by concentrating all the money in one little area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think any system at all was employed as regards discovering the <Col N="174" /> number who wanted work and the amount of distress existing, or anything else, in the districts where the money was to be spent.  There was no discrimination between the man who had no work and the man who might be thought to be well off.  There was no discrimination like that.  As a matter of fact, I think I am putting it clearly when I say that there was no system followed in the allocating of these works, or any attempt to keep in mind the amount of distress that existed in a district, or whether the work was necessary or not.  There was no discrimination between the people who ought to be employed and the people who ought not to be employed.  At least, that was not the basis on which the money was allocated.  I say, as I said last night, that the money was allocated, distributed, and spent from the political point of view.</P>
    <P>I made a reference last night to the publication of the notice of a public meeting on the occasion of President Cosgrave's visit to Cavan.  I have since been able to secure that notice, and I will put the notice to the House.  I will let the House see what it contains, and I will leave the House to judge whether it does not sound more like a Government proclamation than a notice convening a meeting of a political party.</P>
    <P>This is on the 7th of February.  I want to point out that the debate on relief took place on 5th December.  On the 5th December the Minister suggested that there was no possibility of taking the census that I suggested.  I do not know whether the Minister will say now whether or not he was in a position between the 5th December and 7th February to have the census I suggested taken.  I think sensible men will agree that it was easily possible.  The notice of the meeting is headed &ldquo;Cumann na nGaedheal.&rdquo; It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>President Cosgrave will visit Cavan on Sunday, 8th February, and will address the meeting, already announced to be held in the Town Hall, Cavan, at the hour of 3 p.m., in support of Dr. O'Reilly, Cumann na nGaedheal candidate for Cavan.  Dr. O'Reilly, the candidate for Cavan. <Col N="175" /> Mr. J. J. Walsh, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs; Mr. Hogan, Minister for Lands and Agriculture; Captain Henry Harrison, and Mr. Eamon Duggan will address the meeting.</P>
    <P>What follows is the important part:</P>
    <P>All deputations will be received by the President from 2 to 3 o'clock in the Farnham Hotel.  The meeting will start at 3 o'clock sharp.  A County Convention will be held immediately afterwards, at which the President will preside.  Let each Cumann have its proper representation present, so that its area may now be attended to by Commissioners recently appointed to deal with land inspection and distribution, and also have their claims investigated for their share of money to be expended on relief works in areas where destitution exists.</P>
    <P>Deputies on the Government Benches may smile, but I ask any Deputy if that is not more like a Government proclamation than anything else.  Is it not more like a statement that would appear outside the Gárda Síochána barracks, that representatives of a Government Department would come down officially to take a census of what the conditions were?  Is it not more like a statement of that kind than a publication that should appear on behalf of a political organisation.</P>
    <P>Deputies may have in mind different standards as regards these matters. But that is my standard.  It may not be the standard of some of the Government Deputies, but I take it that it was never the intention of any man standing for this State, that its affairs should be administered by, or through, a political organisation.  Whether the Executive Council gave countenance at that meeting to that policy or not, I do not know.  I was not there.  I do not know exactly what happened.  But they gave countenance to it when they appeared at a meeting of which notice was given in those terms.  The policy that was afterwards pursued certainly gave definite indication that they not only countenanced that policy at that meeting, but that they assisted and facilitated the spending of thousands of pounds later.  I said last night that it <Col N="176" /> was only men who were members of the Government organisation who had anything to say at all to the districts in which money was to be spent.  The Government organisation representatives in Cootehill district, Bailieboro' district, Cavan district, and down through West Cavan, could take an engineer by the arm, go into different districts, and allocate the moneys that were to be spent in these districts.  I do not know whether the Deputies I see on the other side of the House stand for a policy like that or not.  I am stating what is a fact, and if any members of the Ministry challenge me to produce any further facts, in accordance with Deputy Johnson's suggestion, I will be only pleased to do so. I say that that policy was pursued down there.  The money was allocated and spent by a political organisation. In how far officials of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, who came down there, had instructions to &ldquo;work in&rdquo; with that organisation or any other political organisation, I am not aware. I do not know what their instructions were.  I am just stating exactly what did happen.  I was requested to.</P>
    <P>As I said last night, I sent in 40 or 50 communications from all over the county.  I was requested to do so, and to ask to have the money spent in these districts.  Every single communication I received I sent to the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.  I left it to him, or those under his authority, to decide what should be done.  In one very particular case, I was invited, with my colleague, Deputy Cole, by a representative body of men&mdash;clergymen and men of different religious persuasions &mdash;to go into a certain district, see the conditions in the district and see whether we considered it advisable to start certain works there.  We went and saw.  We considered that these works might be carried out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Egan was later in the same locality.  We considered works which could be carried out, and we both reported what we considered ought to be done.  I can only say this, that what we reported ought to be done was not done, but what the political organiser of the Government Party later considered <Col N="177" /> should be done was done in that district.  The money was not spent where we thought it might be spent.  It was spent, not on a river, but in draining the bog of a certain individual who was considered to have a good deal of political influence in the district.  I will go a little farther with this just to prove conclusively the policy that is being pursued and in order that I may be able to hear from the other side of the House whether, in permitting this thing to continue, Deputies stand for honesty and clean administration in public affairs. I have here another report of a meeting which I propose to refer to. To a certain extent I can see that it is a little outside the scope of this Vote. Inasmuch as I expect the Minister for Lands and Agriculture will have something to say in reply to this, I quote it as another instance of the policy that is being pursued down there, and also in order to prove that the political organisation there has taken upon itself to say, and feels that it is in a position to say, what should be done.</P>
    <P>I have here, in the Cumann na nGaedheal column of a weekly paper, the report of a certain branch meeting. I will pass the report over to the Minister if he wants to see it.  The report states that a meeting was held in the hall, and that arising out of a report from the delegates who attended the public meeting addressed by Mr. Hogan, Minister for Agriculture, at Ballyconnell, Mr. So-and-so, who interviewed him on the question of land distribution, restoration of evicted tenants, and the heavy death rate of cattle and horses, with the suggestion that Government aid should be given to those who are unable to replace their losses by way of a grant or loan, received the following communication from Mr. Hogan, which was submitted to the meeting:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With further reference to my letter of the 20th February to you on the subject of lands in which Kildallon Cumann was interested, I have been informed by the Land Commission that the lands of Aughnacreevy have been referred to an inspector for a report, and that the lands of Dring and Drumlara, which are subject <Col N="178" /> to a Poor Law annuity, are now under consideration.</P>
    <P>The Report continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Hogan also wrote that evicted tenants should forward to the Secretary of the Land Commission a brief statement of the circumstances connected with their eviction, giving the name and the areas of land, name of landlord, and stating how and by whom the lands were at present used, with the request to have their cases considered.  With regard to the serious matter of fluke disease, the matter was having the most earnest care and attention. Some grievances in connection with the old age pension were discussed, and particulars of circumstances forwarded through our Organisation for further consideration.  The branch unanimously decided to ask&rdquo;&mdash;this is the point I want to call attention to&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. O'Rourke, county Secretary, to either attend the next meeting, or call in the meantime and make out a scheme of distribution of Dring farm similar to that made on Aughnacreevy farm.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What do you think about that?  That is the sort of thing that is going on. I am finding no fault with the Minister's communication.  It was straight and candid, and what I would expect the Minister to send out.  The point I want to make is this: that here are lands that apparently there is no intention of taking over.  A decision is arrived at, and a certain individual is put down as doing what the Land Commission forsooth are expected to do when they get the authority to do it. There is no appearance, even from the Minister's point of view, that the Land Commission will very soon have authority to do that.  That is the sort of thing that is going on all over.</P>

      <P>No, he is not, but he happens to be an employee of another Minister here, and he is one of those who allocated the moneys that were to be spent in each particular district.  The Minister for Finance last night suggested that I was not to be taken seriously: that I was magnifying things <Col N="179" /> and exaggerating.  That was not a fair statement for the Minister to make.  If the Minister thinks that I am exaggerating let his case and my case be submitted to a committee of the House.  I would even accept a majority from his own party.  Let both of us have an opportunity of submitting our cases to that committee, and if it is proved that I have exaggerated, it will then be quite time enough for him to charge me with exaggeration.  I maintain that I have not exaggerated in the slightest, nor have I given one-third of the facts that I could give.  I am taking particular pains not to go into all the byways that I might bring to the notice of the Dáil.  If the Minister suggests that I am not to be taken seriously, or that any other Deputy who stands up and charges the Government Party or any of the Ministries with, apparently, collaborating with their political organisation down the country in running this country's affairs regardless of and irrespective to what Deputies on the other side of the House think&mdash; if that is not to be taken seriously, then I say that the Minister has not heard the last word of this.  The Dáil is the only means that the people of the country have of giving vent to their opinions and of seeing that every section of the people will get fair play. If the Minister thinks that I should not avail of an opportunity like this, but that I should allow things like this to go on under my own eyes and under the eyes of others and not take notice of them, then he misunderstands me and my point of view.  If the Minister asks those people down the country even to repudiate what I charge them with, they will not do it, nor have they any intention of doing so.  In fact, they claim credit for doing it.  They take particular pains to make everyone believe that they can accomplish these things.  They make the point, not simply that they intend to be able to do these things, but that they can do them, and that takes some answering.  I would have to hear from the Minister responsible that the instructions issued to their inspectors have been carried out, and that if the inspectors acted differently they have not carried out <Col N="180" /> the instructions given them by the Ministry.</P>
      <P>As I said last night, if this country's local affairs are to be run through political organisations then this Dáil can serve no purpose, and it is better to dissolve it.  I have here another indication of what is in the minds of these people.  This Vote that we are asked to pass includes, I take it, a considerable sum of money that will be required to complete some works that are still unfinished.  The Minister told us that last night.  Some of this money is wanted then in order to fulfil promises that have already been given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to make a correction.  Perhaps the point is a minor one, but this money is not to fulfil promises that have been given so far as Land Commission works are concerned, but to complete works in actual progress&mdash;works that have been begun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it comes to the one thing.  Promises were given to do certain work, and the work was stopped.  I take it that the promise is only fulfilled when the work is completed. The peculiar point about this is that the local government elections are coming on now, and that very considerable capital is being made out of the fact that more works are going to be done&mdash;works that were partly done. These men say: &ldquo;We are going to get them completed for you.&rdquo; Although we had this debate on the 5th December last, the greater number of the works in my county were only started in or about the 1st March last.  In a few districts they were started somewhat earlier&mdash;about January last.  The 11th March was the date of the election. About the 1st March a very considerable number of works started, and I ask, because I do not know myself, if there was any significance in that? The Minister argued on the 5th December that it was not possible to get a census taken of the number of the unemployed. I do not know how long it would take to get a census of the unemployed, but I think a greater effort should have been made and more knowledge secured between the 5th December and the 11th March if there was a <Col N="181" /> desire to allocate money according to the districts where there was unemployment. That was not done.  I do not know what was the standard set by which men were to judge whether there was a necessity for works or not.  I do not know what the desire of the Ministry to have the money distributed impartially was.  Whatever the desire was I say again it was a political test, pure and simple, whether works would be started in a district or not, as the starting of the works was entirely dependent upon the effect that it was going to create.  I want to say further it was not always a consideration whether the man who got a position in the works was rich or poor.  It very often happened that a man who had at least enough got the position because his influence was going to be considerably greater than that of a man who was poor.  We had men at the start of the work who were responsible organisers of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party at the same time going about in the capacity of superintendent gangers and going round in motor cars from one district to another paying the men on the work.  Deputies can judge what impression this created on crowds in the districts where there were a number of unemployed and a number of other people, seeing these men, with money in their hands, going round paying for the work done.  What sort of an impression is that going to create?  What spirit are you going to breed in the country if you create a band of political mendicants, as the Minister for Finance said last night?  You can only blame the policy and the methods you are pursuing yourself.</P>

      <P>Deputy Baxter mentioned <Col N="182" /> my name in connection with the extraordinary accusations he was making against all and sundry connected with the Government.  I did happen to go to Cavan on two different occasions in connection with the late election.  I was present at meetings, and I heard the Minister for Finance speak.  I utterly repudiate the suggestion made by Deputy Baxter as to the Government Party, or any of those attached to the Government Party, being responsible for the state of affairs which he suggests existed.  As I said, I can only attribute his extraordinary accusations to a somewhat overheated imagination and to disappointment over the election.  But, of course, it is obviously very difficult for anybody to refute general charges, and although I listened to Deputy Baxter for the best part of an hour yesterday, and for a considerable time to-day, on this topic, he did not give one single concrete case.</P>

The Cavan election was held many months ago, and a great deal of water has passed under the bridges since then, yet he has waited many months and allowed this extraordinary state of corruption to exist, and has done nothing.  He has not been true to his constituency, and he has not acted with a sense of public duty and with a proper sense of the duty that he owes to the Dáil in this matter.  He should have taken steps to bring this matter before the Dáil on a previous occasion and have it thrashed out thoroughly.  Even now, when he does bring it forward, he gives no concrete instance of any corruption.  It was quite within his power to have raised this any night on the motion for the adjournment of the House.</P>

Surely, when Deputy Baxter and his friends lost the election, if they allege that malpractices have taken place, they should have taken action in the <Col N="184" /> courts, and dragged the whole thing into the light of day.  They have not had the courage to do that; they waited many months after, and then they come in here and make these vague, general allegations when they know that the people whom they attack cannot take any action against them.  Deputy Baxter makes use of the privileges of this House to make these charges.  If he has the courage of his convictions let him and his friends go outside.  Let them bring the malefactors into court, and prove their charges against them, instead of coming in this fashion and taking refuge in this House, and making allegations under privileged conditions against people who cannot answer them here because they are only hinted at.</P>

    <P>I say that if there is any truth at all in the accusations which Deputy Baxter is making against the Government, he himself is very gravely to blame for having allowed such a state of affairs to continue so long before he did anything about it.  I want to say, if it is necessary for me to repeat it for Deputy Baxter's edification, that I utterly repudiate such accusations as he has made.  To begin with, apart from any consideration of fairness or of public morality, it would be utterly stupid for any Government Party to utilise money in such a fashion as this. It would be bound, as Deputy Baxter himself admitted, to react on themselves. This practice would not be resorted <Col N="185" /> to by any commonsense people or people of decent morality, and for my part I can only say I consider that it is rather a pity that Deputy Baxter did not take the defeat in Cavan in a little more sporting spirit.</P>

      <P>I was in Cavan once during the election, not on the occasion that Deputy Baxter mentioned.  I met at least half-a-dozen deputations representing Cumann na nGaedheal branches, and the burden of the complaint of every one of them was that no one except members of the Farmers' Party could get work.  When I went down I found a fight raging, the Farmers' Party being by far the most vocal, as to who was responsible for the relief grants, and the supporters of the Government candidate seemed to be very excited, indeed, because Deputy Baxter had got in first.  The first thing I was told on my arrival was that Deputy Baxter rushed down immediately after the adjournment of the Dáil, held a meeting in a hall, and announced that he was responsible for securing a certain sum of money for relief work.  That was bruited all over the place.</P>

When I went down I found the combat raging between the two parties as to who was responsible for securing the relief grant.  The burden of the complaints of the supporters of the Government candidate was that the Farmers' Party had got away with it.  I was told that they were saying: &ldquo;Join the Farmers' Party and you will get work.

I admit that political parties take credit for all the good that is going, but we do not take it seriously afterwards.  I am now dealing distinctly with specific points, with statements made on political platforms by politicians on both sides.  We know that both sides claim that they have done everything for everybody, and I will pay a compliment to the Farmers' Party, by saying that as far as my experience down there went they were not behindhand. They were out to do everything for everybody, and everything that had been done for the last three years was done by the Farmers' Party, and more power to them.  The thing was a complete farce down there, and I told all parties that it was a complete farce.</P>
      <P>A month ago Deputy Baxter informed me in this House that he intended to raise this matter.  I said: &ldquo;If you have any charges whatever&rdquo;&mdash;I am sure he will bear me out in this &mdash;&ldquo;you should say so, but I think in fairness to me if you have any concrete charges you should let me have them.  I am the Minister responsible; I am responsible for what the Land Commission does, or what the Land Commission fails to do, and if you have any concrete charges, any instances, any examples of any malpractices by any officials of the Department of Agriculture I think in all fairness to me and in the interests of truth you should let me have them, so that I would have an opportunity of examining them and dealing with officials concerned.&rdquo;  Deputy Baxter informed me that he had not any concrete cases that he could give me.</P>

I had a conversation with the Deputy on this matter.  The Deputy never gave me an inkling of that.  We now hear it for the first time.  Deputy Baxter is a little innocent in ways, but he is not quite so innocent as all that.  I daresay it could happen in the history of Cavan that things would go wrong. Things go wrong every day.  But you can only keep things right in one way, that is by getting after them immediately they go wrong and by making the person responsible suffer.  But here, according to Deputy Baxter, is a case where funds got into the hands of a third party who had no right to them and who was allowed to pay Government employees with them.  Now we hear for the first time actually what the charge is.  The man met him on the road&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That will not do.  This is the first I have heard of it, and I venture to say this is the first that any Deputy in this House has heard of it. I am perfectly certain of that, and the <Col N="189" /> Deputy knows it.  I discussed this specific question with the Deputy.  I invited him to give me a concrete case. Here is a glaring example.  He comes along here now after three months and in the interests of pure government he comes out with this story.  He gives me no chance whatever of dealing with it. I invited him to do so.  I invited him to give me concrete cases.  I did not get them.  If there was any other Deputy on the Labour benches, or on any other benches, who knew of anything like this he could write to me, and if I did not give him satisfaction he could bring it up here, but notwithstanding the fact that I asked the Deputy to do so he now comes forward like an innocent with a cock-and-bull story.</P>

      <P>That is a little bit too thin.  The Deputy recommended that a river should be drained and lo!  a bog was drained instead.  That is more corruption. Let us have the name of the bog we should not have drained.  We have drained a great many bogs and the Deputy has discovered one bog that we should not have drained.  He cannot have it both ways.  I should like to have the name of the bog and good reasons why it should not have been drained.  I think the Deputy should take himself seriously.  When he makes serious charges of this sort he should at least give the circumstances.  The only charge we have heard is that a bog has been drained which should not have been drained.  We should have the name of the bog and the facts concerning it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>The charge I make is not that the bog was drained but that the political henchmen of the Government Party were in a position to go out to a district and get this thing done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not good enough.  It is not fair to the Land Commission officials, to me, and if I may say so, to the Deputy himself.  Give me the circumstances of the case.  There is nothing so easy to say as that it is <Col N="190" /> the political henchmen who got this, that, or the other thing done.  Let me have the name of the political henchman of this party who got that bog drained, which the Deputy said was drained.  Let me have his name, the name of the bog and all the circumstances connected with it.  But Deputy Baxter, no matter what any other Deputy may think, need not expect me to take him seriously if he comes along with general charges of that nature and does not give any particulars.  Every Deputy knows that in the administration of the Relief Vote, which only employs 5,000 men out of a total of 50,000, there is bound to be disappointment. One man is left out and another is brought in.  If the Twelve Apostles even administered it, a good deal of disappointment would be bound to arise. The same thing applies to the division of land.  For every farm divided there would be about three farmers disappointed, and each of those would see corrupt reasons for having been left out.  My hair would become grey if I took all those into consideration.  If anyone in the Dáil has any example of anything other than impersonal administration from the Land Commission, I would be extremely glad to have it and I guarantee it will not occur again.  I have the utmost confidence in the Land Commission.  I have been in touch with the administration of those relief works not only in Cavan but in every other county in which they took place, and I have nothing but admiration for the way the Land Commission administered those moneys from start to finish.  I say those relief works were well done and that we got particularly good value for the money.  That is the experience of every Deputy and I am not confining this remark to Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies.  I would like to hear what Deputies from Cork have to say about the administration there, or what Deputy O'Connell has to say about the administration in Connemara, and whether there was any political influence at work.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say how many men he had representing the Land Commission in Cavan, and what area they had in Cavan?  Would <Col N="191" /> he say how many works they were supposed to supervise and start, and the money they were provided with?</P>

      <P>I could not say anything of the kind.  There were from two to three men from the Land Commission off and on.  There were the same in Sligo and in Cavan for a while. There were some going from one place to another, and an overseeing inspector coming in as well.</P>
      <P>With regard to the advertisement which Deputy Johnson takes so seriously, and which he says the Government should repudiate, my standard may be low, but if that advertisement, or one fifteen thousand times as bad, appeared in a morning paper in this county once a week, I would not wet a pen to contradict it.  If the Government or Ministers have to go about correcting everything that is said even by their political party, they would have their hands full.  We do not take ourselves so seriously, and do not take what our political supporters say so seriously.  I suggest that if Deputy Johnson is so thin-skinned in those matters he ought not to read the &ldquo;Voice of Labour.&rdquo;  If I put it up to him to contradict hundreds of things written in favour of the Labour Party and against the Government Party, I am sure he would not.</P>

      <P>I would like to know whether it is seriously stated from the Government benches that the Cumann na nGaedheal is repudiated when it makes a statement to this effect:&mdash;The President will be present, also the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, and Mr. Eamon Duggan.  I will repeat what Deputy Baxter read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;All deputations will be received by the President from 2 to 3 o'clock in the Farnham Hotel.  Meeting will start at 3 o'clock sharp.  A county convention will be held immediately afterwards, at which the President will preside.  Let each Cumann have its proper representation present&rdquo; (present at a meeting at which the President will preside) &ldquo;so that its area may now be attended to by the <Col N="192" /> Commissioners recently appointed to deal with land inspection and distribution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The inference is that if the Cumann had not its representatives present the representations to the Land Commission would not be attended to.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And also have their claims investigated for their share of money to be expended on relief works in areas where destitution exists.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that the function of the President or of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture? Is it the function of the President during the time of a contested election to attend a Party Convention to receive representations so that the areas may now be attended to by the Commissioners recently appointed by the Land Commission for land inspection and distribution, and have their claims investigated for a share of money to be expended?  Does any Minister stand over that, or may I take it that the Minister repudiates the claim of Cumann na nGaedheal in any part of the country which makes any pretence that they have any influence with the Minister in respect to the division of land, the allocation of relief grants, or the expenditure of money? Will the Minister repudiate the claims of Cumann na nGaedheal that they have any more influence than any other Party?</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson is a little too innocent, and a little too fond of putting us in the same dilemma of the man who is asked: &ldquo;How long is it since you stopped beating your wife?&rdquo; We know that dilemma quite well.  It is not alleged that the President went down and divided this money.  No one has the cheek to allege that.  No one has the cheek to allege any wrongful act on the part of any member of the Government.  The question is, and Deputy Johnson knows well that the question is, whether we should repudiate advertisements issued by branches of the Cumann na nGaedheal in all parts of the country in all circumstances.  Deputy Johnson need not ask me, and he knows well he need not ask me, whether we appreciate our position sufficiently to realise that we must administer the money that is voted impartially. He knows well that it is not necessary to wait until June, 1925, in order to give that undertaking.  It is really trying to put us in the dilemma in which the man is put who is asked: &ldquo;How long is it since you stopped beating your wife.&rdquo;  He should have a little better foundation for a charge or suggestion of maladministration than a mere advertisement of some branch of the Cumann na nGaedheal down the country.  I would be long sorry to hold him responsible for all the statements and all the acts of every branch of the labour organisation here, there and everywhere.  We are not such children as all that.  I certainly am not going to go round Cavan, Galway, or any other county, to contradict what either the Farmers' Party or the Cumann na nGaedheal says.  I refuse absolutely at this stage to give any undertakings to <Col N="194" /> Deputy Johnson, because they ought not to be necessary.  I think he ought to know that we have sufficient appreciation of our position to administer the funds as they should be administered, and to realise that we are not the Government of any party, but the Government elected by the Dáil.  He knows well that we realise that position, and it is not necessary for us now to give undertakings in the matter.</P>

      <P>I can only repeat that the case that Deputy Baxter has made, particularly the case following, as I say, that advertisement, gives me the impression, notwithstanding the kind of repudiation that has come from the Ministerial benches, that there was an atmosphere of public corruption in the Cavan election, and that unless some inquiry is made it will appear that the Government and the administration at the time of an election did use a political organisation to assist the candidature of their party, because of the promise of this special expenditure of funds in the interests of the party.  That is the case, as it appears to me, that has to be met and is not being met, and I suggest to the Ministry that it is the kind of case that ought to be the subject of inquiry from Deputies representing the Independent Party, probably, in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>All I have to say is that Deputy Johnson is exceedingly credulous.  If it impresses him in that way it does not impress me one bit.  I <Col N="197" /> know he is a past master of the art of making up a stage case.  He loves to do it.  &ldquo;Something behind the scenes!&rdquo;&ldquo;People are getting suspicious !&rdquo; The Farmers' Party are also good at it.  We are constantly being adjured by Deputy Johnson and Deputy Baxter, who gets up and says that he does not believe we are such rogues as people are saying, but, in our own interests, we ought to have an inquiry. We are not children.  We are not to be rushed by soft talk of that sort.  Deputy Johnson believes that a <i>prima facie</i> case is made out.  These are his facts.  It is three months or more since the Cavan election, as Deputy Egan has pointed out.  Serious general charges are made now without any specific charges.  For that three months not one single specific charge was made.  I am the Minister responsible for these two Departments.  I discussed this matter a month ago and asked Deputy Baxter for concrete cases.  I will say that I think he told me he had no concrete cases.  In any case I never got one.  Remember these are very serious charges.  According to Deputy Johnson they involve corruption and all sorts of unspeakable things.  You have Deputy Baxter and Deputy Johnson, who do not sleep at night thinking of the reputation of the Government, doing their best to see that the Government is kept in the absolutely straight and narrow way.  Yet not a single inkling of a concrete case have I got that I could get my teeth into from Deputy Baxter for the three months.  After three months he comes along and the Dáil has heard what he had to say.  His first statement to-day was that a certain man, whose name he gave when pressed for it, who was not an official of the Land Commission, told him on the road that he was going round to pay the men.  I ignore that.  I think too much of the Land Commission to listen to balderdash of that sort when simply thrown across the House by a person when forced into a corner.  The next is the advertisement.  I do not care what Deputy Johnson's particular political standards are.  All I know is that I do not give two pence what a Cumann na nGaedheal branch here or there happens to say.  I am not responsible <Col N="198" /> for what they think or say. As Minister for Lands and Agriculture my responsibility is to try and keep the Land Commission and my Department impersonal and non-political.  I do that.  If people choose to make foolish and silly statements which anyone could see are foolish and react upon themselves I cannot be going about contradicting them.  I make no apology for it.  There is the third case.  We have got no names.  It is a case where a bog was drained and something else should be done.  On that flimsy superstructure one is asked to believe that a public inquiry should be held.</P>

The Minister for Industry and Commerce was assured that there is terrible suspicion in the country about the Shannon scheme, and also that the sugar beet scheme is not above suspicion.  We were assured by Deputies that that was so and that they were telling us in our own interests, that they wanted to stop the talk going on.  Now it is the administration of the Land Commission.  The day we begin to do things wrong we will begin to get nervous and begin to find it necessary to have fake inquiries of all sorts.  We are not going to be rushed into inquiries <Col N="199" /> over every flimsy charge made in a casual sort of way by Deputies. I ask the Dáil not to agree for a moment to this inquiry.  There is no case for an inquiry, and I tell Deputy Baxter and Deputy Johnson that if at any time any official of the Department does anything wrong it is their duty to let the Minister know immediately and let him inquire into it.  It would be fairer to the official, to the Dáil and the Minister to take that course rather than making general charges and without giving any facts or names.</P>

      <P>I had occasion to visit Cavan during the last election, and I would like to give what I consider an impartial opinion on the subject that is now before the Dáil.  At one place, where I understand more of the Government money was spent on relief works than in any other part of Cavan, I addressed a large hostile crowd. There were a large number of interruptions, and respectable people, as well as the organiser, told me that these interrupters who would not allow me to speak, were men engaged on relief works, receiving the money provided by the Government.  I made it my business to find out if that was true. I challenged the interrupters, and asked some of them that were pointed out: &ldquo;Are you receiving Government money?&rdquo; None of them denied it. They said the money was their own, and that they were only getting back what they paid in rates.  As far as <Col N="200" /> my experience goes, I say that supporters of the Irregular party were receiving more in that locality than the supporters of any other party, and that if the Cumann na nGaedheal representative was administering the money he was doing it very badly, because all the persons he engaged were active opponents of the Government.</P>

      <P>I am afraid there was not enough discrimination made in connection with relief works.  A certain amount of work was done.  I did not get much done.  I got a little done, but I would like to have more done. At the same time, certain by-ways and roads were made that were, I might say, unnecessary.  I was with Deputy Baxter, and went around these rivers, and saw lands that were flooded.  The crops had not been taken out, and the hay was lying in the fields.  We were very anxious that something should be attempted in these parts, but unfortunately we have not succeeded up to the present.  We are hopeful that with the assistance of Deputy O'Sullivan something will be done in the near future.</P>

      <P>This has been a very interesting discussion.  It is remarkable for the fact that evidently the Government do not think they have committed themselves in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think they have.  This was not good enough, of course, to deceive Ministers.  This policy was not good enough to deceive members of the House, but it was good enough to try on the Cavan folk.  The methods adopted there were certainly good enough to convince anyone that they were the people who held the purse and who were able to deliver the goods. And they did it, too.  Perhaps the average elector had not the high intelligence <Col N="201" /> that is to be found here in the Dáil.  Possibly their intelligence was no better than the intelligence of the Deputies on those benches.  There is no doubt about it, it certainly is strange when you come to think of people coming up in lorries and waiting on Ministers&mdash;deputation after deputation. Those people were introduced by the organiser there, whom I am given to understand was a school teacher.  He was not attending to his duties at the school at that time; he was probably lent to the Government, to the Cumann na nGaedheal party, for the purposes of the election.  He was a gentleman named O'Rourke.</P>

I do not know what arrangements were made between the Minister for Education and the Director of Elections at the time, who I believe was also a Minister.

I know that is quite right, and I know that the Ministers did not commit themselves up there.  I am sure Deputy Egan did not, either.  At the same time, they had those underlings going about, men who did not appear too much, men of little responsibility; but nevertheless, those <Col N="203" /> men were good enough to get into touch with the electors and they were good enough to convince them.  They were the men who did the work and the fellows who were not fools kept away. That is quite a good policy.

      <P>I could not imagine, and I cannot visualise, a more pointed appeal to the cupidity of the ordinary individual than happened in the case of Cavan.  I cannot visualise such methods as were described here as being adopted in Cavan.  I could not picture any methods appealing more to the cupidity and the baser passions of human nature than those that were adopted in Cavan.  The whole thing was a credit to nobody.  It almost reminds me of the tactics adopted by another political party in the country. They have gone around in election after election and appealed to men to <Col N="204" /> vote for them.  They said: &ldquo;If you vote for us you will have to pay nothing; we will get you out of your debts and everything; we will get you land free, and we will get your debts wiped away; you can do what you like and you can adopt any means you like to get other people's property.&rdquo;  That has been the practice in the country, and that is the way that elections have been fought in this country.  I refer generally to the way the Irregular election propaganda has been carried out.  I do not like to see the Government Party following other electioneering methods, if not to the full extent of 100 per cent., at least to the extent of 50 per cent.  I know that in this country elections are not fought on a straight appeal to the electors, but on an appeal to the baser passions and to the brute nature in man.  Deputies may smile at that.  After all, I believe there is a brute nature in man, and the original strain is as near the head to-day, is as near the surface, as when Adam was rearing his family.</P>

      <P>This is not altogether a matter for laughing at, when you go among the people who are in grave want and who are very much in need of assistance.  At that election and in such circumstances you have a party coming, blowing the trumpet, and advertising that &ldquo;the President will do this and will be anxious to receive his loyal subjects and to hear representations from them in regard to drainage, etc.&rdquo;  The people were told that they would be received.  The money bags began to jingle, and it was shouted out, &ldquo;We are the people who are ready to deliver the goods and who can do it.&rdquo;  That does not reflect very much credit on the Government or on the people responsible, and it is putting our national character at a very low par.  The sooner we start on a higher and better plane the better for the nation, and the better for anybody who claims that this nation is an honourable nation.</P>

      <P>I thought that some day three months ago the Cavan election was over.  I thought, too, that the verdict of the Cavan electors was given, and that a certain man was elected there.  I find now, however, that some Deputies want to traverse all the ground traversed in the course of the election, and to have all the controversies associated with it stirred up again.  I would like to know from the Deputies who are bringing this matter forward, did they ever state here in the Dáil that there was no destitution in Cavan?  Did they ever state that that work was not required in Cavan, especially in that portion of the county known as West Cavan?  Did they ever state that West Cavan was not in a state of utter destitution or utter want during that period and for some time before it?  Did they ever state on <Col N="206" /> public platforms that money was not wanted?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>They went round to brag that they got the money to give these people, and what was the meaning of the brag if not to attract the electors?  Was it not to secure their votes?  But, because the Party that Deputy Baxter is a member of, did not get the spending of the money, the pique is on them because they lost the election.  Deputy Baxter may laugh at the moment.  He admits that he went about and tried to get certain works done.  Because the Inspector of the Land Commission or the engineer sent down did not fall in with the views of Deputy Baxter, or had not the works done that Deputy Baxter thought to get done for his friends in a particular place, Deputy Baxter finds fault.  I have been through Cavan a good deal.  Deputy Baxter made statements here last night which no man&mdash;certainly no man in Cavan&mdash; could justify.  He stated that works were done up to a certain point, but because the place of some supporter of another party intervened, the works stopped at that point, and were again commenced further on.  I defy Deputy Baxter to give any idea of the way the people of Cavan voted, because, as sensible men, the majority of them kept their minds to themselves until the day of the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Baxter said that he knew of several instances where people would not get work because they were not of a certain political faith.  I challenge him to give me the number.  He said he knew of one individual case.  I suppose there were thousands employed, and he said he knew of one instance. These charges of corruption are made here.  I say here in this House&mdash;and I think Deputy Baxter will not contradict me&mdash;that I made it a particular point when travelling through the country to inquire whether the work done was work of a nature that was going to be reproductive, and whether the money was earned or not. I inquired from the clergymen and the <Col N="207" /> leading men that I met all over the county.  I am sure some of the clergymen were backing the candidate that Deputy Baxter was backing, and they told me that they never saw people in their lives who worked as well, that it was work that would last, and that it would be of material advantage to the people of the county.</P>

      <P>I have myself been on the roads, bog roads that were made, and the clergymen told me that the people in that area&mdash;it was a very large bog&mdash;could never go into the bog with anything except a donkey and creels on his back, to take the turf down some miles to the county road, and that now because of the work that has been done the people are able to get a cart up there and take the turf out in the cart. These are the classes of work done.  I have seen some of the drainage works done.  I have seen some of them that were finished and they were a credit to the men who carried them out.  I think Deputy Baxter will not deny that. The only point in the argument is that there was not enough money given to carry out the necessary work.  I told the people in Cavan myself that money would be found to finish any work that was commenced, that it would not be left in a state in which it would not be reproductive.  The Minister comes along now and states that any works that were not finished will be finished. It is very good propaganda perhaps to bring this matter up here, but when a very serious charge is brought forward it should be backed by facts and no facts have been adduced here to make this charge what we are supposed to believe it is.  We got a general statement from Deputy Baxter.  If Deputy Baxter had told the people in Cavan during the elections that they were not going to get any money spent in Cavan, that the Government refused to give any grant to Cavan, and if Deputy Baxter says that the people in <Col N="208" /> Cavan, especially in West Cavan, where the bulk of the money was spent, did not want relief, I am sure it is not the question that is raised here now we would hear.  Instead, the Government would have been impeached for a lack of foresight in not providing food and work for the people in that period.  If the Government had waited until something serious had happened or until relief had come from America or Russia, or some place else, then the Government would have been impeached for not doing their duty, but because the Government have done their duty, and because they have sent money, in order that people would not starve at a time which everybody admits was a period of stress, owing to the failure of the turf and the potato crop, it is sought to indict them here. If the Government had not done this they would be impeached for a lack of duty and for not carrying out their responsibilities, which were to see that the people got work and that they were not allowed to starve.  I hope we have heard the last of the Cavan Election, at least until the next election comes round.  Let the Party who is making this noise take their beating manfully. If they do that they will not be the worse of it; they come up here crying &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad that I have drawn the explanation from the Minister for Defence that he was acting under what he believed to be provocation, but he did, what seems to me, to be a very dangerous thing.  I am sure the Minister for Finance is not used to being committed by his colleagues in the Ministry to find the money. As a member of the Executive Council, he may have a right to do that, but he had no right to bind an external Minister to anything.  The Minister has no right to bind the Minister for Agriculture, an external Minister who is not subject to the Executive Council, and is not even subject to the Cumann na nGaedheal.  He is subject to the Dáil as a whole.  The Minister acted, perhaps, under provocation in the heat of the moment, but do not let that be accepted as a constitutional doctrine. Do not let the Minister go down and say: &ldquo;I will see that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, the Minister for Local Government, and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs shall give a guarantee that this work shall be done.&rdquo;  He has no more right to do that than Deputy Johnson has a right to do it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper will not put words into my mouth which I did not use.  I said that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture stated that he was going to finish the work that he commenced, and I say it would be criminal not to finish the work, having started it.

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly never suggested that.  The Minister rebukes me for putting words into his mouth, but I venture to say that if I did so, he is falling into my bad example.  I wish to make the point that members of the Executive Council cannot commit external Ministers in their conduct of the work of their Department. What would the Minister for Defence say if, for instance, the Minister for Lands and Agriculture were to go down to Kerry and say, &ldquo;You need more soldiers here, and I will make the Minister for Defence send them.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Then does not the Minister for Defence think that he misled the people of Cavan to whom he was talking when he gave the guarantee? The moral of this business is that the fewer pledges Ministers make in these material matters to individuals the better. The further they keep aloof from giving undertakings the better.  This, as Deputy Gorey has said, is an appeal to the worst and not to the best of an elector, saying that a man will receive material advantages because he supports one party or another.  I agree that the hands of all parties are not clean in this matter.  The remarks of one member of the Farmers' Party, who is not here, undoubtedly suggested material advantages.  Ministers should, however, remember that they occupy peculiar positions, that they are trustees <Col N="212" /> of the nation, not merely of a party, and they must remember that always and not act merely as party leaders.</P>

      <P>I feel the importance of this debate and I wish to point to one statement which Deputy Baxter made.  He seemed to suggest that the whole Cumann na nGaedheal Party behind the Government are ready to use certain tactics in a particular constituency in support of the Government.  As one Deputy I absolutely repudiate that. In my constituency there have been numbers of people looking for land and numbers looking after drainage.  I have been informed by some of them that some other Deputy will see the Minister and he will use his influence with him as I had no desire to do so. That other Deputy is not Deputy Morrissey. Anybody who has come to me in connection with the division of estates has never been questioned by me as to whether he belonged to the Cumann na nGaedheal, the old Irish Party, or the Conservatives.  With me it is a question of merit.  I get a list of the workers entitled to certain portions of land in their neighbourhood, the uneconomic holders, and the evicted tenants.  What I am saying on my own behalf applies also, I believe, to other Deputies on this side of the House.  It is not a question for them to choose in these matters between those who are and those who are not followers of Cumann na nGaedheal.  I do not think there is any Deputy on this side of the House so base as to do anything in connection with buildings or land for party purposes.  I do not know what occurred in Cavan.  I think it is a very great loss that owing to certain circumstances we saw the departure of Deputy Seán Milroy in that Division.  His has been a great loss as, if for no other reason, it would have saved us from all the unpleasant matters which have come before us this evening, matters which should not have been brought forward at this time.  They should have been brought forward by Deputy Baxter at the proper time instead of now, when they interfere with the business of the House.  If Deputy Baxter had a serious charge to make it should <Col N="213" /> be brought to the proper quarter, and if he has a charge to make again I hope he will make it at the proper time and at once.  We are all aware that certain Deputies avail of their position here to inform their constituents what they have done.  They ask questions in the House and the next thing you find is that the questions they have asked are in the local Press to show what they are doing on behalf of the farmers.  You never see that done by Deputy Morrissey or myself, but you see two pages, perhaps, full of matters which certain members of the Farmers' Party have done for their constituents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisMcCullough" hpid="Mr. McCULLOUGH Mr. McCULLOUGH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCULLOUGH</NameTxt>
      <P>The charge made by Deputy Baxter to-day was somewhat vague.  I took a considerable part in the Cavan election in the interests of Deputy O'Reilly.  What the Deputy has stated was not my experience at all, quite the contrary, that no undue favour was given to the supporters of the Government candidate.  I found that every time I went to Cavan quite a litany of complaints was made to me, and I was besought to report to the Minister that all those who were controlling the relief work were opponents of the Government, and supporters of Deputy O'Reilly in Cavan felt they had a grievance on this account.  I did not report the matter to the Minister, and I never went to Cavan during the election that complaint was not made to me from every centre in the constituency. It would cause me considerable <Col N="215" /> consternation if any improper methods were used by the Party I was associated with in the election.  I regret that Deputy Baxter did not take an earlier opportunity, as Deputy Egan said, of having this matter dealt with by the proper Minister.  No doubt the enemies of the country will take advantage of the statements made by Deputy Baxter to blacken our reputation in the eyes of the world.  As one who took part in the election, I found that not only was what Deputy Baxter said not true, but, as I have said before, and I want to emphasise it, I found the very contrary to be the case.  With regard to the advertisement that shocked Deputy Baxter and Deputy Johnson, I suggest that advertisement should be read seriatim, paragraph by paragraph.  I would ask those Deputies if there is anything in the paragraphs which could possibly uphold a charge of corruption against any member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party or the Government.</P>

      <P>You may, but you could not sustain it.  I agree that the advertisement was somewhat unfortunately worded, and, perhaps, undue advantage was taken of that in Cavan on account of the presence of the President there.  A plain backbencher like myself, who has had the misfortune to travel in company with a Minister, or anyone familiar with an election area knows perfectly well that advantage is taken of the presence of a Minister in the constituency by anyone who has a grievance, or thinks he has a grievance.  Deputations of all sorts put before the Minister, when they have the opportunity of seeing him personally, their claims.  I have no doubt that the presence of the President in Cavan was taken advantage of on that day.  I do not think there is anything wrong in an organisation asking delegates to come forward so that their claims might be pressed on those of their own party at the Party Convention.  I challenge any Deputy to say that there is anything wrong in that.  The advertisement, though perhaps unfortunately worded, could not <Col N="216" /> be construed by any honest Deputy as carrying a charge of corruption against members of the Government or members of the Government Party.</P>

It must be quite clear to Deputy Cooper that the Labour Party had no hand, act or part in the conduct of the Cavan election.  Therefore they are free from any of the corruption that has been alleged against the Government Party in this matter.  The other matter with which I wish to deal is the invitation of the Minister for Defence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister for Defence has made a statement here, and I invite him to prove it.

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I venture to say that is very wide of the subject matter of the discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister for Finance knows, nearly everything discussed here was very wide of the issue <Col N="217" /> raised by Deputy Johnson in his motion.  With regard to the debate, it struck me, and I listened to most of the charges made by Deputy Baxter, that if there is any justification for any of the charges made against the Government, the Ministers, or the Party that supports them, it is the charge that lies in the advertisement issued in their name, and to which they are committed by being present at the meeting called by this advertisement.  It is not an uncommon thing in the ordinary course of events in a by-election or a general election to ask candidates if they would agree to support such and such a thing if elected.  But it is a different matter for deputations to be invited to attend on Ministers, who have the power and responsibility of administration, and ask them to dole out money for such and such an area in Cavan or elsewhere. The charge has been made that that has been done by every party. Deputations could not wait on members of the Farmers' Party, or members of the Republican Party, and ask them to do things the Government could do, for a member of these parties by winning the election in Cavan would not put his party in control of the administration of the country, or get into their possession the funds at the disposal of the Government to dole out for this and that area.  The charge that has been thrown back at the Farmers' benches in this particular case is wrong.  If deputations find it necessary at any time, even at the time of a by-election, to see people, Ministers or otherwise, who have money at their disposal to give away, such as grants for relief work, the Minister should see them in Government Buildings, and not down in Cavan or Mayo when they are going on a party mission.  I think that the charge which we have heard has only met with a qualified repudiation from any Minister who has spoken in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words before the question is put. I spoke in reference to Deputy Baxter's charges last night as if it were possible that a certain degree of seriousness might be attached to them.  Hearing <Col N="218" /> Deputy Baxter further to-day, and hearing especially the story of the man going out to pay the men, I must say, without any intention of being unfair or offensive to Deputy Baxter, that I can only regard the whole thing as a joke&mdash;simply a joke.  With reference to the advertisement, it is not the sort of advertisement I would draft if I were issuing an advertisement.  But so far as I can see, it was simply an advertisement inviting people to continue further the damnable habit of deputationising Ministers.  There is nothing wastes more time or causes more annoyance to Ministers than people insisting on seeing them and telling them in interviews and speeches, lasting sometimes three or four hours, what they could tell them on two sheets of notepaper.  Everybody down the country believes that nothing is done right except they come and see the Minister and make a speech to him. Apparently, owing to the election being on, the Ministers who went down to this constituency were going to be forced to listen at great length to everybody who liked to come along and tell their story of what was needed in their particular district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the slightest idea.  I was not there.  But I suppose they did.  In fact, you can never refuse to listen, though I have on a few occasions refused.  It is difficult, however, to do that, whether the Minister be in Government Buildings or anywhere else.  In a democratic country the people can get at the Minister. They can stop you in the street and deputationise you.  And you cannot help it.  You are at their mercy.  There was no suggestion in this case that anything could be done on a political basis.  The notice simply asked the people to come and put their case for their particular district, and state the areas in which destitution existed, before the Minister who was there.  It is very undesirable to have an election coinciding with the carrying out of relief works in a district.  I do not see how in such circumstances we can avoid the appeals to cupidity which were <Col N="219" /> made.  As Deputy Gorey said, there were appeals to cupidity made and apparently they were made on both sides.  I have no doubt about that.  I do not see how you can avoid that.  No matter what Ministers do, the people who are hot in the election will, when the election fever gets up, use every argument they can to get votes. They will use this argument and make every sort of representation.  I believe that happened in the Cavan election. As to anything wrong having been done, the more I have listened to this discussion yesterday and to-day, the more I have been satisfied that there was nothing wrong done.</P>

    <P>Sub-head (a) shows an increase of £4,990.  This includes provision, not only for recoupment in connection with the preparation of the third register which will come into force this year, but also for outstanding claims in connection with the preparation of the first and second registers.  These amounted, in the case of the first register, to £7,760, and in the case of the second register to £13,600.  The recoupment for which the State is liable approximates to £19,000 a year.  Some of the county councils are slow in sending in their claims.  It is estimated that the provision of £14,740, remaining after the other deductions, will be ample to meet all claims that are likely to come in in the present financial year in respect of the third register, even if these claims are sent in more promptly than was the case in previous years.  The claims are not paid until the county councils have paid the Stationery Office their share of the cost of printing the register of electors.  The expenses, of which the State defrays part, are: (a) expenses of secretaries or clerks of county councils or in the past, district councils; (b) expenses of rate collectors; (c) printing expenses; (d) other expenses. The State pays various proportions of these expenses.</P>
    <P>Deputies will understand now that the electoral list and the register of jurors is one publication.  Of the expenses of secretaries of county councils in connection with the compilation of the register, it is estimated that the work involved concerns jury and franchise matters about equally.  The State pays no part of the jury expenses. Consequently, its contribution of half the franchise expenses amounts to one quarter of the whole of the expenses under that head&mdash;that is the expenses of clerks or secretaries of county councils.  In the case of the expenses of rate collectors, it is estimated that the trouble with the jurors work is about half of the trouble involved in connection with the franchise work, and the State contribution is one-half of the franchise element of two-thirds, or one-third of the whole. The State pays one-third of the expenses of the rate collectors.  As regards the printing, it is estimated that the jury column in the register is equal to one-seventh of the cost of the whole, and this is a local charge.  The remaining six-sevenths of the printing cost of the register is franchise work, and one-half of this is borne by the State and the other half by the local authority.  The other expenses, which include extra clerical assistance and the like, are divided equally.</P>
    <P>Coming to sub-head (b): This shows a decrease of £9,000.  The item under this sub-head will disappear after this year.  There are still some sums due in respect of registers prepared under the Representation of the People Act, 1918, before the passing of the Electoral Act, and provision is made for the payment of such claims as are yet to be presented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister whether anything has been <Col N="223" /> done to improve the machinery by which these payments are made.  If Deputies will refer to the Appropriation Account for 1923-24, they will see on page 54 that out of the sums voted by the Dáil in that financial year, £83,000, only £11,000 was expended, that is to say, only 15 per cent., and there is a foot-note which shows that only a few of the outstanding claims were submitted for payment during the financial year.  That was the year in which there was a general election, and that was the year in which, if one can gather from the Question Paper, there was great discontent about the delay in settling those claims.  There were a number of questions, perhaps not an enormous number, but still a considerable number, about these claims against returning officers, and so on, and when they were to be settled.  That seems to point to some defects in the machinery, either in the Electoral Act, which it would not be in order now to discuss, or in the machinery devised by the Minister for Finance for the settlement of those claims. As we are voting this sum, I think it would be in order to ask if anything has been done on the subject of payments. A man who has to wait six months or a year&mdash;in this case the election took place in August and the claims had not been submitted until the end of the financial period in the following year&mdash;would become very discontented, and would be very importunate to Deputies who represent him.  I hope the Minister will tell us a little about the machinery by which claims are paid and whether it has been lubricated and will work more smoothly in the future.</P>

      <P>On this Vote I would like to ask what has become of the promise made almost twelve months ago that the Jury List would be extended so as to avoid throwing almost two-thirds of the Jury work upon the north side of the city of Dublin. The Minister for Justice promised twelve months ago to amend the Jury Act so as to give an equal distribution of the work as between the citizens of Dublin.  You have on the north side the extended boundary of <Col N="224" /> Clontarf, Drumcondra and Glasnevin, with the old city doing two-thirds of the work, while the residents of Rathmines, Pembroke and Donnybrook escape all this work.  I think the Minister should tell us what has become of the promise that was given to amend the Jury Act and give much-needed relief.</P>
      <P>While on this point I would like to ask the Minister whether during the coming Seanad elections arrangements will be made by the Government to supply the people having votes on the Seanad lists with ballot cards.  Will he take any steps in that direction or does he expect that any of the candidates will take steps to notify the people that they are voters upon the lists?</P>

      <P>I was asked to mention it at any rate.  To supply those lists all over the country would be rather a big job for the candidate, and it was thought that the Government might do something to prevent the elections becoming a farce, because very few candidates will be able, or will take the trouble, to supply the voters with voting cards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I am not called upon to answer a lot of the things that have been raised in this debate.  In the first place, the expenses of the elections are not paid out of this Vote.  They are a Central Fund charge.  I do not know whether we have got rid of the source of delay, but, in general, they were caused by the very unsatisfactory attitude of several returning officers.  In some districts the whole thing was cleared off quickly and satisfactorily.  In other cases it was only when we threatened legal action against the returning officers that we could get them to act.  Then, there was the returning officer whose behaviour was mid-way between that of the returning officer who took no steps and the returning officer who acted in a satisfactory manner.  Delays were due entirely <Col N="225" /> to the non-submission of claims. I do not want to go into it very much. Neither can I go into some of the questions raised by Deputy Byrne. They are matters really for the Minister for Justice, and I think they could be raised when the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Justice is under consideration.  I believe that Committees of the Dáil or the Seanad, or both, have been considering the question of the arrangements for the Seanad elections, and I do not know that I can really answer all the questions put on a Vote that merely deals with the expenses of compiling and printing the Registers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I was entitled to raise the point, because, after all, we must read the Estimates in connection with the Appropriation Account.  We must see how money has been spent in the past when we are voting money for the future, and when we get a startling item like this of £54,000 voted and £2,700 spent, we are entitled to be told that that will not happen in the future.  I gather that the Minister is dealing with the returning officers in the same way as he is dealing with the income-tax payers.  If that is so I am satisfied. Deputy Byrne raised one general point that I do not think the Minister answered: that is, should it be a charge on a candidate, either for the Dáil or the Seanad, to inform the individual voter of his number on the register? It is at present a serious charge.  The Dáil constituency is a big thing.  In County Dublin there are 92,000 electors. You get free postage for sending these things out, but free postage does not cover it all.  You have to get cards printed, envelopes addressed, and so on, and for the Seanad it will be an incredible charge.  If a candidate is supposed to send cards to every elector in the Saorstát over thirty years of age, it will be putting a premium on wealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, there is the point of view of the individual voter, who will not be at all pleased if he receives fifty-seven different polling cards from candidates for the Seanad.  Surely, it is a case for the Government to send <Col N="226" /> a card, with no incitement to vote for any individual, but merely saying: &ldquo;The election is on such and such a day, between such and such hours. Your polling station is so and so, and your number on the register is so and so.&rdquo;  It would be economical.  It would save enormous work entailed by two or three or more groups of candidates addressing envelopes.  I did not send out any polling cards at the last election, but I suppose I will have to do so at the next.  I received four or five different polling cards.  It could be done, on the whole, more cheaply by the Government.  The burden of postage they have already undertaken, and they could send out a non-controversial card telling the voter the hours of voting, the place where he is entitled to vote, and his number on the register.  I believe you would see the result in increased public interest in voting, and you would relieve the candidate from this tremendous burden, which is a most unfair one.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if Deputy Cooper has taken into account the enormous cost that such a distribution of information by the Government to the electors would entail.  The Seanad electorate consists of 1,250,000 voters, and it would mean printing documents to the number of 1,250,000. It would mean a Government staff engaged in addressing 1,250,000 envelopes, and while we are certainly seriously interested in having a fairly good poll for the Seanad election, I am afraid that that would entail too much expense on the Government.  This election may entail a cost of £50,000 or £60,000.  What usually happens in the case of a Local Government election is to publish posters in various places in the area giving the candidates, and I think that if that were found to be a feasible plan, it is about as much as could be done in the circumstances.  I do not think, apart from the Deputies opposite, that it is likely that any meetings will be held in connection with the Seanad election.  They have a clear run as far as that is concerned.</P>

      <P>I do not know. I cannot say yet what is in store for us, but as far as the Local Government elections are concerned, I think Deputies on the far side have been in first with regard to the selection of candidates.  The Seanad election differs very much from the Dáil election. In the first place you are not at liberty to select candidates between the ages of twenty-one and thirty-five. Thirty-five, I think, is the earliest age at which a candidate is eligible for nomination.  In the second place the spirit of the Constitution is that members of the Seanad rather represent interests which originally, at any rate, were not considered to have been represented in the Dáil.  It was hoped, particularly with the country as a single constituency, that certain minorities would be able to get elected which might not do so at an ordinary election.  It is for those people to concern themselves with any advertising that there may be in connection with the election.  I think it would be unusual and unfair to expect the Government to undertake a very considerable expenditure in order that the people might know the candidates, or for what they might stand.  I take it that in each county there will be an interest in a particular candidate, and from the point of view of counting it would be rather useful if that were the case, because it would be easily understood what colossal work those engaged in the counting would have if a surplus of 100,000 votes had to be transferred from a particular candidate.  In addition to that the steps that I think will be taken by the Dáil, and possibly by <Col N="228" /> the Seanad, will enable an early intimation to be given to the electorate as to the vast majority, at any rate, of the candidates that will stand for election, and personally I think that that will be quite sufficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the President has really overlooked the particular point, that is, who will supply the people with the names of the polling stations, their vote numbers and their poll cards.  Even in a small election when people go into a school where there may only be six tables there is confusion, and a woman will say, &ldquo;My name is Mary Brown.  I live in such-and-such a place.&rdquo;  The officer in charge will say, &ldquo;What is your number?&rdquo; I have seen officers turning people out of the polling station when they had not their numbers with them. If these people are to vote, I want to know what candidate, or set of candidates, will go to the trouble of informing them of their polling stations, the tables at which they are to vote and their numbers on the register.  If they are not supplied with this information you will find that half of the people will not vote.  You will find that the Seanad election will turn out a regular farce as a result, and the new Seanad will not be a representative body. Even if it would mean a considerable expense, I think that the Government should supply the people with cards of a non-committal character.  They would find as a result that they would have good representatives in the Seanad.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> This Vote shows a net decrease of a substantial sum in spite of the fact that the actual demands upon the Department have been increasing.  All the legislative activity of the Dáil has resulted in an increased charge being thrown upon this Vote.  It is satisfactory that as a result of close scrutiny on the demands of the Departments and of the work of the contractor and efforts made to secure tenders from a wider circle than previously tendered, it has been possible to reduce it in a substantial way.  Of course it is not within the control of the Stationery Office to regulate the amount of money required by it more or less except in a minor degree.  It is the demand of the various Departments, the number of sittings, and the amount of legislation turned out, by the Oireachtas that really determines that.</P>
    <P>There is a reduction in the sub-head dealing with salaries, wages and allowances. That has been effected by reorganisation of the office and by the letting go of certain members of the staff whom it was found possible to do without.  There were changes in the number of warehousemen.  The changes were not very considerable but they resulted in the reduction of the staff necessary to carry on the work of the Department.</P>
    <P>The reduction in sub-head (b) was due partly to the use of a motor van which was obtained for the carrying of goods through the city and to general care in dealing with supplies and the transport of supplies.  In incidental expenses one of the items that disappeared was an item for removals. The Department is now permanently housed.  For a time it was in various buildings which were unsatisfactory. No figures for removals are now required. The item under sub-head (b) follows the experience of last year, and is somewhat less.  There was an increase in the printing of the <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  That was due to lists being printed for Land Commission work and work in connection with the Damage to Property Act, which required larger issues.  The expenses of the printing of the register are down because in years other than the first year of the five years period, the entire <Col N="230" /> matter has not to be set up.  There are only certain of the lists, claims and objections and alterations to be set up.  It means in those years that the costs are considerably less.  Printing contracts, as indicated already, have been sub-divided to attract wider competition. Smaller printing houses have been enabled to quote for groups of contracts in a way they could not do in the past.</P>
    <P>The prices show an all-round deduction of fifteen to twenty per cent.  The face value of the official publications in revenue forms, etc., sold last year, amounted to £5,500.  In the case of certain publications which one might think the public interested in, the sale has been exceedingly small.  For instance, the Estimates of the year 1924-25 were sold at a price of five shillings, which was less than the price which would be dictated if we were basing it entirely on the printing costs divided by the number of copies printed.  If that were done, the price would be something like seven shillings. Inasmuch as the volume of Estimates was sold at five shillings, the price of the volume is not very high. An argument might be advanced for making it less, but it seems that you cannot, by any reduction, secure a very wide purchase of it by the public.  Even at this price of five shillings, only forty-seven copies were sold.  That is only £10 worth of Estimates were bought.  That would include a certain number of special people who would buy them in any circumstances. As to the Appropriation Accounts, with the Comptroller and Auditor-General's Report, this year's copy was published at 3/6.  It also was below the cost which would be fixed if we were reckoning only the expenses of printing. Only sixteen copies of that were sold.  The Public Accounts Committee's Report, which was published not very long ago, was sold at 7/6.  If the price had been fixed according to the expenses of printing, it would have been 14/-.  Eleven copies of that were sold.  It seems to me that demand is so slow that it is not likely that there would be very many sales, even if the prices were brought down.  I appreciate the view that is held that it would <Col N="231" /> be worth while losing a few pounds that might otherwise be gained by sales for the purpose of having a more substantial number of the public getting those reports and examining them.  They seem, however, to be the sort of things that anybody will not accept who is not specialising or who does not want them for a particular reason.  They do not seem the sort of documents that there is any public to study.</P>
    <P>During the past year there has been a considerable extension of the system now in operation in Great Britain and other countries of obtaining advertisements for certain publications, forms and envelopes used.  A revenue of over £3,000 was got from such advertising during the past year.  It is expected that in the coming year a still greater revenue will be got.  Arrangements are being made in the Stationery Office for the reproduction by other means than printing of certain reports of which a very small number are required, and some of the printing costs of certain classes of matter are expected to be eliminated.</P>
    <P>Sub-head (j) is down largely owing to the fall in the cost of paper.  During 1924-25, the price of paper has fallen, and the fall is reflected in the Estimate.  With the closing down of the Clondalkin Mills, there is only one paper mill in operation in the Saorstát. Generally, the type of paper turned out at that mill is too expensive for Stationery Office use, and support cannot be given to the industry that might be given if a different and cheaper type of paper were turned out, though in certain cases where paper of the kind produced by this mill is wanted, it is got from it.  About £1,700 worth of paper was purchased from the Saggart Mills during the year.  Deputies will note that the system is that the Stationery Office stocks paper and has contracts with printing firms, for which it supplies the paper.  In view of the fact that there are very many contractors and that different classes of paper are wanted for different orders, it has been found cheaper for the Stationery Office to purchase the paper <Col N="232" /> and supply the printer, rather than to have the printer, perhaps, stocking paper specially for the Stationery Office and charging for it.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of Irish manufacture, a number of articles, such as inks, boxes of various sizes, typewriting tables, various stamps, leather bags and pouches, and articles of that sort, are of Irish manufacture. A certain saving has been accomplished by the setting up of a repair shop in the Stationery Office for dealing with typewriters which need attention.  Previously that work was sent out.  It has been found more economical to do it in the Stationery Office.</P>

      <P>The Minister has pointed out that there has been a reorganisation of the staff, leading to a reduction of something like £4,000 in comparison with last year, notwithstanding the increase in the bonus.  I notice that there has been a reduction in the number of lower executive officers from eleven to seven, and a reduction of from fourteen to seven in another class, but there has been an increase in the number of temporary clerks from six to eleven.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that to some extent the figures are not really comparable there, because last year it had not been fully determined what the organisation would be, and the number of staff shown for 1924-5 was never actually reached or employed. Provision was made for them when the Estimates were being prepared, in the belief that they would be wanted, but the number was never really as great as was shown.</P>

      <P>Are we to understand that there has not been a decrease in the number of lower executive and lower clerical officers to make room for <Col N="233" /> an increase in temporary clerks? That would be a reversal of what I understood to be the policy of the Ministry, namely, to place temporary men in established positions or to replace temporary clerks by established clerks.  In this case, on the face of it, it appears as though there had been a reduction in the number of established officers and an increase in the number of temporary clerks.  If I am to understand from the Minister that that has not in fact taken place, that there were never more than seven lower executive officers and seven clerical officers, the point of criticism falls.  But, if there has been a decline in the number of lower executive officers and clerical officers, and an increase in the number of temporary clerks, then some explanation is required, and it is a bad policy to have followed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>What actually happened was that last year we were attempting to fix the organisation for the office.  This office had a great deal of new work thrown on it on being taken over.  Previously, for instance, all matters in connection with the purchase and acquirement of paper, and a great deal of work even in connection with contracts, was central work done in London.  To a very considerable extent the Stationery Office here was a mere agency of the London Office&mdash;a distributing agency to a very considerable extent.  Great quantities of forms generally used throughout the service were printed in England and simply sent over to the Stationery Office for distribution.  When we took over, the Stationery Office had to take on all this new work.  A staff was thrown together which included a considerable number of temporaries.  Last year we were working at a scheme of organisation and a tentative scheme was put into the estimate.  That scheme did not represent the realities at the time the estimate was prepared, but what we intended to have.  As a matter of fact, not only were there the number of temporary clerks now shown last year, but there was an additional number of temporary clerks.  Last year we had not eleven lower executive officers, nor fourteen <Col N="234" /> clerical officers.  We had actually only six lower executive officers and we had more temporary clerks than are now employed.  What we have actually done is that we have increased the number of established officers and decreased the number of unestablished officers.</P>

      <P>These eleven temporary clerks are shown in the estimate at a salary scale from 60/- to 95/-. That would not go to show that the men were in a temporary position, but rather that it was expected they would reach the maximum after some time. Are any special qualifications required for temporary clerks in this department? One cannot fail to notice the difference between the scale laid down for temporary clerks in this department and what is paid to temporary clerks in other Government departments.</P>
      <P>I would prefer to see the other people paid on the same scale laid down here for temporary clerks.  The figures are shown in an extraordinary way, going from 60/- to 95/-.  Making a rough-and-ready calculation, it would appear that some of the 11 are paid over 60/-, as there is a difference of £304 between this year's estimate and last year's estimate.  Some people are employed apparently at a higher figure than 60/-.  We had not these figures in the Estimates last year nor any figures showing the scale of payment for temporary clerks.</P>

      <P>A number of the temporary clerks are in fact men of experience and with technical knowledge of the paper trade or of printing accounts.  They are men who will probably be established.  The intention is that they should be put up to the Civil Service Commission for establishment. They are not simply the class of temporary clerks who are taken in the ordinary way into Government offices.  They are men who are supposed to have certain technical knowledge to deal with stationery, paper, printing and printing accounts.</P>

      <P>What I want to call attention to is the scale laid down for <Col N="235" /> temporary clerks in other departments. Every individual in his own particular sphere of work has some technical skill for working in a particular department, just as these men are claimed to have who are paid the figures mentioned for working in the Stationery Office.  I think the Minister should east his eye over the different Estimates, and he will see that there is a considerable difference between the figures put down for temporary clerks in this Department, and, say, in the Land Commission or the Department of Defence.  I think the figure here is a fair and reasonable one, but certainly the sum paid temporary clerks of a certain type in the Land Commission or the Department of Defence is not what one would regard as a living wage for that particular work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this difference, that you have to recruit from the printing offices and other places men who have some actual knowledge of printing work, paper and of Stationery Office requirements.  Actually a number of these men are compositors who are being paid for doing work in the Stationery Office.  They served their time as compositors, and they are paid at trade-union rates in the Stationery Office.  The people employed in other offices are people who can read and write and have certain educational qualifications, but no particular skilled knowledge.  They require experience and become more valuable in the office they are in as time goes on.  They are not in the same class with men who had experience of any particular branch of work outside.  In ordinary clerks who get into the Department of Defence you do not look for anything except the ordinary educational requirements necessary for clerical work.  It is not considered ordinarily a desirable thing to have temporary clerks except when some mass of temporary work arises. We have partly inherited a position in which there is a big body of temporary clerks only, some of whom can be got rid of without causing very considerable hardship.  The general position we aim at is that we regard a temporary clerk as someone that we take in and give a job for the time being, but <Col N="236" /> whom we do not intend to retain permanently in the service.  The scale is fixed on that basis.</P>

      <P>On sub-head (e), I think this is a suitable time to raise a question regarding the sale of the publications issued by the Oireachtas. I take it that this is the Vote for the Estimates dealing with the Appropriation Account.  I think the general feeling of the Dáil is one of regret, at hearing the Minister say that, of one of these comparatively cheap publications, only 47 copies were sold, and in another case only 11 copies were sold. If we are to be criticised&mdash;and Heaven forbid that we should not be criticised &mdash;we would prefer to be intelligently criticised.  Without these documents it is really very hard for anyone to form an accurate and clear idea of what we are doing.  The Minister has done his best.  I was prepared to attack him on this point, but I do think he has done his best to reduce the prices and bring these publications within reach of the public.  I am still a little doubtful as to whether he has done enough to bring them to the notice of the public.  It seems to me that very few people know that the Estimates and Appropriation Accounts are obtainable at all.  You go either into a basement or into an upper storey in one particular shop in the city and there you can obtain them.  That firm pay, I think, £300 a year for the privilege of selling them.  If they are not put on the market in a business way that £300 a year is dearly gained.  For instance, I should like to see a somewhat larger free distribution of these publications, because I believe it would whet and increase the demand.  Any person who brings out a book knows that the publisher will send a number of copies out for review.  I believe our publications are sent to the Press in the same way, but they do not always get the same review.  I would carry that principle a little farther.  I believe it would be a sound step economically, and I am sure it would be a sound step <Col N="237" /> politically, to send copies of the various publications to any large free libraries in the Saorstát.  I believe if that were done you would find that people who got into the habit of consulting them there would finally think it would be a great convenience to themselves to consult them at home, and that it was well worth 3/- or 5/-, as the case might be, to get them.  What is really needed is wider knowledge.  Once wider knowledge of these things and wider knowledge of the extraordinarily interesting points that could be made against the Government as a result of reading them exists, I believe that the demand would increase.</P>
      <P>I know that in 1923 I bought a copy of the Estimates for that year at 10/-. I never spent 10/- with more satisfaction. I had material out of that for at least half-a-dozen speeches.  There was one other point that I desire to refer to.  The Minister rather gave the impression that there would have been an even greater reduction in this Vote had it not been for the legislative action of the Oireachtas.  I think that was the way he phrased it.  Every Vote relating to the Oireachtas is down. This Vote is reduced by £1,500 and the next by £1,000.  A false impression might be created that we are extravagant, whereas we are reducing our demands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Deputy Cooper's suggestion, but I desire to push it more strongly than he has done.  I feel it is quite true that the public generally do not know what publications are being issued as a result of the work of the Oireachtas or as a result of the work of different departments of the Government.  At the particular stage at which our people have arrived, when you are endeavouring against certain difficulties which are being overcome to make them realise that a State is being built up here, the more they know of what is being done by Government Departments and by the Oireachtas to build up that State, and the more they know of the functioning of the machine here the greater the possibilities of getting done what they wish to have done for themselves.  I <Col N="238" /> would take away the word &ldquo;large&rdquo; and suggest that all public libraries ought to get copies of Government publications, even to the extent of giving them every Bill in the stage in which it is introduced here, so that the public generally, when a Bill is being introduced in the Dáil, will have an opportunity at the earliest moment of consulting the terms of that Bill at the nearest public library.  It is quite possible that in time it would secure that our legislation would be improved by many valuable suggestions from people who are on the spot and interested. It would help to train our people to watch what was being initiated in the shape of legislation here and to think whether there were any things they would require done from their particular view in any particular line.  I think our legislation would be the better of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to clubs of different kinds in the country.  It came under my notice a very long time ago that, even in the case of private authors, small clubs or pseudo-clubs&mdash; because certain people got into the habit of knowing that by calling themselves a club they were able to write to an author and get a free copy of a book&mdash;made application for their books.  Private individuals can do that, and it is done, I think, to a very large extent.  Distribution of Government publications on a larger scale would mean that people would grow to have a broader outlook on what the work of the Government here is.  I think we ought to be prepared to see that money is spent in letting the public generally have the greatest possible opportunity of seeing what is being done here. Another matter arises, and it is that our different professions, and the different classes of business people in the country, could, and would, probably, be induced to pay a composite annual fee in order to get certain selected publications sent them.  It might be that a consultation with some of the principal legal men in the country would result in a schedule of publications that the Government would issue from time to time, and that would be particularly applicable to the legal fraternity.  The same would apply to other professions <Col N="239" /> in the country.  With these lists circulated, persons paying a certain annual amount to the Government, could receive copies of them systematically as the publications that would interest them came out.  It is a matter that might cost some money, but I think it would be well worth looking into.</P>
    <P>There is another point that, perhaps, might be raised here, and it is connected with our own difficulties, as Deputies, in the handling of the great amount of papers that come our way, even if we consider only the Bills and the amendments as they come to us.  I would like to suggest that the first issue of a Bill might be sent out with a stout cover of exactly the same size as the Bill itself, and that could receive the subsequent copies of the Bill and the amendments as they are printed. If possible, all the Bills might be punched.  It is very difficult to handle the number of Bills that come our way. If it were obvious to us that there would be a systematic way of dealing with each Bill, and if the first copy of the Bill is issued as I suggest, so that it will receive all subsequent copies in the same cover, it would lighten the physical work of keeping all the papers.  From my point of view I know it would, at any rate.  Perhaps that suggestion might get some consideration. Possibly, this is not the place to raise the matter, and that the Committee on Privileges would be the proper body to consider it.</P>

      <P>I would like to support Deputies Cooper and Mulcahy generally.  I wish to refer specially to the point raised by Deputy Cooper in regard to the Press.  I would like to know what is the general practice with regard to Government publications, whether they are, as a matter of fact, supplied free to the Press.  If they are not, I think they should be, just as publications generally are sent around to the Press for review. I have heard many newspaper men, especially local newspaper men, say they would be very pleased if they could get copies of the Dáil Debates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to obviate the possibility of that accusation that I am making this suggestion. The weekly newspaper is very much read in the country.  The local paper is much more read than the daily papers, and many editors would be glad to have the Dáil Reports and would use them to a large extent.  It would be advantageous from many points of view.  It would get the country interested in what is being done here. The daily paper cannot afford to report more than a scanty portion of the debates.  That is all they do, in any case, day by day; but the local paper has much more space available. Possibly many people would be interested in the proceedings of the Dáil if they were printed in the weekly papers; they would be interested even as much as they are in the proceedings of local authorities.  With regard to the Estimates, there is a suggestion I would like to make, a suggestion that may be worthy of consideration.  Even at 5s., which is as cheap a figure as the Estimates can be produced at, the ordinary man would consider them dear.  He will not pay 5s. for a copy. The number who will buy a copy is very small.  There are many people interested only in one section of the Estimates. It was the practice in Britain to publish the Estimates in sections. I remember in the old days we used always get the Civil Service Estimates, those that dealt with Civil Service, Education, and so on, and we did not bother about purchasing the whole publication.  We merely got the section of special interest to us.  There are many who would be interested in Estimates concerning education and who would not trouble about other Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, there would be many interested in the Estimates of the Department of Agriculture and the Estimates of the Department of Justice. Each would have its clientele. People would purchase that particular section if it could be produced at a reasonable price, and I see no reason <Col N="241" /> why it should not be.  There would be no great difficulty in getting it done. The Government would have the full volume printed also, for circulation to Deputies and for sale.  It would not mean extra printing, though it might mean extra binding.  You could have the sectional Estimates produced at 6d. or 9d.  In that way there would be a considerable sale for the smaller sections, which you would not get for the book as a whole.</P>

      <P>At present certain of the large free public libraries do actually get copies of the publications. I would consider the question whether we could not send certain of these things to certain types of institutions, like libraries, free.  I would not like to send publications out free to clubs or associations like that.  I do believe that you will not get any more attention paid to them or any more study of them by sending them round free. It is better that people should pay, and I think you will find that there will be really as much interest shown in them if people have to pay.  There is at present an arrangement whereby by paying a composite fee a person can get every document published by the Stationery Office&mdash;Dáil Debates, Bills in every stage, Acts when they become Acts, Statutory Orders, Regulations and everything of that sort. That fee is £15.</P>

      <P>At one time, a certain amount of newspaper advertising was done with a view to securing a wider sale for these publications, but there were practically no results from that advertising.  There were practically no sales.  We could try further advertising. There is to be, for instance, a journal issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, a monthly journal, which might be read in a way that the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is not read.  We can try to issue lists of Government publications that we think would attract some attention and would arouse some interest, and see whether we can get larger sales.  One would expect, for instance, that country newspapers would really be prepared to pay for things like the Dáil debates.  I am not much in favour of sending out free copies of our publications.  I would undertake to go into the question of whether we could arrange to send, for instance, these Debates to newspapers, outside the newspapers that are likely to be represented in the Press Gallery, at some reduced rate.</P>

I would also undertake to consult the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to see if it could be arranged to do something on the same lines, as he did in connection with the National Loan.  We published a certain circular.  Without its being addressed at all, batches were given to postmen, who were instructed to deliver them on their rounds.  I would consult with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on the question of a distribution of some circular in connection with Dáil publications, a statement of prices, and some general statement in regard to their value, that would be of interest to citizens who are interested in public affairs, and to see if we could stimulate any interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to undertake a method such as Deputy O'Connell suggests of getting out the Estimates in two or three sub-volumes.  The possibility is that for each small volume you get, you may have only half a dozen purchasers and the experience that we have had seems to indicate that there would really be no sale.  I do not know where the blame is, but I do not think the position about the sale of Government publications is entirely as bad as Deputy Cooper seems to suggest.  I understand that you have not to go to the basement.  You can get Government publications on the ground floor. I know also that cards are displayed at railway book-stalls and other places stating that Government publications can be got.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not yet clear. If there are 400 copies printed of necessity, and if instead you ordered 500 and bind 500, are we to understand that the cost of printing of the extra 100 would be 7/6 per copy?  I can hardly understand it.  Certainly it is <Col N="246" /> not in accordance with my experience of printing.  I think that some general principle should be used in the fixing of the prices of official publications. In regard to the daily reports, there was a reduction from 1/- to 6d.  I have been asked by quite a number of people in different parts of the country, at different times, in respect to special reports&mdash;special debates&mdash; whether it would not be possible to get copies at a price lower than 6d. If the cost of any extra number is 6d., then, I think 6d. will have to be charged.  I do not think, for the time being, it is wise to undergo a further loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think if the extra number of copies that would be estimated for&mdash;assume it to be for one edition only&mdash;were sold at not more than 3d. per copy, and I think that should be the price, there would be a much greater interest shown in these official publications. That would be the case if the lower-priced publications were popularised, or at least advertised with a view to popularisation.  The same difficulty was experienced years ago in regard to British publications, and they undertook an advertising campaign. I think they have now established quite a considerable sale.  They continued advertising, and they arranged the advertisements of their publications according to the particular journal they were advertising in and the class of readers they would be appealing to.  I would like the Minister to see if it would be possible, as a general practice, to reduce the cost of official publications to the lowest price consistent with no loss.  That has not yet been done, I think.  I cannot imagine the extra cost of a few copies of the Appropriation Accounts, for instance, in addition to the necessary copies, would be 3/6, or of the Estimates, 5/-.  As regards the matter of advertising, which occurred in the course of the Minister's statement, the question has arisen as to the particular kind of advertising.  Deputy McBride the other day raised the question of the advertisements in the Post Office publications, and pointed out that it is hardly consistent with the policy of <Col N="247" /> the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to advertise Beecham's pills on postal papers when there is some local Cork merchant selling some equally good, or better, pill.  I am quite sure they must have been better if they came from Cork.  I am quite willing, however, to give that free advertisement to the unknown Cork pill maker.  The point is, that I expect that these advertising contracts are let out through a contractor, and it is just to find out whether there is any check on the kind of advertisement that is allowed to appear in official publications that I raise the point.  I think there ought to be some discrimination in the class of advertisements that are issued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has promised sympathetically to consider the suggestion of Deputy Mulcahy in regard to the circulation of Government publications to libraries and clubs.  A difficulty arises in view of the conditional promise given by the Minister in this way, that if the publications are only issued to libraries, it means that the rural populations in the west, south, and midlands are practically excluded from making any use of these particular publications.  It is fairly commonly known that in the west, south, and midlands, there are hardly any public libraries in towns with a population of under three thousand, but in towns or villages with a smaller population there are clubs, perhaps temperance societies and sectarian or non-sectarian clubs, where a large number of people, young and old, assemble on Sundays.  As the Minister is giving consideration to the existing practice in regard to libraries, he should consider it from the point of view of making these publications available to rural populations as well as to those in cities and large towns, who have the advantages of free libraries.  The difficulty will arise in the case of clubs, especially in large cities, as to whether clubs of this kind should get these publications.  I think that in any village or town where there is no public library, the Minister should sympathetically consider the point that whatever agreement is come to in regard to libraries, it should be <Col N="248" /> extended to rural populations where a hall is available, particularly where clubs are of a non-political and nonsectarian kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be quite clear as to the basis on which this price is fixed.  I did not follow clearly the statement made by the Minister in reply to Deputy Johnson. I have some small experience of getting printing work done, and I think that anybody who gets publications of this kind printed knows that the first few hundred copies really carry the weight of the price.  In the case of a publication in which I was interested, the general tender from most of the printers ran around two hundred pounds for the first five hundred copies. That would work out at seven or eight shillings a copy, but we could get the next five hundred copies at practically one shilling a copy.  I take it that there are something like four hundred or five hundred copies of these printed in any case, and after that all that is charged is the price of the paper with the price of the binding and make-up. Surely in the case of this publication the price of the paper and the cost of making-up would not run to five shillings per copy.  Anybody who has printing work to get done knows that the whole weight of the cost is in setting up the type, and that after that it is quite cheap.  I cannot understand why the paper and the putting together of the book would in this case cost five shillings.  I would like to add a word in connection with what the Minister said in regard to the usefulness of reading the Report of the Public Accounts Committee.  Anybody who reads it, especially the opening statement, will receive a very good education in learning <Col N="249" /> how Government Departments are run.  It would be a great matter if Deputies could induce large numbers of the public to read some of the memoranda set out in the beginning.  I believe that we would get less trouble from our constituents as there would be then a different notion regarding the powers of Deputies to move a Government Department, as we are supposed to be able to do at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is, we get a certain number printed.  If we were to take the absolute cost of production we would simply have to divide the price by the number we got printed, and that would have to be the price. We normally get, say, 300 printed, and if it were suggested that we should get another 100 printed for sale, and if we printed 400 instead of 300 it would mean we would have to divide the cost of printing by 400 instead of 300. That, of course, would give a higher figure than the method adopted, which is this: Assuming that the type is standing, what will the printing of a specified number, say another 100, cost? We charge what would be the cost of printing any extra number we order with the type already standing.  That is the basis, for instance, on which the charge is made for the Public Accounts Committee Report.  If we went tomorrow and ordered extra copies they would cost us at the rate of 7s. 6d. per copy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has misunderstood the argument.  I, at any rate, am not thinking of running off again a new issue.  All the work has been done in respect of this volume.  Say 400 copies are required for official purposes, and you reckon on the possibility of selling 100 extra, instead of running off 400, you run off 500, and the extra 100 are bound.  The cost of the extra number over and above what would be necessary for the 400 should be the price when divided into the total number.  I think there could be no loss on it.  It would mean that you are selling an article at very much below cost in the ordinary commercial sense, but you would be providing the public with information on which they could <Col N="250" /> base their criticism of the Government and Parliament with knowledge.  As a rule at present they make that criticism without knowledge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not this really the case?  Deputy Johnson wants 100 extra copies printed; if these 100 are taken up by the public, well and good, and if they are not it means 100 waste copies, which will have to be scrapped, and that must mean increasing the price per copy for ones that must in the ordinary way be printed.  Looking at Government publications as a whole, and trying to estimate what likelihood there is of the public generally being purchasers, I think it must be recognised, at all events in the present state of public opinion, that there will not be ready purchasers for most of the documents issued from this House.  It must be borne in mind also that the public as a whole are either too lazy, or they have too much to do, to sit down and peruse documents like the debates of this House.  They are quite satisfied to take the condensed accounts as given by the Press of what happened in the Dáil.  I do not think advertisements and propaganda are going to get any reasonable number of the public to read these volumes in detail.</P>

      <P>In connection with the reports of the proceedings of the Oireachtas, I know that many of the provincial papers, nearly all of whom I am acquainted with, would be very happy to get these publications with a view to publishing extracts from them, or publishing the reports in detail.  I do not know of any paper that would not be anxious to get them.  I have met journalists who have asked me if I could get them copies.  I could get copies if I chose to do it, but I did not. <Col N="251" /> Some of them have found the means of getting copies, either as purchasers or otherwise, and reports taken from these publications are published extensively in the local Press, and these reports are eaten up by the local public.  I have been told by local people that these reports are the most interesting things they see in the local papers.  If these reports were sent to the local Press they would reach all the public, and they would be read with avidity. I think it would be a wholesome thing to have them made available for the provincial Press.  I am convinced they are wanted in the country, and that they would be welcomed.  This would be better than to have reports published, perhaps, in only some papers, and leave Deputies open to the slur that they asked papers down the country to have reports concerning themselves published, which I know is not a fact.  If they are published at all, it is because the editors down the country think they are good material and they want them published, especially, I believe, in South Tipperary.</P>

I will look into it again but as far as I understand, nothing would be saved by adopting Deputy Johnson's suggestion.  In fact, in a great many cases that is actually what is done. The re-print is got before the plates are taken off the machine, and as far as I can understand the matter, we could not sell such publications as have been mentioned more cheaply without an actual loss.  As a matter of fact, the price is, in certain cases, actually cut below what it should be even on the cheapest basis.  I do not know whether Deputy Gorey has heard that the country papers can get the Dáil Debates, which, I take it, was what he was chiefly referring to, at an annual fee of £3 3s. 0d.</P>

      <P>I would ask your leave, A Leas-Chinn Comhairle, to take sub-heads (i) and (j) together, because the Stationery Office supplies the paper on which the printing is done it is a little difficult to dissociate the printing from the paper.  Dealing with (i) and (j) together, I would like to call the attention of the Dáil to the expenditure on printing and stationery shown on pages 82 and 83 for the various public Departments.  Deputies will find that the largest item is printing under the Representation of the People Act.  That has been more or less explained on an earlier Estimate. The next largest item is £28,000 on printing and paper for the Army. Without further explanation, that seems to me to be a very large amount. I am glad to see that the Minister for Defence is in his sentry box mounting guard over this item, and we may get some explanation of it from him.  The Army costs £28,000 for printing and paper&mdash;more than twice as much as the Oireachtas.  For every golden word uttered in the Seanad, and for every green word that is uttered here, the cost is half as much as for the strong, silent Army in respect of printing and paper.  On a rough calculation&mdash;it is very rough and may be wrong&mdash;the Army is spending £1 10s. 0d. per serving soldier on printing and paper.  Is <Col N="253" /> it not possible to reduce that amount to some extent?  I cannot help feeling that a great deal of the work that might be done by the duplicator is being printed, and at disproportionate cost.  If you have units like a brigade that has to produce, say, twelve or perhaps twenty copies of its daily orders, these might be duplicated and not printed.  I think the Estimate is one that requires a little further justification, because, taking the strength of the Army into account, I find that the cost works out at more than £1 10s. 0d.  In fact, it works out for an Army of 14,000 men at about £2 0s. 0d. per man.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have that explanation.  It justifies me in discussing the point.  That is, as the Minister explains quite truly, last year's expenditure, but we cannot dismiss it <Col N="254" /> from mind in reviewing the coming year's expenditure.  We should have been given some indication that this is abnormal expenditure.  For instance, in the Oireachtas Vote we are told that it includes the cost of printing the debates and records, but in the Army Vote we are not given any explanation at all.  If it were necessary to set the Army up with a stock of new typewriters, that would involve an inflation of the Vote.  The only point I am trying to make is that we ought to have a little more justification for this amount before we pass the Estimate for printing and paper in the coming year.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> The chief duty of the Valuation Department is to carry out the annual revision of valuation of tenements, when requested by the rating authorities. The valuations include such rateable hereditaments as railways, tramways, electric lighting works, gas works, fisheries, tolls, rights of turbary, and all buildings whether new, reconstructed or otherwise altered in value. This work is done by valuers who are sent out to every district in the Saorstát and make an investigation in each case in which a revision of valuation is requested.  When appeals are made against the valuation fixed on revision, a further visit in each case by a different valuer is necessitated and if the appellant proceeds further to the Circuit Court a valuer has to attend the Court and give evidence.  Copies of the revised valuation lists and the lists of changes are furnished annually to the rating authorities.  The re-valuation of the Borough of Waterford, which was undertaken as a result of a request from the Corporation in 1922, is still in progress and decisions in the first appeals are expected in the near future.  In all cases where Estate Duty is chargeable on lands or buildings, the Estate Duty Office refers to the Valuation Department for report as to value and that necessitates an inspection of the ground in nearly every case. Changes in boundaries are carried out in accordance with the Boundary Survey Acts by the Valuation Department. That necessitates examinations of boundaries.  The Valuation Department does work for other Departments. It gives lists of changes of valuation to the Revenue Department for Income Tax purposes.  It furnishes capital valuation in cases of Old Age Pension claims and also returns to the Customs and Excise all changes in valuation of licensed premises.  It certifies claims by local rating authorities for contribution in lieu of rates on Government property.  For the Office of Public Works, the Local Government Department and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs it gives estimates of the letting value of premises. It supplies to the public, at certain fees, <Col N="256" /> certificates of valuation and maps in connection with the Land Acts.</P>
    <P>There is very little change in the Estimate for the coming year.  The principal reduction is in connection with the Waterford re-valuation, which marks a decrease of £500.  That is because the valuation is complete.  It is only the appeals that are now being dealt with.  Dealing with the Appropriations-in-Aid, the first item is a statutory sum which is repayable by counties and county boroughs for the services of the Valuation Department. It is a fixed annual sum.  The contribution of £150 by the County Borough of Waterford is half the estimated cost that would fall on the Department this year in connection with the re-valuation. The last item of £750 is the estimated amount of receipts from fees for certificates of valuation from miscellaneous sources.  The decrease in the estimated receipts is attributable to the falling off in demand for certificates under the Land Act and to the fact that costs awarded to the Department in appeal cases will in future be credited to Law Charges and Revenue Commissioners Votes, and not to this Vote, as in the past.  The normal sum that would be received annually for certificates from the Valuation Office would be about £500.  £250 has been added to the Estimate, as representing the estimated extent of extra work this year in connection with the Land Act.</P>

      <P>Under sub-head (a) I wish to draw the Minister's attention to what appears to be a very small matter&mdash;the wages paid to cleaners in the offices.  This year they are reduced to 13/- per week from 25/2 last year. In footnote (e) it is stated that during the summer months two of those cleaners are on part-time work at a wage of 8/6 per week.  This is the only page in the book on which I can see any reference to reduction of a wage of 13/6 to 8/6.  I understand that the reduction is due to the fact that a couple of fires, which require to be lighted in the winter, are not lighted in the summer months.  The result is that these women's wages, which were reduced from 25/2 last year to 13/6 this year, are brought down in the summer <Col N="257" /> months to 8/6.  Nobody will say here that there has been any decrease in the cost of living.  For the Government, therefore, to take advantage of the fact that there are so many females unemployed in the city in order to get this form of cheap labour, is not right. I would ask the Minister if he would go into the matter and find out why this Department is the only Department in the Government to reduce the wages of widows.  I understand that nearly all these cleaners are widows. To reduce their wages in the summer months to 8/6 per week is no credit to the Government.</P>

      <P>In connection with this Vote, the total for salaries, wages and allowances is put down this year at £36,334.  Last year the figure was £36,382, so that it is practically a line ball as between the two years.  The number of people employed, as detailed in the list, is 93, as compared with a hundred last year.  That, too, is practically a line ball.  The amount put down for bonus is £12,248 this year, while last year the figure was £12,039.  It appears from these figures that to the salaries practically fifty per cent. is added as bonus.  That seems to me to work out at a very high figure. It seems strange that the salaries should remain practically unchanged while the number employed is seven less than last year.</P>

I am sure they are being paid on the recognised general basis.  They are paid according to a recognised scale. Offices do not act individually in matters of this kind.  The scales are sanctioned by the Department of Finance. The scales for bonus are the scales in operation everywhere in departments. Where you have on a staff a number not very highly paid the bonus will be well over fifty per cent.  It is the ordinary rate of bonus that is paid here.</P>

In view of the fact that they get no holidays and have to be in twice a day, I hope he will not attempt to justify a wage of 8/6 a week.</P>

      <P>All this depends on the amount of work.  This is really part-time employment.  For instance, charwomen who are employed one or two days a week in different houses are paid less than 8/6 where they are only employed one day a week.  All this is really a question of part-time employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Byrne is wrong in one respect.  There is no change in the Estimate, as compared with the last year, for the rate for cleaners.  It was 13s. plus bonus, I take it, in each case.  I agree that some justification should be made for reducing the pay in the summer months from 13s. a week, plus bonus, to 8s. 6d. a week, plus bonus.  I am assuming now that bonus will be paid even when they are on part-time employment.  The case, I think, is a fair one to make, that women who are employed in the winter months have to live in the summer months, and the opportunities for paying for food and clothing are not reduced by the fact that the warm weather comes in.  There may be less work in the summer, due to the absence of fires, but that would apply, I suppose, to most other departments.  There are certain seasons when there is less work, and certain seasons when there is more work, and if you have staffs which are required to carry on the work of an office, I think the justification for a reduction in the case of two cleaners in the summer time, is a very slight one, indeed.  It is rather too petty to make in the case of persons who are required all the year round, at any rate for some part of the operation of cleaning.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say why it is necessary to continue to employ four temporary assistant-valuers and surveyors?  I notice that the number employed last year was five.  I would also like to know why the three messengers employed last year are designated as temporary messengers this year.

      <P>These particular messengers do not appear to be on the established staff.  Of course, I should point out to the Deputy that there are temporary messengers as well as established messengers employed in the Government service.  If he looks over the Estimates I think he will find that there is quite a number of temporary messengers employed.  Some of them may become permanent later.  The temporary valuers are, to some extent, employed on work in connection with the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act.  I think it is the falling-off in that work that accounts for one less valuer being employed.  The work in the Valuation Office fell into arrear to some extent, the staff being diverted to work in connection with the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act.</P>

    <P>The work of the Ordnance Survey Department is chiefly to revise the county maps on the 25-inch scale at fixed intervals and to publish the resulting maps of the 25-inch scale, and the 6-inch scale.  The 6-inch scale maps are produced by photography from the 25-inch maps.  The Ordnance Survey also prepare other maps for Government Departments.  During the past twelve months maps were prepared for the Office of Public Works, the Ministry of Fisheries, for the north-east Boundary Commission, for the Ministry of Justice and for the Irish Language Commission.  In 1923, the normal programme of work was discontinued and a revision of large <Col N="261" /> areas in the counties of Roscommon, Mayo and Galway, in which the late Congested Districts Board operated, was taken up and the field staff of the Survey is at present employed in these counties.  The whole question of staffing the Ordnance Survey is in suspense pending the reorganisation which is proposed to be effected as soon as the Committee at present inquiring into certain aspects of the survey work has reported.  There was a great deal of delay about the taking up of the work of that Committee, but it is now dealing with the matter. After it was appointed by the Dáil it held a couple of meetings, and the technical members of the Committee have had numerous consultations and have met frequently and it is hoped that the Committee will be able to report without any very great delay.  The normal strength of the staff is 194, exclusive of cleaners.  The estimate provides for a staff of 217, also exclusive of cleaners.  The increase is caused by the re-instatement of victimised officers.  That matter was before the Executive Council some time ago and it was felt that those officers who had been practically given the choice of enlisting in the British Army, during the European war, or getting out, had made good their case for re-instatement as victimised Civil Servants. But actually 34 of the staff of the Survey are seconded for service in other Government Departments.  So there are really only 183 available for survey work, and that is rather less than the normal staff required.  There has been no appointment, in view of the prospective reorganisation, to any vacant position in the Survey, apart from the re-instatements, since the 1st April, 1922.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head (a) there are decreases amounting to £5,282.  There has been an increase which caused the decrease not to be reflected as it should be reflected, from £245 to £224.  There is a small increase in travelling expenses.</P>
    <P>There are no very substantial changes in the other items.  Incidental expenses as Deputies will see are down because the cost of the purchase of a <Col N="262" /> new motor delivery van which was in last year's estimate is not in this year's estimate.  The figure of £500 has been allowed for receipts from the sale of maps.  Since the passing of the Land Act of 1923, the sale of large-scale Survey maps has increased very greatly, and if the sales are continued at the same rate in the present year the amount estimated for will be realised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give us information as to when the report he spoke of is likely to be presented to the Ministry, and I hope the contents made known to the Dáil?  Because if there is to be much longer delay, and if the policy of the Ministry regarding the ordinary promotions given in the service is to be suspended until that report is received, then the amount of discontent and dissatisfaction that prevails in the Ordnance Survey will continue and will greatly increase, and there will be general defects in the work because of the fact that the staff is dissatisfied.</P>
      <P>The Minister says, if I understood him aright, that there has been no promotion since 1922, while a year ago there was a promise that nothing could be done until the report of the Committee was presented: that there would be a general suspension of the proposals for reorganisation until the Committee that was then set up to inquire into an entirely different matter, had reported.  The Committee has not been sitting.  Delays have occurred, as has been explained, and it is now thought and hoped that the Committee will shortly report.  Then, perhaps, the question of the reorganisation of the staff will be taken into account.  I think it is due to the staff to have some indication at any rate, as to when this reorganisation is to take place.  It is not fair that in this particular section of the Civil Service everything should be held up so long a time as from April, 1922, until 1925, with the probability of 1926.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless the report comes in before the Dáil adjourns.  I <Col N="263" /> think the patience of the staff is being tried over much, and some clear indication should be given as to when this reorganisation is to take place.  Now, I do not want to raise the question which led to the appointment of the Committee if it is likely to prejudice any discussion or any consideration offered by the Committee.  But it occurs to me that the terms of reference to the Committee were not likely to lead to the clearing up of the questions that were raised a year ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to have some information from the Minister as to whether the Committee is interpreting its terms of reference so as to include an inquiry into the stocks of maps and plates, the disposal of these maps and plates and the destruction of them.  I think the terms of reference might well be interpreted as meaning that the Committee might not have anything to do with these allegations, and perhaps we might have some information as to whether the Committee is interpreting its terms of reference so as to include that inquiry.  Perhaps, also, we could have some information as to what is meant by &ldquo;Acting Director&rdquo; and &ldquo;Assistant Acting Director.&rdquo;  Are we to understand that the term &ldquo;Acting Director&rdquo; is a term applied pending the reorganisation, and has the Acting Director sufficient technical knowledge to carry on this work, even for this period of delay pending the reorganisation? Also we might have some information about the position of the Assistant Acting Director.  The Assistant Acting Director is paid a sum of £136 per annum, plus bonus, plus an allowance of £120.  That is a curious position for the Assistant Acting Director to be in, and I think that a little clarification of that is required. Then I see that amongst the civil assistants and labourers, there are a number of British Army pensioners who are paid their pensions and military allowances in addition to the pay here provided.  I would like to have from the Minister some information as to the rate of pay that is given to these British Army pensioners and a comparison between their rate of pay and the rate of pay of other men who <Col N="264" /> are not British Army pensioners but who are doing the same class of work. Is the fact that men are receiving pensions for their service in the British Army taken into account in fixing the pay they are receiving for their work in the Ordnance Survey?  I hope the Minister will be able to answer that question, because it raises an important matter of principle, one which ought to be made clear.  The proposition that because a man is receiving a pension, especially a pension for services outside the country, he should be engaged at a lower rate of pay than his equals in competition is a vicious one, and we ought not to allow it to enter the service here.  I would like that point cleared up.  The footnote drawing attention to the fact that a number of these men are British Army pensioners inevitably raises that query.</P>

      <P>I would like to have some information in reference to the Ordnance Survey officers who were discharged seven or eight years ago because they refused to join the British Army.  A number of officers did join the British Army, and they were given full credit for the time they served in the Army, and received, I believe, a very large gratuity on discharge.  I would like to know if those who refused to join, who were discharged and who were wanderers here and there for eight years, have been reinstated on the permanent staff, if they have received gratuities for the time they were out, and if they have been given credit for all these years with those who joined the British Army.</P>

Some of them were not established men&mdash;I am speaking from recollection.  They claim that if they had continued to serve they would, in the intervening period, have been established, and that to reinstate them as temporary men, even allowing them credit for the time they were out, was not fair, and that is a matter that is still outstanding.  In regard to the matter raised by Deputy Johnson, I cannot say directly how the <Col N="265" /> Committee is interpreting its terms of reference, but it never struck me that it would fail to inquire into the matters to which the Deputy has referred.  I think the terms of reference were so drafted that they were certain to do that.</P>

The chairman who had been appointed did not find himself able to act, and we had to appoint a new chairman.  The Committee is now doing the work for which it was appointed.  I cannot state definitely when they will report, but I am given to understand that it will not be long, and I do not think there is any danger&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The <Col N="266" /> Committee was appointed as a result. There was some delay in the publication of the terms of reference.  I have not got them by me, but I have the impression that they do not assuredly contemplate an examination of the charges that were made; they make it possible that those particular charges need not be examined, and they also make it possible that the persons who made the charges need not be examined.  I would like a definite assurance that the impression which I have is a wrong one, that the terms of reference will allow the whole of the case to be inquired into, and that the persons who have any evidence to put forward, who were, or are, on the staff, will be invited to give evidence before the Committee.</P>
