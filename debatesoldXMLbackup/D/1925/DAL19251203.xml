      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that delay in lodging an Order awarding £925 as compensation for malicious injuries to Mr. Robert Coll, of Elton, Co. Limerick, awarded by the Circuit Court Judge in June, 1925, is due to the fact that the representative of the Department of Finance applied for a case to be stated in respect of a portion of the claim; whether he can state if it is proposed to make any further appeal, and whether, in view of the fact that no portion of the claim can be paid until such appeal is dealt with, he will expedite the hearing of the matter.</P>

When these returns have been completed the information will be laid before the Dáil.  I do not expect that that information will be available until the New Year.</P>

      <P>The facts are as stated in the Deputy's question.  The pensioner is maintained by a nephew on a holding of 60 acres (Valuation £25 5s. 0d.) carrying 16 cattle and a horse.  There are 3 acres of tillage and the usual pigs and fowl are kept.  As long as the maintenance is continued in this substantial home the decision already given cannot be reconsidered, or a higher rate of pension than 2s. a week allowed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture <Col N="1169" /> if he is aware that the House of Lords decided in 1921 that, in the case of the Fenit Island (Hurly) Estate, the landlord was liable for the maintenance of the sea-wall; that the landlord has since refused to pay the sum of £1,400, damages and costs, and that the sea-wall is now almost completely broken down, with the result that these lands were flooded for six months from December, 1924; if the Land Commission have now taken over this estate, without requiring the landlord to discharge the obligation imposed on him by the decision of the House of Lords, and, if not, why that Department have repudiated responsibility for the condition of the sea-wall and have suggested that the tenants should reconstruct it, and if the facts are as stated whether any steps will be taken to compel the landlord to restore the sea-wall, or whether he will undertake to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears the landlord is liable for the maintenance of the embankment referred to, and when a breach occurred some years ago the tenants brought an action for damages against him, and a decision was given in their favour.  The landlord appealed and eventually the case went to the House of Lords, where the decision in the tenants' favour was upheld. The damages and costs of these proceedings amount, the Commissioners are informed, to £1,400 or £1,500, and the tenants applied to the Land Commission through their solicitor that they be paid out of the compounded arrears of rent and payment in lieu of rent payable to the landlord.  He was informed that this application must be made to the Judicial Commissioner in the manner prescribed by the Rules of the Land Commission, but up to the present such application has not been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estate is pending for sale under the Act of 1923, but it has not yet been vested in the Land Commission.  A breach occurred in the embankment in December last year, and the Land Commission called on the landlord to repair it which he has declined to do.  The Land Commission informed the solicitor for the tenants that the Commission <Col N="1170" /> was not liable for the repair, and stated that it would appear that the tenants would have a right in view of the decision referred to above to repair the embankment and collect the cost as a salvage payment from the landlord, but that this was only the view of the Commissioners, and that he would doubtless advise them.  The Commission also stated it appeared to them that such salvage payment would rank before any incumbrances on the allocation of the purchase money of the estate when it had been advanced by the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for EXTERNAL AFFAIRS (Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Dáil at its rising this day do adjourn until Tuesday next.&rdquo;  I move that motion because the only item on the agenda for to-morrow is a motion by Deputy Lyons who is agreeable to have it adjourned on condition that it will be given Government time early next week.  One might have hoped that the President would have been able to make a statement, but we do not expect him or the other two Ministers who are with him back by to-morrow. Even if he were to get back, he would only arrive in the morning and I think it would be impossible for him to make a statement.  Therefore, as Deputy Lyons is agreeable to have his motion taken next week and as there is no other business on the agenda for to-morrow, I move this Resolution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is disappointing that we are to be left without any information as to the course of proceedings or as to the line that the Government is taking in respect of the proceedings in London, and that we are to be left until Tuesday next without any information.  I do not know whether it is within the competence <Col N="1172" /> of Ministers present, but in view of published reports, I think it is important that the Dáil should have an opportunity of considering, or have some intimation of the subjects under discussion.  For instance, we learn that the question of Article 5 of the Treaty is now on the carpet, and we ought to know, I think, whether any notification has been received from the British Government as to the amount of their claim under that Article, and whether any notification has been sent by the Executive Council of the amount of our counter-claim under that Article. I think it will be a very deplorable state of things if we come back and learn that agreements have been entered into, even though they are to be the subject of legislation, without informing the country of what line the Government is adopting in regard to the modification of the Treaty or the Constitution. I think that before any tentative agreement is made in London, there should be consultation and discussion of a public character on this side of the water.  I feel that by agreeing to adjourn now we are practically inviting the President and his colleagues to enter into compacts without the country having any knowledge about even the subject upon which these compacts are being entered into. We know that the Boundary Commission Report has been the subject of discussion and we know, from an answer given in the British House of Commons yesterday, that the report of the Boundary Commission is not to be presented at present, but I think we ought to know something of the proposals that are being made by the Executive Council which have led to the decision to postpone the presentation of the Boundary Commission's report.  I feel that we are going to be led into a position from which it will be difficult to withdraw and, if some of the rumours have any foundation, that we ought to withdraw, and I feel that we ought at least be informed before any tentative agreement is entered upon of the basis of that agreement.  I am not going to oppose the adjournment if the Minister has no business to put before the Dáil to-morrow, but I make this plea that the House should <Col N="1173" /> be taken into the confidence of the Ministry in a matter of such grave concern, and of such widespread and anxious interest that is the cause of this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in absolute agreement with Deputy Johnson in this matter.  Since the actual signing of the Treaty itself nothing excited so much anxious interest in the country as the negotiations at present being conducted in London.  To my mind, it is most regrettable for many reasons that the Minister for External Affairs is present here instead of exercising the functions of his office.  What the public want to know is, whether or not the members of the Executive Council who are in London are acting as the Irish deputation acted on the occasion of the signing of the Treaty, or are they merely exploring paths of peace upon which they mean to report to the Dáil when the opportunity is provided to them.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of External Affairs is the one visible and outward sign to the world of our sovereign status.  The fact that we, among the members of the Commonwealth of Nations, have a Ministry of External Affairs, is an unmistakable indication of the fact that we are not only a nation among the nations of the Commonwealth, but a sovereign nation amongst them.  If there are negotiations proceeding with a view to an alteration of the Treaty, we, as one of the high contracting parties to that, ought to be represented, even if we had only one representative, by our Minister for External Affairs, even if it were merely, to use a word which is so much in favour in recent days, as a gesture it is desirable. I do not mind rumours in newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, but I was about to say that I am too familiar with these methods of diplomacy.  Our long history has taught us how to view inspired paragraphs in British newspapers.  They are feelers, <i>ballons d'essai</i>, sent up to see how certain proposals would be received. Very often they are circulated to damage those who are engaged in <Col N="1174" /> the negotiations.  It is quite obvious, or ought to be obvious, to everyone that if a reconsideration of the Treaty is in progress, if that important clause in regard to financial relations is now under discussion, and if there are proposals for its amendment, with all respect to the Executive Council, I say they have no mandate therefor, and they ought to have a mandate if they are to be authoritative exponents of the Irish claim and the Irish position. It does seem an extraordinary thing that, after we have had this revelation as to the proceedings in the Boundary Commission, the same Executive Council which, under the constitutional position of collective responsibility, is responsible for whatever there is to be done, should now, and I say it with all due regard to language, appear to be engaged in further negotiations as if clothed with an authority they do not possess, even though they are members of the Executive Council.  We ought to be told and we ought to be consulted. After all, there is a constitutional Government here, or, at all events, there is the simulacrum of it, and appearances ought to be preserved, even although the reality may have disappeared. We ought to know what is being done in the name of the Irish nation of which we have the honour to be representatives in this House, which is an essential part of the Government of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to what Deputy Johnson and Deputy Professor Magennis have said in this matter.  I think it would be nothing short of a tragedy if this motion were accepted without any expression of opinion from this House regarding the position that confronts the country.  Personally, I recognise how serious and grave it is, but in order that we may not be responsible ourselves for making the position even graver than it is, it is very desirable that we should express our views.  We should say first that the members of the Executive Council now in London should make very sure that they are not going to be placed in the position of the men who went over to sign the Treaty, of having a pistol put to their heads to sign or reject an agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> I think the point raised by Deputy Magennis is very serious.  That there should be in any discussion whatever of that Article of the Treaty any indication on the part of our representatives that we owe England anything under that Article of the Treaty would be breaking faith with the people at home.  We undertake no such responsibility or obligations.  If they are discussing or negotiating on that point, I say they are not expressing the will of the people of this country.  They have no authority from the Dáil to do so, and the country, I think, will not stand for that.  Deputies on other sides of the House feel as I do on this matter, and I think it is right that expression should be given to their views.</P>

      <P>I am not going to complain that the Government cannot give us information as to the negotiations that are going on now.  I do not believe it is possible to carry on negotiations simultaneously with a debate in Parliament.  Let us just imagine that we have rights in this matter.  So has the Parliament of Northern Ireland. So has the Parliament of Westminster. If there were three simultaneous debates going on in these Parliaments, together with the negotiations, could these negotiations come to anything?  If they do come to nothing, we shall be the worse off for it.</P>

      <P>Well, that is my personal opinion.  Any Deputy may controvert that point, but I presume the Ministers will consider that we could gain some advantages by entering into these negotiations, advantages that we have not under present conditions. Anyway, leaving that aside, I do say, as one with some experience of affairs, that it is not possible to have a debate simultaneously with negotiations, and that the only effect of that would be to bring the negotiations to nothing.</P>

      <P>He said it was possible but he did not think it likely.  It is possible he may return, say, by Sunday. Well, what is going to happen in the interval?  There would be a very widespread desire for information.  Is the President going to give his statement on this matter?  Is he going to give an interview to an English newspaper as he did last week?  Is the President going to go unexpected and uninvited to a remote part of the County Monaghan and make a statement there, and then dismiss the Dáil two days later with a statement that the situation is under the careful consideration of the Executive Council?  I humbly suggest that the Dáil should receive the first statement and the first information there is to be given at the earliest moment, so as to render it possible for it to be debated and for <Col N="1177" /> questions to be asked.  That, I think, is a fairly sound constitutional ground. There should be no undue delay.  I suggest if there is any prospect of the President being here to-morrow we should adjourn now until to-morrow; adjourn to-day's business until to-morrow, and if that is not the case, then that our adjournment should only be until Monday, not Tuesday.  We are all of us, not only the Executive Council but each of the Deputies, agreed that we are facing a serious crisis; we have faced equally serious crises and come through them successfully.  But I do feel our individual and collective responsibility is going to be tested in the next week or ten days, as it has not been tested up to the present, and, therefore, I urge the Ministers to give us the earliest possible information as to the course of the negotiations that are now going on.</P>

      <P>There is only one point I desire to make.  I want to refer to the Minister's comments on the remarks of Deputy Cooper, when he asked if the present negotiations were dealing with the revision of the Constitution or the Treaty or not.  I think the Dáil has a right to know whether or not these negotiations are, in fact, for the revision of the Treaty and the revision of the Constitution. I think it is the opinion of a large number of the Deputies that the Executive Council, on its own initiative, has no right to conduct those negotiations.  The original delegates who signed the Treaty with Great Britain were specifically empowered to do so by the Dáil as a whole.  They were sent to London with a special mandate from the Dáil.  The delegates who are in London now have no such mandate from this Assembly to negotiate for a treaty which would revise or change the existing Treaty and the existing Constitution of the State.  When the Minister for Industry and Commerce asked us whatever we were sure that the present negotiations were of this character, I think the Dáil has a right to know from him the true facts of the case, and we will be, I suppose, content to form a judgement from his answer as to whether the present negotiations <Col N="1178" /> are, in fact, negotiations for the revision of the existing Treaty and the existing Constitution.</P>

      <P>I wish to join in the statements that have gone forward representative of every party in this House.  There is no one in the Dáil who would be anxious to do or say anything that would weaken the hands of our representatives on the other side.  But I do insist with the other Deputies who have spoken, that it is imperative that any settlement that may be come to should be first brought before this Oireachtas and put before the Irish people before being agreed to.  Many comments have been made on the other side about Article 5 of the Treaty and Statements have gone forward that the Irish nation owes obligations to England under that clause.  I deny that statement. We have a far larger claim under that clause than the people on the other side, but it is apparent by the Press comments in England that they want something for nothing.  The Irish people are the masters of every Deputy in this House, and they are the masters of every Deputy outside this House who have been elected to this Parliament, and if any change is made in the Treaty&mdash;there has been apparently a false interpretation put on Article 12 of the Treaty by the Boundary Commission&mdash;if, as I say, any change is made in the Treaty, it ought to be imperative that the change will be made whereby every Deputy elected to the Dáil by the Irish people will be permitted to take his seat in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want the unity and co-operation of the people of Ireland.  We have in the Dáil people of every party joining together in a helpful way to help the interests of the country.  We want it made possible for people outside the Dáil to be able to come forward and take their places in the Parliament of the nation and to help to build up this <Col N="1179" /> country.  We are not out for aggression, but we want the rights of the Irish people preserved, and anything we may say in this House we say it in a helpful way and to help the members of the Executive Council on the other side, and to show that the Irish nation is behind them if they stand firm and say that the rights of the people of this country ought to be preserved.  I repeat again we are not out for aggression, but we do not want the rights of this nation given away.  We do not want them given away for an imaginary bribe in Clause 5 of the Treaty. If we set up a Commission, or if we help to set up a Commission, it will be like that other Commission, placing the dice in the hands of the English people. It is time for plain speaking.  The English have not all the trump cards in this game.  I hope a satisfactory settlement will be come to in this dispute, and if any clause of the Treaty is set aside, then the clauses that are to our disadvantage must be set aside as well as the clauses to England's disadvantage. We want unity and co-operation amongst the people of Ireland.  We hope that we shall have that co-operation and if our representatives on the other side do the right thing by the country, they are sure of that co-operation.</P>

      <P>If only the result of this debate affected myself, I should be glad that it took place inasmuch as the Dáil has without information decided to give certain instructions or threats.  To that extent it is taking away a certain responsibility from the members of the Executive Council.  But I cannot think of it in that light.  I have to think of the positive harm that may be done by statements here while a very delicate situation is under consideration. What is all the hub-bub about?  A simple motion moved here that on the rising of the House this evening we should adjourn until Tuesday. From the ordinary course of procedure we have cut out one day&mdash;tomorrow. There is no business to come before the House to-morrow, save a motion by Deputy Lyons, and Deputy Lyons has consented to withdraw that and put it down for consideration on Tuesday next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> There is just a possibility of the President being here in time to make a statement on the Boundary situation to-morrow.  The Minister for Finance left for London this morning.  He gets there this evening.  There must be some reason for his going there.  Is it likely President Cosgrave, or the Vice-President, is going to leave to-night? Apart from that likelihood, or any deduction that people may make as to the likelihood, there is pretty well the certainty that no one of those at present in London will leave to-night.</P>
    <P>We are asked solemnly to arrange for this House to sit to-morrow.  There is no business, and I say there is not the slightest possibility of any statement from anybody with regard to the Boundary situation to-morrow.  The suggestion has been made by Deputy Cooper that instead of adjourning till next Tuesday, we should adjourn till Monday.  If that seems to suit the House, let it be accepted.  Again, however, I may repeat the warning, if the House assembles on Monday and there be no business for it on Monday, let us not have the objections that are usually raised, that the House is called here and there is no business for it to discuss. The House comes here on Monday on its own responsibility, and in face of a statement from me, being in possession of certain facts, that there is little likelihood of a statement then. There is, however, a possibility of a statement; there is a greater possibility by far than of any statement being made to-morrow.</P>
    <P>Now, as to what is happening in London. Deputy Johnson apparently thinks that the whole Dáil should be in London.  Deputy Magennis thinks the Minister for External Affairs should be there.  Some people apparently think nobody should be there.  We are asked for information as to what is going on.  What is the meaning of an Executive Council except it is a body appointed to represent this House in emergencies?  If people wanted to show their lack of confidence in the Executive Council, on the day of Deputy Professor MacNeill's resignation there was a time, an opportunity and a way for <Col N="1181" /> them to do so.  Until that opportunity and that way are availed of, the Executive Council has a right to explore paths to peace, which is all that is being done.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of talk has taken place as to the revision of the Treaty.  Can any members of this House, even if they were appointed for the purpose, revise the Treaty in London?  Have we not a Constitution and a Treaty, and have we not methods by which that Treaty or Constitution is to be amended, if amendment is necessary?  How, in the face of all that is known with regard to the Treaty and Constitution, anybody can believe that the people now in London are engaged on a revision of the Treaty and that this House is to have nothing to say to that, I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooper has put his point very reasonably.  He suggests that the Dáil ought to have information at the earliest possible date.  He reiterated that the Dáil should receive the first statement at the earliest possible opportunity. That, I believe, will be carried out.  Any information that is to be given will be given to the Dáil and will be given at the earliest possible moment.  What is our situation? What can I say beyond that people are at present in London?  What exact point they have got to, I do not know. Am I supposed to stand up here and indicate how far, even with my limited knowledge of what was going on, Press accounts were accurate or inaccurate? Am I supposed to indicate here that certain things will not be done or that certain things will be done, without knowing what course events are taking on the other side?</P>
    <P>I am going to confine myself now to what Deputy Gorey said on the occasion of Deputy Professor MacNeill's resignation.  The point was raised that the Dáil should have some statement.  The answer was implied, in the Vice-President's countering reply, that you cannot make a statement on a situation until you know what the situation is, and nobody at this moment knows what the situation is.  The situation has not yet crystallised. Deputy Gorey intervened in that debate to say that he did not think it was important what length of time the Executive <Col N="1182" /> Council took to make up their minds on this question.  He added: &ldquo;What is important is, not when they will do it, but what they will do.&rdquo;  It still remains an important thing.  You cannot hurry events beyond the pace at which events ordinarily unfold themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde asked as to the negotiations.  I am not in a position to give any information as to what I know with regard to the negotiations that were taking place on the other side, and I refuse to give any information. It would be only detached; it would be out of its context; it would, at this moment, probably be out of date, and it would only add to the difficulties instead of easing the situation. There is a simple motion that the House should adjourn till Tuesday.  I am sure the Minister for External Affairs will accept Deputy Cooper's amendment suggesting that the Dáil should meet on Monday.  If the Dáil like to come here on Monday, with my statement to them that there is very little possibility of any kind as to a declaration in regard to the Boundary proceedings then they can attend.</P>

Let us be certain that a statement can be made on the subject on the day we assemble here.

I suggest that Tuesday, as embodied in the original motion, should be retained.</P>

It is a matter for the Dáil itself to settle, and if the question is put we shall get some <Col N="1183" /> indication of what the Dáil desires.  I would like again to warn Deputies that no important negotiations can be successfully carried on with a continual current of criticism.  If the Reichstag had been sitting, if the Chamber of Deputies had been sitting, and if the House of Commons had been sitting, there would have been no Peace Pact at Locarno; there would be no Treaty signed in London last week.  It is therefore our duty to exercise restraint and it is our duty to bring our judgment freshly to any statement that is made.  Let that statement be made at the earliest possible moment. I am glad the Minister has accepted the proposal.  I hoped that Monday might be possible.  I will leave it to you to put the amendment.</P>

      <P>My point in this matter is not the day on which we are going to get information after a tentative provisional agreement has been entered into.  My desire is to have a statement from the Ministry so that the Dáil will be in possession of the Ministry's point of view regarding the subjects that are under negotiation. Deputy Cooper has spoken about the difficulties and, by way of illustration, said the Locarno Pact was signed in London, but the Deputy will admit at once that the point of view of the various Governments in respect to the international peace had been the subject of frequent and public discussion.  We knew the points of view of the various Government concerned there.  We do not know the point of view of this Government in this matter, and it is perfectly obvious that the subject under discussion is some modification of the Treaty or the Constitution, or both. That is a matter upon which we ought at least have the official views of the Government, so that public opinion of the country might have an opportunity of expressing itself before any negotiations are entered upon.  I feel in this matter that there has been no public discussion, though there has been an opportunity for hearing the views of the Government.  As a matter of fact, public discussion has been cloaked down because of the cry: &ldquo;We must trust the Government.&rdquo;</P>

We all know how difficult it is&mdash;and that the responsibilities are infinitely greater&mdash;to upset an agreement that has been provisionally made by the Executive Council.  My contention in this matter is that we are dealing with so absolutely vital a subject that there should be a public intimation of the views of the Executive Council&mdash; not on the details&mdash;but on a matter affecting the Treaty.</P>

      <P>It may be a debating point.  The Ministry have power to take the Dáil or the public into their confidence with regard to their views on the Treaty and on matters that have arisen out of the failure of Article 12.  There is a point of view and it is affecting the principle at issue. It is not a matter for discussion in detail, but until the Dáil, representing the country, is in a position to give an expression of opinion as to what is involved in any alteration of the Treaty or in the direction of any alteration of the Treaty the Ministry ought not to enter into any negotiations which <Col N="1185" /> would involve any modification of the Treaty, of any kind no matter how small.  They did it before.  They entered into a tentative agreement last year in regard to the appointment of a third Boundary Commissioner.  They agreed beforehand with the British Government that a certain course should be adopted to implement the Treaty, and they agreed to facilitate the appointment of a Boundary Commissioner. They came to the Dáil with a Bill, and because an agreement had been entered into&mdash;despite my vigorous opposition, I am glad to say&mdash;the Dáil almost unanimously agreed.</P>

I fear we are going to be faced next week with some provisional agreement which the Dáil will be told is practically an accomplished fact and that if they do not accept it that something terrible will happen.  I think the Ministry for its own sake should see the desirability of having public opinion behind it, and should take the Dáil into its confidence as to the principles at stake, before entering into any negotiations regarding the details.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson's position is that no negotiations should be carried on by the Executive Council unless he himself is a party to the negotiations. As that would be a perfectly absurd contention, he simply takes it a <Col N="1186" /> step further and says that the Executive Council is not competent to conduct any negotiations unless every member of the Dáil is in fact a negotiator. That is what it comes to in a nutshell.  The Deputy says that perhaps the Dáil will be faced with a certain position next week.  I hope it will.  I hope that Deputies will not always run away from the position by saying: &ldquo;We have nothing to do with it.  We never had responsibility.&rdquo;  I hope they will face up to their responsibility and will not come afterwards and say: &ldquo;We never had any responsibility. We were always faced with an accomplished fact.&rdquo;  Deputy Johnson mistakes the position of Deputies.  Deputies have to take responsibility as well as we have, or as well as the Executive Council have, and when Deputies are faced with the recommendation of the Executive Council, if they have strong convictions against that recommendation they should act on them, and take the consequences of acting on them, and not take Pontius Pilate's attitude and wash their hands of everything.</P>

      <P>I moved this resolution because I was very conscious that at the earliest possible moment a <Col N="1187" /> statement should be made to the Dáil. In moving that the Dáil do not meet to-morrow I explained to the House that I did that, not by any desire to put on the long finger the making of a statement, but because I thought the House would be anxious to hear it at the first possible moment.  It was not possible to make a statement to-morrow as the representatives would not be back, and the next day the Dáil would meet would be Tuesday.  Deputy Johnson seems to me to overlook entirely the fact that this House is the master.  He suggests that by the fact of the Executive Council doing something, the other Deputies can wash their hands of responsibilities. I think that is most unfair to the House.  If there is going to be any change, as the Deputy says, in the Constitution or in the Treaty that cannot be done as he knows perfectly well, by a stroke of the pen.  He knows perfectly that the whole machinery for doing that is so arranged that the Deputies and the country will have ample time to consider any proposed change and discuss it.  We, the members of the Executive Council, have certain powers.  But we cannot legislate off our own bat.  I may say that I am very anxious that the Dáil should be communicated with as soon as possible, and I may also say that I am conscious that it is practically impossible when there is more than one Government involved, to control what is known to the general public and what is not.  There fore, I think it is desirable that the Dáil should meet as soon as we are in a position to put a statement to the House. For that reason, I suggest that my motion be amended somewhat on these lines:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil, on its rising this day, do adjourn until Tuesday next, provided that if, in the opinion of the Executive Council, the public interest requries that the Dáil should meet on Monday next, the Ceann Comhairle be empowered to summon the Dáil to meet on that day, at an hour to be stated by him in such summons.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for DEFENCE (Mr. Hughes)</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving the Second Reading of this Bill, I think I may claim that it is one of the shortest measures that has come before the Dáil up to the present.  It contains one clause, and it is to the effect that the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, 1923 to 1925, shall continue in force until the 31st day of March, 1927, and <Col N="1191" /> shall then expire.  I think that on the last occasion when we asked for a continuance of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, it was promised to this House that by this time a permanent Act would be introduced. I am not, however, in a position at this juncture to introduce a permanent Act.  I do not think, in the first instance, that it would be good policy to introduce such an Act now.  So far as I can see from the connection which I have had with the Department of Defence, it will take, and it has taken, all the time from the establishment of the forces on the 1st October, 1924, up to date, to find out and sift what is best for the country and for the Army and what best possible form of permanent Defence Act could be brought forward.  I do not wish to come before the Dáil with a trumped-up Bill which would not pass muster.  If it is my privilege to bring a permanent Bill before the Dáil, I want to bring one which will be watertight and which will not require amendment every year.  For that reason I am convinced that I have taken the best possible course in order to bring forth a measure over which we can stand and which will be for the best interests both of the Army and the country.  Perhaps I will be asked what is my policy at present in regard to the Army.  My policy is to maintain discipline in the present Defence Forces and to see that they are in a position to defend the country so far as the country's needs are concerned, and to see that the forces which we are maintaining are such as the country can afford to pay for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that some people think that we could get on without an Army altogether. I do not share that opinion. I say that a moderate and well-equipped army is essential for the interests of the country.  It is essential also as an insurance, if for nothing else, because I believe that the price you pay for the Army is well worth the expenditure and you get value in return for it.  The Army and the Council of Defence have been considering for some time back what are the best organisation schemes that can be <Col N="1192" /> put forward.  These schemes have been under consideration for some time but they are not yet perfected.  But as a Bill must be brought in to legalise the forces after the 31st March, I think the only thing I can do is to continue the Emergency Bill up to the 31st March, 1927.  The Defence Forces measure we have at present is an immense document. There are 246 clauses and eight schedules in it, and with the amount of legislation which we have before us for this session, I do not think it would be possible, even if we were ready for it, to get that legislation through and to give it the time and attention which it would deserve.  Therefore, I am of opinion that I am doing the right thing in continuing the present Act in force for one year from the 31st March next.</P>
    <P>We have made some changes in connection with the Army under the present Act.  We are about to take in Cadets for the Air Force, and I hope to extend that system to the Army during the course of the coming year. The Army itself may possibly be greater or smaller, according as the exigencies of the case demand, but at present we have stopped recruiting except for No. 1 Battalion, the Irish-speaking Battalion, which is not up to strength.  That is the only branch we are recruiting for with the exception of the School of Music.  I think, under the circumstances, I am justified in asking the Dáil to pass this measure, and I may say confidently that it will be the last time that we will come before the Dáil to ask for a temporary measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much to say on the Bill.  I think that the Dáil has been very kind and generous to the Minister during his period of office. My objection to the Bill, although I listened to the Minister's explanation, is that it extends the present system for too long a period.  The Minister is asking power to retain the present organisation until March, 1927.  That, I think, is certainly a very long period, and it is a period that would cover the presumed meeting between the <Col N="1193" /> British and Irish Governments this time next year for the consideration of national defence under Article 6 of the Treaty.  One would hope that by that time, say, in twelve months' time, the Minister would have made up his mind as to what is to be the permanent organisation of the Army.  For that reason I object to the Bill in its present form.  In Committee I hope to move amendments to reduce the period for which the Bill will be in force.  My opposition to the Minister has considerably abated since I saw photographs of him jumping over hedges and ditches in the South of Ireland following the manoeuvres of the Irish Army last summer.  These photographs showed that he was taking a very active interest in his Department.  I understand that the President was also engaged in the manoeuvres and was guilty of many grave breaches of etiquette by giving advice now to one side or the other, but I suppose the Minister is not called upon to take disciplinary action in that case.</P>
      <P>In spite of the Minister's explanation, it is very remarkable that his is the only Department in the State which has not produced a permanent Bill for its organisation.  It is now several years since the State came into being, and the other Departments have been permanently organised.  I think the House would be very critical of the Minister for Justice if the police were at present on a temporary and semi-disorganised basis.  The same would apply to all the other Departments of State.  I wonder what explanation the Minister has to give for the fact that his Department is in this respect entirely exceptional, and that even now is not in the position of announcing a permanent policy for his Department.  That is my objection to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not rise to oppose the adoption of the measure. Having heard the Minister for Defence, I am glad that it is a temporary measure. The Bill comes before the House in a very brief form, but I think not briefer than the Minister's explanation of its provisions.  The Minister in his explanation indicates the necessity for a permanent military force.  For that <Col N="1194" /> reason I welcome the continuance of the measure on a temporary basis, so as to give him full time to reconsider his decision.  I am not clear as to the need of the country for a permanent military force, but I would like the Minister to indicate in what respect he considers a permanent military force to be necessary.  Looking at it from a commercial point of view, the military force has been criticised as a very heavy charge on the State.  We get no indication as to whether there has been any saving of expense, or a reduction in the number of men that have been enlisted.  The Minister has told us that recruiting has been stopped, and in that respect one feels he has done the right thing.  The matter of a standing army involves the question as to the numbers required, as well as the broad basic principle as to whether an army constituted such as the present is absolutely required for the defence of the Saorstát. I suppose between this and the time the temporary Bill expires we all will have opportunities of considering that question, both in its economic bearings and otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our War Lord indicated the necessity for a well-equipped, up-to-date army of whatever dimensions &mdash; he does not tell us the dimensions&mdash;adequate to the needs of the country, and I wish he would explain what that means. This matter has been so long under consideration that a decision should have been arrived at before this.  Deputy Esmonde, in referring to the Minister for Justice, compared the Army with the Police Force.  I do not think there is any comparison in that respect, because the Police Force had to be on a permanent basis from the start, but I think we might also criticise the Minister for Justice regarding delay in connection with Departments under his control.  For instance, today we are not favoured with the Rules of Court, which are a very essential factor in connection with the Department of Justice.  As I have said, I am not opposing this temporary measure, but I hope after the interval in which it has been in operation has elapsed, he will have modified his ideas as to the necessity for a standing army of <Col N="1195" /> any great dimensions, or as to the necessity for any elaborate programme for the defence of the country being necessary once we get the Boundary question settled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister if the acceptance of this Bill means an acceptance of the present Army organisation, and a stereotyping of the present form of organisation for the next two years? If that is so I would register a protest against it.  I think there is a good deal of feeling that a standing Army is not necessary in this State.  Suggestions have been made here already that an army organisation in the nature of a militia or territorial army, trained for a short period each year, with a small permanent staff, would be much more in keeping with the ideals of this country than a permanent standing army.  It is my opinion that in a country of the type of the Saorstát, where the ideals are all for peace, and which we hope will never get embroiled in any international troubles of any kind, something in the nature of a militia or territorial army will be much more in keeping with the nation's needs than a standing army.</P>
      <P>It is also a fact that a standing army can become, in certain cases, a danger to the country rather than an advantage, and in a country which has very little possibilities of offering active military services to men, and in a country in which people are tiring of the question of active military service, I think it is a thing which ought to receive consideration before the end of the two years, as to whether the present form of army organisation should continue.  I am not fully aware whether the acceptance of this Bill means that or not.  I agree with Deputy Esmonde that it would be better to accept the temporary measure for a year, instead of two years.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask whether the acceptance of this Bill now would prevent the Minister, between this and the date when this Bill expires, bringing in some measure providing for a number of married <Col N="1196" /> men whose wives can live on the strength of the army.  On many occasions, and practically to every Deputy, promises have been made on this matter. I have heard of cases where married men applied either for quarters or for wages which would enable them to keep their wives outside.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Minister for Defence is sympathetic in that direction, judging by some letters I have seen from his Department, but he is not doing anything beyond being sympathetic, and the result is there are many married men, who with their wives and families have to live on what is paid to single soldiers.  I think the Minister ought to be in a position today to make some arrangement to provide for married men who are already in the Army.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister one or two small questions with regard to regulations in the Army.  I would like if the Minister would indicate to the Dáil what becomes of the money which is stopped from men in the Army in cases of breaches of military discipline?  I understand that for some offences a certain number of days' pay is stopped, and there are other offences for which, I understand, the soldiers are fined.  I am also informed that these stoppages of pay and fines amount to a considerable sum in the year, and I shall be glad if the Minister would indicate what becomes of that money.  I would also like to ask him what are his intentions with regard to the matter mentioned by Deputy Byrne &mdash; the cases of married men in the Army.  I am speaking now of men in the Army who married subsequent to the Order issued in October, 1923, or in October, 1924, I am not quite sure which, and whether he proposes to make any provision whereby those men will be in receipt of sufficient pay to enable them to keep their wives outside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us what the policy of the Ministry of Defence is.  We had an explanation recently of the policy in another Department, and in that case we were told that the policy was to make of <Col N="1197" /> Ireland a Gaelic Nation.  The policy of the Ministry of Defence is to maintain discipline and to defend the country, both very admirable.  But I had hoped that the Minister would have given us some indication of the character of the forces of Defence and of the purpose of their training.  The matter was raised before, and we were not then told what was the view of the Ministry regarding the character of the Army forces.  He told us, for instance, that he proposed to increase the air forces considerably.  Well presumably there is a purpose in that increase.  A change is taking place and a new balance is in process of development, a modification in the number of infantry and an increase in the air forces. What I would like to have from the Minister is some idea or explanation as to the impulse which leads to that change in the balance.  It is a Defence Force, but there must be in mind some sort of an idea of the possible, potential enemy, and it would be in accordance with one's views as to the possibilities as to whether the Defence Forces ought have heavy artillery in good quantity, or cavalry, or develop an air force or a navy or any other arm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Defence Force Bill, not merely an Army Bill, and I think we are entitled to have some indication from the Minister as to whether the Army that is in being and that is being worked towards is to be a Defence Force, as continental armies are defence forces, or whether it is to be an enlarged police force.  I am not sorry that the Bill is again a temporary Bill, notwithstanding my recollection of the original Bill, which, as the Minister has p[ointed out, is a very voluminous one, containing 200 or 300 sections, and which passed through the Oireachtas without any discussion.  I think it is well that the present arrangement shall be still deemed to be temporary, because I am hoping that before the expiry of the present form of the Army, we may be in a position to discuss seriously the question of disarmament with a view to disarming.  Deputy Heffernan has suggested that in his mind a form of territorial forces would be much more in accordance with the needs of this <Col N="1198" /> country.  That may be so, and the whole question of armed forces and the necessity for an Army in this country will, I hope, arise and have a serious discussion here before the expiry of this present Bill.  Deputy Hewat has contributed to this discussion, and he has forgotten one very important feature of our present constitutional position.  I am going to ask the Dáil to consider it, not that I would elaborate it at the present time, but to bear it in mind in any consideration of the defence forces of the country.  We have in the Constitution as everybody knows, and some people pride themselves on, an Article which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;save in the case of actual invasion, the Irish Free State shall not be committed to active participation in any war without the assent of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a formulation of a doctrine which is receiving general acceptance in the British Dominions.  They are contending almost with unanimity that they will not be ever again brought into participation in any war without the consent of their own people.</P>
    <P>We have formulated that in our Constitution, but, unfortunately for our safety, we are nevertheless liable to attack if Great Britain were at war. The inclusion of this Article in our Constitution, while it may be true that we shall not be bound actively to participate in any war without our own consent, does not, unfortunately, make us immune from attack even if we are not participants in that war.  I would like to be able to advocate complete disarmament, and I think it would be satisfactory to Deputy Hewat and others if we were able to advocate complete disarmament.  The country would welcome, I imagine, a general disarmament policy for Ireland, inasmuch as we are not going to participate in any aggression, have no anxiety for territorial possessions, and we have not much likelihood of entering the field of international commerce, which so often leads to war.  Nevertheless, we are faced with the possibility that, if England were at war, under our present international relations we are liable to attack.  Because of that, it is, I am afraid, asking too much of the <Col N="1199" /> country to say that they should disarm.</P>
    <P>I would like it to be brought under the consideration of Deputies whether, with a view to disarmament, we ought not to move in matters of general political policy in such a direction as would secure for this country and its nationals immunity from attack until we have, of our volition, participated in a war.  I think our direct and deliberate policy should be to bring about a state of things whereby other countries, all the countries of the world, would come to recognise that we are not entering into any state of belligerency merely because another country has entered into that state.  By that fact we ought to get, or seek to get, the agreement from the nations of the world that we are to be immune from attack because we are not participators in a war.</P>
    <P>I am not asking the Minister to deal with this matter in any detail.  I am putting it forward here for record purposes and with a view to inducing Deputies to consider our constitutional and international situation in so far as it affects our defence policy and our armament policy.  I think that, if only for the sake of saving the costs of an army, the costs of a defence force, it is our bounden duty to endeavour to bring the country into a position internationally which would secure for us immunity from attack until we have, of our own volition, entered upon a state of belligerency.  Having those thoughts in mind, I am agreeable that the present Defence Forces Act should continue for a period.  I am not pressing for a permanent measure to be brought before the House, because I am hoping that long before the time when this Act ceases to operate the question I have raised will become a matter for general discussion, and perhaps our policy by that time can be determined by an international agreement in the direction that I have suggested.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate, but I do so now, having heard Deputy Johnson's speech.  Deputy Johnson always lives in a castle of dreams, a wonderful <Col N="1200" /> world where everybody is paid more wages than there is money to pay them with, and where everybody lives a strictly self-controlled and self-contained existence without regard to the crude forces of economics or outside competition.  When Deputy Johnson, in his castle of dreams, suggests that that castle should not take the necessary steps for its protection, maintenance and repair, then that castle is likely to topple about his head.  Deputy Johnson spoke about getting some international agreements that would secure us immunity from attack.  I have heard of one such international agreement, entered into about the year 1836.  It was an agreement under which the nations of Europe guaranteed Belgium immunity from attack and neutrality in case of war.  Deputy Johnson knows as well as I do what the value of that international agreement was in 1914.</P>

Deputy Johnson speaks of a general agreement.  the Locarno Pact is limited, and wisely limited, and the obligations of the Powers who have undertaken it are very clearly shown. I do not believe, having regard to the geographical conditions, to economic conditions, and to the fact that a footing in this island would be of such immense value to any Power at war with Great Britain, that any of the Great Powers would be prepared to guarantee our frontiers in the sense that they have guaranteed the frontiers of the Rhine in the Locarno Pact.</P>

      <P>I am a citizen of Saorstát Eireann, and I have not yet had any indication from the Minister for External Affairs as to whether he has acceded to the Locarno Pact.  I may have the personal view that it would be right and wise for us to accede, if only as an example to the <Col N="1201" /> rest of the Dominions; but at present we are not bound, and I would not go to war, and I would not ask Deputy Mulcahy to go to war, until we are bound.  I have strayed away from the point.  I do say that to build any faith on international agreements of a vague nature and a vague character, unless they are absolutely specified and unless they lay down precisely the amount of defence and support that we may hope to receive, is to dwell in illusion.</P>
      <P>Until the thing is more fully defined and more closely worked out than it is at present we should be foolish to disband our army forces.  I have not yet heard any indication that we have sought such guarantees from any foreign Power.  It would be a difficult thing and a somewhat invidious thing unless an International Congress were assembled to have such guarantees, and I suggest that we should not, on the second reading of a Bill to renew an Act for the period of one year, commit ourselves in any such important direction of international policy.  By seeking peace we might obtain war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy Johnson on a somewhat minor point.  Deputy Johnson welcomed the fact that it is a temporary Bill.  I, on the other hand, regret it.  I hoped that we might have a fixed and a permanent code to control and regulate our Defence Forces before now.  There is no guarantee that there will not be another renewing Bill in a year's time and that helps the Defence Forces to pass out of the control of the Dáil.  Established customs will have arisen; prescription will have been created and it will be very difficult to make any real change, however strongly the Deputies may feel in the matter.  This temporary code is springing up and assuming a permanent form, and every year it will be more difficult to reform it.  There is an old constitutional custom in the British Parliament that every year the Army Act comes on for renewal but in practice the British Parliament has virtually no control, in elaborating the procedure, the discipline, and the conduct of the British Army.  It has become an established institution, with its own customs.  I will not say I am afraid, but I have an uneasy feeling that with <Col N="1202" /> this system of temporary Acts we are adopting the same thing is happening here.  I am not a believer in excessive Parliamentary control of the Army, but I do think that in that institution we should be in a position to give it guidance and support.  I do not hold with tinkering with the Army.  I would like to have a more permanent measure. Therefore, I regret the fact that one of that character is not before us.</P>

      <P>I am glad that this Bill has met with unanimity in all parts of the House.  The questions raised are of a very minor nature.  The principal one was why there is not a permanent Bill before the Dáil.  I have given reasons why a permanent measure has not been introduced.  The best reason I can give is that it is not ready at the moment.  Deputy Esmonde complained that we are the only Department that has not produced permanent legislation. Several times in this House I have heard Ministers being twitted for rushing legislation and for coming back at subsequent sessions to have it amended.  I do not want to be in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the other Deputies who spoke are concerned, the only one who seemed to see anything wrong in the Bill was Deputy Heffernan.  He thought the Bill was to cover a period of two years.  The Bill is only for one year from the 31st March next.  As regards his point about the raising of a militia I am not convinced of the advisability of doing so at present.  Later on it may be considered advisable, but at the present time I do not think it would be the best thing for the country. Deputy Byrne and Deputy Morrissey Enquired as to the position of married men.  Of course, there is a number of married men in the Army at the moment.  These are men who joined up before the marriage allowance was stopped, and whose time has not yet expired, and they are drawing marriage allowances.  As regards other married men, regulations are being prepared at the present time which will give some assistance.  I do not say that the assistance will please everybody, but some assistance will be <Col N="1203" /> given to married men.  Deputy Morrissey wanted to know what becomes of fines.  These fines go to the Treasury and nobody gets any benefit from them except the taxpayer.  Deputy Johnson wants to know something about the character of the forces and their training. During the coming year the forces, as far as possible, will be divided into corps and services, and if it should ever arise that the Army would want to be expanded for any national emergency we will have the material to expand it at the shortest possible moment.  There was an enquiry as to the present strength of the Army.  The number provided for in the Army Vote last year was 1,078 officers, and the actual strength at the moment is 1,054.  The number of sergeants and N.C.O's of higher rank provided for was 1,583; the actual strength is 1,386.  The number of corporals provided for was 1,654; the actual strength is 1,217.  The number of privates provided for was 13,300, and the actual strength is 13,791, making a full total of 17,438.  These are all the points that were raised.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of the School Attendance Bill, 1925.  It is a Bill which has been so long expected by this House and on which so much comment has been made by reason of the delay that I do not think there is very much necessity for me to go into any great detail on the Second Reading, which concerns only the principle of the Bill.  Conditions in Saorstát Eireann with regard to school attendance may be briefly indicated, because it is by reason of the failure under the present conditions to secure attendance at school that this Bill is required. There had been an Act passed in 1892 to ensure attendance at schools and that Act had, to a great extent, failed for a variety of reasons.  In the first case, the Act was not mandatory in certain respects.  It was left optional to local authorities to set up school attendance committees who could enforce the Act, and in very many of the districts throughout the country the Act was not at all availed of, and where it was availed of, further weaknesses of the Act were soon made apparent. There were many loop-holes for escape.  It was very difficult to get cases brought and there were very limited penalties for non-compliance. This Act remedies the defects of the 1892 Act as far as those three items are concerned.  There was a further point that in the less populous districts in the rural areas the moneys that were paid to attendance officers were such that they did not succeed in getting any great attention to their duties.  That was an added defect in the working out of the Act which contained so many possibilities of being defeated by itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies who have read this Bill will see that it provides a fairly easy and certainly an easily enforceable method of securing attendance at schools.  The one big difficulty which had to be met and the difficulty which has caused the delay in introducing this measure was the finding of a suitable enforcing authority for the Bill when it became <Col N="1205" /> a statute.  That has been got over by making members of the Gárda Síochána the enforcing authorities, except in certain areas set out in the schedule to the Bill, those areas being Dublin and its suburbs, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  In those areas provision is made for the keeping on of the old attendance officers and the committees set up under the local authorities.  It has been found impossible to have the Gárdai undertake the duties that would be imposed upon them elsewhere under the Act in these districts that I have mentioned, and in the districts I have mentioned it happens to be the case that the machinery set up by the local authorities is working fairly efficiently, so that there will be no failure to have the Act enforced in these areas either.  The Bill, therefore, is designed to cover the defects of the 1892 Act.  It is believed that it does that by stopping up any loop-holes that existed in the prior Act through which persons could escape, by having an enforcing authority which can be made to enforce the provisions of the Act and by having non-compliance very drastically dealt with.</P>
    <P>There is one further point I would like to mention in introducing the Bill. One might almost found the introduction of the Bill on this particular matter.  That is the question of the percentage of those of school age who actually are in attendance at school. It has been calculated that the percentage of attendance at school is only about 73 or 74 of those actually on the rolls, and there has been a suspicion that that percentage is even too highly stated, because there is a definite knowledge that there are a great many pupils attending who are not returned on the rolls in that particular way in which the rolls are made up. A comparison with the ordinary census and returns with regard to children of school age, between the ages of six and fourteen, is set out in this Bill.  The difference between the number of children of school-going age and those actually returned as being on the roll is so great as to warrant the conclusion that the real percentage of absentees instead of being about 27 <Col N="1206" /> would actually be about 40.  Even if it were merely a 27 per cent. of absentees it would be sufficient, but the other calculation in all certainty would make the percentage of absentees somewhere around 40, and warrants in itself the introduction of a Bill of this sort.  I cannot conceive that there is going to be any serious objection to the principle of this Bill&mdash;that is to say, compulsion with regard to attendance at school within certain ages.  But I have no doubt that a great many objections will be taken on many points.  Already one is foreshadowed in respect to the age of 14.  Is that sufficient?  I submit if these points are going to be raised they are more matters for amendment and matters for discussion on the Committee Stage, where they can be argued and where the points can be met.  I do not think there is anything further to be said on the principle of the measure which is all that is under discussion to-day.  I move the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Bill which the Minister has just explained is an excellent one.  The only criticism that at this stage one would wish to make is that dealing with the compulsory attendance of the children being placed in the hands of the Gárda Síochána.  It must be recognised, on the other hand, that in a sparsely populated country very few organisations could operate in the way that the police force can operate.  Perhaps it is unwise to criticise that phase of the Bill without, at the same time, being able to suggest an alternative.  Personally, I could not suggest an alternative by which the Bill could be put into operation successfully. I merely raise the question so that the operation of the Bill on the part of the Gárda Síochána should interfere as little as possible with the liberty of the people.  On the other hand we must recognise that it is absolutely necessary that the children should be compelled to attend school and receive an education.  All over the country it is very difficult to get the parents to send the children to school if they can avoid doing so.  While I regret the necessity for compulsion, I could not contend that it is not necessary <Col N="1207" /> in a measure like this.  The other matters that the Minister referred to can be dealt with on the Committee Stage.  The whole principle of the Bill lies in compulsion and the means of seeing that it is effective.  I would like the Minister and the Dáil to consider the question of embodying some regulations in the Bill controlling the enforcement of compulsion by the police force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which, I may say, is long overdue. It is questionable whether the age of 14 is sufficiently high, and if it should not be extended to 16 years.  Some of us are of opinion that 16 years should be the minimum age, but, as the Minister has stated, these are matters that can be better dealt with on the Committee Stage.  I think it will be generally admitted that the Bill is absolutely necessary, as the standard of school attendance in this country is deplorably low. Deputies should try and find out what are the causes of that low attendance. The neglect of the parents, I submit, is not the only cause.  It is probably known to many Deputies that there are other reasons why children are not compelled to go to school by their parents.  I can give some of the reasons. Most Deputies have witnessed the spectacle of poor, barefooted children trudging two or three miles, often through snow, to school, where they have to remain for four, five or six hours.  The schoolhouse may not, perhaps, even have a very good roof. These children very often go to school with a bad breakfast or perhaps without any breakfast.  They have to remain in the school and are without food, and then trudge back home in the evening.  That state of affairs applies to both town and country, but with greater force, I think, to country districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that this Bill is not going to solve the problem unless some provision is made whereby poor children will be fed and clothed and the schools made attractive for the children so that they will realise that if they have to go to school they will be sure of getting a warm meal in the middle of the day.  If something like <Col N="1208" /> that could be done it would be one of the greatest factors towards improving school attendance.  Attendance at school would also be helped if something could be done to provide the poorer children with good boots and, if possible, warm clothing, particularly during the winter months.  The proposal in the Bill to enforce attendance through the police is an experiment that will, I hope, turn out successfully. Personally, I have my doubts as to whether it is a wise procedure.  If the Minister and the Department of Education believe that by making the Gárda Síochána responsible for the attendance of school children they are going to secure a better attendance, I am prepared to vote in favour of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>Not alone managers and teachers, but the whole country will welcome this Bill, which is long overdue.  That Act of 1892 has been alluded to.  That Act gave the option of compulsory attendance being enforced in the counties.  Some counties availed of it.  County Kildare, to which I have the honour to belong and for which I am one of the Deputies, put the Act in force some time after it was passed, and I think, as far as the towns are concerned, it worked fairly well.  It certainly did not work well in country districts.  One reason for that was that it was difficult to get the School Attendance Committees to meet regularly.  Sometimes weeks and months would elapse between meetings, and, of course, that had bad results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another reason for the poor school attendance was that in these days people had a dislike to being hard on the parents for not sending their children to school.  The excuse was that the parents could not allow the children to go to school because of home necessities.  That sort of excuse had very bad effects.  In many cases the penalties under the Act were so light that they were practically useless. Very often when penalties were imposed by magistrates those who had to pay them went round with collecting cards and collected not only the fine but a good deal more.  In some cases they collected from the very people who had imposed the fine.  That is one reason why I congratulated the Government <Col N="1209" /> on doing away with J.P.'s. These unfortunate gentlemen were very often beset by applicants imploring them to consider the position of the father and mother if a fine were inflicted. I hope that if fines are imposed by the new Bill the Gárda Síochána will be able to give attention to that aspect of the question.  I notice that School Attendance Committees are to be continued in the towns.  I think that is right, because it is is easy to get committees to attend to the work in the towns.  It is quite different in the country, and for that reason I think it is an extremely good idea&mdash;although Deputy Morrissey does not altogether fall in with it&mdash;that the Gárda Síochána should have charge in this respect. I do not think any better arrangement could be got, and up to the present I have not heard any suggested. The police know the conditions in the country and they have information that other people have not.  I think that the proposal in the Bill will prove to be a good one.</P>
    <P>A great many children waste time on the way to school.  I have often wondered what the feelings of the teachers must be when children that should be in school at 9 or 10 o'clock arrive about 12.  I think the Gárda Síochána will now be entitled to ask children whom they find playing about the streets or roads at 11.30 why they are not at school.  That power should have a good effect on the attendance.</P>
    <P>There is a class of children very difficult to deal with, but under this Bill they might be looked after.  I refer to the children of travelling gypsies.  I alluded to this matter when the Local Government Bill was before the Dáil. Since that the number of caravans that are going through the country have very much increased.  I have seen as many as 30 children with two such encampments. I took the trouble to count them and out of two vans came 30 children. I do not know how many grown up people were there.  I am perfectly certain that these children do not attend school; they grow up wild, and if not looked after they become apaches. It seems to me that something should be done for children like these and that their position should be brought to the attention of the police.  They are growing <Col N="1210" /> up without education and will be a danger if something is not done for them.</P>
    <P>Another class of children to which I would direct the attention of the Dáil are those that live on barges.  That is one of the reasons that I welcome the employment of the Gárda Síochána in looking after school attendance, as they will be able to deal with these cases much more effectively than any school-attendance officer could.  The regulations giving power to parents to keep the children at home at certain periods of the year is a good one.  Whether the seasons mentioned are the right ones or not I am not sure.  I think it is a good thing to give parents at certain times in the spring and autumn the right to keep the children away for a certain time, provided they attend regularly during the remainder of the year.</P>
    <P>So far as I am concerned, I think the Bill is a great advance on anything we have had hitherto, and I think the result of it will be good for the uplifting of the educational standard of the children if it is properly enforced, and I am sure that that will be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>The falling off in the attendance of school-children in the city of Dublin is rather deplorable.  I made it my business to enquire as to some of the causes, and, perhaps, it is well that the Minister should know that the points put forward by Deputy Morrissey also largely apply, and perhaps even apply more particularly, to the city of Dublin than to the country districts.  There are people who have no boots or stockings for their children. In some cases the unfortunate children in the slums have barely a covering for their bodies, and their parents are not anxious to send them to school under these conditions.  I have known cases in the city, not a stone's throw from Nelson's Pillar, in which children went to school without their breakfast.  I think the Minister should take some steps to deal with cases of that kind.  It is no use fining the parents sums which they cannot pay, and sums which would really be sufficient to buy boots for their children.  There are schools on the <Col N="1211" /> north side of the city where numbers of these cases can be found, and if the Minister will make enquiries from the teachers there he will find that the attendance in these schools in the slum areas has fallen off simply because of poverty and the want of clothes. Within the last few days I was brought into close contact with a case in which the mother of a family appealed for cast-off boots for her children, and her reason for appealing was that she was afraid, if the children remained at home much longer, she would be brought to court and fined.  I do not say that the Minister or the school attendance authorities should slacken in any way their efforts to improve the attendance at school, but I think, where definite proof can be given of abject poverty, and where the parents are anxious to send their children to school, there ought to be some means of providing such children with boots and stockings and, if necessary, with clothing, to enable them to attend school.  When they do get to school there should be somebody there to see that they will not go home hungry. Were steps taken in that direction, I believe that the attendance at school would be much better all round.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just three points which I would like to make on the Bill.  The first is that the efforts of the school attendance authorities would be much facilitated and made much more pleasant if they were assisted in their work by the fact that leaving certificates were given at the end of the primary school period of education.  If such certificates were given it would not be very long before they would be looked for by employers when taking on employees, and it would help rather to soften the work of the school attendance authorities by getting after the parents and showing them that by sending their children to school they were really helping them to get employment later on.  The second point I wish to make is that the Bill as it stands would bring the compulsory education period up to 14 years of age.  That is, the child would be relieved of the necessity of going to school under this Act if he were fourteen <Col N="1212" /> years and one month.  That, inevitably, brings in a very definite gap between the end of the compulsory period of education and the beginning of the employment age period.  Very earnest consideration should, I suggest, be given to what is likely to be the result of that.  In my opinion it is likely, in a big majority of cases, to have the result of the products of the primary schools lapsing into habits of idleness and losing the edge of their educational fitness, thus making them less fit for employment when the time comes.  My third point is with regard to the fines collected under the Act. I do not know whether it has yet been decided how those fines are to be utilised, but I suggest that consideration ought to be given to the question whether the money ought to be put into a local school equipment fund so that the fines collected in a particular locality would be used in helping to give the schools proper equipment.  As soon as the Act begins to work you are going to see breakages in the educational vessel all over the country, as many of the schools are badly equipped and have inadequate teaching staffs.</P>

      <P>It seems to me a pity that any compulsory Bill should be necessary in regard to this matter, but the Minister has made out a case that only 72 per cent. of the children attend school, and, analysing the case a little further, he said, that 40 per cent. were absent.  When that statement is taken into consideration, along with the statement that 10 per cent. of the people in cities are illiterate, it seems to be necessary to have a compulsory Act of this kind.  Therefore, I give it my heartiest support.  Deputy Mulcahy suggested that a child would leave school at the age of 14 years and one month, but it seems to me that the child will leave at the age of 13 years and 10½ months.  That a child has to be under fourteen is one of the provisions of the Bill.  If his age were nearer the 31st December it would mean that he would not be compelled to go to school any longer after the middle of November. There is a provision here that should there be no national school accessible to the child which he could attend, that is a reasonable excuse for <Col N="1213" /> failure to apply the Act.  I think some provision should be made in cases of that kind by which children could be conveyed to school.  With regard to distance, two miles is the limit for a child between the age of six and ten years, and three miles for a child between the age of 10 and 14.  While it is good, in my opinion, for a healthy child between six and ten years to walk two miles to school in the morning and two miles back in the evening, I think in the case of a delicate child there would be great difficulty, particularly in the winter months, in getting any sort of decent attendance.  Deputy Morrissey raised a point about which I have for a long time felt very strongly, namely, that there should be some provision made for giving a meal to children during the day.  Children must have their breakfast about eight o'clock, though unfortunately, according to Deputy Byrne and Deputy Morrissey, many of them are unable to get any breakfast.  They have to leave home at nine o'clock if they have to walk two miles and get to school at 10 o'clock.  If they leave school at 3 o'clock they will not be home until four, and by that time they would be unable to take any food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have long held that it is an absolute necessity that some form of meal, either hot milk, broth or soup, with bread, should be given to the children during the middle of the day.  I am sorry that there is no provision with regard to this, and I am also sorry there is no provision by which children can be conveyed to school where the distance is far.  There is a provision that there must be &ldquo;a suitable means of conveyance to the school available for the child from a point within a reasonable distance from the child's residence.&rdquo; That is extremely vague.  It might mean that there may be a motor car or mail car running between certain points and the child may be picked up on the way by such a conveyance. There should be some specific arrangement by which children can be conveyed to school.  Although I am extremely sorry for the children who are not able to get boots and clothes, I do not think we can suggest at present that these should be supplied by the <Col N="1214" /> schools.  I agree with Deputy Mulcahy that there is very little use in making compulsory attendance necessary unless the schools themselves are properly equipped and properly heated, and unless they have proper teachers and teaching.  The proposal to give a ten days' allowance during the putting in, and another ten days during the taking out of the crops, seems to me a very reasonable solution, but, on the other hand, as was pointed out to me by one of the Deputies, owing to the length of the holidays, and considering that there is no school on Saturdays, there is no great necessity for including this provision in the Bill.  The case might reasonably be met by giving the managers, as I believe they have, the power to fix holidays for children in rural areas in the particular time when they are most needed for the putting in or the taking out of the crops.  On the whole I am pleased that the Government at last have brought in this measure, but one sees so many things that are necessary in addition to compulsion that one can hardly say the Bill meets all the requirements of the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister stated, the House and the country have been for a long time expecting this Bill.  It is over three years since the Dáil by a resolution urged that such a measure should be brought in at the first available opportunity, and I suppose we must take it from the Government that this is the first available opportunity.  As he has stated, I do not think there will be any difference of opinion as to the general principles involved in this measure. From all sides of the House a call has gone forth repeatedly for the introduction of a Bill of this kind.  At the same time I think it advisable that some remarks should be made on the main features of the Bill by the various parties, because this will help us in framing suitable amendments later on. Some of the Deputies spoke as if it were a pity that such a measure had to be introduced, and as if it indicated some national neglect on the part of parents that such a measure of compulsion should be necessary, but the fact is that compulsory school attendance is <Col N="1215" /> the law of the land in practically every civilised country.  At all events I know of none in which there is not compulsory school attendance.  It is only a question of the measure of its effectiveness. With regard to the position in Ireland, we had it briefly stated by the Minister in his introductory speech. We have had, or are supposed to have had, a compulsory school attendance law since 1892, but that Act was not mandatory, and in many cases it was not enforced, and often when it was put into operation it failed in its object.</P>
      <P>The whole result of such legislation as we have had up to the present was summed up in the figures the Minister gave with regard to the present attendance at the schools.  He told us that, taking everything into account, it is quite safe to say that 40 children out of every 100 of school-going age were at home from school every day.  That is the position.  That is what we understand by a 60 per cent. attendance at schools.  Nothing further should be necessary to condemn the legislation we have had up to the present, and to show the necessity for a measure of this kind.  The Minister might have gone further, and said that if such places as Dublin and Cork, and generally the towns mentioned in the schedule were taken out, the figures would be very much worse for other parts of the country; for in Dublin and Cork for the last two or three years a comparatively high percentage has been obtained, which shows that in the rural areas the percentage is very much lower than would be indicated by the general figure mentioned by the Minister.  With regard to the Bill, there are one or two other matters to which grave objection must be taken. In the first place, the upper age limit is fixed at 14.  I think that is entirely too low, and I hope before the Bill leaves the Dáil the age will be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I throw out the suggestion to the Ministry that this measure should not in any way be regarded as a party measure, and that he would on all amendments or motions, leave it, and make it plain that it is so, to a free vote of the Dáil as to what changes should be made in the Bill in Committee. When compulsion was first <Col N="1216" /> introduced 33 years ago the age limit was fixed at 14, and now in 1925 we are introducing a compulsory school attendance measure, and are leaving the age at what it was fixed in 1892. I do not know whether the Ministry, or the Minister, made any inquiries as to the position in other countries with regard to the age limit.  In these matters we have been too much inclined in the past to look at what was done in England, and taking example by that.  It is well known that in educational matters England is one of the least progressive countries in the world. In England in their Act of 1918, while they have not actually made a higher age limit than 14 mandatory, they have given permission to local authorities, who have a lot to say in educational matters there, to make the age compulsory up to 15 in some cases, and in certain circumstances even up to 18. Powers are given to the Board of Education in England in the Act of 1918 to have education compulsory in certain circumstances up to the age of 18.  But in other countries we have the same.  In Canada for instance, in two of the provinces, Alberta and Manitoba, the minimum leaving age is fixed at 15.  In New Brunswick and Nova Scotia it is 16; in Ontario it is 18; in 34 States of the United States of America it is 16, in 4 of these States it is 17 and in 2 it is 18.  In South Africa the age is 16, in 6 Cantons of Switzerland the age is 15, and in 3 it is 16; in Greece the age is 16, in Norway it is 15, in Serbia it is 15, and in Germany it is 18.  There are continuation schools in Germany in which the attendance is compulsory from 14 to 18.  In France the school leaving age is 16, and in the Saorstát it is 14.  Must we always linger behind?</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister and the Ministry should give this question their earnest attention, and if their view is that it is not feasible at the moment, to raise the age limit beyond 14, they should certainly take powers in the Bill, as has been done in the British Acts, to raise the age by a simple order later on.  In other words, it would be only a question of administration until the age could be increased beyond what it is at the present time.  There is, as <Col N="1217" /> Deputy Mulcahy has said, that gap between 14 and 16.  Sixteen is the general age at which children enter employment. That is the time when children require most attention.  That is the time, I believe, at which the greatest educational effort should be made, and the greatest educational advantage could be reaped proportionately by the child.  He has reached the age of 14, an age at which he is able to appreciate better than in his earlier years the advantages of education, and it is well known that it is during these years that the children who can attend, benefit much more than they did at any time up to the age of 14.  I do hope, therefore, that the Dáil will agree to increase the age which is set forth in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Now, there is another point to which I wish to refer.  It is on the matter of these special exemptions which are set forth in Section 4.  I think there is no necessity whatsoever for these exemptions. In sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 4, these exemptions are set forth.  Now, the position at the moment is this: that there are altogether some 250 possible school days, leaving out Saturdays and Sundays.  Of these 250 days, 40 days, or eight school weeks, are to be taken as vacation. There are Church holidays, bank holidays, in some cases fair days and special days, election days and other days of that kind that make up for at least 20 school days.  In any case the number of days required under the regulations during which the school should be opened in the normal way is 200 days.  Of late years, since the special Irish course came to be adopted, scarcely any school is open 200 days. Now, my contention is, if you take that into account and take also the provision in the first portion, sub-section (1) of Section 4, which provides that a child may be absent if there is reasonable excuse, you will find that you are cutting down the child's school life very considerably by inserting these exemptions and giving these twenty extra days.</P>
    <P>It is quite easy, as Deputy Sir James Craig mentioned, for schools to arrange their vacation to fit in with the spring work and the harvest work. The Easter vacation is generally given <Col N="1218" /> and generally coincides with the time of putting in the crops.  There is generally a ten or twelve school-day vacation given at Easter.  The summer vacation is generally given at the time when the work is busiest on the farm. I believe that in this matter of setting out these exemptions in the Bill we are cutting across the Convention which the Dáil has ratified, the Convention concerning the age for admission of children to employment in agriculture. The first article of that Convention which has been ratified by the Oireachtas states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Children under the age of fourteen years may not be employed on work in any public or private agricultural undertaking or in any branch thereof, save outside the hours fixed for school attendance. If they are employed outside the hours of school attendance, the employment shall not be such as to prejudice their attendance at school.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That article definitely states that they shall not be employed on work on any private or public agricultural undertaking save outside the hours fixed for school attendance.  The second article, on which, no doubt, the Minister will rely if he stands over this exemption, states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purpose of practical vocational instruction the periods of the hours of school attendance may be so arranged as to permit of the employment of school-children at light agricultural work, and in particular light agricultural work connected with the harvest; provided such employment shall not reduce the period of school attendance to less than eight months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Whatever eight months may mean there&mdash;whether eight months means eight school months or eight calendar months or eight months made up of school weeks.  Apart from that it is clearly indicated, however, that the work on which they may be engaged will be work for the purpose of practical vocational instruction.  That clearly indicates not merely working indiscriminately everywhere and anywhere, but working under the supervision of some instructors, some technical instructors, possibly agricultural <Col N="1219" /> instructors, some school organisation in any case which is for the purpose of practical vocational instruction.</P>
    <P>I maintain that the insertion of this sub-section giving these special exemptions is contrary to the spirit, and even to the letter, of the Convention, which has been agreed to by the Dáil in regard to the employment of children.  In the British Act of Parliament there are no exemptions. There is a clear cut in that Act, taking away whatever exemptions were given in the previous Acts, and there is no employment of children allowed under the age of 14 years, under any condition or circumstance.  In some countries exemptions are given for work of this nature much on the lines of this Bill.  But they are very few, and in no circumstance whatsoever in any country so far as I can discover, is there an exemption at such a low age as 10 years.  Twelve is the very lowest age at which exemptions are given, and the majority of countries give no such exemptions.  There are none in England.  There is no exemption in Denmark, a country to which we often look for an example; none in Sweden or Norway, and none in 22 Cantons of Switzerland.  No exemptions are allowed in Australia or in South Africa.  In the United States there are no exemptions allowed in a considerable number of States, and in those States in which exemption is given the age is 12, and a certificate must be given that the child has reached a certain stage of efficiency before any exemption is given.  I do hope therefore that the Minister will see his way to delete, or agree to the deletion of this special sub-section giving these exemptions, because I maintain that the conditions here, where our school week consists of five days, are different to those in other countries.  That is not the case in the countries in which exemptions are given, and where there are closings for holidays, for vacations and so forth.  These are quite sufficient to meet the case.  These already leave the child's school year sufficiently short without putting in these special exemptions here.  I know that, of course, it may be argued, and quite possibly will be argued, that a child of ten can be <Col N="1220" /> very useful at busy times on the farm. That will be argued, and it would be just on a line, but to a lesser degree, with the arguments that were put up in the early days of the last century in Lancashire where the children worked in the mills at a very young age and where their parents were extremely anxious that they should continue at work.</P>
    <P>But public opinion agreed that it was wrong that children of that age should be so engaged, and that it was better that they should be at school at that age, and that a sacrifice would have to be made by the parents in the interests of the children and in the interests of the community as a whole. I do not know that there is anything else that I want to refer to except some small points which would be matters to be dealt with in the Committee Stage.  I do hope that in these two points in any case, the Bill will be altered before it leaves the Dáil.  I would like to say one word on what is possibly one of the chief features of the Bill and which may be regarded as one of its principles.  That is the idea of introducing the Gárda Síochána as the enforcing authority in the rural areas.  There is nothing in the Bill of which I am so convinced as of the necessity that this innovation should be made that the Gárda Síochána should be employed to enforce school attendance.  The history of the school attendance committees, the rural committees especially, is set forth in the results which they have achieved, and we know what they are.  But the position was just that where Committees were set up they generally had no finance.  They were not able to employ a whole-time officer.  If they did employ a whole-time officer, his salary would come altogether too heavy on the rates, especially on the rural areas. So we find that whole-time officers were not employed in the vast majority of cases.  Then the type of man that was employed was generally an insurance agent or a local pensioner, or a rate collector perhaps, or somebody of that kind.  We can quite well understand the difficulty such a person would have in bringing prosecutions against people on whom he would be calling the next <Col N="1221" /> day for an insurance policy or something of that kind.  There is one case on record where the local publican was appointed as school attendance officer. I do not think that it could be argued that a man of that type would be particularly anxious to bring prosecutions against his customers.</P>

      <P>Yes, his best customers, as Deputy Johnson reminds me, because they would be the most likely to have their children at home from school.  I agree further, and I have made it my business to have inquiries made in all parts of the country and to get the views of the people in all parts of the country, and I am satisfied that if the Bill is to be made a success, the introduction of the Gárda Síochána as the enforcing authority is one of the features that is most likely to make it a success.  I thoroughly agree with that principle of entrusting the enforcing of the Act to the Gárda Síochána.  There may, of course, be some criticism as to the actual machinery used.  There may be different views as to the actual manner in which the Gárda Síochana may be brought into it.</P>
      <P>On the general principle of using the Gárda Síochana as the enforcing authority, I am in perfect agreement.  I think it is the only means by which successful school attendance can be secured throughout the area of the Saorstát.  There was one point mentioned by Deputy Mulcahy which struck me as peculiar.  That was with regard to the fines.  He suggested that the fines should be given to the schools for equipment.  If that suggestion were adopted, we would have the position that in a school where you had good attendance you would have poor equipment, and where you would have a poor attendance you would have suitable equipment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my welcome to this long-expected measure, which some of us were anxious to see introduced at a much earlier stage. But we are thankful in this country for small mercies, even though they be delayed.  The one outstanding regret that one has in connection with this measure is that it is introduced as a separate unit, instead of being part of a considered scheme of education. I am afraid we are too prone in this country to consider education departmentally, instead of regarding it as a considered whole.  While this measure may improve the existing situation, like some other Deputies, I am satisfied that it does not go at all far enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question that stress is laid on in some of the clauses&mdash; reasonable excuses for non-attendance &mdash;I suppose there is no country where you will get so many well-considered excuses in almost every department of life as you will in this small island of ours.  Some of our people might be looked upon as professionals in that respect.  Instead of assisting in the way of excuses, one would prefer to see in this measure a tightening up so that excuses, except they were genuine, would not be considered.  We find amongst the reasonable excuses in paragraph (a) of sub-section 2 of Section 4 the excuse of &ldquo;sickness.&rdquo; I am afraid that if that is to be treated in the ordinary way, this compulsory system is not going to be very effective. Among parents who want to keep their children from school, I think this will be found a popular form of excuse.  The Minister will naturally say that in a case of serious sickness it would be unfair to call upon the parents to send the child to school. The difficulty will be to devise a system whereby this excuse will not prevent a number of children from getting the education which they should get.  We must endeavour by some means, when this Bill reaches Committee stage, to tighten up this clause.  One means whereby this difficulty might be surmounted suggests itself.  Where the average attendance of the child reaches seventy-five per cent. there is evidence, both on the part of the parents and on the part of the child, of a desire to take advantage of the <Col N="1223" /> education provided.  In a case of that kind, one would not be disposed to act as firmly as one would where the attendance was not up to that standard. It is the practice to-day in some schools that where the attendance is below seventy-five per cent. some form of certificate from a medical authority is necessary.  I only suggest that, in passing, as a means whereby the evasion of this compulsory system might be prevented.</P>
    <P>With regard to these allowances of time off in agricultural districts, in common with Deputy O'Connell I would like to see these allowances done away with.  There may be hard cases in which it would be desirable to allow pupils off, but it is a well-known fact that hard cases make bad law.  One would be inclined to devise some other means of dealing with this difficulty rather than make special provision in the Bill for children not attending school during two important periods of the year.  The result of the inclusion of clauses of this character may be that the schools will be closed up during those periods, because compulsion will not exist and the desire to attend school will not be there.</P>
    <P>The most serious flaw in this Bill is, to my mind, the age limit.  If we could get what we all desire, and what we seldom get in this House, a free vote, representing the individual views of the different Deputies, I am sure we would get a very high percentage of Deputies in favour of a much higher leaving age than fourteen.  There are difficulties in connection with the matter, but those difficulties, I am satisfied, can be got over without very great sacrifice.  What happens at the moment is, that boys and girls leave school at fourteen, without having attained any particular standard.  A number of them attain fifth standard, and some of them attain sixth standard, while others go even higher, but these are exceptions. I am sure that if you were to take the average standard of education attained in the Free State by the boy or girl leaving a primary school, you would find it exceedingly low.</P>
    <P>The years between fourteen and sixteen <Col N="1224" /> are, to my mind, the most important years in connection with school work, and I would urge that the age of fourteen should be increased to sixteen. If that would debar some boys or girls from entering particular trades or particular classes of employment, then we can make provision to meet that.  What is happening to-day?  In our city alone of the boys and girls who leave our primary schools each year, six thousand register at the juvenile department of our Labour Exchanges.  We are only able to find employment for less than one thousand out of the six thousand who register. What becomes of the other five thousand? That is an appalling problem. To my mind it is one of the greatest blots on our educational system to-day. We take charge of the education of a boy or girl up to the age of fourteen. When they reach that age we leave them to their own resources and tell them to do the best they can.  That is, to my mind, a wastage of the best assets of our country.  What is done in other countries?  Deputy Johnson has told us of what is done in America. Perhaps I may come nearer home and say what is done in Germany.  As soon as a pupil reaches a certain standard in the primary school in Germany, he goes on to a continuation school or technical school and into a certain trade, because apprenticeship in Germany is under the control of the Government and the Government keeps in touch with the training of the boy or girl until he or she reaches 18, 19, 20 or 21 and is a useful citizen, capable of earning a livelihood.</P>
    <P>Contrast that with our system! We turn out the boys and girls at 14 and take no further interest in them.  They are not allowed to enter a technical school until they have reached the age of 14, except they have been so proficient in the primary school that they reached sixth standard before attaining the age of fourteen.  Of course, there is no compulsion in regard to our technical schools as there should be, if this were part of a considered scheme, as it ought to be.  What is the result of our present system?  We give no assistance to these boys and girls to get into particular <Col N="1225" /> trades, so that they may become useful citizens.  You can imagine the position of boys or girls in our city to-day who have reached fourth or fifth standard. That means that they are able to read and nothing more.  Some of them may be able to write, but it will be found that they have no great proficiency in that respect.  They go around looking for employment.  They find that the different places they visit are not anxious to avail of their assistance. After they have been going around like that for some months, they get disheartened and in many cases they become exceedingly undesirable citizens. In many instances they are a trouble to their parents, and they cause trouble in other ways as well, because they are running wild and under no obligation to do anything.  When they reach the age of sixteen, they come within the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Act.  If they have not got employment they are bound to do a certain amount of work at a technical school.  What do we find when they go to the technical school?  We find that in the case of girls there is illiteracy to the extent of almost ten per cent. in our city.  That is to say, that ten per cent. of the girls who attain the age of sixteen and who apply for unemployment grant cannot be assisted by the technical schools when they go there to fulfil the educational qualification attached to the grant, because they are illiterate. Those are all problems arising out of this question of the school-leaving age. That question is one of the most important that can be considered by the Dáil. One of the results of the present system, as I have pointed out on previous occasions, is that in my own trade we have a great shortage of skilled labour and an immense amount of unskilled labour, for which there is no employment whatever.  A great many of those who are at present leaving our schools are driven into that mass of unskilled labour and they will never be able to do anything useful for themselves or for anybody else.  They will either live on the Poor Law or on the dole or something of that character all their lives.  This measure does not deal with the question systematically and, while one welcomes it, one must confess that it does not deal with the problem as it <Col N="1226" /> ought to be dealt with.  It does not deal with the problem as the problem has been dealt with in other progressive countries.  I handed to the Minister within the last few days a proposal which has been taken up in Scotland.</P>
    <P>Recognising there the difficulty that arises from their educational system&mdash; which I agree with Deputy O'Connell is not at all up to date&mdash;they have appointed a Commission of representative men connected with industry, and it is representative also of the various trade unions to enquire into this problem of education in its relation to industry. A similar Commission was set up in England some months ago on identical terms with the same object. This Commission is to deal with the very problem which I have been stressing in this House for some months, and which, to my mind, is more urgent in this country than in either England or Scotland, because of the difficulty of getting into these trades.  It is not alone that trade unions have got to share a portion of the blame, but I am sorry to say that employers also are lax with regard to apprenticeship.  I would like to see apprenticeship put on a different basis to that upon which it is to-day.  It is only a fortunate person who can get apprenticed to-day, instead of having things so arranged that any boy or girl who has a particular bent for a certain trade could get into that trade and make the best use of the qualities which nature gave to that particular boy or girl.  I have said enough to show the seriousness of this problem, but, as I said when I started, I am sorry we are not considering a proposal of this kind as part of a considered scheme of education, instead of taking it up as a separate unit.  In these days we hear a great deal of what Germany and America can teach us, and I am quite sure that they could teach us a great deal in the matter of education.  I would gladly support any proposal whereby the leading men in connection with primary, secondary, technical, and university education, both in Germany and America, could come over and be paid to report on a system of education suited to this country.  I would gladly, and I am sure the country also would, support <Col N="1227" /> any expenditure of that kind.  Having got reports from the experts in these two countries, we could then get a committee here to settle the whole system. That would be the proper way to approach this problem instead of doing it in this wretched piece-meal fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="Professor MacNEILL Professor MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>The criticisms of Deputy Good are welcome.  It would be highly desirable to have a complete ideal scheme, and by ideal I think he means a proper scheme, fitted to the needs of the country, which should be placed before us in its entirety.  That would, I think, lead to some interesting results.  The actual proposal before us is to deal with school attendance, and we have been reminded very properly that there has been a long demand to deal with that particular aspect of our educational problem, and the proper demand in that direction did not suggest that we should make provision for school attendance a portion of any large and comprehensive scheme covering the whole ground of education. Deputies would, I think, if they made enquiry, find that the Department of Education is not badly informed with regard to the conditions of education in other countries.  On the contrary, it is particularly well informed, and has always taken the trouble to be particularly well informed, in regard to these conditions, but I think we shall have to solve our own educational problems.  I think they are of such a kind that while we might obtain valuable suggestions and valuable light by bringing experts from Germany, America, or elsewhere, they would find themselves in touch here with an educational problem of which they had no previous experience whatever, and as regards which they possibly would not be our best advisers.  If we were to bring educational experts from other countries with experience of well-developed systems of education in those countries, I am quite sure that the first main conclusion they would come to, and it is one that has not been touched on in any remarks made on this particular measure up to the present, would be that in order to reach anything <Col N="1228" /> like the right degree of efficiency in our education we should have to double, if not treble, our present expenditure on education.</P>
      <P>I will point out that this Bill as it stands with its limitations is automatically going to cause a considerable increase in expenditure.  The various suggestions with regard to what should be done will, I am sure, be welcome. In the case of the Education Department, practically all these suggestions that have been made along the lines of improvement are simply driving a willing horse.  There is a suggestion that a system of continuation schools after the leaving age, whether it be 14, 15 or 16, should be provided. The Education Department will say, &ldquo;Certainly let it be done,&rdquo; and will say the same with regard to other suggestions, including that to the effect that where technical education is applicable it should be made compulsory on all those who are brought within the range of it.  It has been quite rightly pointed out, and personally I am not sorry for it, that the application of this measure as it stands, within its limits, is going to bring more acutely before the people of this country other aspects of our educational problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of these have been dealt with here, such as the proper provision of food for school children, the proper provision of clothing and food, and provision for heating and equipping schools, as well as the provision of conveyance to bring the children to and from school, and even the proper provision of schools themselves.  In the city of Dublin, when this Bill comes into force, the city is going to be faced with the problem of school accommodation, a very difficult problem, and every single one of these questions has its financial aspect.  Every one of these improvements means providing more money out of either local or general taxation.  I hold, and most Deputies will hold, and it is a very comfortable doctrine to hold and express, that we could have no better investment for our money.  Every reasonable parent knows that, but we are in a particular stage at present with regard to national finance, and a particular stage with regard to <Col N="1229" /> national credit, and we cannot possibly leave that aspect of the thing out of account.  Raise the age limit, and that means raising still more the number of those attending the schools, and creating a still more acute problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the question of raising the school age meant raising the age of attendance at the present schools.  However, every extension of that kind must eventually be faced from the point of view of financial provision.  I believe that we are not spending enough money on education.  I believe that public opinion in this country is not, I will not say sufficiently enlightened, but I think the ordinary man would agree to it at once that it would be a wise thing, but while agreeing that it would be a wise thing it is doubtful whether he is prepared to agree in substance, that is, whether he is prepared to take his part in footing the bill and imposing the necessary taxation on himself and his fellow-citizens.  I think it is very satisfactory to hear the views expressed that this Bill is of general and equal interest to every section of Deputies in the Dáil&mdash;I suppose I might say to every individual Deputy. It has no party complexion whatever; it has no sectional complexion whatever, and I am quite certain amendments that may be proposed will be considered absolutely on their merits. I have been accused sometimes of the crime of being an idealist, and as an idealist I take the liberty of reminding Deputies again that along with the practical application of this Bill they will have to consider&mdash;they will ultimately perhaps more seriously have to consider&mdash;the financial aspects involved and face up to them.  It would be pleasanter, I am sure, for the Department of Education to present you with a Bill so that criticisms would deal with the opposite direction; that is to say, members of the Dáil would be restraining the Department of Education in its natural desire to go as far <Col N="1230" /> as it could in these matters.  It has sought to present a measure dealing with the circumstances as it finds them, and as it is likely to be practicable and deal with them in the time in which we are now.</P>

      <P>It has been stated that all parties in the House are in agreement on this question, and as no expression of opinion has been given from these benches, I want to confirm what has been said by saying that we are in agreement with regard to this measure. Most people are opposed to coercion in any form, and we on these benches are opposed to it, but we are faced with the necessity for coercion in this case.  Anybody who knows the country knows that children are deliberately kept at home through the direct agency of their parents, and they must recognise the fact that compulsion is absolutely necessary to deal with a certain section of the community.  Because of that we whole-heartedly accept the measure.  A good deal of play has been made with regard to the age limit. We consider that the 14 years age limit is reasonable, and a high enough limit for primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that the age limit should be raised.  If it is raised let it be raised in order to give the children technical education, something to fit them for the battle of life.  We were told that our technical schools all over the country are fully staffed and badly attended.  The staffs are there, costing the same amount of money with a very small attendance as if there was a full attendance.  We are not prepared to support any extension of the age limit for primary education. These matters can be argued out and dealt with on the Committee stage. We want a nation of workers, and we do not want a nation of pen wielders and politicians.  Reference has been made to the periods for putting in and gathering crops.  Anybody who knows agriculture knows that in the period for putting in crops there is scarcely any use at all for children of school-going age at that particular time.  In the late spring or early summer the children would be of much more use for the weeding and thinning, and later for gathering in the crops.  The <Col N="1231" /> vacation period would cover the time I am referring to&mdash;the gathering in and thinning&mdash;especially when we are all growing beet.  We are in thorough agreement with the measure.  We welcome it and we welcome its general principles.  Some reference has been made to a free vote of the House, and Deputies turned towards those benches when there was mention made of a free vote.  As far as we are concerned, there has always been a free vote.</P>

      <P>No, a free vote has always been the case.  There is no Party in the House that has put on the Whips, kept them on and got as good a response for so doing, as the Government Party.  I am glad to say that their discipline is a model to the House in that respect.  I repeat that if a higher age limit than 14 years is needed, there is little trouble in placing the matter before the House.  A Bill of one clause will raise the age limit, if raising it is considered necessary. There is no necessity for Deputy O'Connell to put forward the plea that the age limit of 16 years should be embodied in the Bill.  If the necessity arises, and if it is proved to the satisfaction of Deputies that the age limit ought to be raised, a one-clause Bill will remedy the evil, if there is an evil. I think there is agreement amongst all parties in regard to this measure.</P>

      <P>I think the point Deputy Gorey intended to make was that if the Government could, by some method of peaceful persuasion, get the children to school with the same facility and ease as the Government Party get Deputies into the lobby to vote, there would be no necessity for this Bill.  I am in agreement with Deputy Gorey, and with a great many other Deputies, that the purpose of the Bill is a laudable purpose.  There is no controversy about the purpose of the measure, but there is about the machinery.  It is the machinery of the measure that is questioned and, perhaps, one will be allowed to make some points with reference to the machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> Deputy O'Connell told us the school year was too short.  The inference in his remarks was that there were not enough days devoted to school purposes in the year.  He deprecated, and I am inclined to deprecate the two sub-sections in Section 4 of the Bill.  I wonder why Deputy O'Connell did not also advocate the abolition of the whole holiday of Saturday.  When children are sent to more expensive schools, where parents have to pay for the education, they do not get a full holiday on Saturday.  They get a half-holiday on Saturday and sometimes a half-holiday during the week.  I would sooner see that in vogue here.  It is, I believe, a better system.  As it is, you have children two whole days away from school.  A good deal of what they learn goes out of their heads during Saturday and Sunday and the greater part of Monday is spent in putting it in again.</P>
    <P>With regard to raising the school-leaving age, I may say I am in favour of that, and I was very much impressed by Deputy Professor MacNeill's remark. I am glad the Minister for Industry and Commerce is in charge of the Bill.  It is really very largely an economic question.  When you have an overcrowded labour market, a serious problem of unemployment, as you have now, and when you have a considerable number drawing unemployment benefit, would it not, economically, be a good thing to take boys from 14 to 16 years of age off the labour market and give them additional education? Would it not be better to have the money spent on education than on the dole?  That presupposes two conditions: that there are schools for them and that there are teachers for them. There is not the slightest use sending those boys to sit at benches in an overcrowded school, when there is nobody to attend them.  That is pure humbug, camouflage, or whatever you like to call it.  If the schools and teachers are available, and if it is merely a question of providing necessary funds to enable the children to continue their education, I believe the money would be better spent on that than by paying unemployment benefit.  That is the predominant consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1233" /> There is another feature in this Bill that, I think, will be difficult to work. That is the differentiation between children who live two miles from a school and children who live three miles.  A child who lives more than two miles from the school need not attend school until he is ten years of age. I am taking a boy as an example; I am not proposing any sex differentiation on the lines of the Civil Service Bill. Taking a boy as an illustration, we will assume he goes to school when he is aged ten years and two months.  Having learned nothing, he finds himself sitting at a bench by the side of a boy 6 or 7 years of age, who already spent, perhaps, one year in the school.  Is that boy of 10 years and 2 months going to get the best out of education? I ask Deputy O'Connell, as a practical teacher, is it an easy situation for the teacher where you have the 10-year-old boy or girl, absolutely ignorant, sitting down by the side of children two years younger than themselves but who know more than they do?</P>
    <P>My knowledge of education is more or less that of an outsider; but it seemed to me to create a difficulty.  It seems to me the children who live more than two miles from the school will start at a disadvantage, and that disadvantage will continue throughout their school age.  The problem is admittedly a very difficult one.  Having regard to the teacher's point of view, it would be better to have a fixed distance and a fixed age for all children, even if it meant greater exemptions.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the section in reference to miles will discourage the amalgamation of schools.  If transport can be provided, it is desirable to amalgamate schools where you have a large number of small schools.  The matter of amalgamation appeals to me particularly, because in the greater part of the country districts&mdash;the portion of the country especially that I have knowledge of&mdash;they are all small schools; they are inevitably so.  You can get more efficient teaching if you get the children into one fairly large central school.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the wording of the compulsory provision, which sets out that a child must be within two miles <Col N="1234" /> of a school before he can be forced to attend under the age of ten years, and within three miles of the school before he can be forced to attend within the school age at all, will rather discourage amalgamation, because the amalgamated school will not be able to get its attendance.  The conditions imposed in the Bill are all right if suitable means of conveyance are available. Suitable means of conveyance are not available in the country districts unless somebody makes provision for the conveyance of youngsters, and there is no machinery under this Bill to provide suitable means of conveyance.</P>
    <P>The School Attendance Committees in the rural areas, who might possibly have provided conveyances in spite of scarcity of means&mdash;they might do it voluntarily or in some other way&mdash; have been dissolved, swept away.  I have an anxious feeling that some of the provisions of the Bill are rather retrograde; they will not promote education, but will rather tend to retard its development.  In regard to the question of education, there are two duties to be considered.  There is the duty of the parent to see that his child gets a fair chance in life.  That duty is provided for in this Bill, and provided for amply.  The penalties are sufficient and substantial.  The machinery for enforcement is, I think, effective.  But there is another duty besides the duty of the parent, and that is the duty of the State to see that the child whose parent is forced to send it to school receives its education under the best possible conditions, and sustains no injury, mentally or physically.</P>
    <P>The late Minister for Education almost admitted our case when he said this Bill would cause the leaks in the system to be found out.  There are schools in this country not hygienic; there are schools not adequately clean and not adequately heated.  We are taking upon ourselves a very serious responsibility when we compel parents to send their children to these schools. I think the Bill would be better if it recognised that liability on the part of the State, the duty on the part of the State, as well as the duty on the part of the parent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1235" /> I would like to support the plea made by Deputy Sir James Craig.  I know many men who approach this problem solely from the medical point of view and solely from the point of view of the specialist, and who view with anxiety the length of school hours in the country districts during which children get no food.  I am not dealing with the exceptional cases Deputy Byrne and Deputy Morrissey put forward of parents unable to give the children breakfast.  Even where a child has had a breakfast, quite a good breakfast, at home, that child leaves the home at 8 o'clock in the morning and very often does not get home until 4 o'clock in the afternoon without meal of any kind.  That cannot be good for a growing child.  It will, no doubt, cost money.  The more I look at this question the more I see the need for better school equipment, the provision of meals and so on, and the more I am forced to the conclusion that we will have to bring in other resources besides the resources of the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell said that England, in matters of education, was one of the least progressive countries in the world.  I can only say that in England I saw the schools that were provided for out of rates, and I saw the schools in the Irish districts provided for out of State funds.  I wish that we were even level with the schools that I saw in England.  I saw schools through Devonshire and elsewhere in the South of England; I saw in my own county in Ireland thatched schools with dripping eaves that were more like a barn than a school&mdash;buildings one would almost hesitate to put a cow into.  I do not think the problem can be solved by State help alone.  You must co-ordinate rate help with State help, and in doing so you must not lose sight of the necessity for some sort of a meal for the children during the day.  It would be a bad day's work if we were to develop the children's brains at the cost of their bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very reassuring to find a Bill of this type has met with such a response from all sections of the Dáil.  As I imagined, <Col N="1236" /> whatever discussion there has been, has centred mainly around the point of age, and it gravitated to the subsidiary and tender point of the exemptions, and such matters as reasonable excuses which may be allowed to prevail where absence is proved.  Deputy Hewat raised one point which no other Deputy adverted to, or, where it was adverted to, the point was made rather in an opposite way.  Deputy Hewat objected to&mdash;not so much objected as queried&mdash; the use of the Gárda Síochána as the enforcing authority.  He expressed a hope that regulations might be made governing the conduct of the Gárda in so far as they were now being placed in a position where they might interfere in some ways with the liberties of the people.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Hewat can hardly have properly understood what is set out in the provisions of the Bill. There is very little touch really between the Gárda Síochána and the parents in this matter.  The parents are required to do certain things.  The teachers in the schools are required to do certain things.  The enforcing authority may call for certain other matters, and the enforcing authority has a right, which no one, I think, will deny is an ordinary police duty, of bringing before a court of competent jurisdiction those who have not complied with the provisions of this Bill. But there is very little touch in the matter of interference as between the enforcing authority and the parents. If anybody gets the view from this Bill that there is going to be some sort of secret inquisition going on by the Gárda Síochána in opposition to the parents, then that nowhere lies in the Bill, and that idea simply springs from not properly understanding what it means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hewat also queries compulsion of any sort, although he rather admits that the figures in regard to the attendance at school somewhat proves the necessity for compulsion.  To other Deputies these figures undoubtedly establish a case for compulsion. Deputy Hewat was arguing why should there be any compulsion in this matter. The answer to that seems to lie in the defects of our human nature.  If one <Col N="1237" /> could rely on the social conscience of the child or on the social conscience of the parents to ensure that the child would be sent to school, then compulsion would be an unwarranted interference.  But the figures show that these cannot be relied on.  Any discussion on the Bill has centred round the question of the age exemptions and excuses.  Deputy Sir James Craig made, I think, a mistake, at least it seemed to me he was making a mistake, when he seemed to understand from this measure that it forbids the child to attend school over the age of fourteen. If that is as he puts the point it is of course wrong.  The Bill simply provides for compulsory attendance up to a particular age.  Beyond that age nothing is said.  There is certainly no forbidding of attendance beyond that period.</P>
    <P>The question of the raising of the school limit from 14 to 16 is one I feel we should fight out in Committee when definite amendments come before us and when we get the points segregated. Apart from other matters dealt with by Deputy Professor MacNeill, he indicated some objection likely to be put forward here when any move is made to have the age increased.  The financial objection is the main one, and when that is urged there is no use in Deputies shaking their heads and saying &ldquo;the Minister for Finance again.&rdquo; There is a period in the year when the Minister for Finance becomes a lovable person so far as this Dáil is concerned, that is the period round about Budget time.  During the rest of the period he is to be avoided.  He is a person who closes down on everything.  That only means that the Minister for Finance is doing his duty in so far as he is trying to save people from a certain amount of taxation.  If the country is ready through ordinary taxation or through local taxation to submit to further exactions, a great deal more can be done in the way of education, a great deal more which will probably meet, in the abstract, with the approval of every member of the community, but which will meet with considerable disfavour when these advantages have to be paid for.  Before those points do come up for discussion in Committee, <Col N="1238" /> I wonder if Deputy O'Connell would mind furnishing to the Department the figures he has with regard to the age limit in other countries, because I had a series of calculations made as to the age limits in other countries and they were in distinct contradiction to some of the ages as read by the Deputy.  I would like if he could give us those particulars later&mdash;I do not require them now&mdash;so that we may compare them with our figures and have correct data for the House on the next occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The information I got was obtained mainly from a publication issued by the International Labour Office, called &ldquo;A Technical Survey of Agricultural Questions.&rdquo;  I am sure that publication is available to the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <P>I have got now the information I really required. What I wanted really was the source of the Deputy's information, so that the figures could be looked up and compared with our figures.  I may say, however, that I do not entirely rely on anything that comes from other countries, because there is a special problem here, a problem which is possibly not peculiar to this country, but which is peculiar to this country with several other countries of an agricultural type.  Where you have a scattered little rural population, technical school education is not going to reach them and the question really to be considered is the question of post-primary rural education.  Deputy O'Connell, when speaking on this subject, seemed to me to be pleading merely for the raising of the age-limit to sixteen.  When Deputy MacNeill was speaking, on intervention, it seemed to me that Deputy O'Connell was rather aiming at the setting up of something to provide for education as between fourteen and sixteen, which might fall within the provisions of this Act, if enlarged to sixteen years&mdash;in other words, that Deputy O'Connell was aiming at enlarging the age of fourteen to sixteen in this measure and allowing a reasonable excuse to be that the child was receiving elementary or other education somewhere else, thus allowing for a system of post-primary <Col N="1239" /> or continuation education to be fitted in under a Bill of this sort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is again a matter we can deal with on Committee Stage&mdash;the question of the joining together of this Bill and of post-primary education or of something that would be within the primary education system if the age here be increased to sixteen. It has been suggested that this question should be left to a free vote. I do not think there would be any great objection to doing that.  I would only plead, in return for that, that there should be some arrangement of Parties whereby&mdash;if only to break the monotony of the affair&mdash;other Parties besides the Government Party would split when it is a question of free voting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It has also been pleaded that sub-sections 3 and 4 should be just an alternative under the Bill and should apply, not to children who have attained the age of ten years, but only to children who have attained the age of twelve years.  That, again, is a matter for Committee pleading and for Committee answer.  I cannot see any objection on principle to that.  But I can see a point that will go to the root of most of these amendments.  The question raised by Deputy Good with regard to the recognition of sickness as a reasonable excuse is a much more difficult one.  You have to admit definitely that sickness would ordinarily form a reasonable excuse for non-attendance at school.  The Deputy has indicated certain amendments which he may offer to limit that.  There are certain things set out which may be looked upon as reasonable excuses but the onus is on the parent, or person having custody of the child, to prove that there was a reasonable excuse.  It is laid down in Section 17, sub-section 4, that a certificate from a qualified medical <Col N="1240" /> practitioner will be accepted, prima facie, as evidence that there was such reasonable excuse.  That does not necessarily mean that in every case a certificate from a qualified medical practitioner will be required.  It should be taken rather as showing what may operate in the mind of the District Justice before whom cases of this sort would come&mdash;that the question of sickness is not to be taken in just the lightest way and that definite proof should be given of sickness of such a type as would be reasonable to excuse nonattendance.</P>
      <P>The questions as to food, clothing, distance from school and conveyance are rather outside the terms of this measure.  The provision of meals for children is at present under the charge of the Local Government Department. As far as present regulations go, provision of such meals is permitted only in urban districts; so that if anything is to be done in regard to that the amendment of certain existing legislation will have to be carried through.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy mentioned a point as to the leaving certificate.  He thought that it would facilitate the enforcing authority if there were a requirement with regard to a leaving certificate. What I am going to say on this point brings me rather to the point raised by Deputy Good, who complained that this measure was only one item and that, instead of that, we should have a whole comprehensive system and survey of education.  There is being considered at the moment the whole question of a leaving certificate in connection with primary education. No decision has been reached on it. Similarly in regard to one of the points brought forward by Deputy Good.  The whole matter of technical education is very definitely under consideration.  I wonder would Deputy O'Connell, or any other Deputy, raise a protest if I offered to withdraw this Compulsory School Attendance Bill until such time as we were able to bring in a programme with regard to technical instruction and the leaving certificate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think every Deputy who has considered the matter <Col N="1241" /> would.  That is the excuse, if excuse is necessary, for taking this as a single unit instead of having a whole comprehensive survey.  This is a very urgent matter.  It may seem impertinence for me to state that, but it is urgent.  Is it to be delayed so that other matters can be brought in along with it?  I have a certain amount of sympathy with Deputy Good in what he said.  I have had occasion to meet Deputy Good acting on a Juvenile Advisory Committee.  I know of his very keen interest in technical education, and I know of his great desire to help in any question of the sort.  He has more than once spoken to me on the question that he alluded to to-night&mdash; the question of finding employment for children who are thrown into the world and abandoned, so far as the State is concerned, at the age of fourteen. He mentioned as a possible suggestion at the end that a committee might be set up here as in England and Scotland to inquire into certain matters, and he rather urged that we should invoke foreign assistance in the matter of education.  That may come. All I can say to the Dáil in answer to that is that the time is not ripe for that yet.  The whole question of technical instruction, continuation and vocational instruction has been considered by the Department in two aspects, and only recently has the Departmental Committee dealing with the matter furnished a report.  That report had to be surveyed by three other Departments before the matter could be considered finished.  At the moment the report furnished to the Department of Education by certain of its officials is under consideration by my own Department, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Fisheries. When their views have been collected then, and only then, will it be possible to say whether any committee such as Deputy Good suggested is required for the further consideration of what these people have sent forward.  I do not believe there is much use at this moment in my going into arguments for or against raising the age from 14 to 16.  That is purely and entirely a matter for the Committee Stage, and unless there be some definite desire on the <Col N="1242" /> part of the Dáil to have these points discussed, I prefer to leave them until we deal with the Bill in Committee.</P>

      <P>That is a matter for further consideration.  You have Ballybofey to reckon with yet.  Any activity of the Commission that has come under my notice is in the issue of processes, and the mixing up of payments, made in some instances to the State Solicitor and in others to the Land Commission, between both of which the unfortunate tenants are the victims.  I want to bring the notice of the Land Commission to a matter in my area.  With the expenditure of a reasonable sum of money a large amount of land could be reclaimed there, which would provide, I am perfectly sure, farms from 10 to 25 acres for at least 500 to 700 families.  That is a business proposition that should be seriously considered by the Land Commission.  I think the situation is similar in other areas in Co. Donegal.  Congestion could be relieved and existing farms extended if the land that I refer to was reclaimed. If that work was seriously undertaken farms could be provided for a large number of people in the congested areas, and their present holdings could be consolidated or enlarged.</P>
      <P>In Donegal we claim that we should get a share of the lands in Co. Meath and that some of our people should be migrated to Meath.  I am sorry Deputy Lyons and Deputy Hall are not in the Dáil so that there might be an exchange of views on this subject.  I can assure the Minister that if he provides land in County Meath for Donegal men they will hold it against any invaders.</P>
      <P>I have been looking into the muddle about the payment of instalments and the issuing of six-day notices, as well as solicitors' letters and processes.  In my opinion the muddle was created by the high priests of Upper Merrion Street when they curtailed the period for payment of instalments to the various banks.  They insist now on instalments being paid within 14 days from 1st May and 1st November.  Prior to that the banks would take the instalments or the annuities for six weeks or two months after these dates.</P>

I suggest that an arrangement should be made whereby the period for payment of instalments to the banks should be extended.  A circular was sent from Merrion Street last year curtailing the period to 14 days.  I saw the circular with a bank manager in my own town. If it was not issued from Upper Merrion Street it was issued from the Bank of Ireland with the authority of the high priests of Upper Merrion Street.  It would be a sensible business proposition to extend the time.</P>

Of course, I may be wrong, as I often take erroneous views of things.  There is some untenanted land in my constituency that I should like to see divided and added to the neighbouring farms.  Sales of land that was in the direct occupation of landlords have also taken place, and the land has been sold to the other tenants that were in occupation.  I do not know whether the sales were sanctioned by the Land Commission, but these sales should not have taken place.  The speeding-up of the appointed day in my district is also a matter that the Minister should see to, because in Inishowen there is a very large number of unpurchased estates and we have not yet heard of the appointed day being fixed.  The matter should be taken in hand at once.</P>

      <P>I wish to support Deputy Roddy's motion.  At the same time I wish to call the attention of the Minister to certain estates in the West, especially in the County Mayo.  There is one estate in particular that I wish to refer to, the Clifford Estate, County Mayo.  There are 36 tenants on this estate whose valuations are under £5, and 4 graziers, who till no land, graze over 2,000 acres of the best land on the estate.  This estate has been in the hands of the Land Commission for 15 <Col N="1245" /> years and it has not yet been settled. I have received a resolution as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That we, the members of the Islandeady Branch Cumann na nGaedheal, call on the Irish Land Commission to come immediately and relieve us from our present position. We are over 100 in number, whose valuation stands from 10/- to £3, while there is in our midst 1,105 acres of good tillage land held by three men.  This land is practically useless from growing rushes and furze, while if we poor tenants had this land we would have it in a different form.</P>
      <P>We earnestly implore of the Irish Land Commission to put the Land Act of 1923 into force and leave us no longer in our present condition.</P>
      <P>So far our appeals have been ignored by the Irish Land Commission, and if something is not done immediately we must adopt some other means.</P>
      <P>That is a very serious situation in that part of the country.  There is one easy remedy that the Ministry should apply, and that is compulsory tillage for the relief of congestion.  One solution which I am of opinion should be seriously considered by the Minister is that all farmers whose valuations are over £100 should be made to till at least ten per cent. of their holdings.</P>

      <P>With regard to the distribution of untenanted land in the County Cork, and especially in my constituency, I am glad to say that the Land Commission are dealing as expeditiously and in as practical a manner as possible with the matter.  One very large estate&mdash;the Penrose-Welsted estate at Ballywalter, which contains some 700 or 800 acres&mdash;is practically divided.  As to the point raised from the Labour benches yesterday, I am pleased to say that in connection with that estate the question of the labourers <Col N="1246" /> who had been employed on it was satisfactorily handled by the Commissioners. Of course the Commissioners or the Minister cannot be held responsible for the treatment of the employees until such time as the estate is taken over by the Commissioners.  In this case, immediately the estate was taken over by the Land Commission, these men got grazing rights and tillage&mdash;as much as they were able to till.  In fact, they got the land at £1 per acre less from the Land Commission than they had offered for it.</P>

      <P>A very important point was raised yesterday, I think by Deputy Nolan, and the suggestion was re-echoed from the Farmers' benches by Deputy Gorey.  No more important point could arise in determining the future welfare of those who are being settled on the land which has been taken over.  If the men put on the land have to pay an exorbitant rent or annuity they will not be able to make a living out of it, and a situation will be created which will mean that we will never be finished with the problem of the land.  If men who are feverishly anxious to possess land are prepared to pay an exorbitant price for it, and if the Land Commission agree to give an exorbitant price to the landlords for this untenanted land, it will be a very unwise procedure, and it will create a very serious situation that will have to be faced in the near future by the Government and the Dáil.  The mode of collection adopted by the Land Commission at present is by no means satisfactory. Some means should be devised by which the tenants would get reasonable notice&mdash;say six days' notice. When a tenant knows that his annuity is due on a certain date, and that he is bound to pay, I think he should be in as good a position to pay when it becomes due as he would six weeks or two months afterwards.</P>

      <P>We have it on the very highest authority that in a multitude <Col N="1247" /> of counsellors there is wisdom. Accepting that, we must come to the conclusion that the Minister for Agriculture must be an extremely wise person by this.  I do not wish to intervene between the Minister and the Dáil, and I only rise for the purpose of accentuating what has been said by Deputy Noonan, that it is extremely unwise, in fact it is folly, to allow people to take up land at such an annuity that it will work out at a rack rent and that the last state of the people who take up this land will be worse than the first. It will lead to a new agitation in the country&mdash;probably a more dangerous one than we have experienced up to this.  I know of cases in which land has been distributed and annuities fixed at the rate of about 35/- per Irish acre. Add to that a local tax of about 10/- per acre and what position are these people in?  The position is that they have exhausted some of the best lands in County Kildare by over-cropping and not treating it in a proper manner. Of course, that was due to their poverty and the fact that they could not make a proper living out of the land.  If that policy is persisted in it will lead to confusion all round.  I know it is not in the power of the Commissioners always to fix the price at which land is taken over and that there is an appeal from their decision as regards the price.  I think that is not as it ought to be.  I think it is not a proper thing that a gentleman&mdash;a very learned gentleman, of course&mdash;sitting without an assessor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Certainly, these people may be put down as congests.  That estate has been before the Commissioners for a good many years.  In fact, I believe it was inspected by the Land Commission before this Government came into power.  Then there is another estate which I have often referred to, that is, the Verschoyle Estate, where the people have not got access to the lands and are also deprived of turbary.  That is a very great hardship.  I hope the result of this debate will be that these matters will be looked into and the division of these lands expedited.</P>

      <P>Before the debate ends I would like to say a few words, and I will make them as short as I can.  Deputy Roddy's motion aims at speeding up the work of the Land Commission as much as possible, and Deputy Nolan, who spoke afterwards, is rather in favour of advising the Land Commission to go more slowly.  With both those recommendations I am in agreement to a great extent.  I think the Land Commission, as regards the division of land, must go to the bottom of the matter, to the seat of the disease as it were, where it is worst, and cure that first as far as possible.  I do not mean to say by that that the estates that are already marked for division should not be divided, as was attempted to be done by the Land Commission. <Col N="1249" /> What I mean is that without any doubt the question of congestion is by far the worst on the western border.  Those who have not seen the state of things that exists there cannot understand the congestion and the awful conditions under which people live.  Of course, it is up to them to remedy the conditions there first where the question is most acute.  They have on their hands a considerable quantity of land, inherited from the Congested Districts Board, for distribution, and I think that land should be distributed as quickly as possible amongst the congests on that coast, but we know perfectly well that even after that is distributed there will not be nearly enough to satisfy the urgent needs of the people on that border.  Even after that division has taken place in order to get more land some other scheme must be devised, and I think the Minister has more or less suggested that migration should be taken in hand, and that it might be possible that large farms could be bought up by agreement with their owners, and the owners moved into another part of the country. Where it could be done without disturbing the rights of people who have great claims, I think it should be done, to a great extent, I do not say in every case but in a certain number of cases.  It has been said that the western people would not be received very courteously by their new neighbours. I do not know about that.  I am not sure that they would not in certain districts.  You would have to select districts.  During the war, in 1917, when there was a great deal of compulsory tillage being done through the country, and when labour was extremely hard to get in County Kildare, things were different from what they are to-day.  You could not get enough men for your work.  A great number of farmers from my district got a large number of western labourers.</P>

      <P>Yes, for a year.  I had five myself and I am bound to say they were the best workers I had.  I never came across men who gave less trouble. There was not the slightest bother or trouble with them in any way.  At the <Col N="1250" /> end of the year I was extremely sorry when they left, for better men, better workers or men who gave less trouble I never came across.  They were most satisfactory in every way, and that, I think, was the experience of everyone who had them.  It may be said that these men would not be suitable to work farms.  In many cases I suppose they might not, but as far as our experience of them went in our district, and we had, I think, about 40 of them, we found them very hard working and most excellent in every way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>They were Galway men.  I see no reason why some substantial farmers who live on the edge of a congested district and who might be willing to do so should not sell their lands to the Land Commission for division, and be provided with land in some other part of the country where land can be found without disturbing anyone's interest.  I think that such land could be found, and if such a thing as that could be done it would do something towards settling part at all events of this question of congestion in the West where the present stage of things is really awful.  As regards the go-quick part of the business and the most urgent part of it, Deputy Nolan wants to go slowly.  I am in agreement with him.  I think that, viewing the land question as it stands to-day, and on the figures given to us by the Minister for Agriculture, it is very necessary to go slowly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like a great many other people, I had an idea some years ago, when I had not any figures before me, that it would be possible for everyone to have an economic holding in the country. It is clear now, from the figures given to us by the Minister, that that can never be done.  At the very most you will have 100,000 or 120,000 families who can never be provided with a holding. It is obvious that something must be done for these people other than providing them with land.  If the times were more settled and there was more confidence in the country it might be possible to start industries to give them employment.  But capital is very shy, and people do not care to fling out <Col N="1251" /> their money if they are not able to get reasonable security for it.  If the times were more settled some of the money in the banks that we hear so much about might be taken out and be spent in establishing industries with or without the help of the Government.  I think it is only in that way that a very large percentage of the landless men can be provided for.</P>
    <P>It is probable that those who have farms will be considered first, and it is certain that a large proportion of those who have no land cannot be provided with any.  If every acre was divided up to the very hall doors of the demesne owners it would not cure this problem of congestion.  The Minister has made that quite plain, and there is no use in trying to hide the matter. Out of the 110,000 people in the congested districts it is certain that a very large number cannot be provided with holdings, and it is only by something in the nature of industrial schemes, organised with or without Government help, that the majority of the landless men and uneconomic holders can be assisted.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, I desire to say that I am afraid the Deputy misinterpreted my statement last night.  The Deputy said that I made a statement to the effect that the Minister should go slow in the division of land.  What I said was, that I wanted him to go slowly in the taking over of land in the future, and in the making of bargains for such a purpose as the price of land was going down in the market, but that as regards any land which the Land Commission had taken over that it should be divided up as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The people of the Gaelteacht should be very grateful to Deputy Baxter and Deputy Conlan for the plea they made in this House on their behalf.  From my knowledge of the people on the western seaboard of Tirconaill, they do not want to go as land grabbers into Meath or any of the other counties that were mentioned for the purpose of relieving congestion. That is a very big problem, but it is not going to be met by dividing up bits <Col N="1252" /> of land and giving small farms to the people in the Gaelteacht.  The problem must be met in some other way.  What that other way is I am not prepared to say, but I can assure the House that the people living in the Gaelteacht in Tirconaill are not anxious to get two or three acres of land up around Meath where it might be necessary for them to be protected by the Gárda Síochána from some of Deputy Hall's constituents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I should really tender an apology for intervening so late in the debate, but my excuse must be the immensity, the magnitude and the urgency of the problem. Beyond all doubt it is the biggest question that the State will have to deal with in the near future, and on the wise measures we take now for giving relief will depend in a very large degree the ultimate solution of this problem of congestion and the permanent alleviation of the lot of the small holders.  Silence they say is golden, but a time comes in the life of every man when silence is wrong and criminal, and when one should speak out the opinions that one holds.  I am afraid that many of the arguments and statements put up during the course of this debate in the last three days are not in the least helpful towards finding a solution of the problem.  If one were to press the case one would say that they savoured very much of anarchy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the case has been more or less put up to the Land Commission to force its hand&mdash;to tell it that it must do this or that, and that if it fails to do so that certain parties will go to the country and stump the hustings and organise some campaign evidently not of a lawful character for the purpose of forcing the hands of the Land Commission.  I wonder at this stage whether such a thing is justified or not.  I wonder whether people's eyes have been shut to the conditions and to the circumstances that existed during the last four or five years when they indulged in that kind of language.  Are they oblivious of the campaign of rapine that existed in many parts of the country, where a man could not lay his head on his pillow in peace; where he <Col N="1253" /> was forcibly dispossessed of his lands if he were weaker than some of the land sharks around him, and yet at this stage in the year 1925, with all these experiences fresh in the public memory, we are told that they will force the hands of the Land Commission. Some of us feel bound to answer very definitely that threat and that challenge.</P>
    <P>I make no secret of that whatever, and I am as deeply interested in the relief of the congest or the uneconomic holder or the landless men as anybody else, and I hold this policy of crime, to give it its correct term, ought not for a moment to be tolerated, and any politician who goes to the country on such a mission should be dealt with by a process of law.  It is not fair to go down to the unfortunate people who may be the dupes of these men. Rather strike at the sources of evil&mdash;at every person who promulgates a bad doctrine, and I would urge on the Land Commission, if crime results from this, then in no circumstances should lands be distributed which are the subject of agrarian outrage.  I say that very definitely having regard to the conditions in different parts of the country, and not in the least my own constituency.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling abroad, and it is well to emphasise the fact that because a man who over a series of years or successive generations may have owned or acquired a considerable amount of land&mdash;there is a feeling of grievance because somebody else happens not to be so well favoured by fortune.  Is that a fair proposition to put up?  To say that because Deputy Gorey, for example, might have two or three hundred acres of land, and another person with only ten or twelve has a sense of grievance, as if Deputy Gorey deprived him of some land, savours of anarchy and is to be deprecated.</P>
    <P>I never looked upon this question of relief, and I use the word &ldquo;relief&rdquo; in a very wide and extended sense, as quite a simple matter; it has many phases and many aspects.  It is quite true you can by dividing land in some cases very materially aid congestion and confer substantial relief.  In other cases the thing may be quite the <Col N="1254" /> reverse.  I think the underlying principle of this whole process should be to give as far as possible the widest measure of relief.  It is just possible by dividing a farm that you may deprive a large neighbourhood and a very large number of small holders of relief by that very fact.  At some time they may have been in the habit of getting hay or conacre in this place, and it is well to bear in mind that once you divide that holding up and make it the monopoly of comparatively few, the others, who may be equally worthy and deserving and equally in need of some outside aid to carry on the economy on their existing holdings are thus deprived of augmenting the feeding resources for their live stock. That, I say, is one problem.  In pushing on this question of division of land we need to look at it in all its aspects. I say definitely, in this connection, there are many parts of the country, and I name the County Clare as one, where numbers of people are in the habit of buying meadow on those farms which are a proper subject for division, or come under the scope of the Land Purchase Act and would normally be liable to be acquired for division. You have to judge every case on its merits and have regard to local factors largely, and I object to having anything like a stereotyped line of policy laid down by the Minister or by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt, whatever, that this question of congestion is a very urgent and a very pressing question, but the best utilisation of the land must be a factor.  I suggest that all avenues have not been explored.  We need to examine the problem in every phase by which relief may be given. It is quite possible, and I have put this case to the House before, that putting a number of persons on the land and giving them rights of a corporation, might be the most effective means of relief, as against a policy of putting each man upon a small piece of land to work for himself.  There is just that possibility, and I suggest that it is an avenue that should be explored. I suggested that on my own initiative apart from my colleagues and my <Col N="1255" /> party, and I suggest first that a Commission should be set up to explore how far we can permanently relieve the congests, and the small holders, and the landless men, and to explore every avenue, and not to tie ourselves to the policy of splitting up land into small holdings.  You find this situation true in the country.  You find numbers of small holders within a radius of two or three miles of an estate which is being acquired by the Land Commission.  If you tried to give the largest measure of relief you would allow a small portion, an acre or two acres to each of these small men, but I submit that is very often an uneconomic process.  In the first place the congests live too remote from the estate.  Anything beyond a mile or two is too remote from the property, and the natural propensity or tendency is to dilapidate the newly-acquired holding.  The Land Commission must be aware of that. The policy of the relieved persons would be to grow hay upon the new holding without giving it sufficient manure and to cart away the crop and to fodder it on the home farm.</P>
    <P>In the course of time this tends seriously to the deterioration of the holding and the holding becomes scarcely security for the money and certainly not as good security as when the money was originally advanced.  You have, in the next place, a policy of endeavouring to shift a number of small holders on to those places.  You make them surrender their original holdings and give them economic holdings on the acquired estate.  That possibly may have advantages and possibly disadvantages. It occasionally leads to friction in the area, but I think it presents a better solution of the problem than the other.  It appears to me that we cannot segregate this question of land division from the question of the need for improved conditions in agriculture. For instance, a farm of a certain acreage, worked on ordinary standards, yields so much annually.  If you divide that holding into two you know, if you are not to have only half standards of comfort existing in the new homes, you must double the produce and income. There is a further point to be borne in <Col N="1256" /> mind, in this connection; the smaller you break up the land you must, as far as possible, reduce its charges correspondingly; that is my opinion.</P>
    <P>People have got into the habit of thinking, and the view has been expressed here, that the more you break up the land the more you can knock out of it, and that the small holder can afford to buy on a more extravagant scale proportionately than the large landholder. Nothing could be more remote from the truth.  If you break up land into very small holdings you have got to consider the need for the greatest economy in local services, if the conditions of the people who live on them are not to be disimproved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy himself can very readily follow what is meant by very small.  Take the case of a holding of 10 or 12 acres, the owner of which may get in addition three or four or five acres, or the case where you break up a farm of a couple of hundred acres into ten holdings of 20 acres each.  Do you think that such holdings can afford to bear the same charges as when that land was a single unit?  I submit that it cannot, because there would be ten families there where there was only one before, and unless you proportionately increase the productivity of the soil, with correspondingly good prices, you are heading for disaster if you, as the tenant of one of these small holdings, carry on at the more extravagant rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister was giving statistics this night week I heard a very audible whisper&mdash;&ldquo;Liars, damn liars and statisticians.&rdquo;  Without in any way, identifying myself with that observation, when one comes to reflect on and contemplate some of the utterances delivered here one could scarcely augment the force of it.  I submit that the Deputy scarcely went far enough, that while &ldquo;statistician&rdquo; may be the superlative of &ldquo;liar,&rdquo; there is another realm of lying which he does not even approach, or at least if he does approach, he does so unconsciously.  I suggest that the politician's or the mob <Col N="1257" /> orator's utterances are the fourth dimension of mendacity, and I will prove it.

      <P>I was a minority candidate, though.  It was the intelligence of the county that returned me.  That brings me back nearly to the beginning, as to whether we are prepared to put this question of relief as against division on the highest possible plane, and whether we proceed on wise lines, lines carefully thought out, or whether we proceed in any haphazard manner, without reflection on the consequences of our policy.  I hold that the land question should not be a political one, and I have often expressed that view here.  I hold that this problem of relief must be approached from three angles.  The first is the sense of equity to the existing proprietor, whether the tenant or anybody else.  He has a right to get something which approximates, I will not say to the value of the land, but to something which, when capitalised, will give him the equivalent of the income he has been deriving from the land when that money is invested.</P>

We must pay attention also to the economic stability of agriculture.  As far as one can see, some of the wild advocates of an agricultural policy want to put to sea without a chart, with no clear line of policy.  I hold that you cannot separate these things, that you cannot separate the economic aspect of land tenure from the policy of division.</P>

      <P>As in the case of the Seanad election, the first shall be last and the last first.  I did not rise until the end of this debate, but I can assure the House that I cannot follow Deputy <Col N="1258" /> Connor Hogan.  Deputy Baxter was of the opinion that people who live in congested areas should be migrated to other countries, but I think that would be unjust to the landless men and the uneconomic holders who are already in these counties and in the vicinity of the land which it is proposed to divide. In 1924 I put down a motion somewhat similar to this.  I think that as far as my constituency is concerned we have not much to complain about.  Something like 3,500 or 3,700 acres of land have been divided there, and it was not given to people who already possessed farms of 100 acres, but to uneconomic holders, who were thus given a means of livelihood.  I quite agree that there is some delay in the sending out of circulars from the Land Commission to tenants to find out whether they are prepared to let the Land Commission take over certain lands.  I would like Deputies to visit the offices of the Land Commission.  I did so, and I never met more courteous men in my life.  They are not working Trade Union hours but are working overtime, and I do not know whether they are paid overtime.</P>
      <P>I could not tell from the speech of Deputy Hogan of Clare whether he was for or against this motion.  Certainly he used very high language, language that it would take professors to interpret. I would like Deputy Hogan to realise that Rome was not built in a day, and to come down to realities.  It is absolutely useless for Deputy Hogan to spur a free horse.  Since the Land Commission took over the lands from the Congested Districts Board, I think they have done fairly well.  Still it is necessary that such a motion should be brought forward in order, if possible, to make them do better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister last week said that there were 1,240,000 acres of untenanted land in the Saorstát to be divided to relieve congestion, and that something like 40,000 uneconomic holders would benefit.  I would like to put it to the Minister now&mdash;what about the tenanted land, lands in the hands of tenants, from three to seven hundred acres?  Because they are let to tenants under a landlord, it is not possible to have that land acquired by the Land <Col N="1259" /> Commission to relieve the congestion. I would ask the Dáil&mdash;I am sure Deputies have already made up their minds on the motion, and that it will be agreed to by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture&mdash;to try to relieve congestion, not alone amongst the uneconomic holders, but amongst the landless men.  You will find these landless men, agricultural labourers, who are living in labourers' cottages, very industrious, and I cannot see why they should be deprived of the right of getting portion of the lands when they are being divided by the Land Commission.  I think the question was raised yesterday with regard to employees on these lands.  When I had the misfortune&mdash; or the fortune if you like&mdash;of being a member of the Labour Party in 1922, an amendment was added through that Party to the Land Act that any employee engaged on land which was taken over by the Land Commission, would be entitled to portion of that land.  Considering the loss of employment caused by the Land Commission taking over such estates, surely the least we can expect is that a person employed on these lands shall not suffer, and that he shall get portion of the land, so that he will be able to rear and maintain his family.  That provision was inserted in Section 31 of the Land Act, and I am sure the Minister will certainly carry out that section to the letter.</P>
    <P>What is the cause of the delay in the division of the grass lands in the Saorstát?  There are something like 24,000 acres in Westmeath and Longford that are ready to be acquired by the Land Commission.  There have been about 3,700 acres acquired and divided &mdash;divided, I must say, in a most deserving manner.  The Land Commission has succeeded in improving the economic position of a large number of families there.  As far as the Land Commission is concerned, the staff is working overtime without any extra pay in order to try to carry out the provisions of the Land Act.  In 1924, when I raised this question, the Land Commission was very slow.  I think I said at that time that all big bodies move slowly, just like in the cinema, <Col N="1260" /> at the conclusion of a fight, we are shown a slow-motion picture.  I think they have moved rather quickly since then, and instead of paying 6-4 they are now paying 6-5.</P>
    <P>I think the best thing Deputy Roddy could do would be to withdraw this motion in order to give the Land Commission an opportunity of fulfilling and completing their obligations to the State.</P>

      <P>It must be a very large body judging by the speed with which it is moving.  While the debate was in progress I went downstairs to my locker and I discovered I had ninety letters from the Land Commission telling me that matters would receive attention.  The Minister was very fair in his statement regarding the distribution of land, so I will be very fair with him.  I had only 87 letters relative to land in one constituency&mdash; that is to say, the correspondence and the representations all have been made to one Deputy in that county to see that the provisions of the Land Act of 1923 are carried into effect.  I have listened to strange doctrines promulgated in the Dáil from time to time, but I must say that I never heard such economic heresy as I heard propounded during the course of this debate.  I heard quite recently that the centralisation of control and of management of land would bring about better results than the distribution of land.  What proof have we of that?  Let us look at a place where any amount of land is centralised in its management and its control, and what is the net result?  Is the produce better, is the productivity better than when it is given out in economic holdings?  Let us take the landlord class.  What demesnes are the centres of productivity?  Yet it is seriously suggested instead of dividing land, that it should be centralised in management and control.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Corporation&rdquo;; quite right.  I thought the Deputy said &ldquo;co-operation,&rdquo; and I am sorry.  If I understand the meaning of corporation aright&mdash;as Imperialism is the negation of nationality, so corporation is the negation of co-operation.</P>
      <P>It is seriously suggested that centralisation should be brought about. We would then probably have those centres of culture which we were told about on a previous occasion.  I should like to say that when these lands were centrally controlled in the part of the country which I come from, the only sample of culture which we received was the culture of the battering-ram, the crowbar brigade, and the great clearances.  I think we should remember what a gentleman who is not by any means a revolutionary in his outlook on any matter, namely, T. P. O'Connor, has written in his history of the Parnell movement, and it will be seen what culture was distributed to the people of Clare by those who had centralised control of the land.</P>

      <P>I did not awaken them, and I am trying to push them back to their graves.  The economic doctrine propounded here, stripped of its verbiage, amounts to this, that because you cannot cure a disease in its entirety you must let it develop&mdash;you must not endeavour to heal any portion of it.  That is what we hear in part from the Minister and in part from most of the other speakers.  We have <Col N="1262" /> been listening for some time to talk about increased production, and we have been told by people who consider themselves competent that increased production should come from one certain quarter.  The Minister for Agriculture has told us that there are close on two million acres of land either untenanted or ready for distribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  It amounts to this, that now when we are told that increased production is necessary certain people say that these 1,200,000 acres must be withheld from utilisation. What would be the productivity of that land if it were properly utilised? Is it properly utilised to-day?  I ask the Minister can thirty-five per cent. of it be regarded as national wealth? Calculated on that basis, sixty-five per cent. of it is allowed to remain dormant. The Government have, on certain occasions, also urged increased production, but here is a case in which they themselves can endeavour to secure that increased production.  I should like to register one occasion in which I find myself in agreement with Deputy Gorey, and that is when he regrets the disappearance from rural life of such people as country weavers, tailors and boot-makers.  Has he, however, considered what has brought about their disappearance?  Has he considered that it was because the people are not planted on the soil and because there is not sufficient demand for the work these people were doing?</P>

      <P>If these people were put on economic holdings they would be able to purchase clothing and boots which they are not able to do now, to any extent.  This productivity in agriculture would have its reaction right through the whole nation, and would have its effect in reducing unemployment, about which we are rightly hearing a good deal, and possibly will hear more.  The productivity that would come from agriculture would have its effect in reducing the cost of living, and other industries would spring up. <Col N="1264" /> The Minister said that there was not enough land to go around.  I wonder does the Minister suggest that we should become a nation of farmers, just as certain other people have been called a nation of shopkeepers, and that there should be no other industry in the country?
