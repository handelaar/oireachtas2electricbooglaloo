      <P>The intention is to take the Budget Statement and Financial Resolutions immediately on resumption after the Easter Recess, that is, on Wednesday, 22nd April.  If there are any new duties it might be necessary, in order to ensure that no evasion of duty can take place to ask the House to pass the Resolutions on the day on which they are introduced. Opportunity for a full debate on the Resolutions will arise on the Report which will be taken after an interval of about a week.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether a scheme for a Conciliation Council for the Civil Service has recently been issued; whether the scheme was, prior to issue, submitted to a Joint Committee of official and staff representatives in accordance with the undertaking given by the Minister; whether he is personally acquainted with the views of the Service in regard to that scheme; whether he has considered the request for an interview made on February 26th, 1925, by Staff Organisations representative of the entire Saorstát Civil Service; and whether, in view of his repeated assurances that he would be personally accessible to them on important general Service issues, he is prepared to grant the interview.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>A scheme for setting up a Civil Service Representative Council was issued last December.  The object which the scheme will effect is to give the staffs facilities for making known their views on Government proposals affecting the Service and on matters appropriate for discussion which the staffs themselves desire to bring forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme was not submitted to any Joint Committee, but every aspect of it was carefully investigated before it was decided upon.  From a very full statement furnished by the Staff Associations, I am personally acquainted with the views of the Service in regard to the scheme.  I have considered the request for an interview, but as the <Col N="1571" /> scheme has already been launched, do not think that at this stage an interview would serve any useful purpose. The operation of the scheme now only awaits action by the staffs themselves. If experience of its working indicates that it is capable of improvement, I shall be prepared to grant an interview to representatives of the Staff Associations on the subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state why the Revenue Commissioners refused to accede to a request by Irish motor traders to import, under bond and without payment of duty, complete commercial motor vehicles for exhibition at the Royal Dublin Society's Spring Show; whether the motor traders were willing to guarantee that the duty would be paid on any vehicles sold or placed in stock as a result of the exhibition and that the other vehicles would be returned; whether he is aware that such action on the part of the Revenue Commissioners means that traders and producers visiting the Show will be deprived of the opportunity of inspecting the latest and most up-to-date commercial vehicles and thus improving <Col N="1572" /> their methods of transport; and whether he will reconsider his decision on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision in law for the delivery of dutiable goods out of the custody of the officers of the Revenue Department without payment of duty, unless the goods are removed under bond to a warehouse specially approved by the Revenue Commissioners for the deposit of such goods.  The premises of the Royal Dublin Society are not so approved and, therefore, the request of the motor traders could not be granted.  It is not clear that the refusal of the motor traders' request will have the effect indicated in the question as the Revenue Commissioners are prepared to repay, in the event of any of the vehicles being returned after exhibition, any duty paid thereon at importation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major MYLES Major MYLES">
      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Revenue Commissioners not see their way to make the R.D.S. for the time being an approved bonded store in order to facilitate those people in trying to carry on business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extremely doubtful whether such a thing ought to be done, because if a request is made to regard premises for a special occasion as a bonded warehouse and is agreed to, it is difficult to refuse similar requests, and on each occasion a staff is required and difficulty arises in connection with administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major MYLES Major MYLES">
      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not take a guarantee from these people, who are responsible importers, for the amount of duty, in the event of not producing the goods at the end of the Show?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major MYLES Major MYLES">
      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister states that the money will be refunded.  That would be all right if he would guarantee that the refund would be made when the goods are re-exported.  But the usual practice is that it is months before a man gets his money back, with the result that it is looked upon as <Col N="1573" /> being worse than claiming a refund of income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think in regard to this special case, I can guarantee that arrangements will be made for the refund to be paid without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are thousands of pounds involved in this lodging of duty, and that to the mind of the ordinary man it seems that it is simply a way of having the use of the traders' money for months, free of interest?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>A claim for the amount stated has been received in the Office of Public Works.  It comprises £230 claimed for rent for period of military occupation, and £174 2s. 3d. for damage to buildings.  The claim has been investigated, but, as the buildings are vested in the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, information is awaited from him as to whether the compensation should be paid to him rather than to the Board <Col N="1574" /> of Health.  Meantime, at the request of the Minister, a payment as a special case was made to the Board of Health on the 7th ultimo of amounts totalling to £35 19s. 3d., claimed for glazing and building of loop-holes, these being works which are immediately necessary for the protection of the premises from weather.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to a number of applications for unemployment benefit in County Clare, which have been rejected on the grounds that the applicants were not unable to obtain employment, and whether these decisions were reached because the applicants held small patches of mountain, the valuation on which ranged from £1 to £5 per year; and whether he is aware that these applicants have been in the employment of the Clare County Council for some eight or ten years, and have always to depend on their wages as a livelihood, and whether he is prepared to have all these cases reconsidered and a decision arrived at as to their benefit rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>All claims to unemployment benefit must be determined in accordance with Section 11 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, which lays down the procedure. A claimant whose claim is disallowed <Col N="1575" /> is always notified of the ground on which the claim is disallowed, and he is given every opportunity to avail himself of the right of appeal given to him by the Statute.</P>
      <P>The applicants to whom the question refers are not identified, and without specific cases I cannot express any opinion about their claims.  It is, however, open to any applicant dissatisfied with the decision on his claim to appeal against it to the Court of Referees or Umpire, and that is the course which should be taken in these cases if it is desired to have them reconsidered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to terminate the appointments of a number of temporary clerks, men and women, partly because of the assignment of permanent clerks successful at a Civil Service examination, and partly by reason of reduction of work. Notices have been issued accordingly to six men, of whom one has been discharged and two more will be discharged on the 4th proximo.  The remainder will probably not be discharged for some weeks.  These vacancies will be filled either by permanent staff or by temporary clerks transferred from other branches, whose discharge would have involved a greater degree of personal hardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the custom and the law in connection with a Private Bill dealing with a scheme like the Shannon Scheme, of which we have had several recently, that plans and specifications must be laid where they can be inspected not only by Deputies, but any member of the public?</P>

      <P>It is the practice, and I presume the law also, for plans of a certain type, but the plans deposited in connection with the Liffey Bills, to which I presume the Deputy refers, are not at all of the detailed nature of the plans deposited by Siemens-Schuckert in connection with the larger scheme.

      <P>The delay in repairing this bridge, which connects the counties of Kerry and Limerick, appears to be due to the divided responsibility existing in such cases between the local authorities in both counties.  On the 6th November last the County Surveyor for North Kerry was directed to have this bridge advertised for contract.  Representations have already been made to me to the effect stated by the Deputy in the second part of his question, and I have been in communication on the matter with the Commissioner acting in place of the Kerry County Council.

The reasons for closing the hospital are:&mdash;(1) The patients can be more efficiently provided for in the Dublin Workhouse, where there is better equipment and arrangements for their treament; (2) the transfer will not cause any inconvenience to the patients, as the ambulance arrangements are very efficient at the Dublin Workhouse; (3) the arrangement will <Col N="1581" /> be more economical from the point of view of the Balrothery ratepayers.  The average cost in the Balrothery institution is £1 7s. a week, while the Dublin Commissioners offer to take the inmates at £1 5s. a week for hospital patients and 15/- a week for all others. In the circumstances, I considered that the expense of maintaining a separate institution at Balrothery could not be justified.</P>

In connection with the preparation of the local estimates for the year 1925-26, a circular letter was issued to these authorities on the 13th ultimo explanatory of the grants in aid of local taxation. The Estate Duty Grant constitutes the first item of the cash portion of the Land Purchase Guarantee Fund, and opportunity was taken to explain the position of this grant in relation to arrears of land purchase annuities.  I will hand the Deputy a copy of the letter in question.  It is only where the arrears of annuities exceed the ascertained share of the local authority in the Estate Duty Grant that no payment in respect of this grant can be made until the arrears of annuities have been paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The occasion that this Bill provides for discussing general questions might have been taken advantage of on the Resolution stage, but, by an understanding, it was agreed that at this stage of the Bill we might raise questions of general interest.  I gave a kind of informal notice that I intended to raise the question of Unemployment Insurance and economic questions arising out of the unemployment that is rife in the country.  The White Paper that has been circulated in reference to the Vote on Account has given rise to a certain amount of misapprehension <Col N="1587" /> which, I think, it is well to clear up.  Comparisons have been made in the Press regarding the reduction in the Estimates, and while it is true that on the White Paper there is a comparison drawn between the total Estimate for the year 1924-25 and the total Estimate for the year 1925-26, showing a considerable reduction, it has not been noted, though I think it ought to be noted, that the total Estimate, as originally presented a year ago, was considerably less than the total Estimate indicated in the White Paper as having been passed throughout the year.  The sum of £1,200,000, or round about it, is the difference, and that is accounted for mainly by Supplementary Estimates.  Now we know in the Estimates that have been presented in the White Paper, and in the provisionally detailed lists of Estimates &mdash;in the advanced proof of them which is subject to correction&mdash;that there is a reduction in the estimate for building houses, in the estimate for unemployment, and in the estimate for relief, and I wonder whether there is any good reason to anticipate&mdash;it is this point that I want to dwell upon&mdash;that no Supplementary Estimates will be needed in respect of these three classes of services&mdash;Unemployment Insurance, relief schemes and housing.  Speaking of housing, last year's Estimate showed a total of £587,000, partly accounted for by the balance out of the grant of £1,000,000 to municipal authorities and £206,000 under last year's Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we know that a great proportion of that sum of £587,000 has not been spent, and that, therefore, it will come back into the Exchequer at the end of this month.  The total amount in the present year's Estimates for housing purposes is £330,000.  That may be utilised within the year.  I think it will, because of the rather generous terms and of the very effective inducement that, I think, there will be to builders to build.  In respect of relief schemes, mainly road-making schemes, last year a Supplementary Estimate of £250,000 was voted.  This year the total Estimate for relief schemes is £110,000.  I think we are entitled to have some information at <Col N="1588" /> this stage as to whether it is believed that £110,000 will constitute the total requirements in respect of relief schemes as from the 1st April.  If the Minister can give us any satisfactory evidence which will reassure the Dáil and the country that the state of employment and the prospects for employment are so good that none of these Estimates is likely to be increased by a Supplementary Estimate, then we shall all have reason for gratitude.</P>
    <P>In respect to Unemployment Insurance, the position as I understand it is that last year there was a total of £329,000 put down in the original Estimate and there was a Supplementary Estimate of £176,000, making a total of £505,000, so that in the White Paper this year's Estimate of £366,000 shows a reduction on the total Estimate of the year of £139,000.  I take it that that is made up in the main of the non-repetition of the funds set apart for soldiers who had not been insured&mdash;a total of £135,000.  I take it that in the working out of the Unemployment Insurance scheme these ex-soldiers, who were not hitherto insured, will now be left uninsured and not entitled to any benefit unless they have had an opportunity of fulfilling all the requirements by paying into an Insurance Fund and coming into benefit.</P>
    <P>I was disturbed, and I am not yet satisfied by the explanation given by the Minister as to his views in regard to the Unemployment Insurance Scheme.  He said that the fund was in debt to the extent of over £1,000,000, and following on earlier predictions, he appeared to hold the view that it could no longer be considered insurance, and could hardly be considered an advance which might ultimately be repaid.  It suggested itself to me that his contemplation was that there was not to be any extension of the Unemployment Insurance provision because of that fact.  But, then, he suggested that the state of employment was such as to have brought into benefit a much larger number of insured persons than was the case when the last Act was passed, and that, therefore, there was no necessity, or he hoped there would be no necessity for it, when his figures were made known.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" /> Well, I do not know on what he is basing his expectations.  It may be that the relief schemes and their operation have affected the financial situation of the insured persons very greatly, but I want to restate what I stated before, that the residue of persons who are going to be out of benefit, even though it is reduced very considerably, is just going to suffer as much from the horrors of continuous unemployment, and if the insurance scheme is not bettered, not altered, and not increased in respect to these persons, their state of want will be just as great even though they are smaller in number than was the case six months ago.  A man is just as hungry standing alone as he would be if he were in the company of twenty-five others in the same position.  I want to impress upon the Minister that this question of the reinsuring&mdash;I am not now speaking in a technical sense&mdash;the bringing into benefit and making available for benefit moneys to meet the cases of men who have been continuously unemployed and out of strict benefit under the present Act, is important and urgent, and it ought to be faced at once, if provision is to be made for that class of person.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly we are all anxious that people should not have to rely on Unemployment Insurance, whether it is strictly insurance, or whether it is uncovenanted benefit.  We do not want that to continue for any person, or any group of persons, any longer than is absolutely necessary, but it is the lesser of two evils.  It is much better than that thousands of men should be left without either insurance or employment, and while we are all anxious that the provision of employment should be the first aim, then failing the provision of employment, we must provide something in the nature of insurance.  The Minister admitted, in the discussion six months ago and also within the last few days, that it is very difficult to understand the real position regarding unemployed persons and their relation to insurance, the amount of benefit that they are entitled to, the numbers of persons who have a claim upon the funds, and the number of weeks which that claim will be valid.  We had some <Col N="1590" /> figures a week or two ago from the Minister with respect to the number of persons unemployed on the 23rd February this year. The number of persons registered for unemployment was 53,000; that is to say, 43,700 men, 7,900 women, 518 boys, and 882 girls.  That gives a total of 53,000 persons in the Saorstát registered as unemployed, but the figures are not available giving the number of unregistered wage-earners who are unemployed, and there is not sufficient material to get an estimate of their number.</P>
    <P>I am not going to lay any stress upon the numbers that may be unemployed, but not registered as such. Let us take the figure of 53,000 in relation to the total number of insured persons which I put at 265,000 or thereabouts.  We have a total of 20 per cent., one in every five persons registered as insured who were, in fact, on that date out of employment. That is a very terrible state of things, no doubt, and we have not had any information to give us any reassurance that would be needed to justify our assuming that those provisions contained in the White Paper are going to be sufficient.  If the Minister could give us an assurance in that respect, I think it would be well that he should give it.  The fourth benefit year expired on the 25th of this month. From now onward insured persons will be entitled to the maximum benefit of fifteen weeks out of the twenty-nine weeks up to the 16th October.  That maximum can only be received provided that there is a sufficient credit on the insured person's card to entitle him to that, and he will have to have had a considerable reserve accumulated during the war period to entitle him to that maximum benefit.  It was, I think, suggested some time ago that possibly one-half or two-thirds of the insured persons might be entitled to that amount of benefit if they were continuously employed, but that left one-third, or roughly about 20,000, who could only claim benefit for varying periods of from one to ten weeks, and there has been a continuous state of unemployment and very many thousands of people, unfortunately, have been unemployed continuously, and <Col N="1591" /> unless we can see definite signs of renewed activity they will continue to be unemployed for some time.  Many men may run out of benefit in two or three weeks, but in three or four or five weeks' time, we will find complaints that, for some reason or other, they have run out of benefit, that they are not now getting any benefit, and consequently that they are left stranded, and are unable to maintain themselves and their families out of any remuneration they may receive from any source, because they have no benefit accumulated.  That simply means steady deterioration in physical ability and in moral strength; it means the steady depletion of such home reserves as many men may have had; it means the gradual increase in the number of visits to the pawn shop, and in every way leads to demoralisation and to the sapping of the physical and moral strength of that element of the community.</P>
    <P>I believe we ought to make sure, and we ought to face it at this stage, that there will have to be further provision made to keep men in benefit.  On this question of unemployment, and the number of unemployed, I want to refer particularly, because of the matters that we were discussing in the course of the Housing Bill debate, to the number of persons unemployed in the building trade.  I have some figures which show that in December last, notwithstanding the Housing Act of last year, there were in the Free State, amongst the various trades, 2,221 skilled men unemployed out of a total of 8,900, or 25 per cent. &mdash;plumbers, carpenters, painters, plasterers, bricklayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Deputy give details of these trades?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, out of 3,887 carpenters and joiners, 722, or 19 per cent., were unemployed on the 15th December.  Out of 617 bricklayers 94, or 15 per cent., were unemployed.  Out of 1,134 masons 260, or 22 per cent., were unemployed.  Out of 146 slaters there were 40, or 27 per cent., unemployed. Out of 739 plasterers 51, or 7 per cent., were unemployed.  Out of 1,871 painters as many as 932, or about <Col N="1592" /> 50 per cent., were unemployed.  Out of a total of 525 plumbers as many as 122, or 23 per cent., were unemployed.  Now, these are skilled men, and while I cannot give any figures as to the period or number of weeks in the year during which anything like this percentage was unemployed, it is quite evident that when one is talking about rates of wages and hours of work you will not arrive at any satisfactory conclusion as to earning unless you know that there is continuous employment at these rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they are for the whole of the Saorstát.  There will be a proportionate number of unskilled men unemployed, about double the number of skilled men.  Deputy Good could perhaps confirm the figure.  So that we may assume that in December, last year, there were between six and seven thousand men unemployed in the building trade out of about 30,000 men altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President made a statement which, no doubt, he had thought about beforehand.  He said we were not going to build houses economically, or solve the housing problem on the basis of a 44-hour week.  I wonder would the President say that in regard to a 47 or a 48-hour week.  I wonder if that would be any solution, or whether he suggests that an increase in the number of hours to 48, or 47½, or 47, is going to make it economic to build houses, because I find, from a return which I have, that it is only in Dublin that the 44 hours prevail, and that in places throughout the country, where the 47 and 48 hours prevail, there has been no greater number, but rather a lesser number, of houses built than in Dublin, and that where the rates of wages for skilled men and unskilled men are several pence per hour lower than in Dublin, neither the reduced rates per hour, nor the greater number of hours per week worked, have gone any distance towards solving the housing question in these towns.  I do not know; I have not had any opportunity to find out what the difference in price is of houses built in Cork, Limerick, <Col N="1593" /> Waterford, or Wexford, compared with Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of town areas, not rural areas.  In rural areas the houses are partly built by the labour of the builder-owners.  How ever, I may put forward this plea as an instance for the necessity of approaching the question of the solution of the problem, not merely the problem of building houses, but the problem of employing the labour of the country, that we should approach it in a very much more earnest and determined manner or, shall I say, in a more scientific manner than seems yet to have been attempted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has shown what I believe to be a most commendable spirit, and has been most earnest and effective in his view of what is required in respect of the production and the development of power in the country.  We heard a little to-day about the Shannon scheme and we were promised more.  I suggest that if the same kind of intensive study and application to the solution of the problem of the waste of human power were devoted by the Ministry as has been devoted to the problem of the utilisation of the power wasted in the Shannon, we might very speedily have some practical solution of the general problem of the economic waste of human energy in this country.  It is not only the water in the Shannon that is going to waste, but we have, as everybody who thinks for a little while will realise, this other waste of human energy, physical strength, and moral force, through the continuous unemployment of not less than 50,000 people and the half-employment, and, to some extent, perhaps, the wrongly-directed employment, of very many thousands of others both in agriculture, industry, and distribution.  I suggest to the Minister, for his very earnest consideration, that there ought to be devoted to the problem of utilisation of the human power of the country, at least the same amount of intensive study and care as has been devoted to <Col N="1594" /> the study of the utilisation of the Shannon, and that in respect to this other human factor, we have to look to the future, not merely to the present. We are considering the Shannon in the light of its possibilities of the future. We are not thinking of it only for this year, the next six months or the next eighteen months, but for ten, fifteen, or a hundred years ahead.  So far as we have gone, we have had small contributions for the relief of unemployment, we have had piecemeal legislation respecting housing, and nothing yet has been forthcoming to show that there is any comprehensive scheme in the mind of the Ministry for dealing with these problems.  There is no constructive proposal which would carry us on for a few years.  We are simply only looking ahead for six or twelve months at a time, regardless of the fact that this problem, particularly of unemployment, is not going to be solved within one year or, perhaps, within two years.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us some time ago that it is obvious that in the development of private industry rests the main solution of the unemployment problem; any other remedy can only be a palliative, and that the Government's responsibility, therefore, is to do everything possible to stimulate private industry and to provide for those who at any particular time cannot find employment. I am not quarrelling with that. It is quite obvious that the great mass of employment in the country, the use of human energy, will have to be by virtue of private activity co-operating as much as possible.  But under what kind of direction is another matter. Certainly we should look forward, and I am quite in agreement that the great mass of wage-earning employment of the country will have to be found in the direction of private activities.  I want to see the policy outlined by the Government as to how they are going to stimulate, how they are going to develop, or assist in the development of, this mass of private industrial activity, and what is their general policy and outlook.  We have had for several years back now, round about fifty, sixty, seventy, or eighty thousand people unemployed at various times. The problem is one which is very widespread <Col N="1595" /> in England, and in some other countries.  The reliance upon private enterprise wholly, without direction and authoritative intervention as to the line of stimulation, the direction of that activity, the direction in which such activities shall be stimulated, is not going to solve the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>Here and there you may assist one industry or another and generally promote a certain amount of activity, but I can see very little prospect on present lines, no matter how you may stimulate private activity, of any solution, any very great inroad into the number of unemployed for some time to come.  We have the housing scheme before us and if we absorb all the present unemployed of those whom I have enumerated as being unemployed in December, we will take out of that 53,000, say, 6,300, a very important contribution.  Take the Shannon scheme.  That is expected to take, say, three years, during which there will be employed something about 3,000 men on the general scheme of construction. There may be more, but you have, roughly, about 10,000 persons out of the 50,000 taken into employment and absorbed by these schemes.  We have road-making schemes, for which a grant has been made, but that, on this Estimate, has been reduced to £100,000 or perhaps a little more, to £115,000. Concurrently with that we are hearing every day that the county councils are reducing the estimates for roadmaking and that they are jibbing here and there at the spending of more money on roads.  We are told by some of the absent Deputies from the Farmers' benches, and, I think, from some of the absent Deputies who ought to be on these and other benches, that the farmers, when they get possession and control of the county councils, are going to cut down very considerably the amount spent on roads and roadmaking, and until we hear of some very extensive scheme of reconstruction on the main roads I can see very little prospect of a considerable number being added to the 10,000 people of whom I have spoken as being absorbed from the 53,000 persons into <Col N="1596" /> new employment.  If one could ensure that every penny spent by these persons who will be engaged in house-building, the Shannon scheme and road-making were spent on home production, that would, no doubt, stimulate an amount of employment of a secondary character.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that it is a fair deduction to make, that your present schemes that have been touched upon are not going to absorb any very great proportion of the present unemployed. It will be answered, and I think fairly, that if you once create confidence in the future, private enterprise will begin to increase, will rebuild and generally extend its activities.  I have no doubt that that will be so, but, unfortunately, we are faced with the fact that there are very many unemployed in other countries which are just as well-placed in regard to many of these industrial undertakings as we should be, even when the new schemes are completed.  I want to suggest, for the consideration of the Minister, that while house-building, road-making and many of these new schemes of construction are valuable and essential ultimately, in the present stage they are, in so far as they are financed and paid for out of the annual national production, not really increasing the total amount of available wealth for distribution.</P>
    <P>The available national production is being used in that direction rather than in another direction, and we are thus forced to the conclusion that until we devote our activities and thoughts to the stimulation of actual new production of commodities generally usable and exchangeable we are not immediately adding to the wealth of the country.  We are undoubtedly catering for the health and strength of the people, we are catering for the amenities, we are laying foundations for future industrial and productive activity, but I want to urge that our real need for the moment is to direct attention to actual new production of exchangeable commodities of general, common use.  I would specially emphasise in that, food production, clothing, boots and the like.  I think until we devote our minds to the stimulation <Col N="1597" /> of increased production of that class of commodities, we are not directing our minds in the right direction.  I think even more important than clothing and boots, and more important than any other proposition, is that the national endeavour should be to stimulate greater production, greater gross production of actual utilities, and greater production of net benefit directly from the land.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister for Agriculture has gone, because all I am saying is leading up to the point that the immediate need is to stimulate greater production from the land by way of tillage crops.  I suggest that, if it is agreed that that principle is fundamental, we would thereby have a greater national fund out of which the industries in the country can be provided, and a greater value for export and therefore international exchange. Until then we are really not developing the country in the direction in which it ought to be developed.  Apart from one or two items, such as stout and biscuits, which are almost negligible, we are dependent, and I think shall be dependent so far as the export trade goes, upon the direct produce from agriculture.  I think it is foolish to rely at all upon the prospect of developing industries to any great extent of a kind which will only find a market abroad.  Therefore I think, so far as industrial development is to be stimulated, it should be in the direction of the production of commodities of common use among the people of this country, and that for our exportable wealth for international exchange we will have to rely on direct production from the land.</P>
    <P>If that is conceded, I want to suggest that we can with profit devote our thoughts as to how best to stimulate that production.  The proposition of the Minister on the development of the beet-root industry for sugar-making is, I think, a good one, and I hope it will be proceeded with.  I had hoped in fact before I began that we might be able to draw forth from one or other of the Ministers some statement on the present position in regard to that project, but I want to say that neither the beet project nor the development of the egg and butter trade through the operation <Col N="1598" /> of the recently passed legislation, nor the development of the Shannon scheme, nor the improvement of the roads, good as these projects are, and in every case valuable as they will be in a few years, are going to be comparatively slow in their effect, and that the present bulk of unemployed men are not going to benefit materially from the development of those schemes.  I think there can be devised ways and means of stimulating agricultural production by tillage, and by other methods which will run alongside and supplement and help these other schemes which have been the object of legislation for the last couple of years, and the proposals for future legislation.</P>
    <P>I think I wasted a good deal of time and thought during the sittings of the Commission on Agriculture, and I devoted a good many hours after attendance at the Dáil to going through statistics and making an examination of the evidence that was delivered at that Commission.  I say I think I wasted a great deal of that time because the product of that effort has not arrested the attention, so far as I have been able to gather, of anyone in the country.  I have not met five people who have confessed that they have read either the majority or minority report of the Agricultural Commission, and yet I venture to say that within the pages of these two reports there is a good deal of matter of value. I think that perhaps some of the things stated in the minority report are of special value.  The minority drew attention to the fact that the farmers of the country were perhaps the most altruistic of all sections.  They may say when they read, if they do, what I am now saying that I was perhaps somewhat altruistic in giving them a word of praise in their absence, but I pointed out that they were in fact as a body in the community renouncing by their inaction what was claimed by most people who think in terms of capitalistic finance a valid claim in equity of £22,000,000 a year, round or about.  If the farmers made no claim to interest in the capital they have sunk in their farms during the last 40, 50 or 60 years, and are prepared to continue their agricultural operations <Col N="1599" /> on the yearly profit they make out of their personal labours to the extent they are satisfied with at present, then they are entitled to the term &ldquo;altruistie.&rdquo; Speaking for the community, and speaking more particularly for the urban interests in the community, I think we have no right to continue to look to the agricultural interests, farmers and labourers, to carry on as they have hitherto done.</P>
    <P>I agree, as I said before, with the general diagnosis of the Minister for Agriculture, repeated by the Minister for Justice, that the proportion of the total wealth that is taken by the urban interests, and particularly the distributive interests, from the producers was too great, that we are lop-sided economically, and that there has to be a readjustment.  I am arguing now for a direct effort on the part of the Ministry to bring about that readjustment, to take direct means to stimulate the activity of the agriculturists in the production of greater wealth in the form of agricultural produce directly from the land.  I think that the Minister for Finance, if he has the time and his inclinations run that way, might well consider whether a tariff on imported grain, oats and barley particularly, might not well stimulate agriculture to such an extent without any great cost to the consuming public, but that its effect would be to increase very greatly the area under cultivation, and thereby increase very greatly the actual gross production from the land.  If tariffs were not considered desirable there might be a direct subsidy to farmers who till over a given proportion of their holdings.  There might be a guaranteed price for a certain class of agricultural produce.  I suggest that even better than either of these would be a guaranteed price for certain produce, plus a National Grain Board controlling grain imports.  That was the suggestion made in the minority report of the Commission on Agriculture.  I believe it would be found to be valuable from the point of view of food security and stabilising the prices of agricultural produce, particularly pork, and also for increasing very materially the area under cultivation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1600" /> Whatever means may be taken, whether the line I am suggesting is considered by the Ministry as being at all worthy of carrying through I do not know, but I am putting these suggestions forward with a view, if possible, to drawing from the Government some ideas as to the line on which they are thinking with regard to the permanent as well as the temporary solution of this problem of unemployment, or speaking more accurately, the failure to utilise the human as well as the natural resources of the country. The answer, I have no doubt, that we shall receive, will largely be based upon the financial difficulties.  We shall be told that there is no money, or that money is hard to get.  I could not help thinking when we were discussing yesterday the Bill dealing with land bonds that whatever the merits of that Bill, whatever may be said about the terms of purchase of the land, that we did get a clue to one method whereby much of the financial difficulty might be overcome. It is proposed to issue land bonds reaching £30,000,000 within three years.  They are to be held as security, and will, no doubt, within a very short time after the three years have expired be used in fact to inflate the currency.</P>
    <P>We shall have an inflation of currency of £30,000,000&mdash;I suppose one might say it is really an inflation of British currency&mdash;but an inflation of currency to the extent of £30,000,000, less such an amount as had already been used for that purpose.  No less an authority than Mr. Reginald McKenna, late Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain, and chairman of one of the largest banks, a recognised authority, has made it quite clear, as many other authorities have done, that currency is inflated by the issue of credits by banks on securities.  If we are going to issue bonds to the value of £30,000,000, on which banks will lend money for general commercial purposes, and will thereby inflate the currency, I suggest as very well worthy of the consideration of the Minister, that he may possibly adopt a similar means of raising money, even at the cost of inflation, by the issue of bonds, or their equivalent of smaller amounts in bonds <Col N="1601" /> which might be used in the main internally, and that they might stimulate agricultural production without very much fear of consequences, certainly not permanent consequences of an evil kind, by direct inflation by the issue of bonds which will be redeemable not within eighty years, as in the case of the land bonds, but which may be redeemable in eighty weeks.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister, for his consideration, that if you stimulate production which will fructify within a year or eighteen months, the issue of credits for that purpose, which can be drawn in within that time when the effort has been fruitful, is not going to do any permanent harm.  It will, instead, do a great deal of immediate good, and, as I think, also, permanent good.  However, that is a suggestion which I believe is worthy of consideration. If it is not considered fiscally sound, if the general financial policy and the grip that the present system of financing has upon the community prevail, then it is for the Ministry to produce definite schemes which will help to stimulate the production that we all seek.  There have been suggestions made time and again, attributing our troubles to what one might call the domestic difficulties that arise within particular industries.  Such domestic difficulties have led to a cessation of production and an impediment to the free flow of commerce.  I have no doubt this impediment caused very considerable loss.  I do not think, however, that loss was really irretrievable. I would like, if it were possible, to avoid such losses and prevent such obstacles.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the chances are of any means being devised of avoiding such losses and preventing the development of such obstacles.  We had, during the last two or three days, evidence that the financial interests of the build-trade, for instance, needed a stimulus, such as is being proposed in the Housing Bill, to encourage them to develop in the direction of building houses.  It had to be made possible, by the removal of all restrictions on prices, for the speculative builder, the person who is willing to risk money in housing, to make a sufficient profit in <Col N="1602" /> the operation as would enable him to carry on and, with those profits, to invest in sound securities giving him 5 per cent.  That stimulus is required. The Land Bond Bill is another illustration of how financial domination controls human activities.</P>
    <P>In all these discussions we are told that capital is fluid, and will fly away from the country which does not give it security and the normal rate of profit or interest.  We are told that we cannot interfere with that flow, and thereby we are forced to the conclusion that that domination prevails and that finance controls humanity.  We are forced to the conclusion that in the conflict between Emperor and Galilean, Emperor wins every time.  I do not know whether that is so.  I do not think we ought to succumb quite so easily as seems to be generally accepted. I think we ought to make an effort to free ourselves from that particular kind of domination.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be the merits of that question, I put it to the Minister, and to those sitting behind him, that we will require to develop the productive activities of the country rapidly.  That ought to be done immediately, and until it is done it is incumbent upon the Ministry to fulfil the promise of the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he said the Government's responsibility is to do everything possible to stimulate and facilitate private industry and to provide for those who, at any particular time, cannot find employment. I ask the Minister to take that matter into consideration, and to prepare for it in his coming Budget, and, somehow and some way, to find a means to ensure that men shall not go hungry and that their children shall not be naked or deprived of the means for natural, physical and mental development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to a class that do not benefit whatever by any of his relief schemes.  I refer to iron workers. mechanics, fitters, ship repairers and their general helpers.  In any of the relief schemes proposed by the Government this class apparently gets no chance of employment.  There is another class, the printers, and I think <Col N="1603" /> I am voicing the opinion of all parts of the House when I say that it is with regret we noticed the closing down of the &ldquo;Freeman's Journal,&rdquo; which threw out of employment practically 300 or 400 men.  They have no prospect so far of further employment.</P>
      <P>If there is anything to be done under the Insurance schemes, and in the way of immediate relief, the classes I have referred to should not be forgotten.  I am inclined to think that sufficient attention is not being paid by the authorities to the threatened closing down of small Irish industries.  They are being shut down because of the need of very small sums.  I am aware that quite recently contracts were lost to local Irish factories for the sake of 10 or 12 per cent. of a difference.  The Minister would be doing a good day's work for the State if he would see that where local industries are making an effort to continue, they should get at least a preference of 10 to 12½ per cent.</P>

      <P>By giving that preference of 10 to 12½ per cent. to local industries, it would mean saving the Department that deals with Unemployment Insurance quite a sum of money. It is a deplorable thing to see a small factory, employing 30 or 40 men, closing down.  Those men have to be then paid £1 or £1 5s. a week unemployment benefit for very many weeks, and if the amount paid to them in that manner, or quarter of it, was devoted towards assisting the industry, the men would be given a chance of earning decent money and they would not be obliged to draw unemployment benefit.  I notice that in England very serious efforts are being made to safeguard industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite recently there was a case in England where a contract for electrical machinery was tendered for by a British house.  The British house was £12,000 more than a Swiss concern. Labour, and the various political parties in England thought it good policy, for the sake of benefiting their industries, to see that the £12,000 did not interfere with the British house <Col N="1604" /> getting the contract.  The contract was approved of in favour of the British house, although at the time it was 12 to 15 per cent. higher than the Swiss concern. I have reason to know that a small industry in this country was threatened within the past three weeks. A 10 per cent. preference for local work would be sufficient to save the industry and to keep 30 or 40 men going.  There is another industry that is meeting with very keen competition at the moment, and I believe a 10 per cent. preferential rate would save that industry.  A similar preferential rate would enable other premises to be reopened.  I refer to the woollen industry.  As regards that industry, the dumping of woollens in this country, and the consequent closing down of the industry in Ireland, are matters that are really deplorable.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister when he is considering proposals for insurance benefits to the unemployed, not to forget the classes I have just named. Apparently they are a class that get no benefits from any of his relief schemes. I join with Deputy Johnson in bringing forward the cases that he has referred to, and I would lay emphasis particularly on the unemployment in cities.  In Dublin to-day, in spite of all the schemes and the unemployment benefits, there is a condition approaching starvation.  I do not want to enlarge on that matter, but if I were asked to produce proof, unfortunately I could only too well be able to do so.  I hope the Minister will consider carefully the points raised by Deputy Johnson, and that he will not forget the few small points that I have referred to.</P>

      <P>Some interesting points of an economic character have been raised in this discussion, and possibly if I were to refer to the last one first, it might remove some of the difficulties that may have been in the minds of some Deputies.  Deputy Byrne urged that a preference should be given in the case of small local industries to the extent of 10 or 15 per cent., in order to keep those engaged in the industries in employment.  Looked at from one point of view that may be an attractive proposition, but in order to keep a small number in employment in that particular industry, you may hamper another industry by raising the cost of living to such an extent that you may throw hundreds out of employment. That argument has been urged on many occasions in this House and the Minister has been urged on that economic basis to impose tariffs on certain industries.  I hope that the Minister will not be influenced by any such shallow and short-sighted economic arguments.  No particular cases were brought up, so that one cannot deal with the question individually, but collectively it is a dangerous proposition, and I trust that the Minister will be slow to follow it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1606" /> In Deputy Johnson's remarks on the subject of unemployment he referred, in the first instance, to the building industry, incidentally in connection with the proposed housing schemes, and mentioned that in certain trades in connection with that industry there is a considerable amount of unemployment. He took his figures from the returns in December of last year.  It is known to Deputy Johnson&mdash;I was going to say it was known to every Deputy in this House&mdash;that the building industry is very largely a seasonable industry, and it has become more largely a seasonable industry of recent years because of the high costs and poor returns.  It does not need very much inquiry to realise that those two drawbacks are inflated considerably during the winter time when broken weather and other conditions prevail.  So, in a trade that is a seasonable trade at all times, it is not at all to my mind disappointing to find that in December of last year there was in that trade, in which there is a considerable amount of unemployment all over the country, a considerable amount of unemployment at that particular date.  Two particular trades in that industry, in which there has been a considerable amount of employment and in which trades there is a very considerable shortage of workmen, are the plastering and the bricklaying trades. I only refer to the figures in these two trades to show how small really the unemployment is.  Amongst plasterers the unemployment in December last, according to the figures given by Deputy Johnson, only amounted to 7 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have been misunderstood.  The Deputy will know that quite a considerable number of plasterers and bricklayers have gone across the water during the last year or so, and that reduced the number. When there is unemployment here, and no prospect of employment, they go across the water to get employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>That might have been true of other years, but it is not true of recent years to any extent in the building trade, because of the fact that I have alluded to on many occasions in <Col N="1607" /> this House, that wages are considerably higher in Dublin than in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not higher when the men are unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>They are considerably higher in Dublin than in any part of Great Britain and so there is no migration. In pre-war days the reverse was the case.  Our rates in Dublin were then 2d per hour lower than in Manchester, consequently there was considerable migration in the event of any rush of work on the other side.  There was considerable migration of skilled labour from this side to these centres in view of the increased amount of wages earned, but, as I have said, since the war the whole outlook has been changed.  Instead of paying 2d. per hour less to these particular trades, as we did in all cases in pre-war days, we are now paying 2d. an hour in Dublin more than in these other places, so that I am afraid Deputy Johnson, in stating that there is migration in these particular trades at present, is not fully in touch with the details of these trades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say on that point regarding the bricklayers that I know as a matter of fact that a considerable number&mdash;I won't say the exact number&mdash;have gone to work across the water owing to unemployment here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Amongst the bricklayers I notice that on the 1st December the amount of unemployment was only 15 per cent., and we must recollect that in that particular trade, as I have said, it is the effect, very largely, of being a seasonable trade, and also that you have a considerable number of old men and a considerable number of men whom we might term &ldquo;unemployables.&rdquo; You have them in all industries, and when you take these into account I do not think the figure of 15 per cent. shows that there is any serious amount of unemployment in that particular trade.  The Deputy went on to remark that in view of these figures he could not exactly see eye to eye with the President when he <Col N="1608" /> suggested that the solution of the housing problem could not, in his view, be brought about by a 44-hours' week. What the President had in his mind is the fact that is in the minds of anybody engaged in these trades, that so long as we are compelled to pay high rates for a comparatively small number of working hours, so long will we have high costs and want of employment in this country.  If we compare ourselves with other countries where trade is much better than it is here, we will find that labour in these countries works considerably longer hours, works very much harder during these hours, and works for a much lesser rate than we pay here.  One might give many examples of the truth of that fact, but I think the one outstanding example that will occur to all of us who are engaged in any industry in this city will be the shipbuilding industry.  In connection with that industry it is hardly necessary to remind the House that we had a thriving and an increasing trade in the city, but for some reason labour decided that it should get more for its work in Dublin than was paid for the same work in Liverpool, Glasgow and many of the shipbuilding centres on the other side, with the result that that particular trade left the city and went where it could get the work carried out so much more cheaply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is only necessary to give that one illustration to show Deputies exactly the force of the President's remark that as long as we are compelled in the building industry to pay high wages for short hours and for a small output, so long will the industry remain in the position in which we find it to-day, and so long will the housing problem be in the position in which we find it to-day.  It is obvious, if you inquire into it at all, that it is impossible to produce houses to-day at rents which will be called economic rents or at rents which the workers can afford to pay.  The reason is that the houses cost too much and the people who want to occupy them cannot afford to.  That is the problem.  Deputy Johnson will probably reply to me that labour in an ordinary building costs on an average 50 per cent. of the outlay.  That is to say that in the case of a house on <Col N="1609" /> which £600 is expended, labour is only responsible for £300.  On the other side, Deputy Johnson alleges that there is profiteering, which has brought about the high cost in the different materials required.  I do not know whether Deputy Johnson and those who sit with him have looked into that problem at all.  I happen to be connected with an industry that is intimately associated with building, the brickmaking industry.  In pre-war days we had in the city and county of Dublin four brickworks running, and giving employment to a very large number of working people.  Those four works are idle to-day.  Is that evidence of profiteering in connection with that particular industry?  What is the cause of that?  Labour represents over 40 per cent. of the cost of making bricks.  I want you to remember that point.  In that industry labour to-day demands 170 per cent. more than the pre-war level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the pre-war level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not tell the Deputy at the moment, but I can get him the information.  I do not like to give a figure except I am certain of it. But the wage that is demanded to-day is 170 per cent. over pre-war level, with the result that the cost is such that houses can be built more cheaply with other commodities, and it is put out of the market.  Cement which has been manufactured in other countries and has given employment in other countries is coming in.  It is made into blocks which constitute a cheaper material for house construction than the ordinary bricks used in pre-war days. The result is that the brick-making industry is practically closed up. That industry would give much employment in the Saorstát.  I take Dublin as an instance, and you may take it as typical of the whole Saorstát.  I find that labour in that particular industry has ceased.  I do not say that labour is not entitled to 170 per cent. from some industries if it can get it.  What I do say is that in that particular industry, and I am sure there are many like it, would it not be much better for labour to work at such rates as the industry <Col N="1610" /> can afford to pay, even though those rates might be considerably below what we might look upon as the standard rates in such an industry?  Would it not be better for labour to work considerably below the standard rates in that industry, and thereby give employment to a large number of workers rather than that these works should be closed down and these workers in receipt of the dole?  Suppose, for argument sake, the rate was 30/- a week, the industry could afford it.  Would it not be much better for the workers, from their own and from everybody's point of view, that they should accept such rates as the industry can afford to pay and continue employed rather than to have to accept the dole?  We talk about unemployment.  Labour says it is the fault, possibly in many cases, of the capitalists; but they have not been so hard on the capitalists to-day; they blame the Government.</P>
      <P>Do you not think there is a certain amount that Deputies in connection with labour and those responsible for the Labour movement might do in connection with the solving of the unemployment problem which they have not done?  They say the standard rates must be observed.  If standard rates were to be observed in different countries the trade of these countries would be very different to-day from what it is.  Take the linen trade in the North of Ireland.  It is mainly supported by juvenile labour.  If it had to employ adult labour at what you call standard rates there would be no linen industry there.  Labour and capital are agreed in that industry that it is better to employ that class of labour at such rates as the industry can afford to pay rather than it should happen that that amount of labour should go idle.  I would like to see that spirit entering into many of our industries.  If we could get labour to look at these questions from the economic standpoint we would have a great deal more employment in the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson pointed out that doubtless the number of unemployed that exists in the building industry to-day will be absorbed as a result of the activities that will arise from the passing of the Housing Bill.  All over the <Col N="1611" /> Saorstát to-day there is an immense amount of work for builders and for those engaged in the building industry. A large amount of that work is held up because of the cost of reconstruction. We are told that there is very considerable unemployment.  If a reduction of 15 per cent. could be effected in the cost for building it would mean that an immense quantity of that work that is at present held up would be proceeded with, and that an immense amount of employment would be given.  There is an opportunity that arises, a practical opportunity for dealing with the problem of unemployment, and if those engaged in connection with that work, labourers, employers, and building owners, could be got to consider the problem from an economic standpoint I am quite sure that a great deal of that work could be started and much employment be provided.  That only bears out a further aspect of the question that I was anxious to stress in connection with labour representatives here who speak so loudly on behalf of the unemployed.  There are many aspects of the question in which they can give a very large amount of assistance if they desire to see a solution of the problem.  I am satisfied that if that 15 per cent. reduction could be brought about, and it would not be a difficult thing to do, very large numbers of unemployed all over the Saorstát could be profitably employed.</P>
    <P>As to the advantage that would be derived from that I will only mention one point.  I said at the outset that the reason why houses were not being built was that those who wanted the houses could not afford to pay the rents that would cover the costs of the houses.  If we could get that reduction of 15 per cent. it is obvious that we could bring the cost of housing within the means of a great many who require houses.  So that in addition to solving in a large degree the housing problem we would also assist in solving to a considerable extent the unemployment problem.  These are matters that I hope will have the attention of Deputies on the Labour Benches.  I hope they will consider whether there is not something that they might do to <Col N="1612" /> help in solving these two national problems.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point to which I would like to refer.  It is this, that we are all anxious&mdash;I am quite sure that Deputy Johnson is anxious&mdash;when he says that he wants to see industrial development.  We want to see industrial development, but the capitalist is slow to invest his capital in industry. There are many reasons for that.  Here I am afraid that first of all I must blame the Minister for Finance.  It has been pointed out that capital engaged in the Six Counties, and capital engaged in Great Britain are not handicapped to the same extent by the burden of taxation as capital invested in the Saorstát.  The Minister, I am sure, is quite well aware of the truth of that statement, but all the Deputies may not be.  I would like to point out that first of all we have this additional burden of income tax which represents two and a half per cent. on capital. That means 6d. in the pound more income tax than they pay in the North of Ireland or than is paid in Great Britain.  On top of that we have what should be called income tax, but what is known as corporation profits tax.  It is really income tax under another name.  They had it as a war measure in Great Britain but it has been done away with there.  I sincerely hope that in the coming Budget the Minister will see his way to do away with that tax. That is a burden to the extent of 5 per cent. of profit.  These two items together mean that the man who invests his capital in this country is burdened to start with to the extent of 7½ per cent. over his brother in the Six Counties or on the other side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Seven and a half per cent. of what, will the Deputy say?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Capital is taxed on its profits to the extent of 7½ per cent. more here than in the Six Counties or on the other side.  That is a primary difficulty.  That difficulty can, and I hope, will be removed by the Minister for Finance in his next Budget.  A country like ours is dependent very largely for its maintenance on agriculture, which is considerably affected by <Col N="1613" /> the different seasons.  If we have a bad season for agriculture it affects every other industry in the Saorstát; it affects the whole of the Saorstát. Consequently when we come to compare a country whose prosperity is very largely dependent on the seasons with a country like Great Britain, that has large industrial resources and is not at all affected by bad weather in the same way as the Saorstát, from the point of investment the one offers attractions which the other cannot offer.  Therefore, in order to encourage capital to flow into the Saorstát, instead of burdening it by taxation, we should rather tend to help it all we can, and I hope, without stressing that point further, that that is one of the matters that the Minister for Finance will bear in mind in framing his Budget.</P>
      <P>But there are other points at which capital looks when investing in industry, and one of these is the cost of labour.  There, as I have pointed out, we are immediately up against the trouble that I have mentioned.  We find that the cost of labour here is considerably in excess of what it is elsewhere, and the result is that the capitalist has no encouragement to invest here.  In addition to the high cost of labour there is want of industrial stability; we seem to be too fond of striking, of raising trouble, and of upsetting things. We want to get rid of that.  We want stability in many ways, in order to encourage capital, but one of the ways in which we want it is industrially.  We want to stop, if we possibly can, these constant strikes, this constant irritation of industry by those engaged in it.  These, to my mind, are some of the problems that cause unemployment, and those of us who are anxious, as I am sure we all are, to see industrial development, to see work for the unemployed, might well consider a number of these problems and see if we cannot do something individually and collectively towards their solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I was not present during the latter part of Deputy Johnson's speech.  I understand that he dealt with the Agricultural Commission's Reports and regretted that <Col N="1614" /> no steps had been taken to put the various recommendations into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has not been quite correctly informed. I did not say that, because I know quite well that two of the recommendations have become definitely embodied in Acts.  My point was that so far as the general public was concerned&mdash;I was not thinking of the Ministry&mdash; there did not seem to be a single flutter as a result of the Agricultural Commission's Reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, to be accurate, we put three out of four of the recommendations into operation, and whether the public have got excited over that or not, that is the fact.  Further, I think that Deputies will have to realise that it will take a considerable time, one, two, or three years, before there is even a beginning of any sign of improvement as a result of putting these recommendations into effect.  It takes a long time to improve industry in any direction, and it takes a particularly long time to bring about noticeable improvements or noticeable results from anything you can do for agriculture. It will take two or three years before there are any considerable results from the operations of the Acts which have been passed as a result of the findings of the Agricultural Commission, but I do think that within two or three years very considerable signs of improvement will be in evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy, I think, also stated that he would be glad to be assured that the question of developing agriculture by imposing tariffs on imported oats, barley, wheat, butter and bacon has been considered.  It has been considered, and obviously the Department of Agriculture would have been wasting its time if these particular problems had not been receiving consideration since the date of the signing of the Treaty&mdash;in other words, since we have had an opportunity of imposing tariffs&mdash;if we considered that they were necessary.  But I need not point out to the Deputy that it is not simply a truism to say you can do a good turn to the farmer, or to any particular <Col N="1615" /> aspect of agriculture, by imposing a tariff on any of these things.  There is a good deal to be said on both sides, and this is not exactly the occasion to go into a very big subject like that. We probably will have an opportunity of discussing on the Budget the particular concrete items which the Deputy mentioned.  As I say, there is a good deal to be said on both sides, and there is a considerable amount in connection with these problems that is still unknown and that can only be ascertained with the co-operation of the farmers' and labour organisations.</P>
    <P>With regard to sugar beet, I may say that we have not been idle in that direction, and I think I can say, at this stage, that we have practically made arrangements under which a certain amount of sugar produced from beet grown in this country will be subsidised. I am not in a position to say any more at the moment, but we have reached that point anyhow.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson also mentioned that the minority report of the Agricultural Commission had suggested that money might be lent to farmers for developments in a great many directions.  That is so, of course.  But again, agriculture, I suppose, like every other industry, is really too complex to be dismissed simply by saying: &ldquo;Give money to the farmers and you solve all these problems.&rdquo; I do not think you can go any further in a discussion of that sort unless a concrete example is given of directions in which money can be spent. There is no use in saying: &ldquo;Lend money to the farmers.&rdquo;  You can lend money to people for various purposes, out it might be better if you did not lend it.  They have to pay interest and they may spend it improperly, and before money can be borrowed at a very considerable rate of interest and lent you have to consider very carefully just for what purpose you lend it.  For that reason you are really getting no further by suggesting generally that money should be lent for the development of agriculture.  Money will, in fact, be lent for that purpose if you are to subsidise sugar beet.  My point is that while we might all agree in <Col N="1616" /> general&mdash;and I suppose nobody will agree with so much enthusiasm as the farmers&mdash;that credit would be extremely useful to the industry, nevertheless you are making no contribution to the problem simply by expressing that generality.  I do not intend to review the whole agricultural position at this stage.  There will be an opportunity of going into all these matters on the Estimates, and I will reserve anything I have to say until then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidHall" hpid="Mr. HALL Mr. HALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to give Deputy Good an instance to show that profiteering takes place in the building industry, although he has alleged that it does not exist.  He believes that he has made a very good case for building contractors by referring to high wages, small output, and other matters. I can inform Deputy Good that no later than five months ago I had experience of contractors tendering for the erection of four-roomed cottages at £450 each.  The tender was accepted, but afterwards failed to receive the sanction of the Minister for Local Government, and the contract was readvertised. What happened?  Inside three weeks the same contractors had come forward again with a tender of £350.  Does that not prove conclusively that these men were prepared to profiteer and exploit the ratepayers and the general public?  These are facts, and if Deputy Good wants proof I am sure the Minister for Local Government could facilitate him by showing him certain minutes in his department. This was a case of the erection of twelve cottages.  High wages were not the cause of that; there was no question of increased cost of labour. These men were paying 48/- a week to their employees who were afterwards engaged on erecting these houses. These were the unskilled workers at forty-eight shillings, and I believe £3 6d. was the wages paid to some tradesmen.  It has been found on investigation into the matter which was the cause of a public controversy that when the cottages were completed the contractors had a clear profit on each of the houses of £94 each.  To make it particularly plain that they have been attempting to exploit the public, I want to point out another instance in <Col N="1617" /> which that was proved.  In their first tender they proposed to erect the houses in solid concrete.  That was afterwards objected to, and they came forward with their tenders again and agreed to erect them in concrete, brick or stone, saying that they were prepared to erect the houses at £100 less than their previous tender, and that they were prepared to go to considerably more expense in the erection. Of course, Deputy Good endeavours to make a case for the contractor, and is entitled to do so, but such statements as have been made by Deputy Good would be better substantiated by figures than by words in this House. He will find figures to bear out my statement in the Department of Local Government.  It is regrettable at the moment also that the Government have not endeavoured to deal with unemployment in agricultural areas.  It is well known to every member of the Government and of this House that unemployment is very prevalent down the country, and that the agricultural industry is practically at a standstill so far as tillage is concerned.  Some few months ago I endeavoured to impress upon the Ministry the necessity for subsidising the flax industry in this country, so as to absorb a large number of our unemployed in the rural areas.  I would like to know during this debate if it is his intention to subsidise in some way, small or large, the flax industry.  It was pointed out here before that we had only one manufacturing mill working in the Saorstát, and that was situated in Cork.  We have flax growing in different counties throughout the country, and the flax in the counties after being saved on the lands had to be sold in the Northern market.  If we are becoming self-supporting. I think it would be desirable if we made available a market for the purchase of flax products within the Saorstát instead of having people selling their products across the border in the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter.  Deputy Good might say this was unpopular, too.  I would like to have some statement from the Minister as to whether it is his intention in his future Budget to place a tariff on imported building <Col N="1618" /> materials.  This matter was put before the Minister for Finance about eight months ago, for the first time, from the County Meath.  Since then he has been communicated with on several occasions, and I believe an engineer of the Department of Local Government has been sent down to inspect one of those quarries working in County Meath.  We do not know the purpose for which he was sent, and we do not know his recommendation.  It was suggested at that time, and is suggested at the present moment, that building material such as stone has been imported from England into the Saorstát while within the Saorstát you had the best of building materials.  I wonder is that consistent, or does the Minister feel he is doing justice to the country when he allows a foreigner to have a monopoly of the supply of building materials in the erection of the different large establishments and houses within the Saorstát.  There was an objection made to this before, and the Minister inquired into it to some extent, but the inquiry was all we had. We had no guarantee from him that Irish building material would be protected in any way, or that it would be seen that Irish building materials would be used in the erection of houses in this country.  It is quite all right to read letters or to make statements in the House that the matter would be inquired into, but we want more than that.  We would like to know whether it is his intention to place a tariff at all events on building stone coming into the country.  Deputy Good may probably say in a few moments, or through an interjection, that the stone would be considerably dearer than the stone produced in and sent across from England, and this again would be the result of high wages paid here.  High wages are not the cause.  I do not believe wages are one of the causes for the high cost of building or for the high rents charged immediately after.</P>

      <P>I was not born in the same lucky climate as the Deputy.  I was born in a position in which I had not sufficient finance.  If I had sufficient to allow me to carry on for one year I guarantee that I could carry on for a lifetime.  I appeal to the Minister for Finance to examine the statements of Deputy Good and not to take for granted that they are the actual facts of the case, for they are not.  Imagine a man in a £450 contract inside three weeks dropping to £350 and having a profit of £94 on each house afterwards and paying the same wages as before. That is clear proof that there is exploitation of the public in general and profiteering as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing I would like to lay stress on, and that is the matter mentioned at first by Deputy Johnson, the question of the decrease in the amount of money allocated for relief schemes.  I think the whole House would like the Minister to say what improvement there has been in the industrial situation in this country, or what he expects to happen within the next financial year that warrants that relief grants should be reduced from £500,000 to £115,000.  I think it is apparent to everybody all over the State that the situation, if not worse, is equally as bad as it was this time last year.  At the present moment almost fifty per cent. of the people will not be entitled to any unemployment benefit within the current benefit year.</P>
      <P>I have got figures from the Wexford area which show that from the 30th June to the 20th October of last year 1,200 people were entitled to draw unemployment benefit.  During the following benefit year the figures went up to 1,341.  I suppose that was owing to the fact that ex-servicemen who had not previously received that benefit became entitled to it.  During the current benefit year only 500 will be entitled to draw benefit.  That, I think, is a very unhappy state of affairs, and one is entitled to ask, what is to become of the rest of these people?  So far as I can see there has not been any appreciable improvement in employment in the particular area that I speak of.  When the Minister was asked for figures the other day in connection with this question, I think they should have been available.  I do not think it would take the length of time he said it would take to have the figures made available. Something must be done, and there must be new legislation, so that the unemployment benefit may be given to these people.  No Deputies want an extension of the unemployment system if it could be avoided, but there does not appear to be any immediate prospect of a revival of industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally I think we ought to have a periodical report from the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to what examination is being made of the potentailities of the different industries of the country.  We have not had such <Col N="1621" /> examination in sufficient detail.  We are of opinion that there are industries Deputy Hall mentioned that should be afforded protection.  However, when we are so near the Budget statement, I suppose it would not be a very desirable thing to draw from the Minister what his intentions are in that direction. I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce ought to be able to introduce an Unemployment Bill immediately so as to tide those people over the hard period through which we are now passing.  Of course, Deputy Good is an expert in the building of houses, and whenever there is a debate of this kind he talks about figures and wages. Deputy Hall has given instances of the different prices of houses, and the effects, from his point of view, that wages and contractors' profits have on building and the price of houses.  To some extent I agree with Deputy Hall that there is something contributing to the high cost of houses other than workmen's wages.  I have a case in mind, proof of which can be had at the Ministry of Local Government, where, in the latter part of 1922, a house built for the Wexford Corporation, after tenders had been invited from different contractors, cost £635.  A similar house was built in Balbriggan, Co. Dublin, in the same period for £429, notwithstanding the fact that wages in Wexford were 6d. an hour lower at that time than in Co. Dublin.  That shows it is not a question of wages, but that there are some contractors in parts of the country who are not satisfied with small profits.  Surely that house should be built in Wexford as cheaply as in Co. Dublin, where, I understand, the wages were higher than in Wexford. If the house could be built in Dublin for £429, we would expect to have it cheaper in Wexford, where wages were lower.</P>

      <P>I contend that the output would be as good in Wexford as in Dublin.  I agree with Deputy Good that there should be an understanding on this matter.  There is undoubtedly a vicious circle in this country.  There is a misunderstanding in connection <Col N="1622" /> with matters of this kind.  I think the Government ought to go into the question of the building of houses and unemployment generally, and try to get those interested together and take all points into consideration.  It is not a job for one party, even for the Government of the day; the huge problems that confront the country are to be solved.  The sooner the Government realises that the better.  It is a question that cannot be tackled even by such a large party as the one now in power.  We are inclined to debate a question like this one day and bring forward what we consider are remedies, and then forget all about it the next day.  I think everyone will agree that the problem requires careful consideration, and that we should get all the parties concerned together in order to get away from continuous bickering over what is really an outlandish state of affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to join briefly in this discussion, because I was just thinking that it would look out of place if I allowed Deputy Good to speak on behalf of the building trade without saying something in reply.  I do not intend to be too hard on Deputy Good on this occasion.  I have a great deal of sympathy with a lot of the things he said, particularly with his objections to Deputy Hall's remarks.  I would like to say, in support of one of Deputy Good's contentions, as an interruption to a remark of Deputy Hall's, that it is not so very easy to start in the building business.  If it were, and if I was sure of getting good profits out of it, I would be ready to start in the business to-morow.  As a matter of fact, it takes years of training before any man, no matter how naturally clever he may be, can hope to arrive at a successful conclusion in pricing a bill of quantities for any kind of a simple job, even a small cottage job.  If it were half as simple as Deputy Hall says it is to get on in the building business.  I think everyone would be a building contractor. Anyway, there is not a great deal in what Deputy Hall said on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a few occasions in the past, I took it upon myself to defend building tradesmen from Deputy Good's onslaughts, particularly the building <Col N="1623" /> tradesmen in Dublin.  I was very glad to hear him say, in reply to a remark of Deputy Gorey's, that the output of tradesmen in Wexford was not as great as it is in Dublin.  That is a tribute to what I have been saying in the past, that the building tradesmen in Dublin &mdash;Deputy Good himself admits it now &mdash;have never been nearly as bad as Deputy Good and people like him would have us believe.  I am going to tell the truth, and I may say that I am taking a great risk in saying this: that there is some justification for Deputy Good stating that there is not as great an output in the building trade now as there was in the past.  On two or three occasions in this Dáil, and in the previous Dáil, I tried to point out that such was not the case.  I did that from a sense of loyalty to my own class, but I am now willing to admit that there is some justification for it.  I would like to give a reason for it, and the reason is this: that in the days prior to the European war the men engaged in the building trade in Dublin, in every part of Ireland, and in every big city and town in England, had to work as veritable galley slaves.  At that time they were compelled to work hard in order that they might be able to keep their jobs.  They could not relax their efforts, because there was always such a large number in the ranks of the unemployed willing to take their places if their efforts did not come up to the expectations of their employers.  At that time, too, whenever they made an attempt to get an increase of even only one halfpenny per hour in their wages, unless they could catch the building contractors napping, they were compelled, in most cases, to remain on strike for a month, two months, and sometimes even three months before they could get that advance of a halfpenny. The impression which years of treatment of that kind left on the minds of the men was that the contractors were not their friends.</P>
    <P>It would take a very clever and a very eloquent man at the present day, either in this country or elsewhere, to convince a group of building tradesmen or building workers that when Deputy Good says he would like to see the <Col N="1624" /> spirit that exists in the linen industry existing in the building industry, he means everything he says, because these men have not very happy recollections of him or of his fellow-building contractors in the past.  As I have stated, before the outbreak of the European war tradesmen in this country and in England had to work as galley slaves, but a change occurred about 1916 or 1917 when a good deal of government work was provided in the building of factories and aerodromes. At that time practically every tradesman in England and Ireland, including myself, was employed on that work. For a few months I worked myself in England on one of these jobs.  Early in 1918 a number of aerodromes were erected in different parts of Ireland, at least four of them being put up in the vicinity of the city of Dublin.  In connection with the building of the aerodromes and factories in England and Ireland one heard a good deal of this sort of cheap joke passing from one man to another: &ldquo;If you are caught working hard here you will be sacked.&rdquo; In other words, these were Government jobs.  They were not contract jobs, but what are called subsidised jobs, and they were given to a contractor who, as far as I know, got 8 per cent. as a profit or payment on the total sum spent on the job.  Deputies, I am sure, will see the point of that: that the longer the job lasted and the more money, therefore, that was spent on it the larger was the profit which the contractor derived.  The less the tradesmen and other workers did the longer, of course, the job lasted and the more money went to the contractor.  What happened on these jobs led these tradesmen, who previous to the outbreak of the European war had been worked like galley slaves, to the conclusion that it was not always good, even from the employers' point of view, that men should work hard.  During the war quite a large number of employers found that they could make considerably more money by allowing their employees to go easy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, in answer to Deputy Johnson, said that it would take some years before the benefits of recent agricultural legislation <Col N="1625" /> could make themselves felt.  Everyone knows the long number of years it takes to train the mind of the individual. The education of children in the schools goes on for years and years.  In the same way it is a difficult thing to eradicate bad habits that have become ingrained in the individual character. It has not been found a very easy task to eradicate the habits which tradesmen were encouraged to cultivate on these jobs in order to please their employers, so that the profits which the latter derived from the buildings put up would continue to soar higher and higher.  Consequently it is not fair for Deputy Good or for any sensible man like him to expect that the habits ingrained in these men during the highly profitable war years could be scrapped immediately.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good himself admitted that the building trade was a seasonal one. I worked at it myself for over twelve years.  The men engaged in it know that no matter how good the job may be that they are employed on, there is always a period of unemployment awaiting them, and when I was much younger, I confess that I often told them that they were fools to work hard when they knew quite well that their doing so would mean an earlier completion of the job and a nearer approach to the day when they themselves would be in the ranks of the unemployed.  My talk to them in the past had not much effect, but the experience they got during what I may call the prosperous war years, when engaged on Government jobs, has had its results, and has not worn away yet.  It will take a great deal of denunciation before it will wear off, and it will take a great deal of talk on the part of building contractors before they will succeed in convincing the workers and tradesmen engaged in the building industry that they really mean well to the men themselves when they ask them to accept a reduction in wages or to give a greater output in their work.</P>
    <P>The reason the building contractors will fail in that is, that in the past their employees have never seen any evidence of a desire on their part to benefit the industry as a whole or to <Col N="1626" /> improve the conditions under which the employees work.  All the employees have seen is the grasping hand of greed put out by the contractor to get as much as he possibly could.  I am not blaming them, but I am stating the facts as I have seen them.  It will take a great deal of effort on the part of the building contractors before they will bring the workers to realise that it would be to their benefit to do more work than they have been doing during the past few years.  It would take a good deal to convince the workers on that point when, in reality, they know from their own experience that the more work they do the sooner they will be thrown on the ranks of the unemployed, and the sooner they will be lining up for the dole, if they are lucky enough to be in benefit for the required period to enable them to get it.  In conclusion, I desire to say that I believe that the remedy Deputy Johnson has reiterated time and again in this Dáil is the only real way in which we can get a greater output in the building or in any other industry, and that is by some great national effort to give security to the men engaged in these trades.  There is no use in making an appeal to a tradesman to work so hard at the building of a house that the perspiration will come through every pore of his body when he knows that the only result of his labour, from his point of view, will be that instead of getting eight weeks' work on the job he will only get four weeks.  We all know that that is the fate of the average man in the building trade.  I say that you are not going to get increased output in that way.  On the other hand, if you are going to make some great national effort, meant to convince the working classes in this country that the employers regard them with good-will on their side&mdash;and it will take a lot to convince them on that point&mdash;but if once you succeed in convincing them of that, and that you do something to guarantee them continuity of employment, then I would be willing to say, and in saying this I do not think I would be giving offence to any wageearner in the country, that they would be quite willing to do their very best for the country as a whole as well as for themselves.</P>

      <P>This debate has really arisen on two points &mdash;one, that the Estimate showed the money voted for relief schemes has shrunk this year from a sum of £500,000 to a sum of £115,000.  But it must be remembered that this time last year there was voted not £500,000 for relief schemes, but only £250,000, and that other moneys came by way of addition, and that those were justified on account of the very bad season that there had been.  The reduction is, therefore, not so big as a question of £115,000 against £500,000, but rather it is a question of £115,000 as against £250,000 voted this time last year, and the reason of that decrease is partly due to the fact that there is still a certain amount of work in progress started by the extra money voted last year and on account of its being such a bad season.</P>

      <P>That is a question I was asked some few days ago, and my answer was that we had not the figures upon which to form a judgment as to the necessity for any extension or <Col N="1628" /> for any carrying on of the extended Unemployment Insurance benefit to the fourth benefit year.  Deputy Corish said these figures should be available. It is an easy way to deal with a great problem to say that something should have been.  In any case, it is not possible to have these figures at once, and when I said ten days, I said that a ten days' period would be necessary before the material could be made available. In that I made a mistake.  Ten days was an under-estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>

      <P>We had all this before.  The Deputy said that the figures should be available.  I said they were not, and I said that such approximations and estimates as I had would really lead me to announce a decision against the extension of Unemployment Insurance.  I do not believe these estimates will be borne out in full when I get the proper figures. There are certain tendencies observable in the figures we have, but it is not a matter of ten days, but it is a matter of three weeks before the information will be available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said is that in the nature of the case it is not possible.  You can get an estimate through figures, but we do not keep them now, in the same detail, as we did, because, as I have often said, they were being interpreted in a wrong way. You can get certain figures which show the position at the Exchange on a particular day or week, but you cannot found anything on that, particularly with regard to the new benefit year. These figures will be collected as <Col N="1629" /> quickly as possible.  I want to controvert one statement of Deputy Johnson. He said I had indicated my hope that the Unemployment Insurance Act would no longer be necessary.  I do not remember having included any hope of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not remember saying that the Minister &ldquo;hoped.&rdquo;  I think the Minister did indicate his expectations, and he repeated it now, that on the figures available of the number of unemployed and the numbers that have got into employment compared with the numbers insured that the expectations rather showed there would be no necessity, and I think he repeated that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that on the definite basis that it was on these approximations and estimates I made the further statement&mdash;I think there are certain tendencies observable that way &mdash;that I had no hopes that it will be possible to do without an Unemployment Insurance Act by some extended right beyond what is actually available for the insured in this present benefit year.  All I can say is that Deputy Johnson put the position fairly well himself in certain figures.  He took a certain analysis of the figures, and he said he estimated that half or two-thirds of a certain number would be available for the maximum amount of benefit in this benefit year, and that the remainder would be going out of benefit in different periods, and that some of them would go out inside the next three or four or five weeks.  Now that is just the particular point; that as far as any estimates are available, at the moment, it seems to be likely that there is not going to be any big number not having benefit coming to them in the next three or four weeks.  Consequently we have this period of twenty days, or three weeks, before we meet again to have these figures examined, so that there will not be a very big hardship.  Deputy Johnson says, of course, that a single man, one individual who had been hungry for many weeks&mdash;would continue to be hungry, and that it did not matter whether it was one man, half-a-dozen men, or a couple of hundred men, numbers made <Col N="1630" /> no difference as long as there would be hardship.  Of course, numbers make a tremendous difference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Not to the individual, but it makes a very big difference as to whether or not another Unemployment Insurance Act is necessary.  An Unemployment Insurance Act is only accepted by this House because in face of huge numbers it is the only alternative. If it were a case of a hundred or one thousand men being unemployed, I do not think that the House would consider the extension of unemployment insurance.  There would be a bigger attempt made to absorb five hundred or a thousand men, but it is when you are faced with thirty, forty, or fifty thousand men unemployed that an unemployment insurance scheme becomes the only way of dealing with that very big number of people.  My answer to the points raised to-day is very simple. With regard to relief schemes, the position is not so bad as the estimate would seem to indicate, that there is not what you might call a tremendous reduction, and when the facts are considered there does not seem to be the same provision necessary for another Unemployment Insurance Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to ex-soldiers who got special benefit in the last benefit year, and who are now out of benefit, there again we must wait some time before we can get the final figures, but this fact is revealed by what figures we have: that about half of those whom we estimated would be likely to apply for benefit under the special provisions of last year did apply, and, of that number, two-thirds seemed to come from agricultural areas and the whole indication with regard to that two-thirds is that they were chiefly concerned with agriculture.  In the season upon which we are now entering there is the greatest activity in agriculture so far as these men are concerned, and, from the figures we have with regard to unemployed ex-soldiers, <Col N="1631" /> it does not seem at the moment that there will be any great hardship caused by not carrying on that special provision for them.  With regard to one-third of the fifty per cent. who applied, it is still a notorious fact that the army is under strength, that there are vacancies in the army, and that men cannot be got to enlist, so that it does not seem that these people are at the end of their tether after all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great number of single men eligible for reenlistment in the army who have not applied.  I do not say that that is a final judgment on the question of ex-soldiers, but I say that there is sufficient material in the case of ex-soldiers who were specially privileged under the last Act to make us pass judgment in this way, at any rate, that, until we get the further figures and a more detailed consideration of them, there is no case, we believe at present, and there is no sufficient urgency revealed to make the introduction of another Act necessary. My expectations are certainly not that we will be able to do without some extension of the unemployment insurance code.  On that there is just this further point.  Deputy Johnson said that I indicated the fund was in a certain position.  It is in debt to the extent of £1,200,000.  I think Deputy Johnson said further that he understood from me that we have got to the point, where anything in the future could not be considered strictly on a contributory basis.  I am afraid we have got to that point, and that any provisions to be made in the future will require more detailed consideration.  We have reached that point and we can no longer continue by simply borrowing from the Central Fund and making the Unemployment Insurance Fund indebted to it.  There has to be some other approach to it.  The administration may be the same, but these are things which will have to wait for further consideration. We have got, however, to the point where that fund can no longer be considered as solvent if we are to proceed on the old basis.</P>

      <Col N="1632" /> I do not intend to deal with the questions raised with regard to housing. They have been repeatedly thrashed out between Deputy Good and certain Labour Deputies.  There was another question of importance raised and that was with regard to giving a certain preference to Irish materials in certain industries or to help Irish industries by giving preference when contracts are placed.  The Government can influence very few contracts.  There is a special committee dealing with these, and they have special instructions with regard to helping industry in a particular way. I do not want to go into details as to what these instructions are, as it might lead to these instructions having to be carried out in every case, and demands might grow if it were understood what the details of a scheme in any particular case were.  That is being and has been attended to for years past.  In so far as the Government can influence contracts, and in so far as the Government has contracts to place, that has always been attended to.  Deputies should realise that these are mainly matters for private enterprise.  The Government can do nothing except by a general outline of the policy to which it has always adhered.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, with reference to the Unemployment Insurance Act, said that ex-service men who were not insured prior to joining the army, when legislation was introduced by the Government to enable them to get a grant from the Labour Exchange, only one-half of them applied for it, and that two-thirds of these were from the agricultural community.  He also stated that owing to the increased activities in agricultural districts it was anticipated that no distress would prevail amongst these people.  I know the country very well, and there is no activity whatever as regards the agricultural industry.</P>

      <P>I know that Deputy <Col N="1633" /> Hogan asked for that, but I do not think that is going to be of any service to the workers.  I would like to bring before the Minister the necessity for introducing at a fairly early stage a measure for the continuation of the Unemployment Insurance.  About 750 people are unemployed in Athlone. About a fortnight ago there were over 400 of these people knocked off benefit, and in Mullingar alone about 200 out of 300.  I further want to know from the Minister for Finance if he intends giving grants to county councils for road-making in the coming year, and if he can explain why the Government about three weeks or a month ago refused to give sanction to the Westmeath County Council when they unanimously decided after their estimate for the past year was exhausted to give a further £2,000, and to borrow that sum in the coming estimate?  By refusing their sanction in this case the Government left 800 men idle.  We hear a good deal about the Government's intention regarding the relief of unemployment, so that when we go to bed at night we dream about all the millions that are going to be given for that purpose, but when we come to the Minister for Finance he will tell us to dream where we are going to get it. You can get for the Shannon scheme £5,000,000, but when it comes to sanctioning the actual proposals that will do good the Minister refuses his sanction. The unemployment problem will never be solved in this country.  I was pleased to hear Deputy Nagle say to-day that he was going to speak the truth, for it is said that it is almost as hard to get the truth from an official Labour man as to get it from a lawyer.</P>

      <P>They speak gospel.  I was very pleased to hear Deputies on the Labour benches saying that they wished they could become employers. It is a healthy outlook when we find Labour Deputies anxious to become builders.  I venture to think that if Labour Deputies succeeded in becoming builders they would be able to prove that houses could be built much cheaper, with less hardship to the <Col N="1634" /> employees engaged on the building of these houses, and that the employees would be treated as Christians, and not, as they have been in pre-war days, as slaves, by some employers.  I cannot understand why a house in Balbriggan, as Deputy Corish said, could be built for £429.  In the town of Athlone, where the wages are 48/- a week, it costs £600 to build a house.  It is claimed that labour should work longer hours for reduced wages.  At present builders in different parts of the country are trying to get labourers to work for 30/- a week, and it must be remembered that if a shower of rain comes they lose a day's pay out of that.  I am very sorry to see that the grants for the relief of distress and unemployment have been reduced.  I sincerely hope the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be as good as his word. He said the £250,000 was allotted in last year's Budget for that, and it was afterwards increased.  I hope it will be the same again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>We give coal and fuel and make drains then but give nothing when there are no elections.  It is a well-known fact that the labour community in this country for the past twelve months are in a worse position than they were in pre-war times.  You have at present a very large number of ex-National Army men living in agricultural districts who cannot find employment.  They have families, and would the Minister be surprised to know that a very large number of these men who applied to the Labour Exchange have not yet received one penny?  I can give him details of at least twenty such ex-service men in the constituency I represent.  I want to know whether these men will be entitled to receive benefit, or can the Minister say what grants these ex-service men of the National Army, who had not been insured when they joined the National Army, and who were entitled to draw from last year's grant, have been refused.  In the County Westmeath, in 1920, the amount given in home help was £2,340, by the different poor-law guardians.  Amalgamation <Col N="1635" /> has since taken place, and owing to the amount of unemployment the County Boards of Health have had to spend £7,510 more than in 1920.  If the Government does not introduce some legislation for the benefit of the workers who are idle to enable them to get some benefits from the Labour Exchange these men will have to become a charge on the ratepayers.  There is not one person in receipt of home help who is not badly in need of it, but there are hundreds applying for it who cannot get it.  I appreciate the attitude of the Minister for Local Government during the past twelve months.  He has certainly done everything possible to relieve acute distress, but the position is that the people are no better off to-day than they were twelve months ago. Unfortunately we lack industries.  I quite agree with the Deputy on the Labour Benches who said that until the workers of Ireland got some guarantee that they are going to be kept in employment it would be very poor encouragement to increase their output. I further believe that without output there can be no income, and it is necessary for every working man to try and do at least what may be considered a fair day's work.  I disagree with Deputy Nagle when he said that the workers were doing as little as they could.  I think they are anxious to do a good day's work when they are paid for it, but at present they are not paid for a proper day's work.  Surely you cannot expect a good day's work for 30/- a week.  The wages suggested by the Government to the different councils is not adequate for men who have to maintain families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How do you expect a man with six or seven children to live on 25s. a week? It will take at least 5s. for fuel.  A tax of fifteen per cent. has been put on boots, and you are going to tax everything&mdash;at least, I presume that is the intention this year.  Still you will not increase wages to meet that increase in the cost of living.  The cost of living has gone up by at least 103 per cent. since 1914, but the worker is not being paid an increase equivalent to the increase in the cost of living.  I think that before you can reduce wages the <Col N="1636" /> cost of living must also be reduced. I say to Deputy Good, who is a man of great experience in the building world, that before the wages of the workers are reduced, the cost of living must also be reduced.  The cost of living went up considerably between 1914 and 1917, but it was 1917 before the workers got an increase.  A large amount was made in profits by the employers at the expense of the workers during that period.  I would like to know where all these profits are now.  Naturally one must expect that the cost of living must be reduced before you can ask workers to go back to the pre-war wage.  The workers were not very well off in pre-war days.  Surely, no man with a sense of responsibility could ask a labourer to work 48 or 50 hours a week for a wage of 24 or 25 shillings I agree with the view put forward by Deputy Johnson here some time ago, that if the workers got a guarantee of employment, and that they would not be disturbed in that employment, they would have a keener interest in that particular industry.  Until they get that guarantee you cannot expect them to have a real interest in their work. Take the case of any ordinary worker. He is liable to be told that next week will be his last in that particular employment. That man will have no heart in that industry, and until the Government realise the true position of workers in general, and try to find employment for them with some security and some guarantee that they will be continued in that employment for twelve months, two or three years, as the case may be, it is useless to expect workers to give of their best to the State or to their employers.</P>
    <P>Every working man, if he gets proper conditions, is anxious to do his best. He is quite willing to give of his best and to live in and help to improve the State, but it is necessary to give him some guarantee that he will be looked upon as a true citizen of the State.  I do not think the majority of the Government Deputies realise that workers, particularly agricultural workers, are citizens at all.  One would think from the treatment that has been meted out to them that they are foreigners&mdash; Italians who came over with organs. <Col N="1637" /> They are deprived of insurance benefits and even deprived of the housing benefits given to other workers because they belong to the agricultural community. Surely it is necessary, if you expect them to give proper attention to their work, that they should be treated as ordinary citizens of the State?  I would appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to use his good influences with the Minister for Finance and his colleagues on the Ministerial Benches to have an Unemployment Insurance Bill introduced very soon or to float a loan immediately for the purpose of providing work for those who are willing and able to work but who cannot get it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>In this connection it is necessary for me to explain the position as to the operations of the different railway companies in Wexford prior to amalgamation.  At that time the Dublin South Eastern Railway Company was running into Wexford and had a station on the north side of the town.  On the south side the Great <Col N="1638" /> Southern Railway Company had their station, and between the two there was what might be described as a loop-line, a double line of rails extending along the whole length of the quay.  The particular area, where the rails were laid down belonged to the G.S. and W. Railway Company.  One line of rails was used as a siding.  It was immediately nearest to the quay side, and the G.S. and W. Railway Company made wagons available there in order that coals might be unloaded from ships into them, now that coal was being brought from Wexford town up the line to Ferns, Enniscorthy, or any places on the north side of the town.  It was the D.S.E. Railway Company that charged the freight and included in that freight was a charge they called haulage charge of 9d. per ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Wexford Harbour Commissioners during that period repeatedly made representations to the D.S.E. Railway Company to try to get that haulage charge withdrawn, because it militated against the best interests of the Port owing to the close proximity of Rosslare Harbour.  It was apparent then to the shipping interests in Wexford that the Great Southern and Western Railway were providing facilities in order that Rosslare might be developed as against Wexford.  Just immediately prior to the advent of amalgamation, representations were again made by the, Wexford Harbour Commissioners to try to have this haulage charge removed, and the Harbour Board was told then that when amalgamation was brought about that that charge would automatically disappear, that that was a transfer charge between the different railway companies operating in the town.  Since amalgamation representations have again been made with a view to getting this charge removed, but not alone was the charge continued, but the Harbour Commissioners cannot get an answer from the railway company, although they have written to them repeatedly since the agreement came about.  Coupled with that is the fact that the Great Southern and Western Railway Station at the south end of the quay has been done away with.  All the trains run right through now along the quay, not <Col N="1639" /> exactly through the middle of the town, but on the quay line, which extends the whole length of the town from north to south.</P>
    <P>Only four trains used to pass up and down there prior to the amalgamation, but Wexford is now faced with the spectacle of having seventeen trains running up and down at different times of the day.  The result is that it is almost impossible for ships to be unloaded at the Port.  The Harbour Board is protected under an Act called the Waterford and Wexford Railway Act of 1871.  Under Clause 10 it is set out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Board of Trade may, on the application of the Wexford Harbour Commissioners, make such orders with respect to the number of trains, engines and carriages which shall pass along that portion of the railway which will be situated on the quay at Wexford Harbour and with respect to the hours during which same shall so pass as said Board shall consider necessary for preventing obstruction or inconvenience to the trade at Wexford Harbour.  Such Order shall be binding on and fulfilled by the company and all other companies, bodies and persons using such railway.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it in this connection whatever powers the Board of Trade had have now been transfered to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I request that in the best interests of the trade of Wexford the Minister will immediately take up the matter with the railway company with a view to having a settlement brought about.  Coupled with that disadvantage, during the past fortnight the Great Southern Railway Company have given a special through rate from Rosslare to stations north of Wexford town.</P>
    <P>They have reduced the rate that did prevail up to a fortnight ago by 2/- a ton from Rosslare, and they have made no reduction whatever for shippers in the town of Wexford.  I consider, and it is apparent to everybody in Wexford, that that is doing something which will militate against the best interests of Wexford.  They are deliberately providing facilities which will develop <Col N="1640" /> Rosslare and they are giving an undue advantage to Rosslare over the port of Wexford.  It is mentioned in Section 30, sub-section (2), of the Railways Act that this is not permissible.  I can quite understand the Minister telling me that the proper procedure, if such a thing as that exists, is to apply to the Railway Tribunal.  I suppose I might as well forestall the Minister's answer.  I submit that when such a flagrant breach of the Railway Regulations takes place, it is for the Minister to interfere.  The Harbour Board have already written to the railway people in this connection and they cannot get them to answer.</P>
    <P>If we are to wait for six or twelve months, and this is permitted to go on, the best interests of the trade of Wexford town will be prejudiced to such an extent that the port will not be able to retrieve its position.  In consequence of this reduction of the through rates from Rosslare, a person who is in the habit of getting a steamer into Wexford Port, an Enniscorthy merchant, told a ship-broker there that for the future he could not see his way to have his coal brought into Wexford, and it was all because of the reduction conceded by the Great Southern Railways so far as Rosslare is concerned. The reduction enabled him to save £20 on 200 tons of coal.  I think the Minister will agree that this is a serious matter for the town of Wexford.</P>
    <P>There is great indignation there about it.  Rosslare Harbour is, of course, in my constituency, just the same as Wexford town.  I do not object to the rates being reduced at Rosslare, but I do say that when rates were reduced between Rosslare and Enniscorthy some reduction should have taken place on the Wexford side.  If the Minister has the power, I would ask him to intervene immediately. There is widespread indignation because of the action, or inaction, of the railway company.  If the Minister has not power directly to interfere, I would ask him to bring pressure on the Railway Tribunal with a view to remedying at once what I consider to be a very important matter.</P>

      <P>I cannot deal with it in a manner that will give satisfaction to Deputy Corish.  I told him yesterday that a complaint had been received within the last few days. It was stated that the conditions existing were sufficient to constitute an undue preference.  I told the Deputy that that matter was being carefully investigated. That was what I said to the Deputy yesterday, and he considered it unsatisfactory.  I cannot say any more to him to-day.  The matter is still being investigated.  You cannot expect to get, in a grave charge of this nature, satisfactory replies over the telephone from a railway company, nor can you expect to get from them within 48 hours their carefully considered reply to a matter which may, in the last resort, have to be brought before a Railway Tribunal or be the subject of legal proceedings.</P>
      <P>I am going now to add to the dissatisfaction of the Deputy by saying what I did not say yesterday&mdash;that it is not my business to take these things before the Railway Tribunal, and if Deputy Corish, with an appearance of indignation, asks is this to be allowed to drag on for six months and the trade and commerce of Wexford to be ruined, I say if those interested in the trade and commerce of Wexford allow it to drag on for six months, it would make me believe that the preference is not so clearly proved.</P>

It is for the aggrieved parties to do that, and if the Deputy reads the clause to which he himself referred me yesterday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is exaggerating.  I did not refer him to any clause yesterday.</P>

      <P>&mdash;making what I think he thought was an effort to get me out of the difficulty, alluded to Section 30 of the Railways Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>You will pardon me.  If you send for the Official Report you will find that it was not my suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to know is this: Supposing the Wexford Harbour Commissioners kept on making representations to the Railway Tribunal without effect, and supposing this kept on for two years without their case being heard, is there any machinery at the disposal of the Government to demand that they do hear this case which is such a flagrant breach, as far as can be seen, of the Railways Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time I have got it announced from the Deputy that the Harbour Commissioners have made representations to the Railway Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Minister three times to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>To the Railway Tribunal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>To the railway company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where the vital difference is.  If the Deputy cannot get a proper reply from the railway company his proper resort was to the Railway Tribunal, and they are bound to hear it.  I have no way of interfering in this matter until such time as proceedings are instituted.  Then I may appear, and I may have certain representations to make, because outside extra legal action may be taken by the Department, if we were sure of the facts, and the facts were before us to prove that there was a flagrant breach.  If we had those facts we might negotiate before proceedings were entered upon, and might take certain steps with the railway company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Minister the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Deputy states that there has been something which, in his mind, constitutes a flagrant breach of that clause of the Railways Act, and when I have not got yet, and cannot expect to have in the time, any reply on behalf of the railway company, surely I am not entitled on an <i>ex parte</i> statement made by Deputy Corish to intervene with the railway company.  I have intervened to the extent of asking them, and when I get their answer I can see what else may be done.  But let the Deputy take <Col N="1646" /> it from me that if the railway company like to stand on their rights and say, &ldquo;This is really not for you to concern yourself with,&rdquo; I have no answer.  The aggrieved parties have the right to go before the Railway Tribunal; it is within the aggrieved parties' power to go before the Railway Tribunal.  If the aggrieved parties feel that they are aggrieved, as Deputy Corish makes out, they can simply proceed to the Railway Tribunal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>But is it too much to ask that the Minister will follow up this case in the meantime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never refused to follow it up.  I said to the Deputy yesterday that the matter was being carefully investigated.  He considered that unsatisfactory, and had it raised here again.  We are proceeding&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>You will communicate with me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the Deputy's dissatisfaction we will proceed in the same way as before.  We will make our investigations and consider what we can do, but it will be extra legal action, and the interests for whom the Deputy speaks have their right under the Railways Act, and they can take proceedings under the Act.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.10 p.m. until 3 o'clock on Wednesday, 1st April.</P>
