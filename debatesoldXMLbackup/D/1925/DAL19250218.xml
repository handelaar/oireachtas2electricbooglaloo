      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the balance of the account due to Mr. J. Rooney, contractor, Balbriggan, for building six houses for the Town Commissioners of Balbriggan under the authority of the Local Government Board&mdash;which houses have been occupied by tenants for over three years&mdash;has been passed for payment, and, if so, if he can state how soon the contractor may expect to be paid.</P>

      <P>Payment of the contractor is a matter for the Town Commissioners, and presumably they propose to pay this balance out of the final <Col N="226" /> instalment of the loan for which they have applied.  I authorised in December last the issue of the final instalment on condition that the Commissioners paid the outstanding sum due by them in repayment of previous loan-advances, together with penal interest. The arrears of loan repayment have been received by the Office of Public Works, but the amount due on foot of penal interest is still awaited.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that two painters, named P. O'Mara and J. Robinson, who are registered in the Dublin Labour Exchange, were engaged by the Irish Lights Department, Dun Laoghaire, on June 3rd, 1924, to carry out the painting of the lighthouses at Larne Harbour, and Blackhead, Co. Antrim; that the wages earned were paid through the lightkeepers at the respective lighthouses, who affixed Northern Ireland stamps to their books and cards at the time of payment; that on the termination <Col N="228" /> of their engagement the men lodged their books at the Dublin Labour Exchange, where they were informed that no credit could be allowed for the stamps, valued £5 1s. 4d., affixed in Northern Ireland; whether, in this case, and in future cases of a similar character, he will see that steps will be taken to prevent loss of benefit to workmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that substantially the facts are as stated in the question.  Under the Unemployment Insurance Acts contributions are only payable in the Free State in respect of employment in the Free State.  As Messrs. P. O'Mara and J. Robinson were not employed in the Free State for the period in question, contributions were not payable for them, and if paid could not have been accepted for benefit in the Free State.  The contributions paid for these men in Northern Ireland appear to have been properly paid under the Unemployment Insurance Acts in force in Northern Ireland, where they would be entitled to benefit. The case is one which could be provided for in reciprocal arrangements, but as the Deputy is aware, I have not been able to obtain the agreement of the Government of Northern Ireland to any such arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVID HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that nine men viz., John McNally, Patrick McKenna, John McCabe, James McCabe, James MulCronin, Patrick McCabe, James Mulvey, senior, Thomas White, and Thomas Mulvey, all of the Aghanacliffe and Rathmore districts, County Longford, were discharged from employment by the Longford County Council some four weeks ago; that those men, having travelled ten miles to the County Council Offices in Longford, were there informed that their unemployment cards were not ready, and that the cards have not since been given to those men; further, that those men were informed at the Exchange Office, Longford, that claims for benefit would have to be <Col N="229" /> made through the Athlone Branch, forty miles distant; whether he will state if such claims have to be made through Athlone, and if he will see that the cards in question are furnished without delay and claims dealt with in Longford, and that those men are compensated for any loss of benefit and out-of-pocket expenses they have sustained through the failure of the Council to deliver the cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a condition precedent to the receipt of Unemployment Insurance Benefit that, normally, claimants should attend personally and lodge formal claims at a local office of the Department.  In certain cases, where there are special difficulties which render personal attendance particularly difficult or inadvisable, personal attendance may be excused and formal claims accepted through the post.</P>
      <P>In this case, the local office at which the men would attend or otherwise make their claims is situated at Longford. They have not attended at nor otherwise communicated with that Office and I cannot find that they have been informed by any officer of my Department that their claims would have to be made through the Athlone Exchange, as alleged in the question.</P>
      <P>If they are still unemployed and desire to claim benefit, they should communicate at once with the local Office of the Department in Longford, if it is not practicable for them to attend personally for that purpose.</P>
      <P>A communication has been addressed to the Longford County Council drawing attention to the Unemployment Insurance Regulations bearing on the stamping of Unemployment Insurance Books, and their delivery to discharged workers on the termination of their employment. Under the provisions of Section 24 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, insured contributors who have lost benefit as the result of an employer's failure to comply with these regulations, may recover as a civil debt from the employer concerned an amount equal to the benefit which they have so lost.</P>

      <P>I have received a claim for £25 from Mr. Bolger.  He states that the gun was bought in March, 1909, but is unable to produce documentary evidence as to its purchase.  An <i>ex gratia</i> award of £15 was made on the 3rd instant, but he has refused this sum.  In view of the facts that the gun was thirteen years old when handed over to the military, and that there is no documentary evidence as to its cost price, it is not proposed to increase the award.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether persons claiming under the Army Pensions Act, 1923, as dependents of deceased Volunteers are required to state on their application forms the amounts received by them from the National Aid, White Cross, and similar funds; whether the amounts so admitted by the claimants are taken into consideration by the Army Pensions Board, and, if so, if he can state what section of the Act authorises the Board to take cognisance of these grants, having regard to the fact that they are not made from Government funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons claiming under the Army Pensions Act, 1923, in respect of deceased Volunteers are required to furnish particulars of allowances received from the funds mentioned. No reference is made in the Act to such sums, but the fact that they were made out of quasi-public funds is material to the question of dependency, and, therefore, to the power of the Minister for Defence to make a grant under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allowances, which in many cases are in excess of the rates laid down in the Act, are reasonably taken into consideration <Col N="231" /> in fixing the dates from which pensions should be payable.  The Minister has discretion under Sections 7 (2) and 8 (2) in this connection.  At the same time, the White Cross authorities are notified of grants made under the Act, with a view to their ceasing the issue of allowances from their funds.</P>

      <P>With reference to these motions, I must appeal to you, A Chinn Comhairle, as guardian and protector of the rights of private members, because I feel that these motions raise a very delicate question and complicated points not, perhaps, of Constitutional procedure but of Parliamentary morality.  On the 20th February of last year the President made a statement here dealing with a motion for the issue of a writ.  On that occasion, I think Deputy Johnson moved an amendment to the motion for issue of a writ.  The President claimed for the party to which the deceased or resigned Member belonged, the right to move at their convenience for a new writ.  The President stated then that the matter would have to be settled once and for all, and that the practice in another place was to reserve to the Party to which the deceased or resigned member belonged the right of moving for the writ.  He said that that right, which existed in another place, should be even stronger here in the particular circumstances of the country.  Since that time this principle, which was then voted upon and accepted by practically two to one of the Members voting in the Dáil, has not only been acted upon but it has been, in the opinion of many members, strained, if not abused.  The question arises as to why Deputy Dolan should move for these writs on this occasion. Is it claimed that the Members who resigned were Members of his Party?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance have both repeatedly stated that these Members belonged to a separate and distinct Party.  Consequently, they could not possibly belong to the Party to which Deputy Dolan belongs.  It may be suggested, as has been suggested in the Press, that Deputy Dolan takes his stand on the point that these Deputies were elected as members of the Party to which he belongs, and that it does not matter what Party they belonged to at the time of their resignation.  That is a new principle. I do not think it is a sound principle. Let us suppose, say, that Deputy Beamish were to die, which God forbid. I have no doubt that Deputy Dolan would consider himself entitled to move for the writ.  Yet Deputy Beamish was not elected as a Member of that Party.  He subsequently changed his Party.  Some Ministers may deny, for instance&mdash;and I am sure several Ministers deny&mdash;that I am a Member of their Party.  Yet, when I die they will enthusiastically claim me as a Member of their Party and move for the writ, on the principle that dead men tell no tales or <i>de mortuis nil nisi bonum.</i>  At any rate, I must protest against the moving of these writs seeing that you, sir, are the protector of National or other groups.  I must protest against what I consider to be the poaching proclivities of Deputy Dolan, though I do not say that I will force a Division.</P>

      <P>I would like to prevent the President claiming rights in this matter which the Dáil might be compened to dispute.  I maintain&mdash;and I put in this claim in the beginning&mdash; that it is the right of any Deputy to move for the issue of any Writ where there is a vacancy of any kind, but it <Col N="241" /> is the right also of the majority of the Dáil to refuse that motion.</P>
      <P>I want to raise another question. That is, as to whether any authority from the Ministry or any Department of the Ministry has been given, or will be given, to suggestions that public works, such as the Shannon scheme, drainage schemes, or other such works, will not be carried on unless the Government get a majority in these bye-elections; whether the Publicity Department of the Department of External Affairs has anything to say to the newspapers in respect of those elections and in respect of the Government programme and policy, touching these elections; or whether the Government, as a Government, will recognise that they are not a party while a Government&mdash;that they will refrain from using the privileges of the Ministry for pushing the fortunes of a political party.</P>

      <P>I suppose I had better deal, first, with what has been stated by Deputy Esmonde.  If Deputy Esmonde will look up what I said in February he will see, if my recollection serves me correctly, that I went deeper into the matter than simply to say that the vacancy which then occurred was a vacancy which belonged to one particular political party.  I believe I went further than that, although I have not been able to find much agreement amongst my own friends of the political party to which I belong, nor, I think, can I claim Deputy Johnson as a supporter of the principle.  I think I dealt with the merits of proportional representation, with the fact that the person who had been elected was elected by a system of proportional representation, which gives various parties and orders in the community representation.  To my mind, although I may not have succeeded yet in making converts to my way of thinking, there is no real meaning of proportional representation other than the voucher which is got from the electorate at the time of the general election. The Deputy instanced one particular member of one political party here.  I could instance others.  The members of the Independent Party, if they resigned, might not be replaced by persons who <Col N="242" /> would voice the opinion of the order who sent the Independent members here.</P>

      <P>As a rule, the party to which the Deputy belongs is not a disorderly one.  It is, perhaps, a misfortune for one political party that they should be the only party to suffer through the death or resignation of persons who were elected at the General Election to support the policy that has been propounded by the Cumann-na-Gaedheal.  That is unfortunate in this connection, that it falls upon that Party entirely to fight all the elections.  If it had occurred on the opposite side&mdash;if in my own constituency the Labour member resigned, is it likely that the last person on the list elected on the proportional representation system, where there were five seats, or a person espousing the same cause&mdash;granted the same volume of opinion&mdash;would be elected at an election for a single member?  No, it is not.  Deputies know that.  The best possible illustration that could be given of proportional representation is by colours.  White, I suppose, would represent the real minority amongst the colours.  If white retires, it is not so easy to get that particular shade of colour again.  Deputy Johnson did not agree with me some time ago, but I think if a member of his party resigned that he would probably say there was a good deal in what I said at the time. To that extent, I think, the case of Deputy Esmonde is met.  The Writs are being moved for by the Party that secured the election of the retired members at the General Election.  I do not think it was because the Deputy might not, perhaps, be able to find a seconder. I am sure it was not on that ground&mdash;to relieve him of a difficulty in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the other question raised by Deputy Johnson.  I was not aware until the elections came along that it was necessary to state a great many <Col N="243" /> of the things that have appeared or that have been published since: that a great many good works have been accomplished, that there are a number of still greater works, but that the real results could only be achieved if the electorate were fully aware of the great works that have been done, and were conscious of the possibility of much greater works to come.</P>

      <P>Deputies are presumably aware that a Supreme Court was appointed during the period of the struggle with the British.  The members of that Court were appointed for life at a certain rate of salary.  Like other Courts which existed at that time, that Court is gone, and the Judiciary in the country is the Judiciary set up by the Courts of Justice Act.  The judges who officiated under the British have had pensions awarded them on very generous terms.  It is felt that the judges of the Dáil Eireann Supreme Court, who were asked to accept the appointments for life, and who did work which involved them in very considerable <Col N="244" /> personal risks at the time, should not be treated in a way that would compare very badly with the way in which we were obliged to treat the judges who acted for the British Government.</P>
      <P>There were four judges in that Supreme Court.  One of them is now a judge of the High Court.  Another is at present the Judge-Advocate-General. There remain only two judges who seem likely to be awarded pensions under the Bill.  I think that there is a matter of public faith involved, and there is a question of the whole principle of continuity which we have been careful to preserve.  We cannot simply repudiate that court and repudiate the bargain that was made when these men were taken on.  The years of service that they had were short, but it must be recognised that they were years of considerable stress, and that the men who did good service in these years took risks that cannot well be estimated&mdash;risks beyond any comparison with those that a judge would ordinarily take.  The amount of money involved is a very small amount and I think that the bargain which was properly entered into with these men should be carried out in a reasonable way by the present Government.</P>

      <P>The Minister has told us a good deal, but he has not told us one thing.  I do not want to oppose for a moment his argument that these gentlemen who acted as judges should be provided for.  I should like to know, first of all, the total annual expenditure which will be involved and, secondly, what is the age of these gentlemen to whom we are giving pensions for life.  If they are comparatively young men, say, under forty years of age, it would, in my opinion, be a much better bargain for the State to pay a lump sum, say, ten or fifteen years as compensation for the interruption of their career at the Bar, and we should give them ample opportunity of restoring that career rather than placing on the shoulders of the taxpayers a burden they may have to bear for thirty or more years.  I am inclined to think that the principle of lump sum compensation is, on the <Col N="245" /> whole, preferable to a pension, and I would ask the Minister to tell us why that particular course was not taken.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask your ruling, sir, on a point of order involved in the consideration of this Bill.  The basis of the Bill is Section I., which refers to the Dáil Supreme Court which was constituted under a decree made in the year 1920 by the Minister for Home Affairs, purporting to act under the authority of the First Dáil Eireann.  There is not, at present, accessible to Deputies who have to consider this Bill, Acts or decrees of the First Dáil.  If these volumes and documents are not accessible, I submit that it is not possible for us to consider legislation based on these Acts and decrees.  I would like to ask your ruling whether it is competent for the Dáil to continue discussion on this Bill in view of the inaccessibility of these documents.</P>

      <P>The matter is not one for me to make a ruling upon.  I do not think that the documents to which Deputy Johnson refers are inaccessible.  I think they could be made available, but the question, whether the Dáil will or will not proceed to consider the Bill, in view of the absence of certain documents, is one for the Dáil and not one for a ruling from the Chair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true that the proceedings have been circulated and published, but they are not accessible to Members of the Dáil, in the Dáil official building.  They are not in the same position, for instance, as British statutes are.  I think it is not correct to say that the decrees issued under the authority of the Dáil are accessible to Members.  Perhaps, however, <Col N="246" /> having drawn attention to this failure, it may be remedied before we come to the Committee Stage.  I happen to have had access to the two documents mentioned in Section I.  In the report of the proceedings of Dáil Eireann of, I think, 1919&mdash;it is not easy to see from this volume what the date was&mdash;there is a report of a motion moved by the Minister for Home Affairs.  Paragraph 1 is to the effect that the establishment of Courts of Justice and Equity be decreed.  Paragraph 2 says that Ministers shall be empowered, when they deem fit, to establish Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction. After some discussion these motions were put and carried.  Acting under that authority, the Minister for Home Affairs issued rules and forms to parish and district courts, and I assume that it is this authority which is referred to in Section I., which speaks of a decree made in 1920.  It is a provisional constitution of the Courts of Justice of the Irish Republic. Paragraph 4 states that judges of the Supreme Court and Circuit Courts shall hold office for life and shall be removable only by special decree of Dáil Eireann, for cause assigned, passed by a two-thirds majority.  This Bill only proposes to fulfil the obligation the Minister speaks of in respect to judges of the Supreme Court.  Are we to understand that a new Bill will be brought forward with the same import to provide pensions for judges of the Circuit Courts, who were also appointed, apparently, to hold office for life, and are removable only by special decree for cause assigned, passed by two thirds majority?  Deputy Cooper might have further reason to ask what amount was involved in this Bill if he refers to the same decree.  It speaks of judges of the Supreme Court and of Circuit Judges who hold office for life.  Then we have a definition of what is a Circuit Judge and what is a Supreme Court Judge.  A Circuit Judge shall mean a person to be appointed as such by Dáil Eireann and shall include a substitute temporarily appointed.  The Supreme Court Judge shall mean a person appointed as member of the Supreme Court and shall include a Circuit Judge <Col N="247" /> or a member of the Land Commission, requested to act as member of such court by the President of such court.</P>
      <P>Are we keeping our obligation, of which the Minister speaks, by confining this Bill to Judges of the Supreme Court?  If we are bound by the principle of continuity, and if we are to take, as the basis of appointment, this decree, we are bound also equally to make pensionable the other regular judges of the Supreme Court and Circuit Courts plus any temporary judges, since, by definition, they are also judges of the Supreme and Circuit Courts. Whatever may be the purpose of passing this Bill we are leaving ourselves liable to the charge that we are breaking faith with other judges not mentioned in this Bill.  I would like to know whether it is the view of the Ministry that this decree is to be reckoned by the Dáil as equal to a statute, and that, therefore, we are statutorily bound to maintain these judges, either of Circuit Courts or of the Supreme Court, as judges for life, removable only by special decree, for cause assigned, passed by two-thirds majority of the Dáil.  If we are going to base this legislation upon the bond which is presumed to have been entered into, and which the Minister refers to as practically a bond of public faith, then we are taking the responsibility for saying that these decrees are recognised by us as law.  Why, then, are these judges not acting at present?  Two of them are acting in one or other public capacity of a legal nature, and two of them, presumably, are not.  What about the others?  What about the Circuit Judges who were appointed for life? Are they acting?  If not, have they been dismissed, and, if it is not necessary to dismiss them, why is it necessary to pension them?  The Minister says that these judges are appointed at a certain rate of salary.  The Bill provides that the pension shall be payable to them from the last payment on account of salary.  Will the Minister tell us what was the rate of salary paid to the other judges beside those mentioned?  £700 per annum has been mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that when the courts over which they were appointed were caused by an Act of the Dáil to cease&mdash;I think it was decided by a resolution of the Provisional Government that the courts to which these judges were appointed should no longer act&mdash;the judges appointed under that Act also ceased to act?  I am afraid we are bound to a good deal more than is contained in this Bill, if we are to accept the principle involved in the Minister's argument.  These were judges appointed by the national authority at the time.  If the principle of continuity is to be recognised, as the Minister claims, then we are bound to consider these judges&mdash;Circuit Judges as well as Supreme Court Judges&mdash;as judges appointed for life at a salary.  There has yet been no mention made of the terms of the appointments, whether they were pensionable appointments after a certain number of years' service.  We have been told that the appointments were for life at a salary of £750 a year.  I submit that we are bound either to accept the whole of these decrees as the law in the matter at that time until altered, or we are not bound by any part of them.  Therefore, we are not bound, as a matter of public obligation, to pay pensions to these judges.  If we are bound to pay pensions to any of the judges we are bound to pay pensions to all of them. I imagine that it would have been quite reasonable to have kept faith with these judges and to have continued them in the public service without bringing forward a special Bill, which presumably is only going to apply to two persons.  If a Bill is necessary I would suggest that it should be made specific in reference to these two persons and that we should know exactly to whom the Bill applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt it is true that during the period of service of these judges, they ran very great risks.  So, too, did the judges of the Circuit Courts, and so, too, did the judges of the District and Parish Courts; and very many other people besides these judges ran very great risks.  I cannot but feel that the whole story about this Bill has not been disclosed, and that there must be other reasons which the Minister has not <Col N="249" /> hinted at, even&mdash;apart from those which he has touched upon&mdash;which seem to require that such a Bill as this should be brought before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I think, until a full statement of the position is given, and an explanation is made as to why this should be confined to judges of the Supreme Court, the Dáil should not be satisfied.  If a salary were part of the obligation, we are bound equally in respect to judges of the Circuit Courts, to keep them in office for life or only to remove them by special decree of the Dáil for cause assigned, passed by a two-thirds majority. I ask the Dáil not to give a Second Reading to the Bill unless we can have a very clear explanation as to the reason for separating the judges of the Supreme Court and offering them pensions for life of two-thirds salary in the circumstances which I have outlined.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson has suggested that the whole story has not been told about this Bill.  There was almost the implication that something is being consciously kept in reserve or in the background.  I want to assure Deputy Johnson and other Deputies that is not the position.  Information may be somewhat incomplete.  That more or less arises from the circumstances of the time when this Bill had its origin and from the regrettable absence from the Dáil of the person who was then Minister for Home Affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  The Deputy wrings from me one admission, and that is that the judges of our Supreme Court at that time were essentially identical with the judges of our Circuit Court.  We had not then evolved to a position when we thought it necessary to make further judicial appointments than the persons indicated by the Minister for Finance when he moved this Bill.  There was rather an absence of aspirants for judicial honour in those days.  It may have been on that account, or it may have been that the work had not accumulated to render further appointments <Col N="250" /> necessary.  The fact is, there were no other appointments made than the persons for whom this Bill purports to provide; there were no other appointments for life on those terms.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept responsibility for the definition. There are two things to be considered: the resolution of the Dáil enabling the Minister to establish courts when and if he thought fit, and the decision of the Dáil Cabinet appointing certain persons to be judges for life at a particular salary.  The Deputy asks whether we consider that resolution and decision as statutory, or as binding as a statutory decision.  That, of course, would simply raise an academic and unreal discussion.  They were decisions of the Dáil, followed by decisions of the Dáil Cabinet.  They were scarcely statutes.  The circumstances of the time forbade legislation in the sense in which we understand it now.  There was no formal or full consideration of Bills, such as Deputy Johnson and other Deputies can have now in those more leisured times: but unquestionably the net result of those decisions is to constitute a binding and honourable obligation which was given in the name of, and on behalf of, the people to certain persons at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked why these persons are not acting.  One might as appropriately ask why certain other persons who held judicial capacity in those days are not acting now.  The courts of which they formed part have been disestablished. Another judicial system has been set up in the country.  New judicial appointments have been made.  It is not, as I pointed out on First Reading, that they have been removed; it is not that they have been dismissed.  The courts in which they functioned have ceased to exist by the wish of the Dáil and by the act of the Dáil, and another <Col N="251" /> court system has been established. Just as in the case of other persons who were judges, the question arises of making provision for those persons who were judges in a court system which has now been disestablished. The Minister, in moving the Second Reading, has pointed out that we entered into an obligation to make certain provision for the judges who functioned in courts under the British administration.  We considered it would be unwise and improper not to make similar provision for those who functioned in courts set up under the First Dáil as a part of the court system which is now non-existent.  We think it does involve the principle of continuity and it involves a question of public good faith.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not, I feel, fully explained why those judges who, in times of stress, carried on the good work, as it was called in those days&mdash;who upheld the banner of the Republic&mdash;have not had place made for them, having regard to the fact that a new judiciary was established.  If place had been made for them, the necessity for the State paying them a pension now could be avoided.  We understand some of the judges who held office under the British regime have been continued.  Here is a case of only four judges, two of whom are provided for.  It seems strange the other two were not also provided for.  If they were, the State would be saved another charge on its Central Fund, and we would be saved the time of passing a Bill in order to give those men a pension.  There should be some explanation why no provision was made for them.</P>

      <P>I would remind the Minister for Finance that he can save £2,200 to the county and city of Cork by not appointing a judge to replace the bankruptcy judge who has retired. He absented himself from duty for the last four years, and the work was carried on by his deputy.  I think his abstention has established how unnecessary it is to appoint another official. Fully £2,200 could be saved to the ratepayers, <Col N="252" /> who are crying out to us for economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to understand the unnecessary haste displayed in rushing through a Pension Bill which concerns only two individuals. It is all the more difficult when we observe there is a great deal of reluctance on the part of the same Minister to bring forward a Bill, which he promised a long time ago, to provide pensions for the dependents of those who lost their lives defending the State. I have been told&mdash;my information may be wrong&mdash;that one of the individuals this Bill concerns, who would be entitled to a pension if he looked for one, is a very disobedient citizen of the Government. I cannot conceive a man who does not recognise the present Government looking for a pension from the State.  I would like to know if that is the actual position regarding one of the two individuals concerned, and what is the attitude of the Ministry going to be if such individual makes a formal application for a pension.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister who wields the sledge-hammer so far as finance is concerned, should offer to the men who risked their lives under exceptional circumstances&mdash;qualified men, I am sure&mdash; positions under the Government.  He might have saved the money that has been spent in the printing of a document like this Bill, which deals with such a small number of persons.</P>
      <P>Not many months ago I spoke in favour of paying pensions to people who risked their lives and lost their jobs defending the State.  They have not jobs even yet to go into.  I was told in a callous manner by the Minister for Justice that many of those people were lucky they did not get 6 feet by 2½ feet. I wonder if his mind travels in the same direction with regard to the individuals he is now pleading for, or is his argument in favour of paying pensions to people who are professional men&mdash;and who ought, if they are qualified, to have a practice at the Bar today&mdash;simply because they are belonging to a professional class?  He is, if he proceeds on that line, advocating pensions on a class basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance really based his whole case for this Bill on <Col N="253" /> the statement that these men's services to the State cannot be well estimated. Surely, the service given by the men who lost their lives, or risked their lives, in defending the State, should be entitled to greater consideration?</P>
    <P>I think it speaks badly for the Minister, who is holding up at the present time a Bill that should have passed through this House, that he should ask the Dáil now to pass a pension Bill for one or two individuals who are in the prime of life, while we have, as many Deputies know, the widows and children of men who lost their lives in the service of the State starving or depending on charitable institutions.  I think that is not a state of affairs that can be commended to the Minister.  In other Bills that were brought before this House the basis of pension, so far as the mind of the Ministry went, was that no man, particularly in the case of the Local Government Bill and the Railways Act, was entitled to a pension unless he had ten years' actual service. If he had ten years, or over, of actual service, so many years were added for pensionable purposes.</P>
    <P>I assume that the actual service of the individuals who are likely to be concerned with the passing of this Bill does not exceed two, three or four years, perhaps two years.  Clause 2 of the Bill states:&mdash;&ldquo;(1) The Minister for Justice may, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, grant to any person who held office as a judge of the Dáil Supreme Court a pension for life at such rate as the Minister for Justice shall, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, think proper....&rdquo;  I wonder what is in the minds of the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance as to what is a proper pension for a person with two years' actual service in these circumstances.  I think we are entitled to know whether it is the intention of the Minister to give two-thirds of the salary which was given for a life position, as a pension to people who will still have their practice at the Bar and who should be eligible for positions under the Free State Government as Circuit Court or Supreme Judges.  If these individuals were qualified and willing at a particular time, at great risk, as the Minister <Col N="254" /> stated, to undertake these duties, surely they are equally willing and should be as well qualified to take positions under the Free State Government that they, perhaps, more than anybody else, helped to set up.  I think the whole principle of the Bill is bad, and I think the Minister, if we are to rely on the statement he made on moving the Second Reading, has not justified the Bill so far as the Dáil is concerned.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question.  I would like to know from the Minister whether his attention has been called to a statement which appeared in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; on February 7th, a statement supposed to have been made by Judge MacElligott at Kilrush.  County Clare, in regard to the Republican Courts. Judge MacElligott stated he had never attended Republican Courts, would not recognise them, and would not admit as evidence any document purporting to come from them.  I would like to know from the Minister whether his attention has been called to that, and if so, whether he has taken any steps to find out if it is correct, and, if the Judge is correctly reported, whether he proposes to take any steps to deal with the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention was called to the extract which the Deputy has read from the &ldquo;Irish Times.&rdquo;  I took no steps in the matter.  I do not intend to take any steps in the matter, simply because I do not consider that it is within my power or province to take any steps in the matter, regardless of what I may think personally of the utterance, assuming the utterance to be correct.  The judges, once they are appointed, are independent of the Executive. I have no power over them.  I have no responsibility for them.  They are subject only to the law and to the Constitution.  Therefore, although my attention was drawn to that particular paragraph in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; of the 7th inst., I took no steps in the matter, nor have I any intention to take any steps whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister answered that question before I rose to speak, because it more or <Col N="255" /> less amplifies what he said earlier, when he told us that the decrees appointing these judges will hardly be regarded as binding as a bond.  Therefore, the only bond that is upon us in dealing with these judges is a bond of honour. I was glad, also, and indeed it was refreshing to hear the Minister for Finance say such things as these: &ldquo;We cannot repudiate a bargain.  The years were short, but they were years of stress.  They took risks which cannot be estimated.&rdquo;  These are things that were very refreshing to hear the Minister for Finance say.</P>
      <P>But I wonder if anybody else besides these judges had years of stress and took risks which could not be estimated, and if any other people are more in need after the stress of these years and the risks which they ran, than these two judges at the present time.  For the men who, to use the phrase we hear very often now, pressed the button for revolution and who went out in the wilderness, to use another phrase, and who made it possible for these judges to function, and for the dependents of these men, we have been told there is a Bill hatching.  Yet it has not been brought here.  Who did the most work for the country, or who are in the most need of recompense from the nation?  I am referring in particular to the Army Pensions Bill which we have been promised.  Are the two judges referred to more in need of pensions than the widows and children of those men who made it possible for those judges to function?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one thing that this Bill brings home clearly to every thinking member of this Assembly is that there are in this country, undoubtedly, privileged patriots, and that these judges belong to the privileged patriots. The sooner we get rid of the idea of privileged patriotism the better it will be for the nation.  The case has been thrashed out very minutely and very generally.  I only rose to call the Minister's attention to the specific case of the men who made it possible for those judges to function, the men who ran the risks.  The risks which the judges ran were not in any way comparable with the risks that <Col N="256" /> these men ran, and yet these men and their dependents are trying to eke out an existence for themselves.</P>

      <P>Might I remind the Minister that certain information has been asked from him in connection with this Bill that he has not supplied.  I think it would be necessary that that information should be given before a vote is taken on this Bill.  It was asked, first of all, by one Deputy, what is the length of service of the two persons referred to; also what are their ages, and it has been asked from practically all parts of the House if the claim of the two particular persons were not considered when the judiciary were being reappointed under the Courts of Justice Act.  These are questions that ought to be answered by the Minister. The Minister and the Executive Council are aware that complaints are being made daily all over the country against the burden that is placed on the taxpayer by the long list of pensions that the taxpayer is called upon to pay. Before we add to that burden, the information asked for ought to be given and, as far as I am concerned, if the information asked for is not satisfactorily given I am personally going to vote against this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been references to the Army Pensions Act and the fact that an amending Army Pensions Bill has not been introduced.  I would just wish to say in regard to that that the Army Pensions Bill might involve very large sums of money and that it must get an amount of consideration, and consideration extending over a length of time, that would not be necessary in a case of this Bill which does not involve any large sum of money.  I myself have no particular interest in the gentlemen who are going to get the pension.  I would rather see them not getting it, if I was only consulting personal feelings in the matter. But I do think that there is a definite principle involved, and that we cannot simply deal with matters on the lines of personal feelings.  I think that this matter of the preservation of continuity is important in the present and may be important in the future.  There might spring consequences from a <Col N="257" /> failure to recognise continuity which would be serious enough.  Of the two persons who are likely to get pensions under this Bill one is aged 53, the other is aged 47.  It is considered that in the case of men of such years pensions should be paid rather than any lump sum.  These men were considered when the new judiciary were being appointed, just as other judges were considered who would have had to be paid pensions if they were not appointed to the new judiciary.  What we had got to do was to make our new judiciary as good as possible and having, at the same time, all reasonable regard to the desirability of having no pensions paid to men who could do work.  I do not want to go into any sort of personal discussion about anybody.  I can only assure the Dáil that there was careful consideration given to the question of the appointment of these men when the new judiciary was being selected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of pensions simply arises in this, that we acknowledge a substantial obligation. Circumstances have very much changed since these men were appointed judges.  We could not be expected to continue to pay their full salaries when they were doing no work. We do not feel obliged just to continue their employment and to pay them in precisely the same way as if there had been no change in circumstances. We recognise that we undertook an obligation towards them to employ them for life at a specific salary for doing work for us.  If they are no longer being employed, we feel that compensation is definitely due to them for our departure from the conditions under which they entered employment. It is simply a matter of substantially doing what we feel it is due should be done.  The same matter arose in the case of the R.I.C. pensioners.  We did not do exactly all they claimed.  We did what we thought was substantial justice to those men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is this difference between the R.I.C. who are being paid pensions and these judges, that the R.I.C. who resigned <Col N="258" /> left a dangerous job.  The judges took on a dangerous job.</P>

They were asked to accept those positions and they accepted them.  We have abolished the offices to which they were appointed, and we feel that compensation should be given to them, that the power of the State should not be used simply to throw them out and to say that the bargain is a nullity and that we repudiate it.  We feel that there is a principle involved&mdash;that when the State enters into a bargain with individuals, if it does not keep that bargain or varies it, reasonable compensation should be paid to the parties concerned. The equity in such a bargain should be recognised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of this Bill.  The necessity for this Bill arises from the fact that as a consequence of recent legislation it is not now possible to appoint, in accordance with statutory requirements, visiting committees for ordinary prisons or boards of visitors for convict prisons.  Members of these bodies were required to be Justices of the Peace, and in the case of visiting committees the power of appointment lay (except in a few cases) with the grand juries who will not again be summoned to meet.</P>
      <P>Before the passing of the General Prisons (Ireland) Act, 1877, the prisons in Ireland consisted of two distinct classes, i.e., (1) county and borough gaols in which prisoners awaiting trial or undergoing sentences of imprisonment were detained, and (2) convict prisons in which prisoners sentenced to penal servitude were detained.  The county and borough goals were under the control of local boards of superintendence appointed by the grand juries except in the city of Dublin where the board of superintendence was appointed by the town council.  The expenses of these local prisons were defrayed by presentments levied by the grand juries (or town council in Dublin). The Act of 1877 transferred the control of these prisons to the General Prisons Board, and the State took over the responsibility of providing money for their maintenance.  The power of appointing visiting committees for such prisons was left with the grand juries (except in the case of Dublin city&mdash;and afterwards Waterford, Limerick and Cork, where a right of nomination was conferred on the town councils).  Subsequently when many of the county prisons were closed, joint visiting committees were appointed by the grand juries of the countries served by each of the remaining prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time Orders in Council were made by the Lord Lieutenant determining the constitution of visiting committees, regard being had to the area served by each prison.  Thus the visiting committee for Dundalk prison (which served County Louth and County Cavan) was composed of nine members, eight of whom were nominated by the grand jury for County Louth and one by the grand jury for County Cavan.  The visiting committee <Col N="263" /> for Mountjoy consisted of eighteen members, four of whom were nominated by the grand jury, County Dublin; one by the grand jury, County Kildare; two by the grand jury, County Meath; one by the grand jury, County Wicklow; two by the grand jury, County West-meath; and eight by the Dublin Borough Council.  The Local Government Act, 1898, expressly reserved to grand juries their powers of nominating members of visiting committees.</P>
    <P>As regards convict prisons (such as Portlaoighaise and Mountjoy convict prisons), no visiting committees could be appointed for them, and it was not until the year 1908 that statutory authority was given for the creation of boards of visitors for convict prisons in Ireland.  The power of appointment rested with the Lord Lieutenant.  The grand juries or borough council had no voice in the selection.</P>
    <P>The present Bill proposes to repeal the existing statutory provisions for the appointment of visiting committees and boards of visitors, and to authorise the Minister for Justice (1) to appoint a visiting committee consisting of from six to twelve responsible persons for each prison (whether convict or non-convict); and (2) by rules to prescribe the powers and duties of such committees.</P>

      <P>I would like to express a view in regard to this Bill, and it is this: it is not intended to continue the idea embodied in the previous Acts relating to visiting committees, or visitors to prisons.  The Minister is in the position of a prison governor, if you like, over all the prisons.  It is in his charge the prisoners are, and the principle involved in this is that the prisoners themselves and their welfare should be, to some extent at least, safeguarded against possible wrongdoing by the Minister.  Therefore, the practice in the past was to appoint representatives of the civil population outside the Minister, who is the chief gaoler.  I say that without offence. Now the proposition is that the persons who are to act on behalf of the public to safeguard the interests of the prisoners <Col N="264" /> against possible wrongdoing by the Minister or his subordinates are to be appointed by the person whose actions are to be checked, that is to say, the Minister.  It seems to me it is a wrong principle, and that there ought to be embodied in some way the idea that the persons who are to be appointed as visitors should represent or be nominated by some authority, not a Government authority.  The whole principle is one of checking possible malpractices on the part of the Minister or his servants, and, if anything of that kind is necessary, the persons nominated for that function should be nominated by some public authority outside the Ministry.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has put a point of view.  It is simply a question of whether it is at all accurate to regard the persons appointed to act as visitors to prisons as the emanations of the Minister.  I certainly do not hold that view, or do not hold that the persons so appointed do not adequately represent the general public.  It is not so much a question of representation for the prisoners or their relatives as representation for the general public, to see that the prison system is conducted humanely and as they would wish it.  Persons have been appointed through the country to act as visitors to the authorised prisons and reports have been received from them which have been uniformly satisfactory.  I cannot just appreciate the objection that there is to this process of responsible citizens, resident conveniently near to the prisons, being appointed by the Minister to act as visitors and to make such representations to him as they may think fit, from time to time, as the result of their visits and their observation on their visits.  I doubt whether there is any serious objection that could reasonably be urged against such a course, and I simply put it to the Dáil that there is not much substance in the objection urged by the Deputy.  If there is, we could consider the matter at a later stage.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of the Defence Forces Temporary Provisions Bill, 1925, and in doing so I think it will be unnecessary for me to say very much, because there are very few provisions in the Bill which have not been included in the two Bills previously passed, carrying on the Defence Forces Act, 1923.  The only changes that are proposed are some very slight amendments.  There is, for instance, an amendment dealing with the wearing of military decorations, and there is an amendment which increases the amount to be paid by a recruit who wants to get out of the Army within three months from £10 to £25.  There are a few disciplinary changes which are found to be necessary. If the principal Act goes through before the 31st March, 1926, the operation of these amendments will cease. So far as the present Bill is concerned, it is on all fours with the measures previously passed on two occasions by the Dáil, and if any question arises in regard to it I shall be happy to answer them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity which the Second Reading affords to raise a question which I raised rather obliquely a week or two ago.  It is with regard to the powers which the Minister has exercised, or which the officers of the Headquarters Staff of the Army have exercised, or attempted to exercise, in regard to the uniform worn for dress purposes.  I have had it represented to me that an attempt has been made to impose on officers of all ranks that they are bound under pain of displeasure, if not anything worse, to appear only at mess or festive occasions in a particular dress uniform.  The attempt to impose this obligation on officers has aroused a considerable amount of dissatisfaction and discontent which was abated only by an assurance that attempts were being made, and would likely be successful, so that the Ministry would pay for them.  A particular design of uniform was provided, and I understand that the cost of the <Col N="266" /> uniform which the young officers were expected to wear was round about £25 or £27 per rig.  It seems to me, if within the provisions of this Bill it is to be the Minister's prerogative to order that officers shall wear certain uniforms of a particular lavish and fancy kind&mdash;reminiscent of the old days of armies being officered by scions of the aristocracy, young bloods with money to throw about&mdash;and that these uniforms be paid for by the officers themselves, we would have a right to consider our position in regard to the Bill.  I would like to know whether the Headquarters Staff have any special authority, or whether the Minister's influence has been brought to bear on Headquarters Staff, not to impose the wearing of this uniform, otherwise the public might be led to imagine that officers of the Army are to follow this bad tradition of the past. It is known, and the Minister might explain it, that certain officers in the Army, and, perhaps, in other forces, have, as a matter of fact, appeared in particularly fancy costumes designed, no doubt, to attract the other sex, as such costumes are usually designed to do, and no doubt if they had been allowed their way in this matter we should have them walking the streets in a year or two in their undress uniform of an equally lavish kind.  I think it would be well that the Minister should assure the Dáil of what his policy in this matter is&mdash;whether it is intended that this dressed-up-doll idea of an army is to prevail in the country and why it should be looked upon as obligatory that officers on festive occasions, or at least officers who never have occasion to ride horses, are supposed to wear spurs, and whether in any proposal of the kind, even of a less lavish and extravagant character than that of which I have spoken, there is any intention to confine any uniform of that sort to materials procurable, if not made, in this country. I think the Minister will probably have heard the prices at which these uniforms have been quoted.  I understand that they have been beaten down to something in the neighbourhood of £22 or £23 per uniform, but if the officers concerned are inclined to be a <Col N="267" /> little more lavish than their neighbours they may sport a little more and go up to £30.  I may get into trouble with the tailoring trade by referring to this, but I think in the general interest it is well that we should discourage the proposition, whether from the Minister or from Headquarters Staff, that the Army of Saorstát Eireann should be of a character which requires that on dress occasions a rather lavish and fancy uniform procurable only at an expense of about £22 should be required. I hope the Minister will let it be known that he does not approve, if he does not approve, of this proposal, and that it will not come before us in any other form, whether as an expense out of Army finances or whether it comes before the Dáil as a complaint from junior officers that they have been obliged by moral pressure from superior officers to purchase such uniforms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Second Reading is the stage on which principles are discussed, yet Deputy Johnson has nothing better to talk about than uniforms.  There are just two or three points with regard to that that should be remembered.  The first is that this uniform is not worn on parade.  It is worn at dances for which the tickets cost a considerable amount of money, something like 30/- and, considering the menu provided at supper, I think it is worth it.  No officer is under compulsion to go to dances. At these dances the rule is laid down that only persons in evening dress are to be admitted.  Deputy Johnson says the pressure is put on young officers to make them wear that uniform.  If that is so, I agree that there should be no such pressure.  If officers voluntarily desire to provide themselves with evening <Col N="268" /> dress to show that they are officers and not civilians I cannot see how they are culpable.  The Minister will have to be careful, as I know from experience, to see that the thing is voluntary and that no officer is reported to him for not complying with the wishes of his superiors by refusing to provide such uniform.  With regard to Irish manufacture, if my opinion is correct, two Irish manufacturers of tweed were asked to quote for the material for this uniform and they stated that they did not want to do so.  It was only when the most suitable Irish manufacturers failed to quote that the material had to be got elsewhere.  My information about this matter is obtained from the tailoring trade.  There are more important things to discuss than dress on a Bill of this kind, and we are entitled to discuss the whole administration, conduct and control of the Army. Personally, I regret that the matter has come before us at this moment, as there are other important matters on the paper, and I do not want to take up the time of the Dáil unnecessarily.  There is, however, one matter which seems to be a question of urgency, and that is as to the number of guards which the soldiers of the Army are employed on. It is common knowledge to anybody who goes about Dublin that there are too many guards and that the men have too much guard duty to do.  There is nothing so sapping or demoralising to a soldier than to have continually for two hours to walk up and down carrying a heavy rifle, and nothing is more inclined to make him become a sort of Prussianised machine than the continual performance of this duty.  If the Minister will send an experienced officer round to see what guards are necessary he will find that he can reduce them by 50 per cent.  If my information is correct, every soldier in the Army has to do one day on and one day off guard duty.  In other armies it is considered criminal to put a man on guard more than one day in three, and if an officer did so he would be censured if he did not apply for re-inforcements. Here, around Leinster House, there are at least three unnecessary sentries.  We require a guard of armed men.  With a small guard at Government <Col N="269" /> Buildings, with one sentry post here, and also with the presence of military policemen at the gates, the Oireachtas would be well protected. You will never get a fighting spirit in an army by employing men too much on guard duty.  This is a matter of great importance, and I urge the Minister to look into it with as little delay as may be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to endorse the remarks made by Deputy Johnson with regard to this matter of military dress.  I think the Minister should take steps to prevent any kind of ostracism of officers who are not in a financial position to pay for the rather extravagant kind of uniform that has been referred to.  The Minister may not be aware of the fact, but, as far as I know, there is no army in the whole world, except the British Army, which has such a thing as a mess uniform. Continental armies have full dress uniform for ceremonial purposes, but they have not a mess uniform which would be used solely for dances and other social functions.  That is a peculiarity of the British army, and I do not see why it should be introduced into this country.  Certainly it is not suitable for the officers we have got at present, and it is calculated to produce amongst them a social distinction; there would be those who could afford to pay £20 or £30 for uniforms, and those who could not afford to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will do what he can to obviate what may develop into an unpleasant side to this question.  It is not, I suppose, possible to deal with general matters affecting the army on this Bill.  I had intended to oppose the Bill because I do resent that we should always be asked to pass temporary measures.  It is high time now, the State being in existence for several years, that there should be final and permanent organisation of the army. It is regrettable that we should be asked to pass a Bill postponing for another 12 months the final reorganisation of the army.  We recognise, of course, that the Minister has been in office only a few months, and he has not had time to make up his mind definitely as to what can permanently be done in regard to national defence. <Col N="270" /> In drawing up the final scheme, which I presume is being drawn up, I hope the Minister will keep in mind the Article of the Treaty which states that in a year or two years' time a conference will have to be held with the British Government with regard to Ireland taking over control of matters connected with her external defence. That, in my opinion, is the principal matter to be considered in any Bill affecting the army: the part which the army is to take in regard to national external defence is very important.  In drawing up the final scheme I hope the Minister will keep that Treaty Article in mind and that he will not relegate us to the position of a State taking no part in its own protection, but relying on a foreign power to protect it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Army Act comes to be considered as an Act for dealing with army matters in a permanent way, it will not be my intention to rely on any foreign power to defend this country, or to ask the aid of any foreign power to do so, because as far as the army is concerned, I think we should be in a position ourselves to defend the country against any aggressors, either foreign or domestic. The question raised by Deputy Johnson about the mess uniform is a matter entirely for the officers concerned.  I do not believe the officers asked for, or got, any permission in connection with those uniforms.  They did not ask permission from me, and there is no compulsion whatever on any officer to procure one.  As far as I am concerned, there will be no compulsion.  If some officers wish to appear on certain ceremonial occasions in a dress which they procure at their own expense, I do not think it would be in my province to prescribe what they should appear in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was a committee of the officers themselves considered the matter.  I am not sure.  I do not know whether the spurs add anything to the uniform or take anything from it.  Any officer who wishes to spend £20 or £25 on a uniform can <Col N="271" /> do so, but that uniform is not used as part of his army dress.  It is not used on parade or for any military purposes. It is used simply for mess purposes, or social functions.  As Minister for Defence, I do not think it comes within my scope to intervene.  No officer is obliged to spend £20 or £25 on a uniform unless he desires to do so.  As regards the matter of the guard raised by Deputy Cooper, the Army Council have been considering how they could relieve the pressure in that respect.</P>
      <P>I hold&mdash;and I am sure of my ground &mdash;that it would not be safe at the moment to take guards away from a number of posts in Dublin and other places.  It is the practice that whatever posts can be withdrawn with safety are withdrawn, and that condition of affairs will continue until we get to that stage when we can withdraw all these posts and have the men confined to barracks, where they will not have such heavy duty to perform.  These matters are all being attended to, and they will be attended to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am encouraged in moving this measure by a remark which Deputy Esmonde passed on the Bill we have just considered.  He says he resents temporary measures, and considers that it is high time we should have evolved to the stage of permanent legislation.  I agree with that remark. Temporary measures, emergency or occasional legislation, is to be avoided, where possible.  For the last two years the safety, peace, order and dignity of the State depended on legislation of a temporary character which has either now expired or will shortly expire.  The Public Safety Acts which were before the Dáil two years ago, and which were renewed by the Dáil, constitute practically the only statutory power the State had to defend itself against challenge. With the expiry of those Acts, the State simply places enemies, actual or potential, on the physical plain.  If it is struck at, it can strike back, and can hope to strike harder, but there is, as I say, with the expiry of those temporary Acts, only the physical plain on which to meet a challenge.</P>
      <P>I consider that an eminently undesirable state of affairs.  Every modern civilised State, as far as I know, equips itself with powers to meet a challenge at an earlier stage than when the matter would come to one of actual physical combat.  It reserves the right to note and deal with tendencies, and Governments ask for, and receive from, the Parliaments to which they are responsible, full powers to deal with the challenge of enemies, whether from within or without.  It has been represented to me that it is unwise to relinquish, at so early a stage in the growth and development of the State, certain of the temporary powers which the Public Safety Acts give.  The question of seeking from the Dáil a renewal for a further period of those Acts was urged upon me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have preferred not to take that course.  Unquestionably, certain of the powers that the Public Safety Acts gave the Executive were most valuable in preserving order and security, and some inconvenience will, no doubt, be <Col N="273" /> experienced from the lapsing of those Acts.  It was useful to have the power when there was a moral certainty that there was everything, short of legal proof, to intern persons without trial and detain them without trial.  And it is true that the release of some of those persons so detained has led, in places, to an outbreak of, and the renewal of, disorders in connection with which the persons were originally arrested and detained.  But you must sometimes make the experiment of doing without exceptional powers of that kind, and it was thought better, having regard to the conditions of comparative peace, at any rate, and security that prevailed through the country, not to come to the Dáil and seek a renewal of very exceptional legislation of that nature.  We come now with a set of provisions embodying what we consider ought to be the permanent powers of the Executive to deal with dangers, disorders and challenges whether actual in the present or potential in the future, affecting the peace, order and dignity of the State.</P>
    <P>I ask the Dáil to consider this Bill, which is now before you, not in any party spirit, but in a serious, responsible way, remembering that whatever Government is in office, at whatever time, there will be upon it the duty of safeguarding the State and safeguarding the elementary and fundamental rights of the State's citizens.  I have read comment and criticism of this Bill, and it did strike me that such comment and criticism as has been offered was of a short-sighted nature.  We were told that we should forget the past and that anything calculated to provoke or revive bitterness should be avoided.  This Bill has nothing to do with the past. It is not retrospective or retroactive in its provisions.  It looks entirely to the future.  I agree devoutly and emphatically that it is to the future we should look and the less advertence there is to the past the better, unless it be for the purpose of drawing from the past useful lessons and experience with a view to the better conduct of our future. The Government of every State seeks powers from its Parliament substantially similar to the powers asked for here in this short Bill.  It is a mistake <Col N="274" /> to suggest, as has been suggested, that unless in the actual present conditions of the country there is something which calls for these provisions legislative sanction should not be asked for provisions of this kind.  We are not legislating now, at any rate, for this week, or next week, for this month, or next month, but we are purporting to place before the Dáil the kind of provisions with which an Executive here in this country ought to be equipped so that there may be here that stability, that order, which the citizens of this State are entitled to expect.  Consequently, it is not entirely, or not solely, actual present conditions that we are purporting to deal with, but we have tried to visualise any possible trouble or any possible challenges that might at any time arise and to determine what powers the State, or those immediately and primarily responsible for the peace, order and safety of the State, ought to have to deal with any such challenge.  It is in that light and in that way that I ask Deputies to approach the Bill and to consider it in its various sections and sub-sections.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is, of course, of a rather obvious nature, and probably I would not be expected to indulge in very much argument about it.  It reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  Every person who commits in Saorstát Eireann any of the following Acts, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  levies war against Saorstát Eireann, or</P>
    <P>(b)  assists, encourages, harbours or comforts, any state or person engaged in levying war against Saorstát Eireann, or</P>
    <P>(c)  conspires with any person (other than his or her wife or husband) or incites any person to levy war against Saorstát Eireann, or</P>
    <P>(d)  attempts or takes part or is concerned in an attempt to overthrow by force of arms or other violent means the Government of Saorstát Eireann as established by or under the Constitution, or</P>
    <P>(e)  assists, encourages, harbours, or comforts any person engaged or taking part or concerned in any such attempt, or</P>
    <P>(f)  conspires with any person (other than his or her wife or husband) <Col N="275" /> or incites any person to make or to take part or be concerned in any such attempt,</P>
    <P>shall be guilty of treason and shall be liable on conviction thereof to suffer death.</P>
    <P>(2)  Every person who, being a citizen of or ordinarily resident in Saorstát Eireann, commits outside Saorstát Eireann any of the acts mentioned in the foregoing sub-section (other than levying war against Saorstát Eireann) shall be guilty of treason and shall be liable on conviction thereof to suffer death.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every person charged under this section with treason shall and may be indicted, arraigned, and tried in the same manner and according to the same course and order of trial in every respect and upon the like evidence as if such person stood charged with murder, and if such person is found guilty of treason he shall be convicted and sentenced in the same manner as if he had been found guilty of murder.</P>
    <P>That section is the State's answer, or is, what I submit to Deputies, ought to be the State's answer to those who challenge its life.  It is not merely the right but the duty of the State to answer that challenge fully and sternly. There are those&mdash;and the point of view is probably represented in the Dáil&mdash; who deprecate in any circumstances capital punishment, but probably even such persons will admit, even from their own standpoint, that if there is a set of circumstances which warrants capital punishment it is such a set of circumstances as is visualised in the first section of this Bill.  Persons who precipitate war upon the State, with all the consequent loss of life, all the consequent moral and material havoc in the country, must be met by the State with the most drastic punishment in its code.  To argue for or against capital punishment in the abstract is one thing, but taking it, as we have so far taken it, that the State is justified in certain circumstances in taking life and in inflicting capital sentence upon its citizens, I submit that the set of circumstances set out there constitute a justification, the strongest possible <Col N="276" /> justification.  When we were, so to speak, starting business, when we were enacting our Constitution, there were those who held that in taking on at one and the same time adult suffrage and proportional representation the first Government in this State was adding considerably to the difficulties and delicacies of its task.  It may be argued, and it may be admitted, that the task over the immediate period through which we have passed would have been less difficult without that very, very broad franchise and without proportional representation. We figured that, however that might be, in principle these two things were right and sound and would prove ultimately beneficial to the country.  We have adhered to proportional representation and we have adhered to adult suffrage, and I put it to the Deputies that just because we have adhered to these two things, just because we have a franchise open to every man and woman in the State of 21 years of age and upwards, and just because we have a system of voting specifically provided to ensure absolute representation for minorities there is the less excuse that men should go out to do violence, to impose their will upon their fellow citizens, and to subject the Government of this State to unconstitutional pressure.  It is, of course, an easier thing, or it seems at first sight an easier thing, to coerce the bodies of your fellow citizens than to convince their minds, and men undertook a course of coercion rather than the other methods, which are slower perhaps and more tedious, the method of convincing the people of the rightness of the particular political course which they advocate.</P>
    <P>It seems common case that the need of the hour is stability.  It seems common case that the social and economic evils that are pressing on the people cannot be remedied otherwise than by stability.  It is idle to admire stability in the abstract and preach the need of it, as so many preach, and then object to provisions which place the Government and the Executive of this State in a position to ensure stability and to grapple with such factors as menace it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> Section 2 of the Bill deals with misprision:</P>
    <P>Every person who, knowing that any act the commission of which would by virtue of this Act be treason, is intended or proposed to be, or is being, or has been committed, does not forthwith disclose the same together with all particulars thereof known to him to a Justice of the District Court, or an officer of the Dublin Metropolitan Police or the Gárda Síochána, or other person lawfully engaged on duties relating to the preservation of peace and order shall be guilty of the felony of misprision of treason and shall be liable on conviction thereof to suffer penal servitude for any term not exceeding ten years or imprisonment with or without hard labour for any term not exceeding two years.</P>
    <P>The principle embodied in that section is this, that citizens owe a duty to the State.  We hear much, and rightly hear much, of the duties of the State and of the Government, to the citizens. That obligation is admitted fully and freely.  There is a corresponding obligation on the part of the citizen to the State, and one such obligation is the obligation of loyalty.  In this section a penalty is imposed on persons who knowing of a challenge to the life of the State, knowing of a challenge to the peace and order and safety of the State, withhold that information from those who are responsible to the people for the State's safety and welfare. That, of course, is, I grant, a new principle here, and may strike people as a very real and very startling departure from all that code and outlook which were traditional here.  But because there has been a very real and striking departure in our circumstances, there must be a corespondingly real and striking change in our outlook, and such a change is demanded under Section 2 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 defines certain offences against the State.  The Acts are set out as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  attempts or takes part or is concerned in an attempt by force of arms or other violent means to overawe or intimidate in any way either the Governor-General or the Executive Council or any member <Col N="278" /> thereof or any other minister duly appointed under and in accordance with the Constitution, or the Oireachtas or either House thereof, or any lawful court or any judge of any such court with a view to influencing their or his actions, or</P>
    <P>(b)  assists, encourages, harbours or protects any person engaged or taking part or concerned in any such attempt as aforesaid, or</P>
    <P>(c)  conspires with any person (other than his or her wife or husband) or incites any person to make or to take part or be concerned in any such attempt, or</P>
    <P>(d)  sets up or holds or purports to set up or hold any court of justice or court-martial (not being a court or court-martial duly established and maintained according to law) or assists or takes part in or is present at the proceedings of any such pretended court or court-martial, or</P>
    <P>(e) incites any member of a military or police force lawfully maintained by the Government of Saorstát Eireann to mutiny, or to desert from such force, or to refuse to obey orders given to him by a superior officer, or to absent himself from or to refuse, neglect, or omit to perform any of his duties, or to commit any other act in dereliction of his duty, or</P>
    <P>(f)  incites any person in the civil service (other than a police force) of the Government of Saorstát Eireann to refuse, neglect, or omit to perform his duty or to commit any other act in dereliction of his duty.</P>
    <P>It is an elementary principle that the chief functionaries of the State, duly appointed by the people and answering to the people through the Dáil, and the courts of the State should be free from any intimidations and should be protected from any attempt by force of arms to influence them or their decisions. Sub-heads (a), (b) and (c) are an adaptation of the Treason Felony Act of 1848, and the provisions of Section 3 have been simply altered to suit altered conditions in the State.  There is just this difference, that under the Treason Felony Act the punishment is <Col N="279" /> penal servitude for life or not less than 3 years' imprisonment without hard labour or not less than 2 years with hard labour, whereas under the Section we are considering, the maximum penalty is penal servitude for 20 years.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill has received a certain amount of criticism both in the Press and on the public platforms and I would like Deputies to consider it.</P>
    <P>(1)  Every person who commits any of the following acts, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  falsely represents himself or holds himself out as being or styles himself as the President or the Vice-President or a lawfully appointed Minister or other officer of State of Saorstát Eireann, or</P>
    <P>(b)  acts or purports to act as, or styles himself or allows himself to be styled or addressed as, or represents himself to be, or holds himself out as being the President or Vice-President, or a Minister or other officer of a pretended government purporting to be established in Saorstát Eireann otherwise than under and by virtue of the Constitution, or</P>
    <P>(c)  acts or purports to act, or styles, represents or holds himself out as a member of a pretended military, police, or civil service purporting to be established in Saorstát Eireann otherwise than under and in accordance with the Constitution or as a member of the military, police, or civil service of a pretended government purporting to be established in Saorstát Eireann otherwise than under and by virtue of the Constitution, or</P>
    <P>(d)  is knowingly employed in, by, or under any such government or any such military, police, or civil service as aforesaid, or</P>
    <P>(e)  not being a member of any military or police force lawfully maintained by the Government of Saorstát Eireann acts or purports to act as a policeman, or purports to perform any of the functions of the police,</P>
    <P>shall be guilty of a misdemeanour and on conviction thereof shall be liable to a fine not exceeding five <Col N="280" /> hundred pounds or, at the discretion of the court, to suffer penal servitude for any term not exceeding five years or imprisonment with or without hard labour for any term not exceeding two years, or to both such fine and such penal servitude or imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be said of the exact wording of that section and some of its sub-sections, the principle is clear that we cannot tolerate in this State a usurpation of the functions of Government. If there is agreement on that general principle, agreement can easily be found on questions of detail. I submit that it is an impossible and intolerable position to have persons usurping the proper functions of Executive Government, holding themselves up as Ministers, purporting to act as Ministers, claiming to possess Executive authority, obviously not derived from the source of authority&mdash; the electorate.  I put that principle in a general way to Deputies and I ask them to think on it.  Up to a stage, pretensions of that kind may be smiled at.  But a stage does come when they cease to be just funny.  You have persons writing here and there through the country styling themselves Ministers for this and Ministers for that.  Probably very few people in the country are inclined to take that kind of thing seriously.  It becomes, perhaps, a little more serious when people outside the country, who are not so familiar with the fatuity of pretensions of that kind as people here on the spot, receive letters of that kind.  Lately I met a Senator who had received a letter purporting to come from a Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Agriculture was not Mr. Hogan, who we know as such Minister.  That, of course, in itself is not a very serious incident, but one can imagine that if correspondence were sent to persons resident in England or France, or any other country abroad&mdash;persons who might possibly own property here &mdash;by a person claiming to possess Executive authority and claiming some legislative or Executive authority over their property, the matter would become somewhat more <Col N="281" /> serious.  One could, of course, enlarge along that line and quote possible instances but I simply put generally to the Dáil that it does not become the Parliament of the country to tolerate any usurpation of executive functions by persons who recognise no responsibility to the Dáil or, through the Dáil to the people.  Neither is it right or proper that persons should be in a position to act through the country as military or as police who do not hold themselves responsible to the duly constituted Government of the country and, through them, to the Dáil.  Activities of that kind and tendencies of that kind will need to be met and countered and will need to be brought to a standstill.  I simply want to stress to Deputies that with the expiring of the temporary Acts of which I spoke, the power to grapple with abuses of that kind does not exist.  The statutory authority to end abuses of that kind does not exist short of the Dáil now giving legislative sanction to these provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 5 states:</P>
    <P>(1)  Any person who commits any of the following acts shall be guilty of the misdemeanour of seditious libel, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  declares or publishes by speech or writing that the Constitution is not the lawful Constitution of Saorstát Eireann, or</P>
    <P>(b)  declares or publishes by speech or writing that the executive council, or the president, or the vice-president, or a Minister duly appointed under and in accordance with the Constitution is not the lawful executive council, president, vice-president, or minister (as the case may be) of Saorstát Eireann, or</P>
    <P>(c)  declares or publishes by speech or writing that the Oireachtas is not the lawful legislature of Saorstát Eireann, or that the Oireachtas has not power to make valid laws for Saorstát Eireann, or</P>
    <P>(d)  declares or publishes by speech or writing that any lawfully established court duly functioning under and in accordance with the Constitution is not a valid and lawful court, <Col N="282" /> (e)  utters or publishes any speech or writing with a seditious intention as defined by this section.</P>
    <P>(2)  Any person who agrees with any person (not being his or her wife or husband) to do any act for the furtherance of a seditious intention common to both such persons shall be guilty of the misdemeanour of seditious conspiracy.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Seditious intention&rdquo; is defined by the section.</P>
    <P>Deputies have read, no doubt, of people who have stated their intention to break every section and sub-section of this Bill the day after it becomes an Act.  That may be regarded as very heroic or it may be regarded as a tribute to the humanity of our prison system.  But Deputies should ask themselves whether in a well-ordered State &mdash;and I assume that we aspire to be a well-ordered State&mdash;people should be allowed to make declarations of the kind set out in Section 5.  It is, of course, a matter of opinion.  It is arguable and will, no doubt, be argued at length.  I will be interested in hearing the case for liberty to do any of the things set out under the various heads in this section.</P>

      <P>I suggest that with the expiring of the temporary Acts the State stands practically stripped of statutory authority to deal with such offences as are set out, and it can simply meet a challenge on the physical plain.  I have the feeling that we are eminently in a position to meet a challenge in that particular way.  But to deal with tendencies leading up to such a challenge, we have very little statutory authority, with the expiring of these temporary Acts, called the Public Safety Acts.</P>

      <P>I agree, a particular Executive.  That Executive will at all times be responsible to the Dáil, but it will be a matter of Executive discretion whether, in a particular case, a prosecution should take place.  One can point out that, under the provisions of Section 5, every giddy girl who shouts out at a meeting that a Deputy or a Minister is a usurper or a tyrant and so on, is liable to prosecution under this Bill.  That is a particular case.  But, the way I would like Deputies to regard certain provisions of this Bill is, that the alternative is to leave the Executive devoid of powers to meet offences of this kind, whatever the circumstances, whatever the degree of guilt, whatever the general gravity of the attendant circumstances.</P>

      <P>Technically and theoretically, yes.  I think it would be preferable, instead of seeking to act under old statutes of that kind, that were not passed by this Dáil or with any sanction or authority from the Irish people, that we should come here for a set of comprehensive provisions that are modern and up to date and <Col N="284" /> that will be considered by Deputies who have responsibility to the people. It would, perhaps, be more pleasant for Deputies to say to the Executive, &ldquo;Continue to carry on&rdquo;&mdash;as Deputy Johnson says&mdash;&ldquo;You have all the powers you need; there are the Acts passed in the last century, this Treason Felony Act of 1848, and other Acts under which Nationalist Irishmen were prosecuted in the past&mdash;use them.&rdquo;  We prefer not to use these.  We prefer to put the responsibility on members of this Assembly to say what powers the Executive, responsible to this Assembly for the peace, good order and dignity of the State, ought to have to deal with such challenges as exist within the country, of such challenges as may arise in the future.</P>

      <P>It is a perfectly fair and proper and reasonable attitude. Sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 5 define seditious intention.</P>
      <P>In this section the expression &ldquo;seditious intention&rdquo; means an intention to do any of the following things, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to bring into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection against the Constitution, or the Oireachtas or either House thereof, or any lawful court, or</P>
      <P>(b)  to incite any person to attempt to bring about or effect (otherwise than in accordance with law) the alteration of the Constitution or of the law established by or under the Constitution, or the repeal or alteration of any Statute, or</P>
      <P>(c)  to raise, promote, or foment discontent or disaffection amongst the citizens of Saorstát Eireann or feelings of ill-will or hostility between different classes of such citizens, or</P>
      <P>(d)  to incite any person to commit any crime in breach of the peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  Any person who commits the misdemeanour of seditious libel or the misdemeanour of seditious conspiracy shall be liable on conviction <Col N="285" /> thereof to a fine not exceeding five hundred pounds or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment with or without hard labour for any term not exceeding two years or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>In sub-section (3) the offences which it is sought to provide against are offences leading to violence.  We dealt in Section 1 with the actual crime of violence itself.  You have another set of offences not exactly constituting treason, not exactly warranting the penalty of treason, but offences that lead up to and precede a crime of violence against the State&mdash;offences calculated to lead to a violent attack on the life of the State.  It is that kind of offences which it is sought to cover in this particular section.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on Section 5, sub-section (3) (c). I am informed that the only offence which will be held in law to be covered by that particular sub-head is the offence of inciting one section of citizens to violence against some other section of citizens.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>An intention to show that the Government has been misled or mistaken in its measures, or to point out error or defects in the Government or Constitution as by law established with a view to their reformation, or to incite subjects to attempt by lawful means the alteration of any matter in Church or State as by <Col N="286" /> law established, or to point out any error or other removable matters which are producing or have a tendency to produce feelings of hatred and ill-will between classes of subjects is not a seditious intention within the meaning of the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>A public place, within the meaning of the section, would only be the street or road, and it would not apply to a meeting at the Mansion House.  Section 8 prohibits unauthorised military exercise.  Without wishing to strike any note of panic, I think we have got rather hardened, so far as there is any tendency that way, but I want to inform Deputies that a certain amount of unauthorised drilling and organising of a military, or quasi-military nature, is at present taking place in the country.  The tendency is to have a condition of things in which you would have in the country two armies, one recognising a code of discipline and obedience to the Government of the Saorstát, and subject to the control of the Government and Parliament, and the other recognising no such restrictions or limitations and holding itself free at any time to challenge the State and the safety and welfare of the people.  It would scarcely be argued here that that state of affairs could be allowed to continue.  It will, I think, scarcely be questioned that the Executive will need very full powers to counter tendencies of that kind and bring prosecutions where necessary.  Consequently we have embodied in this Bill a provision, set out in Section 8, for the consideration of Deputies.  Section 9 deals with the question of secret societies in the army or police.  That is a matter that, of course, has been argued from time to time on the forms of oaths or declarations that were scheduled to the Police Bills and to the Defence Forces Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 9 prohibits the formation, organisation, promotion, or maintenance of any secret societies amongst or consisting of or including members of any military or police force lawfully maintained by the Government of Saorstát Eireann; or any attempt to form, organise, promote or maintain any such secret societies; or taking part, assisting, or being concerned in any way in the formation, organisation, promotion, management, or maintenance of any such society; or inducing, soliciting or assisting any member of a military or police force lawfully maintained by the Government of Saorstát Eireann to join any secret society whatsoever. Sub-section (2) defines the expression &ldquo;secret society&rdquo; as meaning an association, society, or other body the members of which are required to take or enter into an oath or other engagement not to disclose the proceedings, or some part of the proceedings of the association, society, or body.  It is clear that persons in the position of military or police could not with impartiality or efficiency discharge their duties if they are, at the same time, members of a secret society whose aims or objects may at any time conflict with the duties detailed to them in their capacity as members of military or police forces. When such conflict arises they are placed in the unhappy position of deciding whether they are still conscientiously discharging their duties as public servants, or obeying the mandates of the secret society of which they are members. This section is introduced with a view to preventing such a position arising and has been warranted by recent events, especially in the Army. Now Deputy Davin asks me why this excellent principle should not be extended to judges, civil servants, and all State employees.  The position at the moment is, so far as I know, that there <Col N="290" /> is no statutory provision which prohibits anyone other than members of the army and police forces from being a member of a secret society.  It would scarcely be proper to make illegal, as this section does, the doing by people of something which they have a legal right to do.  Members of the army and police forces at the moment in respect to the Acts governing their organisation take a form of oath or declaration to the effect that while serving in a particular capacity as members of one or other of such forces they will not subscribe to or belong to any political or secret society.  Therefore, so far as members of these forces are concerned, they have abandoned the right of membership of any secret society whatever. That, so far, has not been provided in the case of any other State employee.</P>

      <P>I am stating the facts&mdash;for one thing possibly because it has not been found necessary, because we have not had brought to our notice anything showing that such provision is necessary, and because we do not care to restrict the liberty of individuals except we see cause and reason for such restriction.  The Deputy will agree that we had in one Government organisation evidence of the necessity for such provision.  At the moment, beyond the army and police forces, there is no provision restricting any person from membership of a secret society. It would scarcely be good legislation to proceed to make it an offence for people to do something which they have a right to do.  Therefore, the prohibition here covers only the case of persons who have relinquished a right to be members of a secret society and it covers only members of the army and police forces.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy read the section and then repeat the question, if he thinks it necessary? Section 10 deals with the administering of unlawful oaths, and Section 11 gives power to search for documents of a treasonable or seditious nature.  It provides that where a Justice of the District Court is satisfied, on the information on oath of an officer of the police forces not below the rank of chief superintendent, that there is reasonable ground for suspecting that there are treasonable or seditious documents in any particular place, the Justice may issue to such officer such search warrant as is mentioned in this section.  The rest is precautionary. The general principle set out there is clear enough.  There ought to be power for the Government to search for and remove documents of a treasonable and suspicious nature if it can satisfy a Justice, on the information of a person of a rank not lower than chief superintendent, that there is good cause for believing that such documents are concealed in a particular place.  That seems a necessary precaution in the days we are passing through.  I doubt if Deputies will see very much objection to it.  We can, of course, and I have no doubt we will, on the Committee Stage go into greater details, into the sections and sub-sections of this Bill, than I find it possible to do on Second Reading.  I put the Bill to the Deputies now for their calm, non-party consideration as embodying a set of provisions which we think the Government of this country at any time, certainly for a long time, is likely to need in answering such challenges to its authority as <Col N="292" /> exist, or are likely to arise.  If exception is taken on the Committee Stage to particular sections or sub-sections, I will endeavour to meet the views of Deputies in a reasonable way, provided that I consider they are reasonable views.</P>

      <P>I do in all cases, as the Deputy is well aware, but I would stress, with regard to this Bill particularly, even more than ordinary legislation, that it is a Bill that should be considered by Deputies in a serious, responsible spirit, remembering that they may sit at any time on these Benches, having our duties and responsibilities, and remembering that there exist in the country, if not an actual live challenge to the authority of the State, all the possibilities of such a challenge.  It is simply with due advertence to these things, and with due consideration of them, I would like Deputies to approach the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I was particularly interested to hear the Minister appeal to have this Bill considered in a non-party spirit.  I do not quite know what he means&mdash;whether he thinks every other party in the House is in the habit simply of obeying the party decisions, and not considering Bills on their merits.  I assure him from this side of the House that every Bill is discussed on its merits and not in a party spirit, if he means by that a desire to oust the majority from their position.  Perhaps the Minister intended to say that he does not ask the House to follow any lead which he may give, except the lead of his reasoning, and that every Deputy on his side of the House will be free, so far as party pressure is concerned, to vote as he pleases.  I hope in that case that there will not be any reason to trouble about a Committee Stage, as I hope the House will refuse to give this Bill a Second Reading.  The reason I would put in the forefront of that appeal is that the Bill is entirely unnecessary.  The reasons which the Minister has given in favour of the Bill are not at all frank, and not at all the true reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in the course of his speech, in answer to, perhaps, a most disorderly interruption, suggested that it would not be desirable to proceed in case of treason, felony or sedition by the processes of the existing law, that it was not desirable to bring into the courts, I presume he meant, the name of the King. That must be the reason that it is thought necessary in this month of February, 1925, to bring in a Bill which is in great measure a compilation of Bills passed one hundred years ago.  Unfortunately for the Minister, to prosecute under treason-felony or sedition Acts it would have to be announced as treason against the King, and he does not desire to bring that into court.  I have here a copy of a charge against two persons in 1913, one of whom was a member of this House, Mr. William O'Brien, and the other is one who will, I hope, be soon a member of this House&mdash;Mr. Thomas Lawlor.  It reads as follows: &ldquo;At a meeting at Beresford Place, on August 26th, 1913, having been guilty of the crimes of seditious libel and seditious conspiracy in agreeing and acting together for the criminal purpose of disturbing the public peace, and raising discontent among His Majesty's subjects, the citizens of Dublin, and discontent and hatred between certain classes of His Majesty's subjects, to wit, the working classes of Dublin, the police forces of the Crown and the soldiers of the Crown, and for exciting hatred and contempt of the Government, and for the purpose of inciting to murder; also that they and each of them about the time and place aforesaid were guilty of the crime of the publication of seditious words, and that they and each of them, together with other persons, did, at the place aforesaid, unlawfully assemble with the intention to carry out the unlawful purposes aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was possible, under the existing law in 1913, to make a charge of that kind against reputable citizens of Dublin.  Somebody might interpolate &ldquo;and disreputable citizens.&rdquo;  It was <Col N="294" /> possible, in 1913, to make that kind of charge.  What has happened to prevent such a charge being made again in similar circumstances?  Not, certainly, any enactment of the Oireachtas, because the law of that time was continued by a definite enactment of the Oireachtas, the Adaptation of Enactments Act.  So far as that particular kind of crime is concerned, there is no necessity to bring in new legislation. The Minister pointed out that, so far as the treason felony clauses in this Bill are concerned, they were adapted from the Treason Felony Act of 1848.  It is very interesting to note that they really have not been very much altered.  The present proposals are not very different from the proposals contained in the sections of the Treason Felony Act, except that the names of the authorities have been changed.</P>
    <P>The Treason Felony Act of 1848 was specially introduced and passed in all its stages in forty-eight hours.  It was passed to enable the Government to convict John Mitchel, who had been acquitted by a jury under the law existing prior to the passing of the Act. Mitchel, of course, was generally known as the Irish felon.  The Minister now tells us that it is necessary to pass a new Act embodying the Treason Felony Act passed under those circumstances, changing the name of the King to the Constitution of Saorstát Éireann. I say that the occasion for bringing in such a Bill is very badly chosen.  In the main, most of the Acts on which this Bill is founded were passed by the British Parliament in one of the worst periods in British history, when so many repressive measures against the public and the expression of public opinion were adopted.  That was in the early years of the nineteenth century, when repressive measures against combinations, associations or societies attempting to promote reform, and anti-combination laws of one kind or another, were passed.  It is on those laws, or many of them, that this Bill is based.</P>
    <P>In the year 1925, the Minister tells us it is necessary to re-enact, in a permanent enactment, the provisions of those old, archaic acts that were passed, one might say, in the most reactionary period of recent British history, when <Col N="295" /> the powers that were at that time endeavoured to do all that was possible to prevent any development of the idea of freedom for the common people.  This is the kind of thing the Minister asks us, at this time, to re-enact in a slightly new and, in some respects, in a considerably worse, form.  I say that the law that at present exists, after the expiry of the temporary measures which we passed a year or two years ago, gives the Minister far more power than he ought to have.  He has certainly quite sufficient power to meet any possible contingency.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the suggestions to the House, and, I hope, to the public.  The enactments that are at present in force, and that the Minister wants particulars of, include: &ldquo;that it is not lawful to preach that the King is not the rightful sovereign, or that the Crown and Parliament cannot make binding laws.&rdquo;  That is embodied here, too, but in slightly different phraseology, and it goes back to Queen Anne.  It is again an offence at the present time to affirm that Parliament has legislative powers without a King. I understand that is existing law, and the Minister, if he wishes, can enforce it.  The general proposal, as I understand it, reading this Bill, is that it is <Col N="296" /> desirable to re-enact, in language suitable to the new status under the Constitution, the repressive legislation that was considered necessary by a reactionary and very conservative majority in the British Parliament a hundred years ago, and the panic legislation of Parliament in the year '48.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been very softspoken to-day.  He has not referred to the gentleman who &ldquo;touched the button.&rdquo; He has not indulged in any of the very favourite expressions of his. He has attempted to woo the House by striking a minor key.  He has suggested that it is logically necessary that a State must take to itself powers to do things in the future to protect itself against possibilities, and that it is necessary to do it now, because certain extraordinary powers which have been enacted, and which have now ceased to have effect, have lapsed.  I have heard the Minister refer in scathing terms to the narrow logic of Miss Mary MacSwiney and President de Valera, as he is called.</P>
      <P>When I heard the Minister pleading in terms of logic for this Bill, I could not help thinking of cases made by them in their narrow logical way.  When the Minister told us that other States were bound to take upon themselves these powers, I was reminded of Lenin and the Russian Communists, and Mussolini and the Fascists, and I was led to realise how, because they have power, they will take upon themselves all the authority they think is necessary, simply because the power is theirs.  But I suggest statesmanship requires a little more than mere logic, and that you have to consider the circumstances of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you consider the circumstances of the day and the time there is absolutely no necessity for this Bill as a protection and there is great danger in the Bill so far as public liberty in the future is concerned.  The Minister went through the Bill section by section.  He dealt first with the treason sections.  I wonder did he recognise that he was making punishment for treason very much more serious than the law which he is attempting to embody under this Bill.  The punishment for treason will be death, and persons who are indicted <Col N="297" /> will be arraigned and tried in the same manner as if they were being tried, indicted and arraigned for murder, and if found guilty they shall be convicted and sentenced in the same manner as if they had been found guilty of murder. But the punishment for treason at present, punishment by death, makes it necessary that the sentence should be carried out in public.  It shall not be within the walls of a prison, so that we are to assume that the Minister desires that the punishment for treason shall be in a public place, not inside a prison, and that he shall retain the powers by warrant to say that the person to be punished by death shall be beheaded.</P>
    <P>I wonder does that embody what the Minister really desires?  I listened carefully to the Minister to try and find out whether it was his intention, in any way, to repeal the existing law through the passing of this Bill.  As I gather there is no intention to repeal the existing law, but this Bill is in addition to every existing law relating to treason, sedition, seditious libel, and the rest, so that we are still going to be made liable for punishment for saying nasty things about the King, or the British Parliament, or the British Constitution; we are still going to be liable to punishment for treason for any act which may lead to riotous assembly in the city of London, for instance. We are going to be made liable for any act of treason under the existing law, and also to have liability for punishment under the new proposals.</P>
    <P>I will concede to the Minister that it is not allowable in any State that two Governments should attempt to function and carry out the powers of Government in the same area and at the same time.  If they try to do that, they will come into conflict, and one or the other must be supreme.  But I say that that is a very, very different thing from a body of people presuming to call themselves the Government or Parliament or Ministers or Presidents or Heads of State: it is a very different thing indeed for people to call themselves by these names and doing the things which appertain to these offices. If the Minister confined himself in this Bill to making it an offence to attempt <Col N="298" /> to enforce the powers of Government, then I suggest there would be no need for very much pleading with any Deputy in the House.</P>
    <P>There are very many details that one is tempted to touch upon, but I suppose they will be subject, notwithstanding my hope already expressed, to discussion in Committee.  There are a few matters that it will be necessary to touch upon in more detail.  The Minister, for instance, referred to a certain judgment in the courts, the judgment of Mr. Justice Cave.  He quoted that to show that a particular section of the Bill might appear to have a meaning to the public, who are supposed to understand the law, but that in fact certain judges in England have made the law and interpreted it in such a way as would excite no hostility.  He relies upon the judgments of the judges in the courts.  Well, that is one of my objections.  In the case of sedition, the law that has been made by the judges is very often, in minor cases, more objectionable than the law as written and as understood by the average man in the street.  Many of these judgments, the people in this country are fairly well aware of it, have been inspired by antipathy to public popular movements, and in particular to Irish popular movements, but it is the judgemade law that the Minister relies upon to determine what is the meaning of certain sections in the Bill.  Of course, he says in this particular section that he is prepared to consider an amendment to the Bill which will allow the public to know what he means rather than the proposition in the Bill which is different from what he means.  I mean to say that the interpretation of the law regarding sedition has been very often inspired by antipathy to popular movements, and particularly movements having reform and progress as an end. I said that in many cases the provisions of this Bill were worse than the provisions of the law which this Bill attempts to embody.  I will quote one case.  Under the Prison Act of 1877 any prisoner under sentence for sedition or seditious libel is to be treated as a misdemeanant in the first division, but under this Bill any such person may be sentenced to hard labour, so <Col N="299" /> that we are getting on nicely in the Saorstát under the Minister's directions.</P>
    <P>Take another illustration of one reason for not proceeding further with this Bill.  In Section 5, sub-section (3), the Minister quoted that the expression &ldquo;seditious intention&rdquo; meant an intention to do any of the following things: (a) &ldquo;to bring into hatred or contempt, or to excite disaffection against the Constitution, or to incite any person to attempt to bring about or effect otherwise than in accordance with law the alteration of the Constitution or of the law established by or under the Constitution or the repeal or alteration of any statute.&rdquo; The saving clause is intended, presumably, to lie in the words &ldquo;otherwise than in accordance with law.&rdquo;  But supposing we desired to secure an amendment of the Constitution, supposing we incited, as I hope we shall do, persons to attempt to bring about an alteration of the Constitution, we will be liable to a fine of £500 or two years' imprisonment. We cannot do that in accordance with law.  We are prohibited by the very Constitution itself from doing that in accordance with law.  We cannot alter the Constitution, because the Constitution is based upon the Treaty, and we cannot alter the Constitution in any way which would alter or change the Treaty.  We cannot, therefore, advocate or incite other people to advocate an alteration of the Treaty, because we could not do that in accordance with law, and if we should attempt to do it, we are to be liable to a fine of £500 or two years' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will have to find another way out and to please allow us to incite people to demand an amendment of the Treaty otherwise than in accordance with law.  We must not attempt to bring about or effect a change in the Constitution.  The Constitution says nothing can be effected in the way of change if it is repugnant to the clauses of the Treaty, so you see how we are bound up and going to be liable under the Minister.  We are making a good show towards gripping very tightly any of the activities of <Col N="300" /> what you might call the popular movement. I asked the Minister certain questions regarding his intentions touching secret societies.  He seemed to say that the intention of this section was to make it illegal, to make it an offence for any person to attempt to maintain a secret society which included within its membership a policeman or a soldier.  He did not answer Deputy Davin's further question whether he was proposing to take powers to search the books of these secret societies, to see if there were any membres of the army or the police forces within their membership.  The section speaks of &ldquo;every person who shall form or maintain any secret society which includes members of the military or police forces, and any person who does such maintaining, organising or promoting such societies shall be liable to five years' imprisonment.&rdquo;  I hope the Minister's intention will be very actively canvassed, and that we shall know exactly what public opinion is on this proposition.  I, for one, am glad to know that that is his intention, that if there is to be a prohibition against policemen or soldiers becoming members of societies of that kind there ought to be all the powers requisite to see whether any society of a secret character has such persons upon its books.</P>
    <P>But let us take Section 10, which is intended to make it illegal to administer oaths to commit any offence.  I ask the House to think for a moment of what this includes.  It is quite within the spirit of the anti-combination laws and sedition Acts.  &ldquo;Every person who shall administer or cause to be administered or take part in or be present at or consent to the administering or taking in any form or manner of any oath, declaration or engagement purporting or intending to bind the persons taking the same to do all or any of the following acts.&rdquo;  That is to say, commit any breach of the peace or other unlawful acts.</P>
    <P>Now, what is an unlawful act? Nobody knows.  You have to go to the judges to find out, and so much depends upon the judge, at the time, whether an act is an unlawful act.  Everybody knows who follows the proceedings <Col N="301" /> of the law courts relating to trade unions, that in one year an act is unlawful and another year it is lawful. But under this section any person who &ldquo;shall administer or cause to be administered a declaration or engagement, which is not an oath, intended to bind a person to do any of the following things, that is to say, to commit an unlawful act,&rdquo; is to be made liable to this penalty of hard labour for a term not exceeding two years, unless he is able to show he was compelled by force or duress or that he informs on the people who induced him to take this oath.  I say that is entirely in the spirit of the anti-conspiracy laws, of the anti-combination laws, of the anti-trade union and friendly society laws of the early nineteenth century.  You are going to rely on what the judges have said to be the law.  You are imparting by the very passing of this Bill, if it is passed, a spirit into the public life of the country which will inevitably create a repressive feeling against popular movements, which will inevitably have the effect of inducing judges, juries and the like to say that &ldquo;This is unlawful, this should be suppressed, and this should not be allowed to be carried out, and we will take advantage of such means as are at present in our power to stop the development of this particular tendency.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>In putting this motion before the Dáil I want, before putting any reasons that I wish to advance before the Dáil as to why I think the Dáil ought to accept it, and before coming to the actual provisions that I have caused to be drawn out, and have drawn out with the assistance of others, and which have been circulated in order that Deputies might have a definite and concrete proposal before them for their consideration, to deal with the actual terms of the motion itself and to show why it is that this motion should be a motion to be accepted by the Dáil here and now, and why it should not be postponed for consideration, either it or the matter which it contains, to a later date.  The first reason is that if this motion were to be accepted by the Dáil, it does not mean and would not mean, that any action would be required to be taken in any violent hurry.  It would require a great deal of time before any definite action could proceed.  There is no question, if the Dáil were to accept this motion or the substance of it, that anything would be done in haste.  The Executive Council, through the Minister for Defence, is merely required to furnish measures providing for the abolition of the Standing Army&mdash;and by that I mean the type of standing army as we now know it&mdash;and for the creation of a a National Militia.  By that I do not mean that the word &ldquo;Militia&rdquo; should be necessarily adopted.  I have merely adopted the word because it has been accepted in other countries for the type of the force I have in mind.  It might be called a territorial force or a citizen force.  In some countries it is called a citizen force; in others it is known as a territorial force, but it is generally referred to as Militia, and it is for that reason I use the word and not because I have any peculiar preference for the word itself <Col N="303" /> over and above any other possible description. What I wish to put before the Dáil now, and all that the resolution requires, is that provision should be made and some measures should be elaborated and laid before the Dáil by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In justification of bringing forward this motion at this particular time, I want the Dáil to work out exactly what it would mean if it were to be adopted.  It would mean that the Minister would be required to draw up such a proposal.  We know exactly what the legislative programme is between now and June.  It is obvious that if the Minister were to accept this motion or the substance of it and were to proceed on the terms of it, no such proposal could possibly come before the Dáil before the autumn session and probably not before this time next year.  That is to say, if the measures were to be adopted in any legislative proposal, that legislative proposal could not be considered before a year from the present moment and would not be adopted and passed before summer twelve months.  Then a period would have to elapse in which a change would be made from one system to another. There would be no violent change; there would be no violent hurry.  The thing would have to be done with care and with method.  In effect it would mean before any such proposal could be carried into practical effect, if this motion were to be accepted now, at least three years would transpire.  If ever such a motion at any time were to be laid before the Dáil and accepted by the Dáil, three years would have to transpire from that acceptation before the Dáil could begin to see the fruits of such acceptance. That is why I say we are dealing in this resolution not with a matter for immediate action to-morrow, but a matter in which immediate action could not proceed within much less than two years, and where we could not see definite fruits much before three years, having in mind that the preparation of the scheme, the passing of the legislative proposals embodying the scheme, the change from one system to another, and the institution <Col N="304" /> in full of any new system that may be adopted.  There is another reason that I want to put before the Dáil as to why this motion, if it is to be considered at all, ought to be considered now.  In August, 1923, the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act came before the Dáil, and some of us then directed attention to the fact that one of the sections of that Act provided that enlistment could proceed, as it may still proceed, under the terms of that Act, for twelve years. The Minister for Defence, Deputy Mulcahy, replying to that interpretation, said that he engaged himself that no persons should be enlisted, under the terms of enlistment that were about to begin, for a period of more than eighteen months or two years, according as the exigencies of the time dictated. That is to say, in September, 1923, or thereabouts, we were led to believe that a number of re-enlistments would occur, and that these re-enlistments would be for either eighteen months or for two years.  That means to say, following that up, calculating still in the terms of the pledge then given by the Minister, that new enlistments will be or should be undertaken some time this year. Obviously the Dáil ought to have an opportunity of expressing its opinion as to the type of army that is considered desirable for adoption in this country before these re-enlistments are entertained.  The Minister ought to know whether it is the desire of the Dáil that the present type of Army should continue, or whether there should be some other type of army, and if the Dáil itself decide that this motion is one that should not be accepted, if the Dáil itself come to the decision that the present type of army is one that ought to be continued, I say for myself that I will faithfully and loyally abide by that decision of the Dáil, and stand by it for the rest of the term of the Dáil.  But I will put forward reasons why I think another type of army would be better suited to the conditions of the country and would give relief from the heavy burden of taxation that is at present doing the country such an amount of injury.  There is a third reason: it is one to which Deputy Grattan Esmonde has referred.  It <Col N="305" /> is that a provision of the Treaty lays down that within five years negotiations will have to take place between the Government of the Free State and the British Government with regard to Ireland providing more fully and amply for herself in regard to her defence.  Obviously, I put it to the Dáil, before any such discussions or conferences can take place the Minister and the Executive Council ought to know and have cleared up what the desire of the Dáil is as regards the type of Army which this country ought to have.  I believe it to be true; I am so informed, and I would like if the Minister would definitely inform us whether preparations are now being made, necessarily being made as things stand, for the adoption of the present method of defence forces and the organisation of these in such a way that if the Dáil were, in two or three years' time, to change its mind and desire a different type of Army and a different type of defence forces, it will find it very difficult to effect any radical change.  It is for these reasons that I have brought forward this motion at this particular moment, firstly, because we are dealing with a period three years ahead, necessarily; secondly, because we are coming upon a period when there will be certain re-enlistments; thirdly, because of the Treaty provision that will fall due in a short time for the reconsideration of the defence provisions of the Treaty; fourthly, because I believe that the Army is now being reorganised in such a way that it will be difficult to effect a change if the Dáil does not have an opportunity to express its opinion this year.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons why I think the matter presses urgently for immediate consideration.  The outstanding reason is the question of economy.  I need not draw the attention of the Dáil to the fact that there is an increasing amount of discussion as to the necessity for relief from taxation somewhere.  It is a fact at the present moment that money, instead of coming into the country, is flowing out of the country.  If there will be in the immediate future, as we believe there will be, a fundamental reduction of taxation in Great Britain, that tendency of money to go <Col N="306" /> out of the country rather than to remain in the country, much less to come into the country, is bound to increase, and consequently many persons, alive to the actual state of affairs in commerce to-day, have urged that there should be a structural and a radical reduction in taxation.  That, I think, is a matter on which there can be a certain amount of agreement.  I think it can be taken as correct that the abnormal unemployment at the present time is very largely due to the fact that there is abnormal taxation.  Ministers, when they are confronted by the proposal that taxation should be reduced, always make a very effective and proper reply.  The President the other day, when he was asked in Cork city whether there would be some reduction in Income Tax, whether there would be a wholesale reduction of Income Tax on moneys earned in Ireland, at once turned on his questioners with a very effective retort.  He said that the persons putting forward any such proposal had upon them the responsibility of showing where the money could be saved, and I think that that was a very effective and very proper reply, that it is not right for persons to make broad claims that taxation should be reduced unless they are in a position to say&mdash;&ldquo;Here and there are places where that money could be saved.&rdquo;  I am suggesting, and I will show later on, that money lost by a remission of income tax on incomes earned in Ireland could be saved by the adoption of the general principle laid down in this resolution.  But it is a matter of agreement; I think the Minister for Defence himself would be inclined to agree with me; I feel pretty sure that the Minister for Finance would be inclined to agree with me, that as one looks over the whole field of administration, the proper place to begin economy is the Army.  I say that there would be agreement as to that; I claim that there has been agreement as to that; I claim that the Executive Council have already adopted that principle; that during the past twelve months they have made their most effective economics in regard to the defence forces.  It was not so very long ago when we had an Army of something <Col N="307" /> like 50,000 men.  It has been cut down drastically, and, if I am correctly informed, I believe the position to be to-day that the Army does not consist of more than something round about 15,000 men, possibly something under that figure.  That I accept as an intimation by the Executive Council that they agree with me&mdash;whether they would continue to agree as to the future adoption of that principle I am not now going to say&mdash;that the Army is the most effective place where a reduction can be made.  I am only now urging that the principle that has been accepted should be continued, that we should go on reducing the standing force from 15,000, steadily, not violently, not with any unnecessary haste, until we reached a period of about 5,000, and that the difference might then be made good by the creation of a Territorial or Militia or Citizen force on a system that the Minister could devise, after consultation with his chief officials, but of which I have put forward an example in the document that has been circulated to Deputies.  Here again I want to repeat what I have already said, and I cannot repeat it too often, because I desire to give it special emphasis.  It is that whatever is to be done in the way of a change in the defence forces of this country by the adoption of a new method of organisation and the adoption of a new principle of procedure, the changes will have to be made very slowly and very steadily.</P>
    <P>That question of economy I consider to be the chief argument in favour of this scheme.  It is the reason that has been the motive behind all Governments that have adopted this particular type of army defence force.  I have had an opportunity of reading the debates in several of the sister States of the Commonwealth since the war, and in them all it has been said, over and over again, that modern States cannot afford standing armies, that standing armies are an expensive form of defence, and that all that is required is a small nucleus round which a militia or territorial or citizen force could be grouped, and the motive of economy in every case has brought about a change from the standing army type of defence force to the militia type of defence <Col N="308" /> force.  It is the motive for economy that I desire to emphasise here this evening; but there is a chance an objection would be made, and I am sure there are Deputies to whose minds that objection had already occurred. They will say that Ireland needs a defence force because of any possible recurrence of Irregular warfare&mdash;that she needs a strong defence force of the standing army type, because of that possibility.  Of course, if the Minister brings forward that argument I can only refer him to the statements by his colleagues, and notably several times by the Minister for Finance, who expressed his conviction that Ireland had seen the end of civil warfare.  I believe myself it is perfectly true that Ireland has seen the end of civil warfare.</P>

      <P>Even the incitement of the Treason Bill will not induce the young men of this country to go back upon a thing that has revolted every decent sense in the country. There are, as the Minister for Justice has frequently reminded us, dumps in various parts of the country. I do not know that these dumps will not be referred to as the reason why we should not change from the modern type of defence, but if they are, I would anticipate that argument and say, if the weapons are to be taken out of those dumps after having been there for the past eighteen months, and if I were to be presented with the alternative of being either at the muzzle-end or the breach-end of one of those guns, that I do not know which I would consider the more dangerous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I do not know which end would be the more dangerous, but I would say that I do not believe that the weapons in these dumps are to be put to much effective use in the future.  I do believe, apart from that, that the people of this country are not going to see any return to civil war, and I do not think there is any of the Ministers who think there is <Col N="309" /> any chance or likelihood of such an event.  Some of us know very well that in 1921 the country was tired of warfare. It took a very great deal to get many of those who went out in the Irregular campaign the following year to bring them there, and if effective measures had been taken at the beginning of that year we would never have seen civil warfare at all.  I am not speaking now as an optimist in the matter.  I endeavour to look at this matter with the fullest possible realism.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to say an unfair thing, but I am bound to say as to those who, as I have heard, have argued that the possibility of civil warfare should be quite sufficient to deter our making any change in the form of our defence forces, that I could never convince myself that that argument was as sincere as those who adduced it would like us to believe.  I do not think any Minister believes that we are going to see any return to civil warfare in this country.  I think we ought to be able to take our decision unclouded by any consideration of that kind.  There may be an element of doubt in the matter. One Deputy said to me there is an element of doubt, but he expressed his conviction that we would not see civil war and that, therefore, we might make the change that this resolution proposes. He concluded by saying: &ldquo;We will not know for certain for another couple of years.&rdquo;  I would like to point out to that Deputy and to the Dáil that this resolution, as I have already stated, is thinking of two or three years hence. If this resolution were to be adopted to-morrow, it could not be put into practical effect to-morrow, or into practical effect for another couple of years, possibly three years.  In the meantime, preparations could be made, and, if Deputy Johnson is going to suggest that the Treason and Sedition Bill that we have just been considering is going to cause a recrudescence of Irregular warfare, why then the Treason and Sedition Bill will cause that recrudescence long before the Minister will have prepared the scheme, and the Dáil will be able to consider that scheme in the full light of any consequences of any Bill that we may consider this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another reason that I would like to place before the Dáil as to why I think <Col N="310" /> that this motion should be accepted, is this, and it is really the final consideration in all matters of this kind, as to the type of army that best suits the conditions of the Saorstát.  We have had discussions here with regard to fiscal matters.  We have discussed protection and we have discussed free trade.  When that matter was under discussion I ventured to suggest that there was only one argument that we ought to consider in connection with that legislative proposal.  It was: what is the type of fiscal economy that best suits the condition of this country, irrespective of what happens in other countries?  I bring that argument forward to support this present resolution. If we keep a standing army, if the decision is that we shall have a standing army of 15,000 or 20,000 men, I ask the Dáil for what purpose will we want these men?  What are we going to protect ourselves against?  I heard the Minister for Defence say earlier to-day that he desired that we should be protected against all-comers. It is desirable that we should be protected against all-comers, but I think that we should have some clear information, if we are asked to keep a force of such an expensive character and such a large establishment as a standing army, what those all-comers may be.  Under modern conditions of warfare I think that if any people were going to prosecute offensive tacties against this country, that they would be conducted not in this country but from another country.</P>
    <P>In less than five years there is not a city in the Saorstát that could not be bombed by aerial warfare controlled by wireless from another country if it desired to do so.  I urge that there is no real reason why we should keep an expensive establishment in the country when we could find much better uses for the money in other ways.  I have already dealt with all possible arguments in regard to dangers from outside sources.  I have already dealt with possible dangers from inside sources.  Now I come to the actual proposal that I will put before the Dáil.  As to the possible method of such an organisation I will show that in any event there will be a standing force of 5,000 men, an efficient <Col N="311" /> force kept at a high standard of efficiency, and with such a force it should be possible to stop the beginning of any trouble that might be likely to occur within this country.  And so I put it to the Minister if he opposes this motion, if he believes that the correct method of organising the defence forces is by the expensive establishment of a standing army, that it is due to him to show what cause exists and is likely to exist for such forces.  I believe myself that a standing army is unnecessary, and I urge the Dáil to consider that the moneys expended at the present moment on such a force might be much more profitably expended in other ways.  I believe, all questions considered and weighed in, I am correct in saying that, officers and men considered, £5 per man per week represents the expenses of a standing army.  That is too expensive and costly.  I can only say, in the alternative proposals I have put before the Dáil, I have accepted that figure, and if I have accepted the figure in my proposals then I am accepting it that that is the correct figure of the cost of the present force.  That is to say, that every soldier walking the streets represents an average of £250 a year.  £250 a year capitalised is £5,000. Every soldier walking the streets represents at an average a capitalised sum of £5,000.  That £5,000 capitalised could be brought in under the credits of this country for other purposes. The Minister might know exactly how many houses might be built, and exactly what amount of good work could be done by economies of that kind.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like the Dáil quite briefly to consider the conditions that prevail in other countries.  I am not going to stress this.  I think if any Deputy suggested that we ought not to consider too carefully or too closely the conditions that prevail in other countries, and the kind of Army that prevails in other countries, until we knew the conditions that prevailed in those other countries, he would be essentially just and correct.  It is very easy to get statistics put before the Dáil about other countries, without being aware of the conditions in those countries.  This evening in laying the matter before the <Col N="312" /> Dáil, I do not want to press on the attention of the House that other countries do this, and other countries do that, but I consider the right way we should deal with the matter is to consider our own circumstances and conditions, and having attentively surveyed them, to come to a decision which we would judge in our wisdom to be right for our own country.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it is perfectly true that every country but one has the type of defence force that I advocate in this resolution.  There is only one country that I have been able to discover that keeps a standing army, and that country is Great Britain, and Great Britain does it for the reason that it is right and proper for herself.  She has to keep her regular army, for she has to have regular forces for sending around to different parts of her Empire, but that condition does not prevail in other countries.</P>
    <P>Every European country to-day has under a compulsory form, which I do not advocate, the type of army, the type of defence force, that I am advocating in this resolution.  Every one of our sister States in the Commonwealth has that type of defence force, though I do not want to stress what other countries have done until we know the conditions in those other countries.  I say that if there is a concensus of opinion of this kind, and if, with different conditions and circumstances, they have come to this decision, then the retort that we need not consider what other countries do until we know their conditions loses some of its value, because the decision has been the same, although the conditions are very widely different.  For those reasons I urge the Dáil to consider this resolution, and ask the Executive Council to prepare, and as soon as may be, lay before the Dáil measures providing for the abolition of the standing army, that is to say, the army as it is at present organised, and to provide for the creation of a national militia, whether it be called militia, territorial force, or citizen force.</P>
    <P>In considering this resolution I have felt that it would not have been right or correct if a resolution in broad general terms had been put before the Dáil without being backed up by some <Col N="313" /> detailed and substantive scheme.  I, therefore, with others who have special competence in the matter, have drawn up such a scheme, copies of which have been circulated to Deputies.  I want to make it perfectly clear that this scheme is not put before the Dáil as if it were a scheme that ought to be adopted.  I am putting it before the Dáil as a possible scheme that could be adopted, just to show that the general terms of the resolution can be brought to fruition in some definite and concrete form.  Under the scheme of organisation the defence forces of the Saorstát would consist of three parts: (1) a standing force, (2) a militia force, (3) a reserve force.  I deal with each of those in turn.  The standing force, it is suggested, might consist of about 5,500, and where it is reduced to small numbers like that, not only is it possible to effect very considerable economies, but it is possible to take care to make a force of excellent quality.  It would require that, because the functions of the standing force would be responsible.  They have been outlined by me in this memorandum under the several heads.  The scheme would require (a) organising, training and administering the militia forces which would form the bulk of the defence forces of the Saorstát; (b) commanding and handling the whole defence forces in a competent manner, and (c) providing specially trained technical men that it would not be possible to secure at short notice. I only have suggested that it should consist of a certain number of men without descending to practical details. The actual constitution of such a force has been considered and is laid before the Dáil in this memorandum.  It is stated it should consist of the following force:&mdash;</P>

    <P>It will be found by those familiar with the subject that this would be a well-constructed, coherent force amounting to 5,550 men.  On that I wish to comment that an unusually large proportion of these would be officers, and especially N.C.O.'s.  Indeed, it would be desirable that upon occasion every man should be competent to be at least a corporal, in order thus to provide solid cadres for a much larger force.</P>
    <P>With regard to enlistment in the standing forces, it could be for either 1, 2 or 3 years.  There are certain considerations in that regard that have been detailed here, that could be entered into much more fully, the considerations being that the longer enlistment would ensure a certain number of men to give greater solidity, and the shorter enlistment would ensure a larger number of men passing through such a force and thus provide a substantial reserve.  With regard to location, it is suggested that the standing force should not be scattered in a number of small posts, but that it should be distributed in about a half dozen centres.  The effect of this would be enough permanent troops in each centre to enable the officers and staffs to acquire practice in handling bodies of a fair size, and to combine the several types of forces.  In this way all officers would have experience at all times of handling bodies of, roughly, 1,000 men of different arms and function.  Therefore, when at certain times of the year, the militia force was called up, officers would have the capacity to learn how to handle very much larger forces, amounting to several thousands at a time.</P>
    <P>That deals with the first section of the Defence Forces of the Saorstát under the General Draft Scheme that I am drawing up.  I have entitled the second section &ldquo;The Militia Force,&rdquo; and I would like to repeat what I said <Col N="315" /> earlier, that I attach no peculiar value to the word &ldquo;militia.&rdquo;  South Africa used the word &ldquo;citizen forces&rdquo; to describe this section of its armed forces. This standing force would be supplemented by a militia force.  The militia force would naturally considerably outnumber the standing force.  The units of the militia force would be required to undergo an annual training period of, say, one month in their recruit year and a fortnight in any subsequent year. In the case of units recruited in large towns, half the recruit-training period could be carried out by means of weekly drills, leaving only a fortnight to be performed in camp.  It is unnecessary to enter into details of such training. The methods adopted in other countries would be studied on the spot, and should be so studied before determining such details.  But it will be seen that, inasmuch as the General Staff&mdash; Administrative, Instructional and Inspecting&mdash;would be whole-time officers of the standing force, there would be no opportunity for lack of efficiency in such training.  I want to emphasise at this point that practically all the specially trained persons of the defence forces of the Saorstát would belong to the standing forces.  It stands to reason that you cannot rely upon territorial troops for special engineering work, for air force work, or special staff work. Those are permanent forces of the standing forces.  The only persons affected by the type of organisation I am bringing before the Dáil are those who constitute the ordinary infantry.  The constitution of the militia force would naturally be somewhat different from that of the standing force.  It would, for example, be necessary to provide for a larger proportion of infantry, which would be organised in battalions.  The number of men from the militia force to assist and augment the specially trained technical units of the nucleus of the standing force would by necessity be in a much smaller proportion.</P>
    <P>Now, I pass to the question of enlistment in the second section.  Enlistment in the militia force should be for not less than two or three years, as a shorter period would result in the men being insufficiently trained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> Re-enlistment, upon the expiration of the man's enlistment period, might be permitted in either the standing force or the militia force, from year to year, as thought advisable.</P>
    <P>When any member of the militia force was not under training, his arms and equipment would be kept in depôts at the centres of the standing force.</P>
    <P>I already dealt with the argument that might be raised against me as to possible Irregular activity.  It is the case that even if there were to be such Irregular activities in the future, the number of men available to the State would not be less than the number of men available at the present moment. If an emergency arose there would be available the standing force of 5,500. There would thus be available, at any moment in case of need:&mdash;In summer, the standing force, plus countrymen in training; in winter, the standing force, plus townsmen in training.</P>
    <P>There would be no danger of the militia force falling below the required strength.  It would be a paid force; and not only would the same conditions apply as apply to the present army, but a number of desirable men would be available, who would be glad to undertake training for their country's defence who are not now able or disposed to become whole-time professional soldiers.</P>
    <P>Now I come to a matter of very great importance in this scheme, and that is the number of men who would be required for the second section of the defence forces of the Saorstát.  I have laid it down at 25,000 men.  There would be in the defence forces 5,000 men in the standing nucleus and 25,000 available in the territorial additions. All that includes the third section of the defence forces of the Saorstát and the reserve.  The actual difference between the present method of organisation and the method laid down in this scheme is this: that whereas the present scheme consists of 15,000 men and a reserve, but no territorial addition, the proposed scheme would consist of 5,000 men as a standing force, instead of 15,000, with a territorial addition of 25,000, and also a reserve.  Such actually is the scheme of organisation that could be adopted.  It is put forward <Col N="317" /> as a possible scheme.  The proposition is put forward after careful thought.  It is right that any proposition put forward like this should of necessity show what the comparative costs are.  These comparative costs have been worked out for the present army and for the scheme proposed here. I have taken an allowance, as I said before, of £5 per man-week.  If that is thought excessive, then the alternative I offer to the Dáil has the advantage of a better price.  I have accepted that cost as the cost on which I would base the entire cost of the alternative now proposed&mdash;£5 per man-week, all in all.</P>
    <P>The defence forces of the Saorstát would cost the following figures:&mdash;The standing force £1,433,000, the militia force £500,000, giving a total of something a little under £2,000,000 per annum.  If Deputies will turn to the current Estimates they will find that the cost of the army for the financial year now closing was estimated at £4,000,000.  The alternative put forward here, if adopted, would cost £2,000,000, making a total saving of £2,000,000 to the Exchequer.  That saving would be effected under practically all the sub-heads of the Estimates, but under some sub-heads more than others.  This proposal existed in notes in my possession for the last two or three months.  That particular section by which an economy of £2,000,000 per annum could be effected was before me when last Tuesday week I read in the daily press of a proposal made in Cork city that all income tax on incomes accruing within the Saorstát should be remitted.  The figures that were put forward show, with whatever authority, that if such income tax were remitted the total cost to the Exchequer would be £2,000,000.  When the proposition was put to President Cosgrave he said to the proposer, &ldquo;Will you show me exactly where that £2,000,000 can be saved&rdquo;?  The proposer did not answer that, but I suggest that here is where the £2,000,000 might be saved.</P>
    <P>Accepting these figures, and the figures have been worked out with rather more care than possibly the others were, as a comparison I have drawn up a table which I think is a <Col N="318" /> fairly striking one.  I have taken the various sister states of the Commonwealth, other than Great Britain, their populations, their standing forces, their available forces, and the cost of their defence forces.  This is what we get. Canada, with a population of eight and three-quarter millions, has a standing force of 3,500, a total available force of 120,000, at a cost, in Irish money, of £2,250,000.  South Africa has a white population of one and a half millions. She has a standing force, known as a citizen force, of 1,750, a total available force of 135,000, at a cost to the South African Exchequer of £935,000.  Australia has a population of five and three-quarter millions, has a standing force of 3,000, a total available force of 118,000, at a cost of £2,000,000.  New Zealand has a population of one and a quarter millions, a standing force of 500, a total available force of 36,500, at a cost of £500,000.  Canada, with nearly three times our population, has an army that costs £2,000,000 per annum less than ours.  Australia, with nearly twice our population, has an army that costs her £2,000,000 per annum less than ours.  The total strength for all these States, with a population of seventeen and a quarter millions, of the standing forces is 8,750, with a total available force of 309,500, at a total cost of £5,500,000.  That means that populations totalling seventeen and a quarter millions, dealing with different circumstances, in different parts of the world, spend very little more than fifty per cent. more than we spend with our population of three and one-quarter millions.  The figures are I think, fairly striking and conclusive.</P>
    <P>I urge on the Dáil that it is time Deputies gave consideration to the form our permanent forces should take, and what type of army we should have.  I urge on the Dáil that our condition does not require a standing army of a costly nature.  Whatever else may be urged, at any other time, the present moment is one in which drastic economy must be made, if there is to be any revival of commerce and trade, and any end of the present problem of unemployment.  In conclusion I ask the Dáil to remember that in considering this proposal it is <Col N="319" /> not considering something that is going to be brought into effect to-morrow. If this resolution were to be accepted, or the substance of it, a change could not be effected before the end of three years.  A change could hardly be effected before two years from now, because you are dealing with the preparation of a scheme, the passing of legislative proposals, and the adoption of an entirely new institution&mdash;a change from one type to another&mdash;by slow and gradual measures.  Inasmuch as we are dealing with a period so far ahead, and dealing with circumstances that are pressing, I urge on the Dáil that this resolution should be accepted, and that the Minister be desired to lay proposals before it for its consideration this year, or at the beginning of next year.  In this resolution we are not asked to commit ourselves to anything finally.  We are merely asked to request the Minister. to go into this matter carefully, and, after due consultation with his advisers, to place proposals before the Dáil for its consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion, although I must say that the wording of the motion is liable to misinterpretation.  As described by Deputy Figgis, the motion is, I think, one which should commend itself to the Dáil and to the Minister, and I hope the Minister will accept it.  There are, as I have said, in the actual resolution certain words which might be changed.  The phrase, &ldquo;the abolition of a Standing Army and the creation of a National Militia&rdquo; is apt to be misinterpreted, but the intention of the motion has been fully explained by Deputy Figgis.  What he meant by &ldquo;Standing Army&rdquo; was an army such as we find in Great Britain at the present time.  I would certainly prefer that the defence forces of the country should be called an Army than that they should be a force known as a &ldquo;National Militia.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the general motion, I think it has been clearly explained by Deputy Figgis.  We discussed this evening a Defence Forces Bill, prolonging for another year the present arrangement with regard to the Army. <Col N="320" /> That, I think, was inevitable, under the circumstances, but at the same time it will mean a great loss of money to the State&mdash;a great waste of money&mdash; within the next twelve months, in view of the unnecessarily large number of soldiers at present in the Army who serve no useful purpose.  I do not refer to the officers, who are learning their jobs, or to the technical side of the Army which, far from wishing to see decreased, I hope will be increased in the future.  But we have several thousands of ordinary privates and non-commissioned officers who are actually doing nothing at the present time and who are of very little use to the country.  Some such scheme as that which was outlined by Deputy Figgis should be considered by the Minister when he comes to draw up his final Army Bill.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of this suggestion not only from the point of view of economy but also from the point of view of efficiency.  Under the present system, although I am sure officers and men are doing their best to acquire efficiency, the Army is not in a position to defend the country adequately, and it is not in a position, if the system be continued in its present form, to make it possible at the end of the next year and a half to fulfil the intentions of Article 6 of the Treaty.  Some such scheme as that which has been outlined by the Deputy will be essential if we are at the end of next year to fulfil what the signatories to the Treaty and those who ratified the Treaty had in mind when the Treaty was accepted for this country&mdash;that at the end of five years from the signing of the Treaty, this country should be in a position to take over its own defence from the British Imperial forces.  It is very important, I think, that we should get away from the idea, which has up to the present prevailed, that the Army is simply an armed police force for the purpose of suppressing Deputy Miss Mary MacSwiney.  It is a great expense to the taxpayers that Miss Mary MacSwiney should cost £4,000,000 in order to be suppressed.  We should get away from the idea that the only object of the Army is to suppress internal <Col N="321" /> trouble.  In fact, that is not the object of any army.  That is the object of a police force.  Such a scheme as has been outlined, although I do not agree with all its details&mdash;the details are largely for the Minister to consider&mdash;would tend towards the elasticity of the army and the possible development of the army into a force capable of defending the country against external aggression.</P>
    <P>I remember a phrase used, I think, by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Mulcahy, that the army was not the army of a party but was the army of the Irish people and stood for independence. It is very important that the army should not develop by stagnation into the army of a class or the army of a caste, but should be, as its name in the Irish language implies, a body organised and disciplined for the defence of the country.  That is impossible so long as the army is confined to a small number of permanent warriors such as exist in England and such as is described in this motion as a &ldquo;standing army.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The motion is not a very serious one and I do not think the Minister should be very much alarmed by it.  It does not suggest that he should produce this army immediately.  It only suggests that he should prepare and &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; lay before the Dáil such a proposal.  He has got plenty of time to do it.  But I think the Dáil should suggest that that is the line upon which the army should develop; that there should be a small nucleus of experts and trained officers, and that at the same time a wider field should be allowed to recruiting amongst the general mass of the population, in order that the young men of the country should have an opportunity of learning how to defend their country. I hope the Minister will accept this motion, which I second.</P>

      <P>Then my opposition to the motion, as originally drafted by Deputy Figgis, is stronger.  Though I agree with a great deal of what Deputy Fiiggis has said, though I agree that it is the duty of every man to learn how to defend his country, I cannot think that under existing conditions in this country that is a practical proposal. Deputy Figgis follows in illustrious footsteps.  The last man I found advocating the principle of a national militia was Lord Roberts.  Lord Roberts and Deputy Figgis&mdash;<i>par nobile fratrum</i> !  I only saw the memorandum, which has been supplied in connection with this motion, just now, and I did not hear all of what Deputy Figgis said.  There are one or two remarkable gaps in this memorandum.  It is not clearly stated whether service in this militia is to be compulsory or voluntary. In every national militia that I know, service is compulsory, or there is the element of compulsion, sometimes by ballot.  I think, from internal evidence, that the memorandum was drawn up intending service in this force to be compulsory, and that then the word &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo; was dropped out, because somebody suggested that it would not be expedient to suggest conscription in this country after an interval of only about 8 years.  If your service is to be compulsory, there are great difficulties.  How are you going to call up men who have a conscientious objection to the Saorstát&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>But there are many different ideas as to the kind of fighting that is desirable.  One of the dangers I foresee in adopting this scheme is that if, for instance, the North Mayo National Militia&mdash;I mention North Mayo because that constituency is unrepresented&mdash;come up to Athlone for training, and at the end of the training period express a desire to take their rifles home with them, how are you going to deal with them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>You can, of course, always shoot them down, but I do not think that is entirely desirable under this scheme.  On the other hand, if service in this militia is to be voluntary, we have to face two difficulties.  One is, you will never get training completed if you are going to have men coming in all the time.  You can train men very much more quickly if you get them all together at once.  I think Deputy Professor Thrift will agree with me that any form of instruction becomes impossible if you have new men coming into the class all the time and have to start from the beginning again and again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The alternative then is to enlist a certain number, and possibly to say:&mdash;&ldquo;We will call you up when you are wanted.&rdquo; That principle is adopted in the British territorial forces, and in no other body that I know of&mdash;I am not sure that it is not adopted in the Swiss militia.  I think the experience as shown in this country by the old militia was that the kind of man who will let himself in for a liability to be called up at a time that may suit the Government is not the best type of man.  You will not get the man with steady employment or with a farm of his own to undertake a liability like that.  You will get a few idealists like Deputy Figgis who will rejoice in the opportunity of serving their country, but you will not get 25,000 of them.  What you will get will be the men out of work, and even they will prefer to be enlisted straight off, and feel that they were provided for, rather than waiting about without a job for some indefinite call that may come in the future.  That is the first point I wish to make, that we should know whether service is to be compulsory or voluntary, and if it is compulsory, you should know how it is to be enforced.  The second point is: how is a national militia&mdash;to take Deputy Figgis's name&mdash;to be officered? Where are the N.C.O.'s to be found? You cannot train officers in a month. You cannot train N.C.O.'s in a month. Deputy Figgis has provided 200 administrative officers and N.C.O.'s as a permanent force to instruct the militia.  It is a low proportion to say that in modern armies there is one officer and <Col N="324" /> one senior N.C.O.&mdash;a sergeant at least, or a sergeant-major&mdash;to every fifty men. Therefore, this force of 25,000 men would require at least 500 officers and at least 500 senior N.C.O.'s.  I see no machinery in this memorandum for producing them.  Two hundred is the outside where you need one thousand. That is including the whole of the general staff.  One officer to fifty is a low proportion.  The proportion is nearer one to thirty, and that is with trained troops, not men with a month's training who are then called up for a week or a fortnight as a refresher course.</P>
    <P>This memorandum has borrowed the Canadian system without borrowing the keynote of that system, and that is the Royal Military College at Kingston. Officers are trained there for the militia.  They do a course, not of a week, not of a month, not of a year, but of five years, and that is a very highly efficient establishment.  There is no provision for that in this memorandum, and no provision for the cost of it.  In the same way in Australia, officers are trained at courses lasting. I think, four years.  The officers in the New Zealand forces are trained in the same establishment by arrangement with the Australian Government.  I am not sure about South Africa.  There is apparently no provision for the training of officers and senior N.C.O's in this memorandum at all.</P>
    <P>The next thing is the period for training.  Deputy Figgis proposes that this militia should be called up for a month at first, and subsequently for a fortnight.  You can dismiss the fortnight. I know something about militia training.  When you get men coming straight from civil life, you spend that fortnight learning them what they learned before.  You do not advance in your instruction.  How can you train a soldier in a month?  I do not know what experience Deputy Figgis has had, but I should say it was impossible.  Certainly you cannot train a man to be an expert shot and to use his rifle properly in a month. That is a thing which requires at least six months, unless you are going to dispense rifle and erect ranges over the country and allow men to go out <Col N="325" /> and do musketry in the evening, as is done under the Swiss system.  I am afraid if you do that there might sometimes be a little confusion about the target, and they might take a running target rather than the one put up for them.</P>
    <P>Seriously, a soldier cannot be made in a month unless he has some previous knowledge.  Under the Australian system the boys are given military training at school.  The Australian boy at, I think, sixteen years, goes into a cadet corps compulsorily and does four years' cadet training before he goes into the Australian national militia.  There is no provision for that in this scheme.  That involves the element of compulsion.  Therefore, we would have a force imperfectly trained, able to form fours and march about the barrack square; not trained in musketry, not trained in work in the open country&mdash;a force which, in my opinion, would be useless and dangerous and also insufficient.  How many men would there be to call on in a sudden emergency?  Remember, if you want to call out the whole militia you have got to get them to mobilisation centres which are to be about half-a-dozen. You have got to issue equipment.  They would not be available possibly for a week.  You have only got for an emergency 5,000 of the present force&mdash;that is excluding non-combatants&mdash;5,000 fighting men at the outside and that portion of the force that was in training. It is not quite clear from the memorandum whether you are going to take in 25,000 per year or whether they are to be spread over three years.  We will assume the former.  There is only a proportion of the 25,000 men doing training.  They do a month's training. That would only give a little over 2,000 men in training for a certain emergency, that the State will be able to lay its hand on by denuding every garrison, by giving up the whole of the rest of the country, if a disturbance breaks out in Dublin.  The margin of safety is too low.</P>
    <P>There are other points.  There is the cost of travelling.  The cost of travelling has not been considered.  If you are going to have all the arms in half-a-dozen centres you have to pay for <Col N="326" /> travelling to these centres.  Assuming that the centres are the principal military centres at present&mdash;Dublin, The Curragh, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Athlone&mdash;you have got to bring men from Tirconaill to Athlone.  That is not a cheap proposition, even if the unified railways do give preferential rates.  The whole thing is full of pitfalls that nobody but the man who has some technical knowledge can possibly see.</P>
    <P>There are one or two things the Minister can do.  I would like to put them to him now.  Firstly, there is the question of the want of a reserve.  At present we are dangerously weak in reserves and the Minister should, if possible, try to ensure that every new recruit taken into the army undertakes liability, not only to serve two years, but to serve in the reserve for a period of at least six years.  Any pension that is given should be contingent on the pensioner undertaking liability for terms of service.  That gives us some means of expansion.  We also need to expand in officers, and I think it would be a very desirable thing if the Minister would consider the possibility of starting an officers' training corps in the two universities&mdash;both in the National and in Trinity&mdash;a voluntary officers' training corps.  Nobody need join if they do not like, but a certain number of people who, at any rate, knew the rudiments of their duty could be made very useful.  I have some experience of British officers' training, and the members of these corps were more useful than the raw men who had to learn the job from the beginning.  These two things, I think, could be done, and if the Minister would also, as I said earlier this evening on another Bill, look into the question of guards, I think by reducing the number of such guards he could also reduce the strength of the army.  I do not think that we could permanently contemplate an army on the present strength, but we ought to try to build up an army by extensions and otherwise in case of necessity.</P>

      <P>It is the case that an application for a large grant for renovation purposes has been made by the Trustees of the Lough Corrib Drainage District.  I understand that the Trustees seek to throw upon the Government some responsibility for the present defective state of the drainage area on account of alleged errors in the execution of the works, for which the Board of Works of that time and <Col N="235" /> their engineers were responsible.  However, as these works were completed as far back as 1859, it seems to me to be a fruitless proceeding to proceed now to inquire into the merits of the matter, more particularly as the Government of the time carried out most of the work at its own expense.</P>
      <P>The Trustees, undoubtedly, have a substantial grievance, and a real excuse for the state of neglect into which their district has fallen, in the fact that it has proved impracticable to collect drainage maintenance rates from the large numbers of tenant purchasers who have replaced the previous landowners. This is a state of affairs which may have to be met by a considerable adjustment of present arrangements, and this, I fear, might require legislation. As a result of the discussion of this matter which has been in progress, an engineer from the Office of Public Works has gone down to Galway to discuss the position with the engineer of the Drainage Trustees and their advisors.  He will also make an examination of the district when weather conditions permit.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission have gazetted untenanted lands comprising 631 acres 3 roods 9 perches of the townland of Drumlargan, County Meath, on the estates of A.A. Bomford, for acquisition under the Land Act, 1923.  It is not possible at present to say when the lands will be vested in the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>The lands of Drumlargan on the Rolley Estate, which are also referred to in the question, do not appear to be untenanted, but constitute a holding which is subject to a judicial tenancy. The estate will in due course be vested in the Land Commission, and will be dealt with by the Commissioners in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</P>
