      <P>I beg to move that the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Bill, 1925, do now pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>In one of the newspapers this morning there is published a report of a statement made by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in respect to this Bill. In that statement he makes it known that, in his view, at any rate, the Bill will not interfere with any local authority in making a local purchase, unless the price paid is higher than the official contractor's price.  I think we should understand where we are in this matter.  I have not had much time to make a comparison between the statement made by the Minister and the Bill that is proposed, but with a little patience on the part of the Dáil I may be able to point out that the statement made by the Minister as to his view of what the Bill contains is not in accordance with the facts.  Section 2 of the Bill states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It shall be the duty of the Minister to take all such steps as may be desirable to enable local authorities to obtain jointly from one or more suitable contractors such supplies of any commodity as may be required by them in the performance of their duties.</P>
      <P>Now I will come to Section 3 of this Bill, and it is set out in Section 3:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The Minister may as and when and in such manner as he thinks <Col N="1632" /> proper give public notice that he will, within a specified time, receive applications from persons desirous of being appointed to be official contractors under this Act for a specified period in respect of one or more specified commodities.</P>
    <P>(2)  Every application for appointment as an official contractor shall be made in writing in the prescribed form and shall contain the prescribed particulars, including a statement of the price at which the applicant is willing to supply to local authorities the commodity to which the application relates...</P>
    <P>That would mean including a statement of the price at which the applicant is willing to supply local authorities everywhere in the Saorstát.  Now we come on to Section 6, wherein it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Whenever a local authority purchases or enters into a contract for the purchase of any commodity for which an official contractor has been appointed under this Act with a person who is not an official contractor for such commodity, an entry shall be made in the minutes of such local authorities stating the reasons for such purchase or contract...</P>
    <P>(3)  At any such audit, unless the auditor is satisfied that such purchase or contract was not made for any fraudulent or improper purpose or object or for any object other than the bona fide discharge by the members of the local authority making or authorising the making thereof of their duties in the interests of the ratepayers, he shall charge against such members jointly and severally the amount of any loss caused to the local authority by such purchase or contract, whether such loss arises from the price paid for the commodity or from the quality of the commodity so obtained or otherwise howsoever, and in the case of a contract if in his opinion any such loss as aforesaid is likely to result from the continuance of the contract, he may declare such contract to be illegal.</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussion the President has pointed out frequently, and did so no less than a couple of days <Col N="1633" /> ago, that the local authority would not be allowed to purchase at a lower price than the contractor's price if the purchase was made after the contractor's price had been made public in any form.  That was the implication of his statement.  The implication was that if one public body learned in the course of its contracting that the contractor's price for a specific article was £X, then no other local body would be allowed to purchase from a local contractor at lower than that contractor's price.  If they purchased at that price locally it would be incumbent upon the local authority to prove to the auditor that they had no fraudulent intention and they would have to prove to the auditor that there was better service and better quality given and better satisfaction generally, the price not being the only consideration.</P>
    <P>I maintain that the provisions of this Bill do not support the statement made by the Minister for Local Government, if he is reported correctly.  They do not sustain the claim that he made, which is that a local authority would be free to purchase from a local contractor if the price were the same, or lower. I think it is necessary that public attention should be drawn to the difference between the Bill and the Minister's interpretation of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had an opportunity of reading the Minister's speech, or of hearing it.  I might state, briefly, that the idea underlying this measure is, as I have already explained, to enable local authorities to purchase commodities at the lowest possible price.  In order to secure that there will be a sufficient amount of competition for any articles which will be required, it will be realised that the competition should take place on the same date.  Any other proposal than that would mean that the contractor, not being satisfied that he would get the whole of the business of any particular commodity or commodities, would naturally have to make an alteration in the price at which he would tender.  Certainly in the majority of cases that would happen if he were not satisfied that he was going to get all the business. That lesser business would naturally mean in most cases an increase in <Col N="1634" /> price.  The rights and the privileges of ratepayers in local areas are still secured.  If the local authority advertise for particular commodities at the same time as the Central Purchasing Board and if the price in these cases is equal to or less than the Central Authority's price, there is an opportunity for a much bigger business I should say on the part of that local contractor.  To that extent, if the Minister made that statement, I should say he was perfectly correct, but we cannot hope to get the very best out of this measure if it were made known that, immediately a particular contractor was notified for any one commodity, it would be open to every trader in the country to supply the local authority at that particular price, or at a lower price.  The whole basis of this central purchasing is to get the best articles at the cheapest price and where any industrial or manufacturing concerns exist for the provision of certain articles, there should be some inducement to manufacturers, even in a small way, to extend their premises by reason of their getting the whole of the business. Several examples of that have occurred and it is hoped that by reason of the passing of this measure further extensions and developments will be inaugurated in those industries or businesses which supply the commodities that will be required.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In the Title, line 6, to insert the word &ldquo;pictorial&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;advertisements.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that I should apologise to the Dáil for bringing on this list of amendments to the Bill at such an advanced stage of its progress.  That it is an <Col N="1635" /> admirable Bill is evidenced by the fact that it has reached this stage without a single comment unfavourable to it being made by any member of the Dáil.  I should have supported with pleasure the Second Reading had I been here, and I had intended on the Committee Stage to indicate the views, so far as they could be gathered, of the Appeal Board of Film Censorship with respect to these proposals.  The Bill, as I have said, is positively, so far as it goes, excellent.  But in the opinion which I take the liberty of expressing it might have gone further, and it is to draw attention to one limitation of its scope that I move this apparently verbal amendment, to introduce the word &ldquo;pictorial&rdquo; before &ldquo;advertisements&rdquo; in the Title, so as to read: &ldquo;An Act to provide for the control of pictorial advertisements of cinematograph pictures.&rdquo;  I fully recognise that to propose a censorship of reading matter would be very bold and would, doubtless, create a great amount of discussion, would produce perhaps endless controversy, and I do not believe that the country is ripe, or, it is possible, would ever be ripe, for a drastic proposition of this kind to meet with general approval.  But I draw a distinction, which is a very obvious line of distinction, between censoring books and pamphlets and censoring written matter in the form of the advertising stuff that is provided sometimes to the film exhibitor by the renter.</P>
    <P>If you will allow me I will show to the House examples of what I have before my mind, because the object lesson in education, it is notorious, is of more value than mere verbal lecturing.  It is the practice to serve out, along with the film picture that is to be displayed in the cinematograph theatre, a lot of what is called, in the American language, &ldquo;Teaser Paragraphs.&rdquo;  These are to stimulate interest, to excite discussion about the picture and in that way draw a larger audience.  For this &ldquo;teaser&rdquo; campaign of the film &ldquo;Tess of the D'Urbervilles,&rdquo; sometimes more accurately, if facetiously described as &ldquo;Tess of the Dirty Fields,&rdquo; you have these suggestions:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1636" />&ldquo;Copy is furnished here in advance for your regular exploitation campaign. This copy is suitable for either posters, snipe bills, tack cards, throwaways or newspaper display ads.&rdquo; Here is one of the &ldquo;teaser&rdquo; paragraphs:&mdash;&ldquo;Tess of the D'Urbervilles avenged her betrayed love.  Do you blame her?&rdquo;&mdash;subject for debating societies, Dorcas meetings, Church Society functions, and afternoon tea parties.  &ldquo;Tess of the D'Urbervilles told her husband the truth about her past, and lost him.  Was she wise?&rdquo;&ldquo;Tess of the D'Urbervilles trapped her betrayer and made him pay the penalty.  Was she justified?  Do you condemn her?&rdquo;&ldquo;Tess of the D'Urbervilles punished one whom the law failed to convict.  Was she justified?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Take again some of these advertising pictures which contain a large amount of Press matter:&mdash;&ldquo;Like a frightened bird she struggled in his arms.  The heart of humanity is thrilled with the story of Tess.  It has come to symbolise a pure woman caught in the toils of relentless fate.&rdquo;  I need not inflict more of these catch lines and teaser pars. upon your notice, but it is well to know that in England these very advertisements that I am reading to you provoked the attention of a society of exhibitors and were discussed, and the English agent of the firm in question apologised.  His apology, I think, is of value as indicating the danger that I am trying to impress upon the Minister as a danger. I am quite willing to concede that our <Col N="1637" /> papers, in Dublin especially, are exceedingly careful with regard to the type of advertising matter that they allow to appear in their pages, but what has happened in England might happen here, and through the very same cause.  Mr. Howe is the advertising manager of the firm that issued this official exploitation statement, and he wrote in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are sorry that we should have been instrumental in the construction of such a detestable advertisement&rdquo;&mdash; that was the advertisement, including what I have read out&mdash;&ldquo; As you know, we have at all times fought against anything that would reflect discreditably upon the industry.  In this instance the phraseology referred to was taken from an American publication and inadvertently allowed to go through.&rdquo; Considering that these sheets are supplied along with the film, it is hard to understand how the inadvertence comes in&mdash;&ldquo;We like to assist exhibitors with forceful selling matter.&rdquo;  They have a very appropriate name for the forceful selling matter, namely, &ldquo;punch pars.&rdquo;  He goes on:&mdash;&ldquo;You will admit that this case has been aggravated by the way in which the text is displayed; but it has served its purpose, because we shall in future, more than ever, guard against the few undesirable exhibitors who foolishly cajole themselves into the belief that this class of announcement is profitable, without regard for the welfare of the trade.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Chairman of the Irish Censorship Board put up this point to the representatives of the exhibitors of Great Britain the rejoinder was:&ldquo;It is the exhibitor's own fault if he uses this material.  True, we provide it to him, but he need not use it; he is under no necessity to use it.&rdquo;  When it is used, here is one of the consequences, and it is because of these consequences that I am dwelling upon the matter.  The House is probably aware that many of the firms that receive our Censor's licence have received it after the film picture has been considerably cut, that is, after the objectionable scenes have been eliminated, or after the objectionable part of what are generally known as the sub-titles&mdash;the reading matter&mdash;<Col N="1638" /> have been expunged.  On several occasions, to my own knowledge, the whole spirit, the tenor of the story has been altered by the omission or cuts demanded by the Censor, but the advertising matter that was supplied to the newspapers enabled the reader of it to enter the cinema and behold, for all purposes of the impression made upon his mind, the original picture.  You see, there is what is called &ldquo;The ready to use Press picture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here is an example of ready to use advertising matter in connection with a picture called &ldquo;The Slave of Desire.&rdquo; This is provided, and all the exhibitor has to do is to tear the sheet where it is arranged like postage stamps, fill in the blanks, and the criticism appears then as if expressive of local opinion upon the film exhibited.  I say nothing about the false character of the criticism in so far as it professes to be a local criticism.  Here is what happens. A very objectionable story is made unobjectionable by cuts, receives the Censor's certificate, and is exhibited in a Dublin cinema, but the programme or the advertising puff in the Dublin papers gives an account of the story as it was before it was thus edited.  The result is that everyone can catch the sequence of certain remaining scenes which, without the cue supplied in those puffing paragraphs, would be quite harmless, particularly to youthful spectators. Hardened and seasoned adults, with a wide and full experience of life, would be able to detect the inner and evil significance of the situation without that assistance, but fully ninety per cent. of the audience, without this reading matter, would never suspect even that the story had the original character it had.  I quite realise the difficulty. It is that the Minister cannot very well or at once frame a section which would authorise the Censor to deal with the printed matter that is provided to the exhibitor.</P>
    <P>All through the Bill in so far as it deals with advertisements, it is with pictorial advertisements.  Consequently, in describing the reference, or scope, of the Bill, as to pictorial advertisements, we are really giving the more accurate description, but to be quite candid I put down the amendment to give an <Col N="1639" /> opportunity of ventilating this shortcoming of the censorship provision.  No one can exaggerate, even if he tried to exaggerate, the extent and depth of influence on the growing generation that is being exercised by the cinema.  It is the popular high school.  It is the university of the people, and most of what they are going to learn about life and conduct they will learn by the visible, actual example shown to them on the screen.  Therefore, anyone who fully realises that fact will understand that we cannot be too critical or too exact, without going to the length of being puritanical and grandmotherly, in our legislation in safeguarding the young from the deleterious and dangerous influences we know are there. The Minister may, at a later stage, introduce a further amending Bill.  If so, I should rejoice to know that he would attempt to deal with this, which is, I admit, a very difficult problem in some fashion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the amendment. I take it amendment one is in question.  It deals with the Title, which usually comes last.  I take it that the purpose of the Deputy, as his words explain, is to put in the word &ldquo;pictorial,&rdquo; but all his arguments went to show that it was not merely pictorial advertisements that had to be controlled.  It does not seem to me wise to insert the word &ldquo;pictorial&rdquo; and then to have to limit certain later sections of the Bill.  It seems to me, judging by the extracts from the advertisement which Deputy Magennis has read, and by our observations, that however unwilling we may be, as a general practice, to use a censorship with regard to printed matter, we have to recognise that the exploitation of the new science and art of pictorial presentation by means of moving pictures is in the hands of people, at least on the commercial side, who have not any long-established tradition of decency, while we may realise in the ordinary publishing world it is doubtfully wise, probably decidedly unwise, to establish a formal censorship.  That <Col N="1640" /> is largely because of the fact that the publishing world has had a long tradition, and it is only the meaner and degraded people, the few that there may be in that trade, that are likely to take advantage of their opportunity to spread degradation.  I am afraid there is within the world of films, on the exploitation side&mdash;that is, on the publication side&mdash;a large number of people who are prepared to use their opportunities to excite curiosity of an unpleasant-kind and that the facts are, whatever we might like in the matter, that that must be restrained and that the censorship, such as has been established, is necessary.  I think that the censorship will be bound to apply to advertisements which are not merely pictorial.</P>
      <P>I do not quite appreciate the point of the Minister in accepting the amendment, because I think it would necessitate some alteration in the form of the Bill which he has presented, and I rose with the object of finding out what his real views are in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I accepted the amendment, because, in my opinion, the Title, so amended, would constitute a more exact description of the scope of the Bill than the Title as it now stands.  We had not contemplated, and we would have considerable difficulty in contemplating, the extension of the censorship to printed matter.  It is something that would want to be very fully considered, if it was to be taken on at all, just where it would begin and where it would end, whether it would extend to advertisements in the Press or comments in the Press, and so on, with regard to the pictures.  I think it is a reasonable enough stand to take that the censorship shall concern itself with the pictures and with pictorial advertisements of such pictures.  To be led further along the path, into the attempted censorship of printed matter, would be doubtful wisdom and very difficult administratively.  In any case, it is something that would need greater consideration than we have been able to give it.  My sole reason for accepting the Deputy's amendment is, that I believe his suggested title would constitute <Col N="1641" /> a more exact description of the scope of the Bill than the Title as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The examples quoted by the Deputy suggest that, associated with the picture, there is a letterpress.  It is the combination which creates the objectionable material. Now according to this proposal, it is only the picture that matters.  If the picture passes, you have no authority over the written matter which explains the picture, and it is written matter, in conjunction with the picture, that might raise the objection.  That is the difficulty I see.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2:&mdash;&ldquo;In page 2, Section I, to delete lines 23-27.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has no meaning except in conjunction with amendment 4. It is preparatory to it.  The words in the lines indicated are: &ldquo;The expression &lsquo;exploitation sheet&rsquo; means the document commonly known by that name amongst persons engaged in the trade of exhibiting pictures by means of a cinematograph or other similar apparatus, or the making, distribution, or renting of such pictures.&rdquo;  Now the later amendment, as will be seen in due course, proposes to deal with a great deal more than the &ldquo;exploitation sheet,&rdquo; and it is to clear the way for that larger provision that I propose to leave out of the definition clause all the words relating to the &ldquo;exploitation sheet.&rdquo;  Some of the firms call this the &ldquo;exploitation supplement.&rdquo;  Others call it the &ldquo;exhibitors' advertising campaign,&rdquo; and the usual term in the trade journals is the &ldquo;publicity sheet.&rdquo; As we are all familiar with the boast of the lawyers that they could drive a coach-and-four through an Act of Parliament, we are equally familiar with what it is that provides the gateway for their feat&mdash;namely, that things are named which do not exhaust all that was meant.  One producer issues an &ldquo;exploitation sheet,&rdquo; another an &ldquo;advertising campaign,&rdquo; and another a &ldquo;publicity sheet.&rdquo;  It might, very well, be argued in a court that the sheet I have in my hand is not an &ldquo;exploitation sheet.&rdquo;  It is, as its name <Col N="1642" /> declares, an &ldquo;exhibitor's advertising campaign,&rdquo; or in the case of that other sheet which I exhibited a few moments ago, a &ldquo;ready-to-use press book.&rdquo;  So really the generic name would be &ldquo;publicity sheet.&rdquo;  I am not making any argument upon that point, because what I really want to do, as I have explained, is to get this out of the way in the interests of Amendment No. 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that amendments 2 and 4 rather hang together.  Amendment No. 2 would delete the definition of &ldquo;exploitation sheet&rdquo; and, having done that, amendment No. 4 would substitute &ldquo;the actual photographic or other reproduction or pictorial representation, intended to be sold or otherwise to be provided as advertising matter to the exhibitor of the film picture in relation to which the application is made.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As drafted, this Bill provides that the document known in the trade as the &ldquo;exploitation sheet,&rdquo; which contains all the posters prepared by the manufactures of the film, shall be forwarded to the Censor, together with the film.  The posters are in miniature. The Deputy's amendment, if I understand it correctly, aims at securing that the full-size posters will be before the Censor, in addition, of course, to the film itself, and the &ldquo;exploitation sheet,&rdquo; containing the posters in miniature. The Censor can examine the small picture and, if he has any doubt as to whether the full-size poster would be objectionable, while, possibly, the miniature is not, he can, before passing the &ldquo;exploitation sheet,&rdquo; require to be furnished with a full-size poster.  Presumably, in the event of a refusal, he can hold up the picture and hold up the &ldquo;exploitation sheet.&rdquo;  If that is a fair presentation of the matter, I think that the Bill, as drafted, is sufficiently strong, and that it is unnecessary to accept the amendments.  If it is a fact that this &ldquo;exploitation sheet&rdquo; contains, in miniature, all the posters and all the advertising pictures to be used in relation to a particular film, and, if the Censor, as is the case, can hold up that or can move on and call for, if he thinks it necessary, a full-size poster, under pain of holding up the entire <Col N="1643" /> picture in the event of refusal, I think that constitutes an adequate safeguard.</P>

      <P>The danger I am trying to obviate is that, under the guise of advertising matter in aid of a film-picture, the degradation of public morals and general debasement may be secured, in spite of the Censor of Films.  The House probably is not aware that when the Censor refuses a certificate for a proposed film, the renter is entitled, on payment of a fee of £5&mdash;which may be returned to him in the event of his succeeding in his appeal&mdash;to have the judgment of an appeal board.  The appeal board consists of unpaid members.  Most of <Col N="1644" /> them&mdash;in fact, all of them&mdash;at the present time, are very busy men and women.  The task that is put upon the Censor and upon that board of appeal, in turn, is to deal with what comes in.  Look at the extent of this sheet, which I hold in my hand.  It is for a film entitled &ldquo;Wine,&rdquo; and it is the &ldquo;exhibitor's advertising campaign.&rdquo;  That is only one sheet in connection with one film.  The Censor has to decide whether or not that illustration is indecent or suggestive of something that would be regarded as indecency, or whether its general effect is subversive of public morality.  In the interval of waiting for this debate during the week, I have shown sheets like this to some of our colleagues in the House.  It has taken some of them quite a considerable time to make up their minds as to whether that little block, enlarged to the dimensions to which it would be exhibited outside a country cinema, would be the right kind of exhibit for our country people.  Suppose it were enlarged. The Censor and, after the Censor, the members of the Board of Appeal, have not alone to deal with that, but to deal with all these that I have in my hand. There is quite a number of them. Some of them are shown here as three inches by two inches, but in certain cases, as in that case, they would be enlarged to the size of huge posters. It is very hard to make up one's mind as to what the impression of that picture would be upon growing youth in a country place.  Neither the Censor nor any member of the Board of Appeal is entitled to say, &ldquo;I like that well enough; that would do me no harm.&rdquo; He is in a very difficult position and, at times, almost in the impossible position psychologically, of having to put his own personality out of the matter, and imagine himself what he is not. He must try to decide what effect upon the soul of that other person he imagines himself for the time being to be, is likely to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to &ldquo;exploitation sheets&rdquo; and &ldquo;throw-aways&rdquo; and all the rest of it, you have presentation matter, which is handed out as a souvenir.  I invite the attention of the House to this booklet&mdash;&ldquo;Southern Love.&rdquo;  That <Col N="1645" /> might be presented without ever coming before the Censor or the Board of Appeal.  That publication has a harmless cover; we take then the beautifully produced illustrations in the body of it; and now we come to the centre of it. Supposing that is exhibited in Cahirciveen or Ballinasloe, what will be thought about it by mothers or fathers? Could the Censor pass the entire advertising unit, knowing full well it contains that?  The obvious answer is that he must reject the total thing.  But that need not come before him at all. Furthermore, what the Minister, with all respect, has overlooked, in his reply to me, is that the local exhibitor may produce his own advertising matter. That is not covered.  Consequently, in amendment No. 4&mdash;which, if passed, would render any reference to the &ldquo;exploitation sheet&rdquo; unnecessary&mdash;I add the words: &ldquo;the actual photographic or other reproduction or pictorial representation intended to be sold or otherwise to be provided as advertising matter to the exhibitor of the film-picture in relation to which the application is made.&rdquo;  As a rule, the renter who sends along his films and, subsequently, gives a trade show, so as to receive orders from exhibitors, would not dream of providing all this stuff by way of illustration.  Very often it is too expensive.  It would be quite easy for the renter to make up his mind beforehand which of these illustrations he intends to provide to an Irish exhibitor and let him submit those along with his film-picture.  The work imposed upon the Censor and later, possibly, upon the Appeal Board, would be very much reduced in consequence. It is hard enough to decide with regard to the film, without being called upon to decide also upon all sorts and varieties of illustrations that may, in practice, never come into the country at all.  It is a needless expenditure of energy.</P>
    <P>I have an illustration here which appears to be what Deputy Johnson said a few moments ago.  Personally, I should hold that that picture by itself is harmless and unobjectionable.  But taken with the printed matter that accompanies it, which shows that that is the initial stage of an indecent assault, <Col N="1646" /> that that is an attempt upon the virtue of this girl, it then becomes objectionable. The Censor may pass the block and afterwards find clergymen in a district denouncing him for negligence and disregard of his duty, when he has been most careful.  His hands are tied.</P>
    <P>This whole matter of advertising&mdash; especially pictorial advertising&mdash;in connection with the films, creates a far greater difficulty, I submit, than the censoring of the films themselves.  Anything that can minimise the difficulty or make the position easier or facilitate matters, and make the censorship less opne to unfavourable criticism subsequently, would be a great advantage, not merely to the Censor's office, but to the public at large.  Therefore, I do not think it is too much to ask the firm to provide the actual illustration. Remember, we are dealing with firms that expend huge sums of money on production.  Yesterday afternoon I had to see a film which, the producer informed me, cost £150,000 to produce. Surely, to provide the Censor with a copy of a 17s. or 11s. or 9s. poster, in addition to exhibiting the film, is not imposing prohibitive expenditure upon these firms with colossal capital.</P>
    <P>I submit, with all respect, that the actual portraiture&mdash;the actual picture&mdash; is what ought to come first under the criticism of the Censor, and not something that is remotely or proximately at the best indicative of its character. The colouring makes an enormous difference to some of these posters, especially where semi-nude figures are in question, and what is harmless enough and might be passed by anyone not too prudish, could not be permitted and could not be tolerated in colour for promiscuous and general exhibition on the posters in a town.  Inside a picture gallery, where these things are for the entertainment of people of culture, or where they are for the higher education of those aspiring to culture, these things are absolutely right, and I would contend defensible, but as a stimulus to pruriency, as sensational items and as things intended to appeal to the lower instincts, they should not be tolerated to deface the hoardings of our towns or villages.</P>
    <P>I do not want to speak any more <Col N="1647" /> upon the matter, but I would urge this on the House, that I am putting before you the experience of some eighteen months of the working of the last Act. That was a most excellent Act, and this, I suggest, will make it still more excellent.  I am seeking to introduce this slight alteration, not at all in any spirit of opposition to the proposition of the Minister, but quite in the spirit of support for all the great work that he has done for the nation in this regard. It is only after two or three generations that the Irish public will be able to appreciate the great benefits that have accrued to the nation from the fact that the Minister introduced that measure, and made it the stringent measure it is.</P>
    <P>The Minister will perhaps be gratified to know that the statements made by the Censor Board through the Chairman some time ago to representatives of the trade have gone around the whole world.  There is scarcely a single newspaper in the whole civilised world that has not dwelt upon this and that has not held up the Irish Free State as an example.  There were articles in Italian newspapers as well as in Australian and New Zealand papers.  There was a proposition from some of the American cities to introduce a State censorship on the Irish model.  Therefore, I would assure the Minister that in resisting his suggestion that the present Bill is ample enough in regard to illustrations, I am acting, not in opposition, but as one who appreciates very much all that he has done and all that he is seeking to do in regard to film censorship.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the Deputy's amendment does not effect all that he claimed for it when expounding and advocating it.  The amendment proposes to substitute the following words: &ldquo;The actual photographic or other reproduction or pictorial representation intended to be sold or otherwise to be provided as advertising matter.&rdquo;  Now that requires a copy of the actual photograph, but it does not specify that the copy is to be full size and is to be in the same proportion as the actual poster to be exhibited.</P>

      <P>Then what about the full-sized posters the Deputy spoke of as something that would appear on the hoardings of towns and villages? My point is this, that there is nothing in the amendment which would compel the renter to forward to the Censor anything more than the photographic representation of that poster, and that consequently, whereas in miniature it may be sufficiently harmless, a full-size or a life-size presentation of the same picture would have a different effect.  That scarcely seems to be covered by the amendment.  The Deputy stated that his amendments are based on a year's experience of the working of the principal Act.  Of course the Deputy speaks with authority as Chairman of the Appeal Board. Without seeking in any way to pit the Deputy against the Censor, I might point out that the Bill, as drafted, has been prepared in close consultation with the Censor, who had necessarily an even closer and more intimate acquaintance of the principal Act and its administration than the Deputy.  The Censor considers its provisions reasonable and adequate, and has no suggestions to make of extensions such as the Deputy envisages.  I do not know whether the Deputy speaks for the Appeal Board collectively?</P>

      <P>I thought that was more or less implied.  There must be some limit to the burdens that we have to impose on the Censor, and also, although perhaps this is a small point, some conception of the physical limitations surrounding him.  This thing of full-size posters and of every scrap of <Col N="1649" /> literature and photographic advertisement in connection with films being poured into his office, does open up a rather appalling prospect of the Censor in a small room trying to work his way through perhaps dozens or scores of ten-feet posters, and to form an opinion as to whether or not they would be objectionable from the point of view of the youth of Ballydehob. The Bill, I think, is reasonable.  I have laid it down, and the Deputy, so far, has not questioned it, that this exploitation sheet which must be forwarded to the Censor, together with the films, will contain in miniature all the pictorial or photographic advertisements to be used in connection with the particular film.  There is also a provision in the Bill that no incident in the play which is deleted by the Censor on examination can be used as a pictorial advertisement of that play.  If, as I say, this exploitation sheet contains posters in miniature, it is open to the Censor if he considers that one of these miniatures might possibly be objectionable as a full-size or a life-size poster, to ask expressly and specifically for that poster.</P>
    </Speaker>

I am not prepared, after consideration of the amendment, to extend the scope of the Censor's duties other than what the Bill provides, and I ask the Dáil to take the view that the Bill provides adequate and reasonable precautions, and that the suggestions are scarcely practicable in an administrative way.</P>

The Censor is an official of my Department and I state here that this Bill was prepared in close consultation with the Censor; that, further, I have secured his views with regard to these particular amendments of the Deputy, and I would like to be clear whether the Deputy is expressly questioning them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>No, sir, I am not questioning anything the Minister stated.  I am arguing against what he states.  These arguments can be weighed and considered by the House and estimated whether they have little or no value, or any value.  I leave it at that. The Minister dealt with my amendment, I respectfully submit to him, without reading the clauses of his own Bill.  The section I seek to amend is Section 3 (1). That follows Section 2 (1), which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any person to display in public in relation to the exhibition of a picture by means of a cinematograph or other similar apparatus any photographic or other reproduction.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister's attention to these words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;any photographic or other reproduction of any part of such picture unless such picture, including the part thereof so reproduced, has been certified by the official Censor to be fit for exhibition in public.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment proposes to read in connection with Section 3 (1), where the words are: &ldquo;shall be accompanied by a copy of the exploitation sheet relating to the picture in respect of which the application is made&rdquo; by adding &ldquo;the actual photographic or other reproduction or pictorial representation,&rdquo; etc.  It ought to be obvious that these words in my amendment are the words out of the preceding Section 2 (1), namely, &ldquo;any photographic or other reproduction of any part of such picture.&rdquo; What I submit is that to the Censor there should be proposed for his criticism not all this mass of matter that I have already shown you, complex sheets for innumerable pictures, <Col N="1651" /> not the small, but the actual poster or the actual photograph which it is intended to provide to the exhibitor here. That would not impose extra work upon the Censor.  On the contrary, it would diminish the amount of his work. Instead of devoting time to the close scrutiny of the smaller representations he could, at a glance, come to his decision with regard to the large poster. It is quite easy to see whether or not it is objectionable.  There may be a difficulty later with regard to storage.</P>
    <P>Now, on this subject of the Censor, he is a salaried officer of the Ministry of Justice, and the Minister has told us that he has produced this measure in close consultation with the Censor.  I also was in close consultation with the Censor, on behalf of my colleagues and myself on the Appeal Board, and, so far as I am aware, the Censor and I are of one opinion in regard to these reforms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so. Quite definitely it is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  I will not embroil the Censor in the controversy, as he is a public official.  I will speak, therefore, exclusively from my own experience, and that of my colleagues. There are several exploitation sheets.  It is always possible, besides, for the exhibitor to produce matter of his own; it is possible, as I pointed out to the House, that additional matter may be produced for distribution.  If the Minister believes, as obviously he does, that it is easier to call upon the Board of Appeal to give their time and their busy day discussing and entering into discussion on all the details of these little pictures, then he knows more about the mind of the Board of Appeal than I do.  No one has any conception of the vast amount of time that is involved in the discharge of these responsibilities of censoring films, of deciding what may or may not come before a general audience.  Now, admission must be paid for in order to go into the cinema to see the film; but these posters are exposed to everyone outside&mdash;that is part of the publicity campaign&mdash;and the Board of Appeal will be called in, no doubt, on occasions <Col N="1652" /> where the renter of the film thinks he is aggrieved by rejection on the part of the Censor of his proposed advertising matter, and the Board of Appeal then will be called upon to adjudicate, and to go into all these niceties.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to realise what that means, and what he is imposing on the Board of Appeal.  As you will see from the later amendment, it is very difficult to get the Board of Appeal to sit with a proper quorum at proper times.  How much will the difficulty be enhanced if they are to consider whether three-by-two, as enlarged to eight-by-four, in colour, would be objectionable, or whether three-by-two does not seem to be objectionable.  The question is really a question of greater convenience and greater feasibility.  It is a question of which is the more feasible to submit, the exploitation sheet, the publicity campaign sheet, or what the renter proposes to provide.  He may not propose to provide in these small towns, or, indeed, for exhibition in Ireland at all, any of the large posters.  He may only intend the small things, what are called the &ldquo;throw aways&rdquo; or the stills.</P>
      <P>No one appreciates more than I do the amount of close attention which the Censor devotes to his work.  In the beginning he was technically a part-time officer, but I know that he does a full day's work, and everyone marvels at the devotion&mdash;that is the word to use&mdash;which the Censor exhibits in the discharge of his very difficult duties. I am speaking in the interests of the Censor.  The Minister will hardly challenge that, but I do not claim to speak on his behalf.  The Minister is better able to speak on his behalf authoritatively. I know how much work will be imposed on the Censor's office if all these things have to be dealt with one by one.  Furthermore, I say in the case of an illustration, which is really a matter across the border, as I have already shown the House, if the Censor rejects it, what weighs with him is the reading matter.  The renter may appeal on the ground that the pictorial advertisement is right, and it will be technically right in such a case.</P>

      <P>I think everyone in the House sympathises with Deputy <Col N="1653" /> Professor Magennis in his very evident anxiety to safeguard public morality in every shape and form.  I am one of those who always had very strong views in connection with the possibility of abuse to which a display of films and the literature associated with them may give rise to.  I would like to be clear whether the expression, &ldquo;exploitation sheet,&rdquo; mentioned in Section 1, really covers every conceivable form of advertising matter which might be displayed throughout the country in connection with the showing of any film.  That is one of the matters on which the House ought to be clear, because Deputy Professor Magennis has held up to the view of the House a great many different types of literature and illustrations. I would like it to be clear whether this term, &ldquo;exploitation sheet,&rdquo; embraces every kind of literature which he has described to us.  It may be argued from sub-section 2 of Section 3 that the official Censor has very considerable discretion.  The wording of that sub-section would seem to protect the public to this extent, that the official Censor had power to deal with these, but would he have power before some subsidiary literature became public?  I would ask the Minister to make that clear.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, Section 2 (1), line 31, after the word &ldquo;picture&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or any pictorial advertisement whether as decoration on cover of a programme, or as exhibit in the hall or vestibule of a cinema, purporting to reproduce, or otherwise to represent a scene or situation in any such film picture as aforesaid,&rdquo; and, in line 32, after the word &ldquo;reproduced&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or otherwise represented.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1654" /> I am afraid that this amendment is condemned by the rejection of Amendment 4, because the purpose is identical.  It is to prevent publicity matter of a pictorial kind being circulated which is not in the exploitation sheet of a firm which uses the name &ldquo;exploitation sheet,&rdquo; and not in the publicity campaign supplemented by a firm that uses that name for its circulars and so on.  So far as I understand what the original proposition deals with is a reproduction of a part of a picture.  I want to leave no loophole. If anyone argues that this is not a reproduction of a part of a picture, that it is merely giving the spirit, the wild gaiety, for example, that permeates the whole story, I want to see that that contention will not make him escape the clutches of the Minister's section.  That is why I introduce the words &ldquo;purporting to reproduce or otherwise to represent a scene or situation.&rdquo; Very often, in fact usually, these little illustration blocks are made from the actual photographs to which the positive picture shown in the film is a counterpart, and made from the same negative.  It is easier, as anyone accustomed to work of this kind is aware, to make a block from a photograph, but it would be possible to employ a draughtsman who would depart from the original in various respects, and then, if the law challenged the exhibition of this, the contention might be raised that this is not a reproduction of a scene in the film and that it is nowhere in the film. Very well.  Was it ever before the Censor?  How are you going to prove before a court of law that it was not before the Censor unless by calling the Censor as a witness?  Then the work of the Censor's office is interrupted and more duties are imposed on the Censor.  The object of the amendment is to make this watertight so that there can be no leakage.</P>
    <P>I submit, although I realise that the Minister will not accept this, that we require to put in the words: &ldquo;any pictorial advertisement whether as decoration on the cover of a programme.&rdquo; Programmes might be circulated free, as they sometimes are, and the actual picture that decorates the programme <Col N="1655" /> may not have been, and very often is not, in the publicity sheets, and, therefore, if the law stood as in the Bill, would not come under the eye or the observation of the Censor in his critical capacity.  There are a great many loopholes that, perhaps, the public are not aware of, and when the Censor has cut a picture, and gives a certificate for the picture as cut, it is quite possible later, when the picture is worn out, and a new one is provided for exhibition, that through inadvertence, or oversight of some sort, the uncut picture may come back, and have the Censor's signature affixed to it and be exhibited.  No one has intentionally broken the law, but there it is.  Similarly, after a while reproductions, &ldquo;stills&rdquo; as they are called, photographic exhibitions by way of enlargement of the photograph and posters based on those cuts of whose excision from the film the firm has become unaware, may in the course of time find their way in.  If the actual poster were filed and numbered in the Censor's office it would clear up the situation if there were any difficulties. However, I do not want to press this if it is not acceptable to the Minister.</P>

      <P>My view about the amendment is substantially my view on the two previous amendments.  I do not consider it necessary, and I do not consider that it really is a practical contribution to the Bill.  There are, as I have said, two classes of posters used in connection with the advertising of a film.  There are those prepared by the manufacturers, and reproduced in the exploitation sheet which under the Bill must be forwarded to the Censor with the film, and the photographic extract from the picture which is used for lobby or publicity display.  Class one must under the Bill be submitted to the Censor&mdash;that is the exploitation sheet. Class two cannot be exhibited under section 2, sub-section (1), unless the portion of the film from which they are extracted has itself been passed by the Censor.  Accordingly, there seems to be no necessity for having a section prohibiting the exhibition in the lobby of the picture house of posters purporting to represent incidents in the play, unless the incidents were represented <Col N="1656" /> as in the play as passed by the Censor. It may be assumed that the Censor after objecting to, and deleting certain incidents of the film, will also prohibit the exhibition of posters illustrating these incidents.  On these grounds I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the position of the Minister in not desiring to overload, and, by such overloading, make impossible the work of the Censor, but I think that his very narrow rendering is going to make null and void the greater part of his purpose in promoting this Bill.  He speaks of the photographic or other reproductions of any part of such a picture, and it appears from that that the object is to prevent the publishing of enlargements of photographs.  I think a good deal of the objection that has been raised has not been to photographs at all.  The Minister spoke of posters, but could it be maintained that a picture on posters produced by an entirely different process was a reproduction of any photograph which appeared on the screen?</P>

      <P>It may have been in the past, but you are not arranging for censorship, and to avoid the censorship and get the same results they will not appear in the exploitation sheets.  Let us bear in mind the possibility that all the evil in the world does not come from the exploiter outside the country. We might not unreasonably expect that cinema proprietors in the country would arrange for illustrations of the scenes to be exhibited next week, or pretending that such scenes or pictures would be presented in the picture house.  That is not an exploitation sheet, for it is provided by the owner of the cinema and not by the renter of the picture.  But under Section 2, there is no censorship, no prohibition, no restriction, of that kind of freedom, and I think that if the Minister desires to restrict the illustration parts of pictures <Col N="1657" /> which have been deleted and eliminated by the Censor he will have to arrange for some censorship of any picture purporting to illustrate a picture that is to be exhibited.  Otherwise, I am afraid if there is any desire at all on the part of cinema proprietors or exhibitors to exhibit pictures of an enticing kind, even though they are not a true presentation of what they intend to produce&mdash;unfortunately, that is a charge which has been dealt with on good grounds against many proprietors&mdash;this section will not effect the end the Minister seeks.  It seems to me he will have to introduce some section dealing with what purports to represent the picture <Col N="1658" /> on show.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment will appeal to the Minister inasmuch as he has in mind to reduce as far as possible the labour cast on the Censor.  According to the Bill, the Censor is to decide whether the display thereof in public would be calculated to convey suggestiveness or would be otherwise subversive of public morality.  I propose that all he has got to decide is whether it is the fact that it conveys something, or whether it actually is subversive of public morality. In other words it is not conjectural. It is a question of whether in his present judgment, looking at the pictorial advertisement, it is of a calibre to do those objectionable things&mdash;not that it would be&mdash;otherwise to remove <Col N="1659" /> the contingent element out of the thing and make it actuality.</P>

      <P>I may be misunderstanding the amendment, but I do not see how the Censor could form an opinion that the exhibition in public of a poster actually conveys suggestions contrary to public morality before the poster has, in fact, been exhibited in public.  I think the language of the Bill is accurate and is an exact description of what the Censor has to do.  He has to calculate what the effect of a particular picture or representation would be when, and if, exhibited publicly. It is the Deputy I think that puts the burden on the Censor by asking him to say that the exhibition in public of a poster conveys a certain impression before the poster is, in fact, exhibited in public.</P>

In the course of discussions as to an Allotments Bill which was promised a year, or perhaps two years ago, both the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Local Government on several occasions suggested that a private member's Bill should be introduced.

      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Acquisition of Land (Reference Committee) Bill, 1925.  It is a very short Bill and, as I mentioned before, the object of it is to reconstitute the Reference Committee established by the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.  Under that Act, where a local authority is authorised to acquire land compulsorily and where there is any dispute as regards compensation, a Reference Committee had power to appoint an arbitrator. This Committee will be the same as that appointed under Section 20 of the Courts of Justice Act, namely, the Chief Justice of the Irish Free State, the President of the High Court, and the Chairman of the Surveyors' Institute. Under Section 20 of the Act this Committee was only reconstituted for revenue purposes, and it is now proposed to reconstitute it for the compulsory acquisition of land.</P>

    <P>This resolution is meant to cover the two charges on the Central Fund, for which provision is made in Clause 11 of the Bill.  The first charge is that referred to in sub-clause (1) and sub-clause (5) of Clause 11.  The second charge refers to sub-clause (8) of Clause 11.  The first charge provides for the meeting of advances to the total amount of £5,210,000, which may be required to finance the scheme generally. These advances from the Central Fund are to be paid into a separate fund to be established for the purposes of the scheme.  All the financing of the scheme will be directed to the Central Fund, the amount of which will be kept in detail so as to afford a clear understanding of the financial standing of the scheme.  The second charge relates to such borrowing as the Exchequer may have to incur in order to find the sums required by the separate fund. The principal and interest on securities <Col N="1663" /> created for the purpose of such borrowing must be charged on the Central Fund, and the present provision is consequently rendered necessary.</P>

      <P>With <Col N="1665" /> regard to what Deputy Johnson has said, the Bill, of course, as framed, is framed in a very general way, so as to preclude it from coming within Standing Orders applicable to Private Bills. There are really one or two local authorities that could possibly enter within the provisions of the Bill, and Dublin local authorities are not so included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that suggest that there is no need for this amendment? The amendment, as drafted, says that the expression &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; means and includes a county council, a county or other borough council, an urban district council, and the commissioners of a town. I take it the implication is that the words &ldquo;rural district council and boards of guardians&rdquo; are unnecessary, because of the passing of the recent Local Government Act, and perhaps it is foreshadowed that rural district councils and boards of guardians will be abolished in County Dublin as well. They are not yet abolished, however, and it may be that in the wisdom of the Oireachtas they will not be abolished. I suggest that the Minister should not press this amendment in view of the continued existence of these local governing bodies.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The expression &lsquo;local authority&rsquo; means and includes a county council, a county or other borough council, an urban district council, and the commissioners of a town.&rdquo;  That will include every local authority in the ordinary sense in County Dublin and the City of Dublin, but the original definition would include all these bodies which are not in the ordinary sense local authorities at all.  For instance, the Alexandra College is an institution subject to audit by our Local Government auditor, and it would be a local authority under this Bill.  There are numerous other institutions of the same kind which should be excluded from the scope of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at end of sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Always provided that the Minister shall not supply or distribute electricity in any area in which a local authority or public company has obtained statutory powers to enable it to supply and distribute electricity, and in which such local authority or public company is actually supplying and distributing electricity at the time of the passing of this Act, without the consent of the said local authority or public company, which consent shall be notified to the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is one of a series of amendments and I will set the mind of the Dáil at rest at once by saying that I do not propose in any of these amendments to talk about amperes or kilowatts, reinforced cores, or any of the technicalities with which this subject is surrounded. I learned all these things at school, but like most things we learned at school I have forgotten them since. My only regret is in connection with the disappearance of another word, the ohm.  I do not know what has happened in the case of the ohm.  It seems to have taken refuge in the region of some cross-word puzzle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told nothing about ohms. This amendment is intended to draw attention to the position of the existing companies who are supplying electricity, mainly for light, in the Saorstát.  There are two types of suppliers of electricity for light; one is a company operating under a licence from the county council, I believe.  That may be a company in a small town or village.  As a rule, it is not a company; it is a case where a mill-owner, the owner of a factory, or something of that kind, has put in electric light on his own, and is persuaded to extend it to the village on agreed terms.  The licence under which that light is supplied can be revoked by the county council at will, and, therefore, such concerns have no grievance if they are superseded by the competition of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  But there is another form of electricity undertaking which requires consideration, and which has <Col N="1669" /> not had adequate consideration up to the present.  I think all through this Bill there is a general acquiescence in the idea that the Minister will be able to supply existing electric light companies and electricity companies with power so cheaply that they will gladly sack their employees, cancel any contracts that they have for the supply of coal, and so on, and take the Shannon units instead of their own. I do not know; that may be well founded; I have no intimate or expert knowledge of the business.  But I do know that we should have heard a very different story if the Dublin Corporation were still in existence, and had a vested interest in the supply of electricity. Deputy Alfred Byrne would be sounding the war whoop, Deputy Myles Keogh would be taking down the scalping knife, and I am not sure that the President would not have rendered a distant ear to the well-remembered throbbing of the tom-tom.  As it is, there are Commissioners, and consequently there is silence.  The same is the case with the city of Cork.  Yet there is a case for these municipal or private undertakings that have obtained statutory powers to supply electricity. They got these powers and at great cost.  They promoted Private Bills in the British Parliament, and in one case in the Oireachtas.  They briefed counsel, they faced opposition, and they obtained a statutory monopoly for the supply of electrical power in the area in which they operated.  Now by a stroke of the pen, by the word of the Minister, that monopoly has been taken from them.  A State-aided scheme is being set up in competition with them. They must either take power from the Shannon on the Minister's terms, or they must face competition that may be ruinous, because it will be supported by the revenues of the State.  I suggest that this is raising a very serious issue, and an issue that has not been fully foreseen.</P>
    <P>We are making the rights conferred by Private Bills null and void.  What effect will that have on the promoters of Private Bills in the future?  It has hitherto been the case that although a Private Bill might be repealed or revoked it never was repealed or revoked, <Col N="1670" /> that any rights given by a Private Bill were rights that could be asserted and maintained practically for ever.  Now this is suddenly raised.  We say to the people who have obtained these Private Bills: &ldquo;Your rights are valueless; the State superseded them; the State is all; it can swallow you up.&rdquo;  It may be necessary to do it; the Minister may be able to make the case, but at least the case should be made, and the case has not been made, as far as I have read the discussions.  I was not present at all the discussions but I have read them.  I have not seen any detailed reference in this Bill to the position of municipal or private concerns supplying electricity. It has always been assumed: &ldquo;You will get cheaper units from the Shannon, and you will be only too glad to take them.&rdquo;  It will affect municipalities; it will affect labour; it will cause, as I said on Second Reading, a displacement of labour.  People who are unloading coal from ships at the Pigeon House, and carting coal to the Pigeon House, and so on, will no longer be employed; at least, I assume that they will no longer be employed at that particular job.  We ought to have some justification of it before, by an Act of the Dáil, we set at naught the rights obtained by Private Bill legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder will the Deputy give us a little assistance to understand the position from which he is arguing?  I gather that his contention is that the company that has obtained statutory powers to supply electricity has obtained the right to a monopoly, that no person in the community concerned will be entitled to supply electricity which he himself generates; that he must obtain it either from the company or the local authority.  If that is the case&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh no, he could supply it to himself but a competing company could not enter the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible for A.B. to generate electricity by any means he can, without interfering with public rights of any kind and to supply to his neighbour next door?  I assume that nothing in these statutory powers <Col N="1671" /> that have been given to local authorities or public companies indicates a monopoly; that a private citizen is not prevented from generating electricity and supplying it to his neighbour unless he interferes with some public rights, and only then in exceptional cases.  I imagine that the Deputy is arguing from an assumption that because a company, or a local authority has got powers to supply electricity, to take up roads, erect poles, etc., that thereby there is power to prevent anybody else supplying electricity.  I am astonished if that is the case.  I would like to have some information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the amendment is valuable in so far as it will enable the Minister to give us some little information as to his intentions under the Bill, which he will probably develop more when he comes to deal with the details of the scheme.  At this stage I think that an explanation of the mentality of the Minister on the subject of the rights of other undertakings in connection with this national scheme would help us to see a little further ahead into the scheme than we do at present.  In asking for that I am possibly not the best person in the House to do so, but I ask the Minister to let us know what his views on this amendment are, and what his attitude is in connection with Bills promoted in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cooper says that no case has been made.  No case has been made for what?  No case has been made for allowing people to get cheaper electricity than they at present get it from local bodies, acting under statutory authorities.  I wonder does any case require to be made for that, that we should allow people to get benefit from the Shannon scheme. It is the opposition to that case that the Deputy has made, if he has made any case.  It has been said that I have not revealed my mind on the question of supply.  I did not intend this Bill to have anything to do with the question of supply, except in a limited way, but to wait until I came to an amendment by Deputy Cooper later with regard to a provisional contract.  But I have <Col N="1672" /> already indicated my position and the whole policy of the Department has been indicated in the same way, in an Order which I quoted in the debate on the 3rd April, when Deputy Cooper was not here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the debate very carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>And although he read it he has apparently missed this. I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Certain Electricity Orders have been passed since the Shannon scheme made its appearance, even as a White Paper, and a clause in these has always been insisted upon by my Department.  That clause has received the sanction of the Oireachtas in at least four Orders, and in the Seanad on one occasion when a Senator believed that the clause was left out he made an attempt to have it inserted.  This was the clause:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In the event of a central power station being established and that the supply of electricity in bulk is thereby made available to the undertakers at a rate of charge equal to or less than the cost of generation in the generating station of the undertakers, the undertakers shall take such supply from the central power station.</P>
      <P>I continued:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That seems to be entirely reasonable, and it has received the approval of the Oireachtas in several cases already.  If we can supply to an existing undertaking current at the same, or at a less price than, they can themselves generate and to which they can themselves add their own overhead charges they are not prejudiced in any respect.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder where is the harm done to the statutory undertaking?  I do not regard anything that has been said about the defeating of peoples' rights acquired under Private Bill legislation. Private Bill promoters with regard to electricity undertakings did not really obtain a monopoly in their own district. Deputy Johnson is quite correct in that.  Even if they had, is Deputy Cooper going to argue now that something that had been done has been definitely stereotyped for all time, and that <Col N="1673" /> people should be precluded from having the benefit of cheap power if power were delivered to them cheaply?  In this I am going further than this Bill intends to go.  I bring in Clause 13 later with regard to the contract and supply of electricity.  I intended to explain that when it came along, but I may explain it now.  It is intended to cover such things as the making of contracts not provisional contracts within margins, so that our salespeople within the next couple of years may be able to have good ground on which to base their ideas as to what lines should be built immediately.  Further, there is the intention of the Siemens-Schuckert people that they will develop by means of a station on the Shannon, right at the start, power for their own building purposes, and that they will supply, possibly from that, Limerick immediately with electricity.  That electricity will probably be necessitated by the extra number of workmen and the extra business that Limerick will have to accommodate itself to from the start. It is said that this is not a supply Bill. The supply and organisation Bill will follow later.  It will take certainly nine to twelve months to think it out and get it drafted.  This has nothing whatever to do with it.  The amendment, as framed here, would mean that no matter how inefficiently or extravagantly local statutory undertakings at present supply we would have no right to go in under them or to take power to supply at a less cost than that at which they themselves can generate.  If Deputies read the experts' report carefully they will see certain comments.  I think there has been deliberate refraining from comment, but certain tables show that certain existing statutory undertakings are providing electricity either inefficiently or extravagantly.  This clause, as I said before, is a clause that even if it were meant to cover the supply system is entirely reasonable.  The whole principle of the supply is contained in the Order.  If we can give electricity to undertakings generally at a less cost than they themselves can generate, they will remain very largely for distribution purposes presumably.</P>
    <P>As to the displacement of labour, I do not think the Deputy was serious in <Col N="1674" /> what he said.  He used the phrase: &ldquo;What about people employed at present carting coal to the Pigeon House?&rdquo; Would the Deputy proceed with his argument to its logical conclusion, that if the Shannon scheme was able to do away with the entire import of coal we would nevertheless be bound to have some import of coal, because some labour had, at some time, been employed in that way?  The argument would operate also that if we had got to the stage of a well-behaved community so that we could do away with prisons and police officials we should not do away with them because there are people employed as warders and as Civic Guards.  That argument, if followed to its logical conclusion, would be absurd.  It is a little more absurd than the main amendment the Deputy put down.  The amendment really means that existing undertakings would have to be allowed to supply extravagantly, and that the country would be precluded where there was a statutory undertaking from having any advantage from the Shannon scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's answer is not altogether satisfactory.  The purport of the amendment, as I read it, is to ascertain if the Government were precluded from or opposed to entering into the retail business of distribution of electricity.  The Minister's reply to that is that where the statutory undertaking is operating the Government is presumed to offer them current at a lower price than they are generating at.  If they do not take it I think the reply is that they would be forced to take it.  Of course, we recognise that the trend of the Dáil in this and other directions is towards nationalisation.  I think it would be well for the country to understand that, that in this Bill and from the reply of the Minister the attitude of the Government is that whether you are inclined to take the current or not the purport of the Bill and the intention of the Ministry is that you shall take it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not appear in the Bill.  It is plain in the clause, and it is more plain by what the Minister said.  The Minister qualified that and <Col N="1675" /> stated that the scheme will be able to supply current at a lower price than the local station is able to generate at themselves.  Of course it will.  In the first instance it has got the backing of the Government behind it.  They can make it any price they like.  They can come in and put it at any price they like.  Whether they are making 20/- in the pound or not is nothing to them. That is the main objection to anything that savours of nationalisation.  Of course I am not fond of Government interference.  The more it can be restricted the better.  I have recognised in this Dáil for the short time I have been in it that the tendency is increasing of a strong Government and a strong Government Party being in the position of Pooh Bah.  I think that this Bill in connection with the harnessing of the Shannon is likely to be made very political in its operations and very political in itself.  I think the Minister might have been quite clear in response to this amendment of Deputy Cooper in saying: &ldquo;We are going to do what we like in relation to the Bill.  We are not going to be restricted as far as we can help it, even on the question of overriding local authorities.  That is our intention.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Yes, on this amendment.  What would be the position if this amendment were carried?

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the people in the country to get the full advantage of the Shannon Electricity Bill. Would the Deputy consider the position <Col N="1676" /> of a town where there is an existing electricity company and where from one shilling to one and sixpence per unit is charged for the electricity? That is quite a common figure in the country.  In the next town to that, where the people were, perhaps, wiser, and are still using candles or oil or gas, they can start a company under the Shannon scheme and obtain electricity at from perhaps 3d. to 5d. per unit.  I think the Deputy should consider the people and not confine his interest to the companies.  The companies are not going to be penalised, so far as I know. Current will be supplied to them at a certain figure and they will be allowed to charge for distribution a reasonable figure, which will cover their overhead and general expenses and allow them a fair margin of profit.  But we certainly require some safeguard for the consumer.  We must not be all the time concerned for the person who is going to draw the dividends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Would Deputy Morrissey show me what safeguards there are for the consumer in this Bill? I see none.  I always have a feeling of mistrust when anybody in the Dáil gets up and talks about &ldquo;the people.&rdquo; I have a feeling that he is probably going to talk nonsense, because we generally drag in the people when we have no other argument.  Under this section, it is in the power of the Minister to go into an area where electricity is being produced.  If the company do not agree to take his electricity, on his own terms, he can undersell that company until he forces it out of business. Then he can raise the price of electricity to the consumer.  That is perfectly within his power under the Bill.</P>
      <P>I assure the Minister that I dislike stereotyping any condition just as much as he does but when a change is being made I want it to be made with due consideration for all the interests involved.  The Minister referred me to the Experts' report.  I assume he referred me to the tables given in pages 61 to 65 of the Experts' report.  If not, I hope he will correct me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very interesting, because I had noted before that those tables do not give a fair comparison. Table 1, I leave to the Minister. It is not my concern to defend the Dublin Corporation.  I admit they produce their electricity very expensively. In Table 2 you have Pembroke and Rathmines compared with a number of English and Scottish and Welsh towns&mdash;all of them larger than Pembroke or Rathmines, except one industrial town in South Wales, which is smaller.  They are very unfavourably compared, but the conditions are entirely different in a suburban area where electricity is only used for light and to a limited extent for heating, and in an industrial area like Aberdare or Accrington or Burton.  They may be somewhat similar in the case of Gloucester, but that is also an industrial town.  Blackpool is, of course, different, because it is a tourist centre.  Rathmines is not yet a tourist centre, so that that is not really a fair comparison. When we come to Table 3 we find one Irish town mentioned&mdash; Dundalk.  Dundalk compares very favourably with these other towns in regard to efficiency.  It is actually a halfpenny per unit below the average of these particular towns.  And yet the Dáil is asked to give the Minister power to go into Dundalk and to turn out this efficient undertaking which, though it has to import its coal, is, nevertheless, selling at a lower rate than a great many of these towns in Great Britain, such as Oban, Fareham, Elland, Bangor, and other centres.  We are asked to give the Minister power to go in and undersell this undertaking, to put them out of business, and then to fix what price he likes for his power and his light.</P>
      <P>It is always assumed that the Minister is going to be able to sell current cheaply.  But what will happen if there is any miscalculation?  Deputy Gorey put a question on Second Reading which was not satisfactorily answered.  He asked: &ldquo;Is this a final estimate?&rdquo;  It is not a final estimate. Nobody could make a final and binding estimate at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only answer.  It is as final as it could be. But look at the Siemens-Schuckert report. It is definitely stated there that the calculations have been made on the basis that Irish labour will work the same hours and give the same results as German labour.  If that is not the case, they point out that more labour will be required.  On page 65 of their report Siemens-Schuckert state:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The number of workmen has been calculated on the basis of the normal output of our workers.  Should this output, contrary to our expectations, not be attained, the number of workmen would have to be increased, and this, of course, would affect our estimates of cost.  We would, naturally, try to increase the output by offering prizes for rapid work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how far that is consistent with trade union regulations. But this, it is admitted, is not a final estimate.  It cannot be.  As the Minister says, it is as final as, in the nature of things, it can be.  It cannot be absolutely final.  Suppose it is considerably exceeded; suppose the costs are more than it is believed they will be at the moment.  The Minister will not be able to sell his electricity at a cheap rate. He may even be compelled to sell it at a higher rate than, say, the Dundalk Company are supplying it.  But he will go into Dundalk and there will be cut-throat competition between the local company&mdash;I do not know whether Dundalk is a municipal supply or not&mdash; and the State undertaking.  The Minister will naturally want to have as big an area of supply as possible.  He will try to get into Dundalk.  When I say the Minister will do these things, I do not mean the present Minister.  But whoever is Minister for Industry and Commerce, and whoever is conducting this concern will try and conduct it on a business basis.  The normal procedure in business is to try first to capture the market.  In order to capture the market you fix cut-throat prices.  When you have captured the market and you have a monopoly, you put up your prices.  I think Deputy Hewat will admit that that is the normal business procedure. Deputy Johnson will not agree with that procedure and I do not know <Col N="1679" /> that I am strongly in favour of the system myself, but that is the procedure in business and that is likely what is going to happen in this case.  Therefore I submit that the reasons the Minister has given are not absolutely convincing or satisfactory, and that we want a little more consideration for this amendment.</P>

      <P>Whatever this Bill does or does not do, this amendment does one thing very definitely.  It gives the owners of any electricity supply a close preserve that nobody can invade.  Companies already established in these various towns would, according to this amendment, have no competition in the matter of supplying electricity.  The amendment hands over to the owners of these undertakings the community in a particular district, and it says that nobody can interfere with these companies.  Nobody can come in and give the public the benefit of competition.  That is what this amendment says very definitely.</P>

      <P>I am not referring to the Dublin Corporation or to anyone in particular.  I am referring to the position of any town in this country where an electric supply company has been set up.  I am not concerned with any particular town, but I know that the <Col N="1680" /> principle of the amendment is bad. The public in those places will, like the rest of the community, have to bear their share of the cost of the Shannon scheme.  They will take as much responsibility for that as anyone else. Under the terms of the amendment they can get no benefit from it.  If anybody is prepared to dispute these facts, let them dispute them and not talk to me about eviction or anything like that.  I object to the creation of this preserve.  I object to the principle of the amendment, and I am going to vote against it.  If there is any benefit at all to come from this Bill, I insist that it shall come to the whole people and not to any section of the people.</P>

      <P>I think it is perfectly clear to the Dáil that Deputy Cooper did not expect us to take this amendment seriously.  It is rather a severe tax on our intelligence to suggest that the country should be wedded indefinitely to any inefficient concerns that may be in existence, or to any concerns that are now supplying electricity at high prices, when we have a State scheme that is going to give us electricity at a much lower price. Deputy Cooper really has allowed his imagination to run away with him in this matter.  He referred to the town of Dundalk as supplying electricity at a very cheap rate, and he appears to assume that, under this Bill, the Government are going into the town of Dundalk to erect distribution wires and so forth, and supply electricity.  The first thing that strikes me about that suggestion is that the present sum of money which is mentioned in connection with the Siemens-Schuckert scheme provides simply for a central station and for the main distribution.  It does not propose at all to cover the distribution of electricity in local towns, or to meet the expense of the wiring of houses, or any of these things.  These further elaborations of the enterprise, if undertaken later by the Government, will obviously have to be the subject of a separate Bill.  It appears to me that Deputy Cooper is giving credit to our Government for rather a minus quantity of intelligence by suggesting that they are going to enter into such wholesale competition as that, and that <Col N="1681" /> they are going to insist that all towns that are now supplying electricity at reasonable prices scrap their distribution plant to permit of the Government itself coming along and providing a new distribution scheme.  That, of course, is quite absurd.  The Government, I take it, have sufficient confidence in the enterprise of local people not to do any such thing.  I myself happen to be associated with an electricity scheme, and I am not in the least nervous about this scheme.  I think the Government have sufficient confidence in the enterprise of our people to know that when they can get electricity cheaper than they are making it now, that, obviously, it will be to their advantage to take it and to utilise the existing distribution wires. That is to say, they will buy the electricity from the Government at a cheaper rate than they can make it, and sell it at a cheaper rate than they are already charging for it to the public.  I suggest that is what will happen.  I take it that in a future Bill the Government will probably make some arrangement with the local distributors of electricity as to the price that they are to charge for it to the consumer. That is one of the matters that I would be very interested to see dealt with later on.</P>

I assure the Minister that I do not want to waste the time of the Dáil, but I do say this is a real danger. We are putting it in the power not of the Minister specially but in the power of any Minister for Industry and Commerce to enter into competition with the existing undertakings.</P>

If Deputy Davin or Deputy Morrissey at any time becomes Minister for Industry and Commerce their party could force through a Bill to provide the additional money and give no safeguard whatever.  I ask Deputy Egan to consider that.  I am not simply chasing chimeras.  It does seem to me that that section will require more consideration.  As a result of the discussion I am a little more satisfied than I was, and if the Minister would consider any means of avoiding the danger that I foresee, and if on Report Stage he would be prepared to reconsider the matter, I would be prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the danger that Deputy Cooper is pointing out? The danger is apparently that a State electricity supply scheme will enter into competition with the local undertakings, undercutting the prices of the local suppliers, driving the local suppliers out of existence and then charging what it likes.  He thinks that a State electricity undertaking will be actuated by the same motives entirely as big monopolistic private enterprises or trusts.  I could understand that if we were establishing a private profit-making trust here, giving it powers to <Col N="1683" /> enter into competition and to make its own prices, driving out of business any other undertaking, and then to charge whatever price it likes, there would be a case.  But we are dealing with powers given to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce&mdash;a Ministry responsible to the Dáil and indirectly to the country for the general conduct of this public service&mdash;and I maintain that that is an entirely different proposition. If we are going to legislate on the assumption that the Minister is going to run this undertaking as a profit-making service, to drive out competition and then to pile up charges against the public, so as to save the payers of income tax some of their taxes, I can understand the point of view.  But I cannot imagine that that is the position at all, and I think you have got to consider this matter on entirely different lines.  You are not dealing with a monopolistic undertaking or with a private company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy does not think for a moment that any Government setting out to work this scheme will not have as one of their primary objects the making of the scheme a commercial success.  I think the Minister has already said that that would be the outlook of the Government. I believe there is no doubt about it.  The Government have no doubt that they will make this scheme a success.  I am in this matter solely concerned with the interests of the community.  Therefore I want to get one important point clear.  To my mind it is clear, but I want to make perfectly certain that it is clear.  I take it that the Minister is so convinced of the success of this undertaking from the practical, commercial point of view that he is relying solely upon what he regards as the certainty of being able to sell electricity where it is already produced at a certain price, at a lower price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it the Minister accepts the proposition?  The Minister's nod, I take it, indicates assent.  I think that is very important, and I hope we are perfectly clear about that.  The Minister has got nothing else in his mind except the conviction that the scheme <Col N="1684" /> is going to be a commercial success which will enable him, without putting pressure on anyone, to provide electricity in cities and towns at a cheaper price than it is provided at present.  But here is where the remark of Deputy Cooper strikes me: Supposing that things do not turn out in quite the way that the Minister anticipates and that the scheme is not a commercial success, will there be a necessity put on big suppliers to come within the purview of this scheme?  Without wishing to undercut or undersell anyone, will it not be necessary that electricity shall be provided for large enterprises at a lower figure than at present?  That may mean that places that have large stations at present and that are fairly successful will stand to lose until this is as completely successful as the Minister hopes it will be.  That is the danger that strikes me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Paying its way I definitely took it to mean.  There were three phrases used by Deputy Cooper. In the first place, he said that this amendment of his was a safeguard, and he alludes to danger.  Deputy Professor Thrift said that he has the interests of the community at heart.  We are discussing an amendment to a section in the Bill.  I want to take the table on page 62 of the experts' report. The seventh column in that is the column for comparative purposes. Thirteen towns are there taken for comparative purposes, and for these thirteen towns the average cost per kilowatt delivered is under 2d.  Pembroke is 3.60d., and Rathmines 4.15d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister is he comparing the other towns that come into this with Pembroke and Rathmines.  These other <Col N="1685" /> towns are self-contained, with shops and cinemas, etc.  Pembroke and Rathmines are suburban districts.  There are shops in Rathmines and also a couple of cinemas, but Pembroke has none.  I suggest that we should not make a comparison on the basis merely of looking up figures in a table.  Anyone who has knowledge of the local conditions will see that you cannot make a comparison between districts that are largely suburban, and self-contained towns such as are given in that table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to make the comparison as favourable as possible for Rathmines, let me take Gloucester, to which the Deputy himself referred. The price in Gloucester is 1.63d., while in Rathmines it is 4d. Remember that this amendment is spoken of as a safeguard, and yet, unless Rathmines agrees, we could not supply from the Shannon at .53.  We are told that we cannot supply at anything under 4d.  unless Rathmines agrees, and that is put forward in the name of a safeguard.  I call it a danger.  That is the danger that Deputy Professor Thrift is endeavouring to prevent the Dáil assenting to. If Deputy Professor Thrift had the interests of the community at heart&mdash;and Rathmines is a part of the whole area of supply&mdash;he surely would not hold that that amendment is going to safeguard anybody except the people who are profiteering in the sale of electric light, or else who are mismanaging the undertaking to such an extent that they have to charge an exorbitant rate.</P>

The Dáil may not realise that in passing this section they are giving the Government the widest possible powers.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1691" /> I put down this amendment in order to call attention to the extremely wide powers conferred by the sub-section. The Minister, or contractor, may &ldquo;do any act or thing which may be necessary for or incidental to the doing of anything which he is by this sub-section authorised to do.&rdquo; But there is nothing in the world that might not be incidental to or in regard to some of the things mentioned in this sub-section, such as the construction and maintaining of railways and tramways, the laying of mains, the closing, diverting or removing of any public or private street, roadway or bridge, entering upon lands and premises, and so on. Anything is incidental to any of these matters.  The contractor commissions a man to go and examine certain premises and enter upon certain lands to make a survey.  The eating of a man's dinner may be incidental to such a work as that.  He cannot go without nourishment.  The Minister is a lawyer &mdash;I am not&mdash;and he would be in a position to say whether this power to do anything incidental in these matters would enable him to commandeer a meal if he wanted it.  To smoke a pipe is incidental.  This section would empower a man to light his pipe and throw away the match into a farmer's haystack. I know, of course, that would not be done, but we should be careful only to give such powers as are necessary, but not to do everything incidental to them.  The Bill is framed on the widest possible line, and I venture to think that a little compression and constriction on these points would be desirable. It might be held&mdash;I am not a lawyer enough to know whether it could or not&mdash;that the commission of a crime could be legalised under this proviso, possibly not a crime under the criminal law, but one under the civil law.  Is it absolutely necessary that not only the Minister, but also the contractor and presumably the agents of any contractor that the Minister might appoint should have these powers?  If so, I am standing up here for old-fashioned things like security in vested interests and for the rights of individuals and things like that, and I say, in the name of these old-fashioned things, it is very <Col N="1692" /> desirable that we should have a full explanation on this question.</P>

      <P>The wording of the paragraph is the wording that is invariably adopted in connection with all similar works.  The wording, as the result of experience, seems to be necessary in the carrying out of big works of this kind.  I think the weakness of the examples taken by the Deputy is the best answer to his amendment.  He stated, for instance, that throwing a match on a farmer's haystack might do something incidental.  I can only imagine myself that if he was a particularly obstructive farmer that it would be something in the nature of making the punishment fit the crime&mdash;of course I am not suggesting anything of the kind&mdash;to burn his haystack, particularly if he was reclining on it, so as to get rid of him and his hay. It may be incidental to the conferring of some of these powers that a man should be paid for his dinner. Surely the men will get wages for the work they do.  The phrase in the section is the one invariably used, and has been confirmed by experience.  What interest would be protected by leaving the words out as proposed by the amendment?  You give me all the powers that I require, but you balk at giving me powers that are &ldquo;incidental&rdquo; to doing them.  There is one error in what the Deputy stated.  Any contractor, according to the Deputy, may get all the powers of the Minister for himself and his agents.  The contractor cannot get these powers until the requirements of Section 3 are complied with.  The Minister may confer on the contractor the right to do certain things under sub-section (1) as the Minister may think proper and as specified in the order.  The contractor is not substituted for the Minister.  It is the Minister who authorises him in his opera tions.  There is no reason to cut these words out.  If they were cut out it would only subject the engineers to unnecessary delay upon any pretext by any person who had an interest in delaying the scheme.</P>

      <P>It is because of the existence of sub-section (3) of this Section <Col N="1693" /> 3 that I move this amendment. the Minister, I readily admit, would not do anything unfair that would be incidental to the scheme.  But when the Minister empowers the contractor to do things incidental to the scheme he has to trust to the contractor's interpretation of what is incidental and what is not.  If the Minister will say that sub-section (3) is to be so used that the contractor will be definitely limited in what he can do and not allowed to do other things simply because he believes they are incidental to, I will withdraw my amendment.</P>

It reads &ldquo;whenever the Minister enters under this section into any contract or agreement for the doing of anything which the Minister is authorised by sub-section (1) of this section to do, the Minister may by order confer on the contractor the right to do such of the things which the Minister is authorised by the said sub-section (1) to do as the Minister shall think proper and shall specify in the order.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have read them. If the Minister is interpreting sub-section (3) as definitely limiting the contractor as to what he can do, and nothing else, then I agree my amendment is unnecessary, but if the contractor is to be allowed incidentally to do certain things and may not be amenable to the law, and, say, he did these things because the Minister authorised him and that they were incidental, that would be conferring a greater power than you say you are conferring on the contractor.  If the Minister will satisfy me upon what the contractor may do simply, then my objection would be gone.</P>

      <P>I do think in any action that might arise afterwards that the contractor could really be held liable as long as the Minister had given the order required by Section 3. Whether or not incidental matters are to be included in that order, if that question of being incidental were raised I think the responsibility in all cases would fall back upon the Minister. The contractor would be protected by his order.  I ask the Deputy what does he suggest instead of the words &ldquo;or incidental to&rdquo;?  Is it that we must set out everything in this Bill that may at any time crop up as a matter to be dealt with under the terms of the contract? If that is the case, I would like the Deputy to draft the schedule instead of leaving it to me to draft, because that would take many days.  If you take out that phrase you take out a phrase consecrated by usage.  It has been proved by experience on big works such as these that you must have that general phrase in.  You must trust certain people, and if you do not trust them to carry out certain things, you will have to have a Bill of several hundred volumes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has appealed to experience and usage, but the firm of contractors to which he is giving the contract are not familiar with the usages of our law or British law, so far as I know.  My fears would be much less but for the fact that we are dealing with the German mind which is essentially logical and which will carry conclusions of this kind very far.  I do not share the cry about German influence as I do not believe in that, but I believe that the German mind is a logical mind and not a meek mind.  Believing that it possesses these powers, it will carry them to an extreme not contemplated by experience and not in accordance with the practice of the past, because that usage and experience are not known to them as they are to the Minister.  I agree that you cannot put every detail into the Bill, but I suggest that the Minister, when delegating powers under this section, should give detailed instructions and powers to the contractors to enter such lands in such a townland for the <Col N="1695" /> purpose of building a power station and to enter such and such a field for the purpose of making trial borings.  Definite powers should be delegated and not general powers to build a power station and carry out trial borings, say, in counties Clare and Limerick.  That delegation should be specific and not general.  It would mean more work for the Minister but I think, inasmuch as this is a great experiment, the Minister should reserve a close supervision of it.  If he is to interpret the words &ldquo;incidental to&rdquo; and not the contractors my objection would be removed. If he is going to give general powers, and powers that may be incidental, to the contractors I think we shall have a great deal of trouble.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me take the point which the Deputy raises about trial borings.  If I wish to make trial borings in a field belonging to so-and-so in such a county that would be all right, but if I am to, say, make trial borings in a county that is all wrong. Supposing I said: &ldquo;Make trial borings in the land belonging to John so-and-so,&rdquo; would I not have to specify and for that purpose say: &ldquo;The parties shall have leave to enter on the said lands to erect this triangular construction which shall hold the boring apparatus,&rdquo; and detail that down to the smallest provision in the contract.  It could not be done.  When I wish to make a trial boring incidental to that trial boring, so delimited as to meet the Deputy's wishes, it would beimpossible to detail all these.  I can conceive circumstances in which I should say to the contractors: &ldquo;We want trial borings along certain stretches.&rdquo;  After that was done, after consultation with the chief engineer he would make up his mind after considering the geological position where these borings should be made, but to say that that order should specify everything incidental to such a simple thing as trial borings puts, I think, the Deputy's amendment out of court.  We could not specify everything.  When he talks of the German mind being logical and not submissive he should remember that it is not the German mind which is to be the last decider as to what is or is not <Col N="1696" /> incidental.  We give general power as to what is incidental to anything authorised by the sub-section.  It is the courts, and the courts of this country will have the decision in the matter. No German will have a say in that.  The German may interpret it but he can always be brought to book before our courts here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that he would be brought before the German courts.  That is not the line of argument that I was adopting.  But I think the Minister has made my case, that any farmer who would be aggrieved in this matter has got to prove that the thing is not incidental. Almost everything you do in your daily life is incidental to something. You will have to take a man into court to try and prove that the thing is not incidental, and you will have great difficulty in doing so, whereas, if you have to prove that the thing was necessary to the carrying out of the scheme to make power houses and borings, it is a difficult matter to prove.  If I had to do that, I should probably secure the Minister as my counsel.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should, I think, read the words &ldquo;incidental to&rdquo; in relation to the word &ldquo;necessary.&rdquo;&ldquo;Necessary&rdquo; may be subject to interpretation.  It may mean that nothing but what is proved to be essential to a particular job can be done. There you have the question of expert decision, whether three ropes, for instance, instead of two, were necessary. With the term &ldquo;incidental&rdquo; in relation to &ldquo;necessary,&rdquo; it will always be possible to have a difference of opinion as to what is necessary.  I think that my memory is sufficiently good to know that this is a phrase which can be found in many Acts and orders dealing with works of this kind.  You give powers to do certain things and you give power to take such steps as are necessary and incidental to the carrying out of that sort of thing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided that the terms of every such contract or agreement proposed to be made by the Minister shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas at least one month before it shall come into force, and if both such Houses shall, within the next twenty-one days on which either House has sat after these terms have been laid before both Houses, pass resolutions annulling such contract or agreement it shall be annulled, but such annulment shall not prejudice or invalidate any matter or thing previously done <Col N="1698" /> in connection with such contract or agreement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not, and I am sure the Minister knows it, trying to crab this scheme, or trying to waste the time of the Dáil. I am not tied to the words of the amendment I put forward, but I am anxious that the principle at any rate contained in the amendment should receive acceptance.  I think we should have as much publicity as possible in the first place for all the details of the contract.  I am not suggesting anything behind the scenes, but I think we want to secure public confidence to make the scheme a success.  I am taking these words from clauses which have been brought forward by the Government in other Bills, and I have adapted them.  I think it is the only safeguard the Dáil is entitled to ask for, namely, that the Dáil shall be aware of the terms of the contract entered into, and that the Dáil shall have the opportunity, if necessary, of discussing them, and if any Deputies think fit and are able to do so to suggest alterations.  I do not think that the Dáil ought to hand over to the Government, or the Government's engineers, complete and absolute control of the contract without being aware of the kind of contract entered into.  I know it is difficult in connection with this Bill to refer particularly to any particular contract.  I am not quite sure whether it is in order, but it appears to me that this particular clause is the only chance that we are going to get in this Bill to refer to the particular terms of the contract which we hope to be able to discuss in Committee. If you, sir, think that I am out of order, I may refer later on specifically to certain points which we understand are going to be covered by this particular sub-section.  I am going to postpone that because I am anxious to hear whether the Minister is disposed to take into consideration acceptance of the principle involved in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I can answer Deputy Thrift concisely by saying that the amendment is entirely unacceptable.  I I go further and say that the amendment introduces a principle which has <Col N="1699" /> not in fact been accepted by the Dáil or the Oireachtas.  It is, in fact, every day negatived by the Oireachtas.  All the departments under the control of the Government and the Dáil have to enter into contracts, the Board of Works, the Post Office, Local Government Department and the Trade Department, and there is no difference in principle between the contracts which are being entered into every day by the Post Office, and the Board of Works, and the contract in this case.  Here is a contract entered into by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  You may say this is a bigger contract.  It may be bigger spreading it over a three years' period, but the Board of Works, I understand, have contracts annually of half a million or three quarters of a million, and the Post Office have annually contracts for about three quarters of a million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>They come before the Dáil for just the same authority as I ask for here, to spend a lump sum on a contract.  That is the authority they would get from the Dáil. The Board of Works have an estimate, and there is included in that money for new buildings.  I heard a Deputy on the Farmers' benches complaining that so much detail was given regarding this scheme, on the grounds that it was giving contractors too much information. Leaving out the Local Government <Col N="1700" /> Department, the Stationery Office, and any other supply departments, there is one and a quarter million per annum spent on contracts, and no hint whatever as to the terms of contract being laid on the Table.  I want to point out further the effect of the amendment. Instead of being responsible to the Government, contractors under the authority of the chief engineer, under the authority of the Minister responsible to this House, it would mean that details of the contract would have to be settled by Deputies and Senators, but that they would be able to rule political considerations out when considering the multifarious details of the contracts that would have to be made for the carrying out of this scheme is incredible.</P>
      <P>I cannot conceive that the amendment is seriously meant, if it is understood that the practice has been that the spending departments get from the House the same authority as I seek here. I refer to Deputy Johnson's phrase: &ldquo;Much greater detail has been given regarding this scheme than he or the House expected.&rdquo;  Again we get a reversion to this talk about public confidence and the withholding of documents, as if there was something withheld which if revealed would lead to some defect in the scheme being discovered. Nothing has been withheld that might prevent a defect in the scheme being recognised.  I have withheld one book which contains only a list of articles and prices.  If it is put to me that I am withholding information and destroying public confidence in this scheme, I cannot conceive that that argument is based on the one booklet dealing with prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>An estimate as to the engineering character of the whole scheme.  I take one illustration.  I am referring in this connection particularly <Col N="1701" /> to what I may call section levels right along.  I take page 18 of the report on the Shannon scheme, which is a report on sections which appears to be the only one available, and the levels to the power-house.  On page 40 there is a paragraph where the experts refer to the levelling of the bed to a level of plus .5 at the mouth of the tail-race, that is to say the lowering of the Shannon bed from that level.  If you take the output of the tail-race, and look at the diagram, you see the levels given at the end of the tail-race.  There are no figures as to depths, but there is obviously considerable depth between the ground level and the tail-race end, according to statements made in the report.  That depth, I think, is given on the same page as minus 4 metres. I am simply putting this forward to show that it is impossible for us to estimate the details.  So far as we can see, from putting these things together, what is proposed is that in the bed of the Shannon we are going to have a level of plus point five in metres, and at the end of the tail-race a level of minus four.  In the mile between these two we are going to have an up-flow from the end of the tail-race to the Shannon bed.  I do not say that that is actually what is proposed.  There may be something altogether different in the actual plans, but we have never seen the actual plans, and are not in a position to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last debate I put up a point to the Minister in connection with the core of the embankment, and I said that so far as I could find in the report there was no reference to the core.  He answered me&mdash;no doubt on the information that was supplied to him&mdash;in these terms: &ldquo;What is known as the method of hydraulic fill, and that method gives definitely, completely and assuredly a strengthening core.&rdquo;  I did not contradict him at the time and, as I said, I am not an engineer.  I felt sure, however, that he was misinformed in that. I have made all the inquiries I could on the point since, and I find that, as I suspected, the method of hydraulic filling may or may not involve the question of strengthening the core.  I have got classifications of embankments beginning with core embankments and <Col N="1702" /> ending with hydraulic-filled embankments. I find in no place any such security for the presence of core in a hydraulic-filled embankment that the Minister stated.  Of course I am not suggesting that he stated what was wrong, but my information is that it is quite inaccurate.</P>
    <P>Engineers ask that they shall have full information of plans and details before they commit themselves on the scheme, and I say that the Dáil ought to ask for similar information.  I think it will be admitted that I have never put up an amendment which I did not intend seriously, and intend to be helpful. I intend this amendment to be helpful.  I have no attachment to the words or to bringing contracts generally before the Dáil out of Government departments, but I am anxious, as we all are in this scheme, that we should do everything we can to make it a sound and successful one.  That is all I am out to secure.</P>

I quoted from page 48 with regard to hydraulic filling-in: &ldquo;This method which ensures a stable impervious structure.&rdquo;  I did not want to get into any argument as to strengthening core as opposed to giving a stable impervious structure, because if there is a stable impervious structure you do not want any strengthening core.  Is that an answer to the point that the Deputy put up?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred the Deputy to two pages when he spoke of the question of embankments.  I said that apparently it had not been realised that the method to be adopted was the most up-to-date method, and that is the phrase which described the method of hydraulic filling-in.  I want to ask if there is any engineer of repute who questions that phrase&mdash;that it does ensure a stable impervious structure? From some words which I, not being an expert, used here, the Deputy thinks we should have contracts before this Dáil: that when I talked of strengthening <Col N="1703" /> core that what I should have said was: &ldquo;This method which ensures a stable impervious structure,&rdquo; and that Deputies and Senators would then proceed to debate whether what was in the contract was right, or whether that contract was going to be weakened in any way by some words of mine here.  Although I gave the correct reference, and although I was speaking hurriedly I think it was quite clear that I did give my reference accurately as to the page and as to what was meant.</P>
      <P>Think of the result of it all.  We get a contract brought in here&mdash;a contract, remember, not a discussion as to methods to be adopted, but a contract. On that we are to have a discussion by Deputies and Senators on whether this is or is not the correct method to be adopted with regard to embankments; a method that has been put up in that way: that has all the weight of up-to-date engineering experience behind it, and that has passed the test of the four experts&mdash;that has to be decided here by the cumbrous method of discussion, and every detail of every contract has to be discussed in the same way.  I do not know whether it is a sound proposal, but it certainly means that there is going to be no Shannon constructional work started for two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this phrase is mainly taken from the schedule to the State Lands Act&mdash;at least it is the phrase used there. There is no comparison between the handing over of a Government asset&mdash; the use of it&mdash;and this construction portion of the Shannon scheme.  We are asking people to make the project into an achievement.  We are getting that contract supervised by expert engineers. We are getting somebody here who has Parliamentary responsibility to take responsibility in the final instance for it&mdash;all in accord with Parliamentary procedure.  After that, when we get that project in the completed form, and when it becomes a Government asset, we will then have to deal with it as a Government asset, just as we deal with things scheduled to the State Lands Act.  That is to say, that we will have the question of supply, distribution, and organisation to come <Col N="1704" /> afterwards.  This is simply a contract for the constructional portion.  The constructional portion has been already supervised and passed by experts, and put up by a firm that is hardly equalled in this matter of engineering.  The details of a technical contract are to be subjected to the scrutiny of Deputies and Senators.  I do not think the proposition is workable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>There are points in this amendment that are possibly not as clear to the Dáil as they might be.  The Minister has pointed out that in the ordinary contracts we enter into, a scrutiny of the kind asked for here is not required.  Let me reiterate what I said on a previous occasion with regard to this contract, that it is not an ordinary contract.  May I make that statement a little more clear by taking the comparison the Minister has brought forward.  He stated that estimates come before us from the different public departments and he enumerated the Office of Public Works.  The Minister said these proposals come forward and are approved by the Dáil and that there is no such inquiry as is asked for in connection with this scheme.  I admit from that point of view that he is accurate in his statement, but let me show the Dáil that that is not a proposal similar to the one before us.  In that case what happens is this: When a work of any particular character is required in connection with a department the engineers of that department are instructed to prepare a plan.  They are engineers appointed by the Minister, they are known to us, and we have every confidence in them.  They put forward their plans and estimates and as we have confidence in them the estimates go through without question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the attitude adopted in this particular case?  No instructions were given to any engineers so appointed or who were in the employment of the Government.  I therefore reiterate that this is a most unusual proposal.  In the sense put forward by the Minister this is not an engineer's proposal at all.  It is a contractors' proposal.  Let me explain what I mean.  It has been pointed out to us by the President how this proposal came about.  A firm of German engineers were introduced to him by, <Col N="1705" /> I think, Deputy Magennis and they put up this proposal for obtaining electrical energy from the Shannon.  The President was quite candid in telling us that he turned it down in the first instance. Subsequently he reconsidered his decision and these contractors were asked to put forward their proposals.  In the case cited by the Minister we had proposals prepared by our own engineers from instructions given them.  This is quite different.</P>

      <P>I thought the Deputy was making a mistake.  I thought he said proposals prepared by our engineers were put before the Dáil.  I think that was a slip.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Now I come to the other proposals which emanate from a German firm of contractors.  They put forward plans and estimates and when the Government received them they sent them to expert engineers with such details as they had.  Then we have the report of the experts before us and it is that scheme the Dáil is asked to approve of.  To anybody at all conversant with these matters there is a difference between the two proposals. The ordinary proposal comes before the Dáil from our own engineers and is carried out in the usual way, through getting competitive estimates.  That is the usual procedure.  This contract is I say quite a different proposal altogether. In that difference lies the necessity for the inquiry that has been called for.  Once this particular section is passed the Minister is authorised to enter into a contract for this particular work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section authorises the Minister to enter into a contract.  Before authority is given to enter into the contract we ask that we may see the documents connected with it.  That request <Col N="1706" /> was made previously to the Minister and his reply was that it would not be in accordance with his views of commercial morality to produce the documents before the estimate is accepted. Does the Minister want to bind the Dáil to this contract without seeing the documents?  That is the position we are placed in by this proposal.  If this section is passed the Dáil authorises the Minister to enter into a contract for work for which we have not seen the plans.  We are told that that is done every day in our own Departments. Is it?  I am quite satisfied that if any Deputy wanted to know the details of any proposal that comes in the usual way from the Office of Public Works he would not have the smallest difficulty about seeing the plans.  I am sure that every facility would be given so that Deputies might see the plans and the prices if they were anxious to do so.</P>
    <P>We ask that an opportunity should be afforded the Dáil to inspect these documents before being tied to these proposals.  It is not an unreasonable request.  In fact, if members of a local authority attempted to enter into a contract of this kind without having seen the details, I am quite sure they would be held up to odium by the Department of Local Government, and I am not at all sure, in view of recent events, that that would not be sufficient justification for dissolving that local authority.  Local authorities have been held up to odium for committing sins of a very much smaller character.  Here we are in the dark asked to accept this contract of very considerable magnitude without having seen the documents in connection with it.  To my mind that is not a reasonable proposal. It is not, shall I say to the Minister, a commercial proposal.  Before we are asked to accept this contract and pass this particular Bill, there ought to be an undertaking given by the Minister that an opportunity will be afforded for a thorough inspection of these documents.</P>
    <P>May I make one other point in this connection?  When we were discussing this Bill on a previous occasion it was pointed out that by reason of the small scale to which the drawings submitted <Col N="1707" /> to the experts were prepared they were unable to arrive at what, in their opinion, was an estimate for the work involved.  They said they could only go within 10 per cent. of what was the value of the work included in the plans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Page 80.  The phraseology of the final finding is correct, but the implication in the reading of the preamble is entirely wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The President discussed this matter on a previous occasion.  It is quite obvious to those who are experts in the matter, that if you have a set of drawings, drawn to what is known as an eighth scale, except you have details amplifying these drawings it is impossible for any man to prepare a definite estimate.  For that reason the experts said they could only go within 10 per cent. of the value of the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Not for that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can make his point quite clear.  I am prepared to stand over that statement.  The point I want to make from that is that the experts themselves were not satisfied that these drawings were complete, and further details were necessary. Before we are called upon to enter into this contract, we should be satisfied, not alone with the completeness of the drawings, but we should be given a full opportunity of examining the scheme, and of seeing the details attached to these drawings, so that we will be able to judge, as far as we can judge, whether we are getting value for the money which we are called upon to pay. These are only elementary matters in commerce.  If we were to do in commerce what the House is here called upon to do, I am afraid the mentality of some of us would be called in question. I do not want to take up the time of the House unnecessarily, but an amount of suspicion, as I have pointed out before, and as has been <Col N="1708" /> pointed out by Deputy Thrift and others to-day, surrounds this whole proposal. The very action of the Minister has engendered that suspicion.  The very withholding of documents has done so.  I urge that, even at this stage, some opportunity should be given to any who desire to see these drawings to express their views on them before the House is tied to this contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little hope of getting a proper judgment from the Deputy on documents which he says are withheld, when I see what little use he can make, and how fair a judgment he can form, of documents already in his possession.  I want to call attention to the complete inaccuracy of the statement to which he devoted portion of his speech.  He said there were certain plans criticised by the experts as being on too small a scale, and for that reason I interrupted the Deputy at that time, but those were his words&mdash;the experts said that they could only regard this as a judgment of the probable cost within a margin of about ten per cent. I challenge him now to give me any page on which that connection is shown between the 10 per cent.  margin and the scale set out in the plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will look up page 80 he will see what I referred to.  If I do not trespass too much on the time of the House, I will read the paragraph.  &ldquo;The plan handed to the experts does not show any detailed constructions.  According to the rules of the Swiss Institute of Engineers and Architects, with regard to the drawing up of engineers' plans, three different kinds of prepared plans are distinguished, viz.: (1) general plan with approximate estimates; (2) building plan with estimates; (3) detailed elaboration.  From the point of view of this differentiation, Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert's plan must be considered as a building plan.&rdquo; Now come the important words: &ldquo;It permits of a judgment of the probable costs within a margin of about 10 per cent.  Accordingly the data can be described as sufficient to enable one to arrive at a judgment as to workability of the scheme.&rdquo; I think that makes clear everything I stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1709" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether the experts at any time asked for a more detailed set of plans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Their opinion was that no more detailed set of plans could be put in at that point, and they had no intention of asking further.  If Deputy Good thinks that paragraph proves what he said, that certain plans drawn to certain scales and the ten per cent. were joined together, I repeat that the ten per cent. margin depends upon particulars with regard to the bringing of an impervious type of clay from a place up the river to a point lower down where it might be needed. In the main it refers to this and this only.  It is a thing that Deputy Good, if any Deputy in the House should be aware of it, should know.  It refers to the fact that where you are going on with an excavation process, inasmuch as the material which is to be excavated is not known, it cannot be known until the last ounce of material is excavated. Your costs of that can only be binding within certain margins, and the ten per cent. margin is mainly intended to cover that.  It is impossible, until the last portion of material is extracted, to find out to the last penny what the scheme is going to cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the plans and the statement, I am quite satisfied with what the experts say&mdash;that the plans do not show the details of the construction and therefore they could not get nearer than a price of ten per cent. of the possible cost of construction.  I cannot put any other reading on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very different interpretation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very different.  The Deputy's previous statement was that there was a suspicion in the minds of the experts that they had not sufficient details to enable them to give a complete judgment, a judgment to the last penny.  Of all the men in the world, any person who has a knowledge of contracting work ought to know that until the work is actually finished and every item of the material is extracted, you cannot give a binding estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1710" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Until a contract is finished?  That is another matter.  We are called upon to give a binding estimate before the work is started.  It is impossible to get a close binding contract unless you have details showing all the work that is to be included in the contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The details that are not here will be required to give you absolutely the last penny to be spent on the contract.  Just think that in regard to the details somebody will have to say accurately, and beyond all fear of contradiction, that in the stretch of the canal 100 yards broad and about six miles long there are going to be X units of rock and Y units of earth. Somebody has to say that without any danger of contradiction before there can be a completely binding estimate. If Deputy Good believes that anybody in the world could make that statement, then I will say that the contract is not made soundly.  That is not the only point.  I will make a slight variation for material to be dredged from the river, but that is regarded as inconsiderable in the contract.  You may take it 9½ of the 10 per cent. simply depends on whether it is rock or earth. You have to excavate the tail-race and the canal.  On no other points were the experts concerned when they wrote that phrase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>There again I must differ.  I hope the Minister will forgive me interrupting so often.  The point is this: he instances the case of the embankment. There is a great deal of work included in this contract other than embankments.  It may be a cost with regard to embankments until borings are actually made in a position, but you cannot tell whether you have to excavate rock or sand.  You have a schedule with types of contracts which deal with one or the other.  Possibly the excavation would be taken in sand.  If the contractor is undertaking to deal with sand only he will charge extra for rock.  That is an everyday occurrence. Do not let the Minister lead us away by saying that is what is referred to in this.  I say that is not what is referred to in this particular clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1711" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one point of view against another.  The figure of .05 will cover the whole variation in the contract as far as the embankments are concerned.  The margin of 10 per cent. is confined to the dredging of the head race and the tail race.  The tail race is to be blasted out of solid rock, but if it occurs where rock is not to be encountered, it is so much saved.  The allowance is there, and it is almost entirely for rock.  In the head race it is a question of excavating for rock or sand.  The experts give it as their considered judgment that 10 per cent. covers all that, and that the 10 per cent. margin is on the cost of civil engineering, of the two and a half millions portion of the contract.  Outside that there is no variation against the scheme. There is a variation, a possible variation, and a very probable variation, in favour of the scheme.  Deputy Good has talked about this as an unusual contract.  It is a very unusual contract. I wonder would Deputy Good like to find himself bound up in a contract in which the prices were the maximum that he could charge but under which his prices were to be compared with those at which any reputable firm in any part of the world could do the work at the time and under which his prices would have to come down if the comparison with those of another firm were unfavourable, and that his prices could not rise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to interrupt the Minister more than is absolutely necessary, but he has called me in question again.  Let me point out clearly to him that once he has entered into a contract with this particular firm, he is not going to get further competitive estimates for work that is not placed with people from whom he expects such estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already mentioned that matter, and I do not intend to go over these competitive estimates again.  I got the Deputy to advance some points since last we discussed the matter, that there are ways of getting estimates, that it is possible to get some idea of what some portion of the work can be done by a reputable <Col N="1712" /> firm in any other part of the world.  I put it to the Deputy as a personal matter, would he like to have a contract made in which his prices were based on an upward scale but in which, as far as beating them down was concerned, they could be checked and measured by the amount at which another contractor in any other country could do the work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I reply to that by stating that I have thirty odd years' experience of contracting and I never heard of such methods of contracting before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid Deputy Good, in one phrase he used, when he said this was the reason why an inquiry was called, was getting back to the amendments of the 2nd April.  The Deputy made one point with regard to the contract.  He asked&mdash;Did I want the House to authorise the work without seeing the plans?  I put to him the analogy of the Board of Works, and I said that the House does authorise work, under the Board of Works, without seeing the plans.  His answer to me&mdash;I hope I have got it correctly&mdash; was that the estimate of costs comes before us on plans which are prepared by our engineers and on specifications adopted by our Engineers.  That is the point.  Before this contract is made it will be absolutely in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>It will never be in that position&mdash;it can never be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be in that position inasmuch as it will have been handled by the Government engineers, and the contract that will be made on another point with the firm of Siemens-Schuckert, will not be simply the Siemens-Schuckert scheme even with that schedule of costs that I have, but the scheme with the schedule of costs modified, on such further modification as the Government engineers think fit to put on it.  On that point it assumes <Col N="1713" /> absolutely the character of a contract that the Board of Works might bring forward with an estimate of costs, with the exception that the Deputy will probably make&mdash;that the Board of Works contract, at any rate, can be tested out by open competitive tenders, and this cannot.  That point I will admit, and I get back now to the previous argument that this is an unusual contract and put up as such.  We can only approach it in the ordinary way. What is the ordinary way of approaching it?  Ask an engineer to draw up plans and pay him three per cent. or £125,000 on a scheme of this magnitude? We had to come to the House to get leave to spend this money at a time when any engineers, who had any thought of hydro-electrical matters in the country, were engrossed on what would be the enormous blunder of the Liffey scheme.</P>
      <P>In that atmosphere somebody had to go to the House and say: &ldquo;We want money to look into the possibilities of the Shannon development.&rdquo;  Where were we to get engineers?  We would have to go abroad for them.  Immediately we would have the cry: &ldquo;What about the Irish or British engineers?&rdquo; This is an unusual scheme, and it had to be tackled in an unusual way.  Nobody can say that the facing up of the problem by the Government, as shown in the White Paper, was enthusiastic. Deputy Hewat used the phrase in the last debate that this firm came along and enthused the Government.  I would ask Deputies to read the details in the White Paper.  In that Paper the phrase occurs here and there that the Government are not convinced this, that, or the other thing might happen.  If anything, it was a chilling reception that the Siemens-Schuckert firm got, and the result of working it in this unusual fashion has been that the sum of £125,000, consulting engineers' fees, has been definitely saved; that we have got contractors into this position, that they have a scheme binding on them in so far as maximum costs are concerned, and that scheme has to be handled by our engineers as to the minimum costs which we think necessary and adequate for this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that the contract will have definitely <Col N="1714" /> and absolutely assumed the same form as any contract on foot of which the Secretary of the Board of Works would come here for his estimate. I have definitely stated that I do not consider it is commercially moral to get a firm of contractors into this position and then reveal their costs so that other competing contractors may combine to cut them out of certain details.  This firm has brought forward a project and put it in the position in which it can be made an achievement, and their costs should not be thrown open publicly.  The costs binding on them should not be thrown open for cut-throat competition by rivals, and that is not going to be done.  The Deputy has used the phrase that this is a contractor's proposal. It is a contractor's proposal that has run many gauntlets.  It has passed the experts and it has to pass the engineers, the most competent engineers that I can get to carry out the scheme for me.  If the House does not think fit to entrust to a Minister acting under the Government and associating with himself engineers to test out still further a scheme that has been tested to the extent that this has, then of course you need not trust the Government for anything.  There has to be trust at some point in this, and this is the point on which it must necessarily come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one phrase which Deputy Good let fall which indicates a point of view that is not uncommon, and I want to put in a demurrer. Deputy Good is arguing as though the Oireachtas was an executive body.  He said if we were to do in commerce what the House is asked to do, certain things would go wrong.  I suggest to Deputy Good definitely that he, and all men in commerce, are doing this identical thing every day in the week.  If we were to draw an analogy, the analogy is that the House is the equivalent of the shareholders and the Ministry is the equivalent of the directors, and they have their experts to advise them.  The shareholders do not inspect and examine all the plans of works and all the terms of contracts. That is the analogy, and I maintain that there has been in commerce every <Col N="1715" /> day, every week, and every month exactly a parallel operation.  That is happening now.</P>

      <Col N="1717" /> Question proposed&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Before deciding to adopt this section it would be well that the Dáil should realise the full implications of all the powers that are given to the Minister thereby, because the Minister talked about the words &ldquo;incidental to&rdquo; being in accordance with precedent.  I do not know where he found the precedent for the extensive powers that are conferred on him.  Let me take only one point.  The Minister, under sub-head (g) of sub-section (1), is entitled to &ldquo;construct and maintain railways and tramways (whether worked by steam, internal combustion, or electric power) docks and piers.&rdquo; He is not limited in any sense.  He is not limited to constructing his railways on the Shannon; he can construct and maintain railways, under this section, anywhere in the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>Who is to say what the purpose of the undertaking is?  It might, for the purpose of the undertaking, suit him to take over the late Dublin and South Eastern Railway and electrify it.  He could say that that was for the purpose of the undertaking, that it was in order that it might have a market for electricity.  Let us know what we are doing.  In this experiment in State Socialism, and in practically uncontrolled State Socialism, let us at any rate know what we are doing.  If we are going to give this precedent to Deputy Johnson and other Deputies, let us do it with our eyes open, but do not let us have Deputies who believe in private property and private enterprise who belong to the Government Party coming to us afterwards and complaining: &ldquo;Oh, we never knew what we were doing.&rdquo;  This is a very big experiment. We all hope that it will be an experiment for good, but we ought to realise that in order that the experiment may be carried out we are giving colossal powers, powers that will have to be exercised with the very greatest care, powers which are conferred not <Col N="1718" /> only on the present Minister&mdash;the whole Dáil, I think, has great confidence in the present Minister&mdash;but on any Minister for Industry and Commerce, so that if the Government decide to reward Deputy Beamish or Deputy O'Mara for their regularity of attendance here with the office of Minister for Industry and Commerce, they could exercise the powers; if the Government decided that another Minister from County Monaghan was needed and made him Minister for Industry and Commerce he could exercise the powers.  Equally they could be exercised by a Minister for Industry and Commerce coming from the Farmers' Party or the Labour Party.  It is not a matter of confidence in the Minister, or even of confidence   scheme, that makes me mistrust this experiment&mdash;I did not catch the President's remark.</P>

      <P>The Independents are too stereotyped and not sufficiently cohesive to take office.  Besides, they also have the quality known as modesty.  I would not like to suggest any Independent Deputy as a suitable Minister for Industry and Commerce. No doubt, if the few remaining individualists that we have, Deputy Hewat or Deputy Good, became Minister for Industry and Commerce the first action of either would be to repeal this Bill. Will Deputies read this section and realise exactly what the powers you are giving mean and put it to themselves whether they are justified in standing over them?  It is a most gigantic experiment. Once it is launched I think Deputies will agree, Deputies who have put down amendments as well as anyone else, that it must be given a fair chance without carping criticism.  But until this Bill is through the Dáil we should fail in our duty if we did not point out the vastness of the powers sought by it, and all the implications attached thereto.</P>

      <P>I will follow my friend and colleague, Deputy Cooper, on the lines of his criticism of this clause and <Col N="1719" /> of the wide powers it gives to the Minister. We must all recognise that the Dáil is in its infancy, and whereas great things are expected of it in the future, at all events, at the present time our legislation is forming the foundation for growth hereafter.  I wonder has a Bill giving a Minister such wide and exhaustive powers as this Bill gives to the Minister for Industry and Commerce ever been passed <i>in toto</i> in a Parliament before.  I cannot claim to have any experience of Parliamentary proceedings in other places; I can only say that if as wide powers had been given to any Government under a Bill of the kind anywhere else I would like to have the reference.  This particular clause, in its way, is not more drastic and far-reaching than the clause preceding it. But the two together, added to other <Col N="1720" /> clauses in the Bill, I think, give the Minister more power than this House ought to give in a matter of the kind. As Deputy Cooper said, when the Minister has got this Bill through the House and in operation he will find it difficult to know what he could not do under it.</P>
