      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether arrangements have yet been completed for making loans available from the Local Loans Vote for the building of teachers' residences, and, if not, if he will state when it is expected to have them completed.</P>

      <P>No arrangements are being made for the purpose of making loans out of the Local Loans Fund for the provision of residences for national teachers, and no provision has been inserted for such an object in the Local Loans Vote for 1925-26.  The maximum loan permissible under the National School Teachers' Residences (Ireland) Acts, 1875, etc., is £250.  In view of the present cost of building such a sum would be insufficient to meet the cost of providing a residence.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state upon what grounds in a case where Messrs. Suttons, Ltd., were applicants, the report for £138 10s., made by the County Court Judge, Mr. Justice Pigot, K.C., at Limerick, on the 6th December, 1923, was reduced to £15 4s. 6d.; if he is aware that the claim was fully investigated by the County Court Judge <Col N="1648" /> and resisted by the State Solicitor, and that the claim consisted of £195 for a motor car, and £9 10s. 6d. for coal seized by Irregulars during the investment of Limerick in June and July, 1922, and converted by them to their own use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction to which the Deputy refers was made because I was advised that the evidence before the learned judge as to the circumstances in which the motor-car was taken did not justify his making a recommendation in respect of the loss. The amount actually paid was the amount recommended by the judge in respect of the loss of coal, plus costs and expenses of the hearing.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that forty-six temporary clerks with long service, of whom twenty-seven are British ex-Service men, have been dismissed from the Department of Industry and Commerce, and that their places have been filled by temporary clerks from other Departments; whether, in view of the Minister's statement in the Dáil recently, that these dismissals were necessary to make room for permanent officers who had passed an examination, he will state the reasons for dispensing with the services of these clerks, and whether he is prepared to reinstate these officers, or to offer them employment in other Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of clerks who have actually been dismissed from the Department of Industry and Commerce is eleven.  The places of these clerks have not been filled by temporary clerks from other Departments, and the reason for their discharge, as already stated, was to make room for ex-Army candidates who have passed a competitive examination for permanent employment.  Wherever possible continuing employment is found in the service generally for temporary clerks about to be discharged from a particular Department, but no vacancies are available to which the clerks who have already been dismissed could be appointed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply, does the Minister not consider that he is more or less under a moral obligation in this matter, in view of the arrangements made at the time of the Treaty?  A large number of these temporary clerks were prevented from transferring to Great Britain, because if they had gone the work would have been badly held up, due to inexperienced men coming in.  Has he now nothing better to offer them than dismissal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said that we cannot keep people for whom there is no work.  We cannot delay or avoid the ordinary recruitment of the service by competitive examinations, getting as far as we can the best material available.  Every step is being taken to avoid unnecessary hardship in dealing with these dismissals.  I have arranged that for the future a representative of the temporary clerks will sit on the Substitution Board which deals with the transfers, where possible, to other Departments of clerks who are redundant in any particular Department.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that the President has recently consented to deal personally with any cases which will be put to him by a committee representative of the ex-Service men, and will the Minister be good enough to postpone the notices to these men pending investigation by that Committee, which has not yet had time to sit, but will sit very shortly?

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Office of Public Works has only received one claim from the County Wexford Board of Health arising out of the military occupation of Gorey Workhouse, namely, that for £404 2s. 3d., which is referred to in the present question, and was the one dealt with in the Deputy's question of 27th March.  This claim is in respect of occupation, rent and damage to the premises, and the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has still under consideration the question of whether the compensation, or part of it, should be paid to him, the buildings being vested in him.  The payment of £35 19s. 3d. recently made in respect of the part of the claim covering glazing and building up of loopholes was, as stated in the reply to the Deputy's question of 27th March, only made to the Board of Health as a special measure in view of the urgency of the repairs.</P>
      <P>No claim for £66 0s. 0d. has been received in the Office of Public Works in connection with this occupation, but the Board of Health has foreshadowed a further claim in respect of damage to furniture.</P>

If the Deputy would provide me with the information on which he relies, I could see what might further be done.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether the Secretary of his Department wrote in March, 1923, to the Commission on Reconstruction and Development recommending proposals for the hydroelectric development of the Liffey, and expressing the view that private capital could probably be found for the purpose, and urging that the Executive Council's financial responsibility for <Col N="1652" /> such enterprises should be strictly limited to temporary guarantees of interest upon the debenture portion of the capital required; and whether, in view of the Executive Council's resolution regarding the Shannon Scheme, he will cause copies of that letter to be circulated to Deputies before the matter be discussed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The reference is apparently to a letter which is marked confidential, and was sent by my Department two years ago to the Commission on Reconstruction and Development. With the letter was a memorandum containing suggestions made at the request of the Commission as to a number of development schemes which might be considered by the Commission. Included in these suggestions was a Liffey scheme.</P>
      <P>In the covering letter the following reference to these suggestions was made:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Your Commissioners will appreciate that any suggestions now made are merely the suggestions of departmental officials, and do not in any sense represent considered suggestions made with Ministerial or Government authority.  The Government does not, in fact, wish to commit itself on such questions or to lay proposals before the Oireachtas until it has been able to consider the recommendations of your Commission.&rdquo;</P>

It has been ascertained that Lieutenant Smith, acting on a requisition from a sergeant of the Gárda Síochána, accompanied the sergeant and another guard, with a small party of troops to the house of Mr. Kilkenny in a search for armed men who were believed to be hiding there.  Mr. Kilkenny made a violent attack on Lieutenant Smith, and fled. Lieutenant Smith did not lose his revolver in the struggle.

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I moved to report progress upon this amendment, when it was under discussion this day week, and as a week has elapsed since that discussion took place, it would be well to review, and perhaps somewhat to reiterate, the arguments that have been put up in connection with this matter.  I was dealing with it, and the President, on that occasion, said that no case had been put forward for the acceptance of the amendment, or that the case put forward was so poor that it was still sufficient to warrant a ring in his voice&mdash;something approaching the tone of the celebrated &ldquo;mahogany&rdquo; speech, or the &ldquo;antique-furniture&rdquo; speech.  He said that no more <Col N="1663" /> than ten houses would be affected in the Deputy's constituency by this thing.  I had to join issue upon that statement.  I had to show that we were not alone dealing with this, but that other measures had preceded it&mdash; the Housing Act of 1924, and a section put into the Local Government Bill, and which was carried and has become law, and giving a remission of rates on all buildings erected since 1920 and up to 1927, inclusive.  Furthermore, any buildings that had been restored or repaired or renovated would have a further advantage of a reduction in the assessed rates equal to two-thirds.  I was endeavouring to demonstrate that this was inimical to the welfare of the agrarian community.  I was endeavouring to point out that the land, already unjustly rated&mdash;a contention that no man can deny&mdash;must still, owing to all these cumulative effects of these ameliorative measures, as the President calls them in the House, bear a greater and a more undue burden than what it has heretofore borne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President was rather sarcastic and was endeavouring to twit me with not having his experience of public life. Quite true, I have not had his experience, but I have had an undesirable experience; I have had the experience of paying rates for some years back which exceeded my land purchase annuity by about 50 per cent.  That is a thing I never want to have revived, but if we continue in this policy&mdash;and, remember, this Housing Bill is not the last that will come before the Oireachtas, we are promised Bills for the next 10 or 20 years to come&mdash;the effect will be that the urban interest&mdash;the bourgeoise interest&mdash;will have secured an undue influence over the agricultural community. That is a proposition which we can scarcely stand over.  We cannot be silent assentors to that.  We farmers have been put up on a definite issue, to secure as far as possible justice for our people.  We have been, so far, beaten all along the line, but I do not believe, at this time of day, in making a surrender.  We have got to fight every one of those questions on its merits, and, beaten at one point, we <Col N="1664" /> must make a strategic retreat to another.</P>
    <P>The President was inclined to twit me with inexperience.  I could retort, and ask him was it his experience, acquired in the Dublin Corporation, he was boasting of.  Remember, the Dublin Corporation is of blessed memory, and the President who is, perhaps, the epitome of this tradition which the Minister for Local Government, inferentially, by his act of suppression, characterised as infamous, if I may use such a word with propriety, still asserts and puts himself on this pedestal.  But we see what the thing really is.  I am afraid that in the statement of the President we have something like this psychic gravitation to egoism, and perhaps another thing, a rather restricted vision&mdash;a vision so restricted, perhaps, that he loses sight of the verities. His attitude may very well be held to mark perhaps a recission of the ethical principles from his consciousness, while he is at liberty, I admit, to stand up in his defence and come to the House more or less as an ancient mariner.  But as friend to friend, despite all this, I would suggest to him for prudential considerations, that he must know that the imputation of senility in politics is damning.  It is a question for himself and his own good judgement whether we are to continue in this harangue, in this strain or not.  I submit then that taking this thing into being it is a desirable thing to restrict the powers of the Minister to remit rates; that he should not supersede and override the wishes of the local authorities who are elected by and are primarily responsible to the people.  If the local authorities are willing to remit the rates, that is their concern.  They are directly answerable to their electorate, but it is not a fair thing or scarcely a correct thing, that the Minister should override their wishes and grant remission, perhaps, on the demand of a clamorous minority.  I move the amendment standing in my name.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I observe that no case was made against this particular suggestion in the Bill by the Deputy who has just spoken.  If a case had been made I would be prepared to consider it.  The Deputy said that in my <Col N="1665" /> speech the other day I said there would be ten houses built in his constituency. I did not say that.  I have the report here, and I said, &ldquo;taking the Deputy's constituency, if we build ten houses in Clare, what expense on the local authority is that?&rdquo;  The Deputy might have concerned himself with that.  It is a pretty just proposition; it is sensible, and does not mean great speeches of big words or anything of that sort.  It is solid business.  Why does not the Deputy concern himself with it and show that in connection with the 69 houses in the course of construction in his area, and which has benefited considerably from this grant, that the constituency has improved, and that the valuation will be increased by something like £690 by reason of this particular addition that was made last year under this Act.  As a result of that sum so given, something like £20,000 was spent in the Deputy's constituency. A good deal of employment was given in that particular area, and the Deputy has not shown by reason of the building of those 69 houses how a single penny expense was put on the local authority.  If he would concern himself more with that and leave the dictionary alone, we would get on more quickly with the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The President seems to miss the point.  I am concerned with the cumulative effect of all the Acts adopted on this housing question, the Act of 1924, the Amendment of the Local Government Act, and this.  True enough, the houses erected under the Act may, on a narrow basis, be held to have occasioned no loss to the local authority.  You must take a wider outlook, and look at things perhaps in a larger perspective.  We must be concerned with the incidence of taxation.  How many of those 69 houses are being erected in urban areas and how many in rural areas?  If a house is erected in a rural area, it is a fair assumption that it is put up by a farmer, but as to the house erected or reconstructed in an urban area, who would benefit by this section if it is passed?  It is well to bear in mind that it is the monied people and the monied interests who will receive the direct benefit.  The demand of the <Col N="1666" /> well-to-do is for a modern house, and the old houses are relegated to the slums.  Therefore, the people who can afford to build a house in your urban areas will benefit, and it is from those areas that the whole demand will come for the remission of rates.  On the general principle, I submit that we ought not to agree with the wording &ldquo;which when required by the Minister shall,&rdquo; for it is really the demand of the well-to-do that will come up before the Minister.  They will seek to get a dole at the expense of a public, poorer than themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the President ought to pass over the real aspect of this case so lightly.  The last Act offered inducement to people to build houses.  A great number of people took advantage of that fact and built houses down the country.  These houses are being built by people with money, and they would have done that without this inducement of exemption from rates which is offered to them. They would do it as a speculation.  The average man will have to bear the burden of taxation without any remission, and he is generally living in a poor hovel.  His position everywhere is worse than that of the people who built houses.  There have been more speculations in this country than in housing. People have speculated in land, paid extraordinary prices for it, and found themselves in the Bankruptcy Court as a result of it.  What exemption is offered to those people who are in a bad position because of that?  People who entered into speculation other than in lands also are in a bad position. The people of the country are crying out.  &ldquo;We cannot pay our way,&rdquo; but the people who could pay their way better than any and who entered into those speculations outside of what is offered to them now, and with their eyes open, are offered this additional benefit.  It is all right to say the people who are paying will be no worse off, but it must make some people very much better off.  It is an unfair discrimination, and, to my mind, it is not sound.  It will establish a principle on which I think any responsible Government should be very slow to embark. I do not think it is even honest from <Col N="1667" /> the point of view of the people of the country.  To my mind, it has much more far-reaching reactions than the President seems to think, and I would ask him to think very carefully about this amendment before he rejects it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording of the section shows that in the first place the local authority has to exercise its discretion.  If the local authority unfairly discriminates against persons the matter can come before the Minister, and if there be wealthy persons concerned it would be for the consideration of the Minister whether or not he should prescribe that this particular benefit shall be derived by the person who is building the house.  The Deputy instanced the case of persons who bought lands.  I have very great sympathy for those people who bought land at prohibitive prices, and who now find themselves in difficulties.  As far as the State or the people or the district are concerned, how are they benefited by the big prices that were paid for land?  Only the individual who sold the land benefited.  Who is benefited by expenditure in housing?  Various people, such as the mason, the carpenter, the slater, the plumber, the plasterer, and so on.  Some advantage is derived in the locality by reason of such expenditure, and the expenditure is incurred at a time when, as we know, the market value of the house when built is not what it cost.  Consequently, some consideration must be given a person who does a little more than speculate, as in a case of this kind.  Speculations are of various kinds.  One can speculate on the Stock Exchange, one can speculate on the Turf, or purchase a business, but when one gives employment in a district to various people in the course of a speculation, that is a speculation of a sounder character than the ordinary one that one thinks of on the first or the last pages of a newspaper.</P>

      <P>May I point out that a good deal of the discussion has centred around the question where there should be a remission of rates.  Most of the arguments have been directed to that question.  It is not the question raised by the amendment.  The question raised by the amendment is whether the Minister shall have power to override the decision of the local authority.  As I see it, whether the Minister has that power under this section or not, he will have it by another section.  It is clear, if that is the Minister's mind, that he will not make grants to the local authority unless in the case of houses in districts where the local authority has already decided to remit rates, so that the question raised by Deputy Hogan's amendment does <Col N="1669" /> not arise.  It is clear that no difference will accrue in the Minister's power whether the words are deleted or whether they remain in.  Powers are given under Section 3 where the Minister may make grants to persons, local authorities, and so on.  Of course he may make conditions, and one of the conditions may be, as has been publicly announced, that the local authorities shall make a remission of rates for a period of years.  It may be well to know publicly whether it is the present intention <Col N="1670" /> of the Minister to continue to restrict grants to those local areas where the local authority has decided to make remission of rates for this period.  As I see it, unless some understanding is arrived at regarding Ministerial policy, which, of course, can only be the present policy, acceptance or deletion of the four or five words make no difference whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 12, to delete the word &ldquo;nineteen&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;eight.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will notice that the proposal contained in the section is to give over a period of nineteen years remission of rates specified in the schedule.  In the first year it would be a remission of 19/20ths or 95 per cent.  The whole effect of the proposal is that for ten years those houses erected, or reconstructed, under this Bill would escape liability for rates.  I submit that that is an undue period&mdash;even if we accept the principle that such houses have a right to have the rates remitted&mdash;and that to give it for nineteen years is excessive.  I move that eight years should be substituted, because in my opinion a remission for that period is desirable.  It is true that further on the schedule will require amendment but that can be done.  A remission of four years at 50 per cent. would be a very good thing, and so also would be a remission of 25 per cent. for the <Col N="1671" /> subsequent four years.  I do not quite agree with the principle that nineteen years should be accepted.  It is scarcely fair to the other taxpayers, and, remember, in this connection the proposal means to give it to houses which are reconstructed.  When those houses are reconstructed they will be revalued, and it is just a problem whether the valuation will be increased or will remain stationary, but it is possible that an increase will take place.  Let us think what this proposal in regard to ten years will mean.  Supposing a house in an urban area gets a remission for ten years.  It might have an original valuation of £12 and the subsequent valuation might be £15 or £16. The State is giving £40, which, I take it, will be a maximum and it will be more or less <i>pro rata</i> to the amount of repairs executed.  The effect will be that in the first year, if the valuation is £16 and if the rates were 10/- in the pound, rates would amount to £8. Under the old scheme the rates would be £6.  I submit that, having regard to the poverty of many people, this proposal of nineteen years is one which should not go through and I ask the Dáil to accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This is practically saying the same thing as was said before.  Under the Local Government Act just passed, new houses come in for special consideration, and that special consideration starts, I think, in 1926 and runs to 1933.  To put in the word &ldquo;eight&rdquo; and not to take into account any amendment of that Act would mean, obviously, that those persons who would build would take advantage of the clause passed last week.  It is not customary in legislative institutions to pass an Act one week and to restrict it the next, but that is exactly what we will be doing if we pass this amendment. Compare&mdash;and this is the real question at issue&mdash;the advantages provided under this Bill, and the clause which was inserted in the Local Government Act a fortnight or three weeks ago, and, we find, in the case of a valuation of £16, with rates 10/- in the pound, allowing for the 5 per cent. valuation, that the Local Government Act advantage is <Col N="1672" /> £30 16s. 9d. for a period of twenty years, whereas in the case of the Housing Act of last year the advantage is £38.  There is not much between them.  This advantage, which was given last year, was, I believe, responsible to some extent for the very great success of last year's Act.  There is a shortage of houses, and every effort must be made to try to have houses erected.  We had evidence of that only yesterday at a meeting in Dublin of persons keenly interested in housing. I very much welcome such meetings, and I hope that good results will come from them.  As to the point about which the Deputy said he did not wish to refer in extenso, that is, in connection with reconstruction, I may say that that is the only weak point, and we propose to amend it.  I think on the next stage I will be able to introduce an amendment which will provide that the old valuation in the case of reconstructed houses would stand for seven years.  That would be an advantage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I move to delete sub-section (3).  The purpose of the amendment is to prevent the removal of restrictions on the selling price and rent. The Act of 1924 definitely laid down in the schedule the prices that should be obtained for these houses when built, or the rent that should be charged.  I contend that those restriction clauses should be incorporated in the present Bill, for if that is not done the Housing Bill will become nothing but a speculation.  I take it that the object the President has in view is not that, but rather to provide houses for the people who are badly housed at present. The removal of this sub-section, taken in conjunction with the fact that there is to be a remission of rates, is to my mind going to militate against the person who will eventually occupy the house.  As I said in the discussion on the amendment proposed by Deputy Connor Hogan, there are houses in respect of which landlords are liable for the payment of some of the rates, and those people may, if they get the grant under this Bill, charge a sufficient rent to pay rates without having an obligation to pay any rates at all, and thereby take part in a speculation which has for its object a different thing altogether to the object I believe to be in the President's mind.  Another thing in connection with this section is that it is more retrospective legislation.  The people who built under the 1924 Act did so with their eyes open, and it must have been a good business proposition or they would not have embarked on <Col N="1675" /> it.  I think in the best interests of the object that the President has in mind that that clause ought to be retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as we have been able to discover, only something like 200 houses out of all those of which notice for reconstruction has been given were reserved for sale or letting. The remainder were intended by those who had them built for occupation by the person paying the money.  One of the arguments, I suppose, that would get least consideration either in this House or in the Seanad would be to say that it is a matter of administrative convenience.  Well, it is certainly, to my mind, one slight consideration in this matter.  Will the extra trouble, expense, waste of time, and all the rest, be worth reserving that particular section restricting the sale price, considering all that we will get for it?  I was told in the Seanad last year by a member of the Labour Party that I might have what restrictions I liked, and people would get through them. We thought they were so tightly drawn that it would not be possible to get through them, but we are informed from nearly all sides that the restrictions in respect of the sale or letting were the main obstacles to the Act being a real success in the cities and towns during last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite agree with the Deputy that I had in mind a proposal to provide houses for people who at present are very badly housed, in other words, for occupants of the slums.  I would much prefer to see these people benefit by the activities of the local authorities. In dealing with those people that ought to be taken into account, and in several cities where there is congestion, and where there are large areas of slums, very particular attention is being given by the local authorities.  In Cork we know there is a very big scheme on hands, and in Dublin I believe there is a proposal to construct over 1,000 houses during the next twelve months. While all that is the case, and while, as can be seen, we are giving more advantages to local authorities, we nevertheless wish to resuscitate the speculative builder for many reasons, and if for no better reason than that his activities <Col N="1676" /> and co-operation are essential towards a reduction of the congestion, and the real slum problem at present is the congestion.  I do not think that in the history of the country housing congestion has been so marked, so intense, as at present, and we believe that taking out those restriction clauses, which, so far as our experience of last year is concerned, affect something like eight per cent. of the houses built, will have more satisfactory results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider it fair if a person were to be permitted to charge a high rent over and above what he would expect to get as an ordinary profit out of the transaction, and who will also have his rates remitted?  Surely there ought to be some check in the matter.  Would the Minister between this and the next stage give consideration to that point?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There is scarcely any question I have given so much attention to as this particular one.  I put up that particular objection to a number of experts.  My own answer to it was that if a man could get an exorbitant rent, a rack rent, it was obvious that there was a field there for rack rents.  If he could sell a house at a higher price than we have specified it is obvious that there is a market for houses of a higher price.  It means then on his part greater activity during the next twelve months than during the last twelve months, and we achieve one thing that is essential towards any solution of the housing problem, not an ideal thing, I agree, but an absolute essential if you are going to deal with that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with that, but at the same time&mdash;I am sorry if I am somewhat out of order in going back to the rates question&mdash;I take it that if you are going to remit the rates you want to relieve the tenant.  If a person is permitted to charge a rack-rent, an exorbitant rent, is it fair to allow him to drift away from his obligation to pay rates to the local authority for that year?  There should be some restriction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I admit it is not fair.  But, even though it is not fair, you are certainly enlarging that <Col N="1677" /> man's activities by reason of this.  You are showing him there is a market, and I believe that in order to reduce that market, and in order to bring down those rack-rents, you will have to build more houses.  As more houses are built, the rack-rents will fall.  The people in the rack-rented house will not remain there in two years' time if there are cheaper houses to be got by reason of our activities under this Bill.  Prices will have to be brought down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister is more or less thinking that the position created by this Bill is that there is no other way of getting houses than by holding out a particularly fruitful prospect to the speculative builder, certainly for the next two or three years. The possibilities of getting a rack-rent are obvious.  People are badly in need of houses, and, with all restrictions removed, the ability to pay on the part of prospective tenants will be exploited to the utmost.  Every possible penny will be squeezed out of the prospective tenant by virtue of the fact that he needs a house more than anything else. He is more or less compelled to live up to the margin and he will pay up to that margin, whether that includes rents and rates or rents alone. We are now going to give the speculative builder not merely the value of the subsidy, but, in fact, the value of a remission of rates for twenty years.  I have no doubt it is calculated that will bring into the field of building operations a large number of people who have not hitherto been in that business, and will thereby invite the building of a great many more houses than would otherwise be built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on the Second Reading, as a building trade subsidy Bill, this is, no doubt, very good.  Indirectly, also, in the long run it will, no doubt, assist in relieving the housing pressure, and it will possibly ease to some small degree the conditions in the overcrowded areas.  The degree will be so small that I doubt whether it would be appreciable before five or ten years. It is not the building of houses for the working-classes, as generally understood, that this Bill will effect.  On the assumption that we are providing money to enable speculative builders to <Col N="1678" /> make rather extravagant profits for the first two or three years, this Bill can be justified.  But to remove all restrictions, to give them the benefit of the rates remission and to allow them to make, either by selling or letting, any price they can, is certainly a happy prospect, provided the speculative builder can reach the people who have any money to spare.  It will lead to a contest between the urgent clamour on the part of people for houses and their ability to pay, and every penny of that they may be pressed to pay for the purpose of getting a house will be transferred in capital value some way to the speculative builder.</P>
    <P>As a subsidy to the speculative builder, this Bill is going to be effective. I cannot bring myself to agree to the insertion of the section which is going to have that effect without any restriction whatever either in regard to rent or price, and especially in regard to houses which have already been contracted for.  People have entered into engagements, prepared to pay certain prices and prepared to build a particular kind of house on the basis of last year's Bill.  Having, within twelve months, decided to pay a certain subsidy for house-building under particular conditions and those people having applied for that subsidy under those conditions, we are now saying to them: &ldquo;Well, you were very brave; you took risks.  You took the risk that if you had only waited you might have had a better subsidy.  We are going to reward you for that risk by offering you an absolute freedom of purchase and renting.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The better subsidy lies in the fact that you have still got a great mass of people clamouring for houses, and while, under the other Bill, you paid them subsidies of one hundred and an additional hundred, or some such figure, provided the houses were not sold within a certain number of years, and were not sold beyond a certain price, you are <Col N="1679" /> now removing those restrictions, and you are handing over £200 or £250, as the case may be, and telling them that they may get the most they can out of the market&mdash;the best out of the market.</P>

      <P>With all respect, that is not so.  We are talking now of subsidies. The subsidy for a five-roomed house under the present Bill to the builder is £75.  The subsidy to the speculative builder under the 1924 Act for the same size of house was £100. He was 25 per cent. better off under the 1924 Act.  Therefore, I fail to see the point of the Deputy's argument.</P>

      <P>The subsidy was given under the 1924 Act on conditions. One of these conditions was that the house would not be let beyond a certain figure per week nor sold beyond a certain price.  I think the Minister has indicated that no matter what conditions we laid down for the payment of the subsidy the persons who built houses have not complied and they are inclined to get released from these conditions by one way or another, legal or illegal.  The difference between this Bill and last year's Act is that we are now paying a subsidy, perhaps a smaller subsidy in the case of an individual private builder, but we are telling him that he may go into the market and that he can get the highest price possible.  I think Deputy Good told us last year that the limit of prices was too low.  If that be the case, we are now removing any limit whatever, and we are telling the builder that he is to take the most out of the market that he can get.  He is to exploit the demand for houses.  A starving community will pay any price for bread within the limits of their pockets, and <Col N="1680" /> that, within a degree, applies in respect of houses.  People will pay a rent for houses to the utmost limit they can afford.  With this particular subsidy, we are telling the private speculative builder that he is to take advantage of that hunger for houses and to induce him to do that, we are giving him a subsidy of £75 and £75 or £150 in all, or in the case of an association £200. As a house building proposition for the housing of the workers the Bill is not going to be very much good.  As a proposition for the speculative builder, I think it is very good, but I am not going to agree without opposition to the removal entirely of restrictions which I say are mainly in the interests of the speculative builder.</P>

      <P>The case which Deputy Johnson makes might hold if it were not a fact that local authorities are getting still greater advantages under this Bill than private builders. The actual number of houses which it appears the Dublin Corporation are considering under this Act is 1,200. In the case of the Cork Corporation the number is about 200.  That shows&mdash; and I think even Deputy Johnson will admit it&mdash;maximum activity as far as these large municipalities are concerned. I have not got the figures for any other area.  I believe Waterford has been active under last year's Act, and I believe their activities are not yet finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to what the local authorities themselves would do we have the advantages that are given to private builders.  If it could be shown to me that private builders would by any way, in which we could restrict them, do the same work as the Corporation, or any of these corporations, I would prefer to deal with them.  I do not see how that is possible.  I do not see any likelihood of private builders, no matter what inducements are given, doing the same thing as the corporations do, but having corporations actively engaged in doing gigantic work under this particular Bill and bringing in these outside agencies as well, I think that within a few years at such a maximum output, we should be able to deal with the question of congestion. <Col N="1681" /> My experience of profiteering is that it occurs where there is a shortage. This evil started anywhere when a shortage was noticeable.  I think that you will have profiteering in the <Col N="1682" /> matter of housing until the shortage is disposed of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move this amendment.  Deputies who look up <Col N="1684" /> Section 6, sub-section (2), of this Bill will realise that the expression &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; has two interpretations&mdash; first in respect of the council of any borough or urban district or the commissioners of any town, and in the next in respect of the area governed or administered by a county council, which is roughly the rural area.  This amendment would have the effect of enlarging the floor space by 350 square feet.  I am not very keen on the erection of small houses under this Bill; in my opinion it would be much better to erect large houses, even though they were sub-divided into flats.  However, I cannot speak with authority on the needs of the towns so much as on the needs of the country.  Perhaps some Deputies who come from towns would rather like to see the figure of 1,250 feet deleted and the house subsequently divided into a number of flats. Even if it had an area of 2,500 square feet two or three flats might serve a very useful purpose.  But my point is that in the country a house with an area of 1,250 square feet is rather small. A two-storey house 40 feet by 20 feet internal measurements, which would include the space occupied by the partitions and passages, would just give 1,600 square feet.  I submit that that is not an unduly large house; it is only just a reasonable size.  A man in a town can do with a smaller house than a man in the country.  In addition, the walls, as a rule, are stronger in the town, and the same must apply to the partitions.  It is all very well, of course, for us to say that Euclid's definition of a line was length without breadth.  That may perhaps be the ideal of a builder, but we want to put up good and substantial houses.  We have got to make a certain amount of allowance, and while you may have a floor space inside the walls of 1,600 square feet, a large deduction must necessarily be made for passages and partitions.  I think inasmuch as the Bill will not demand anything further from the Treasury than the grant fixed, a little latitude might be allowed in the case of a house built in a rural area, and I ask the President to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a word in support of Deputy Hogan's point.  After all, if the Bill is to apply to rural districts, the President, having gone so far, ought to try to make it as suitable and as applicable as possible to conditions in rural areas.  It is easy for the President to say that a man who can build a house 40 feet by 20 feet is able to pay for it.  If the President understood rural conditions, he would know well that a site in the country is not as valuable as a site in a town or city.  If a man proposes to build a house on his own farm a few feet one way or the other will not matter very much with regard to the amount of ground the building will cover.  Further, the house would be very largely built by the labour of the farmer and his own family, and the cost to him would not be as much as it would be in a town or city.  If the cost were to be half as big, the small farmer for whom we seek some extension of the benefit could not face it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President may think that our point of view is that it is men with 200 or 300 acres who might be able to build their own houses and who would come along and benefit under this Bill.  I <Col N="1686" /> can assure the President that in my county men with 15 acres of the very poorest land have built houses under the last Act and they would not have faced the proposition of building houses but for the grant under the Act.  The complaint of these men was that if they could build their houses a little bit bigger that the houses would be much more satisfactory from the farmers' point of view.  The work of the rural dweller differs very much from that of the man in the town or city.  His rooms would be utilised for different purposes. His kitchen, sitting-room and bedroom will be different.  All that ought to be taken into account, and I do not think it can be disregarded.  It is not to the benefit of the rural dweller.  A house of 1,600 square feet in the country would be as much in accord with the conditions in the country as a house of 1,200 square feet in the city or town. I think the President would be doing the fair and right thing in accepting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that when Deputy Connor Hogan spoke about houses of 40 feet by 20 he must not have been putting the case fairly from his own point of view, because it seems that a 40 by 20 house would be very big.  A 40 by 20 house would be a very irregular house.  If the President would consider a house now of 30 by 25, that would mean two rooms in the front with a passage of three feet, which is very small.  That would leave him 12 by 12 in front and the same behind and the same in depth.  There would be only four rooms on the floor and the same on the first floor.  Twelve by 12 with a passage of 3 feet would make up the floor space that Deputy Hogan is pleading for.  That would not be a big house.  When the Deputy talks of a house of 40 by 20 it gives a wrong impression.  Houses with rooms 12 feet by 12 are what would be required, and these rooms would not be too large at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <P>I think the Deputies on the Farmers' benches have made a very good case.  I think it is quite reasonable to say that the houses in the country ought to be as large, if possible, as the limit that has been stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1687" /> If the Deputies will refer to last year's Housing Act they will find: &ldquo;The aggregate amount of the grants to be made under this section shall not exceed the sum of £250,000 in respect of the erection of houses.&rdquo;  This Bill says &ldquo;the aggregate amount shall not exceed £300,000.&rdquo;  I want to say that if it is possible that the Bill is to do what the Minister hopes it will do, that is, to give a better chance to the urban dweller, I would like to see, if possible, that under this Bill the balance will be altered somewhat.  Under the Act of 1924 there were 464 houses built in urban areas and 2,423 houses in rural areas.  If you pass this amendment with a view to inducing the farmer to go as he did last year we shall have a multiplication of the 2,400 houses built in the country and less than 500 in the towns.  Give us a chance this time, or, rather, let us have the same opportunities for urban houses under this Bill as for the rural houses under last year's Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say to the President that the passing of this amendment does not mean anything extra from the Treasury. Deputy Johnson says there were over 2,000 houses built in the country and only 400 in the towns.  Why is that?  Housing shortage is as serious in the country perhaps as in the towns. A very large proportion of our people are living in insanitary dwellings, and seeing that they are taking advantage of these facilities and putting their labour into the thing&mdash;I stress the word &ldquo;labour&rdquo;&mdash;I put it to the President that they ought be met as far as possible.  A house of 1,600 square feet is not an unduly large house.  He need not put it up to 1,600 if he wishes. The words are &ldquo;not exceeding 1,600 square feet.&rdquo;  If he builds a house of 1,200 square feet, it is his own lookout, but at least an opportunity should be given to put up some good houses in the country which may perhaps serve a dual purpose.  The farmer has to carry on his business under his roof to some extent, and we feel it is necessary that he should get a little extra space to enable him to carry it on successfully. <Col N="1688" /> I will ask the President to accept this amendment, because it will not mean any cost to the Treasury.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a word in support of the amendment and in the interests of rural dwellers.  I think the main case made by the President against the acceptance of this amendment was that it would bring in a class of persons for whom this Bill was not intended.  I do not think that will be the case if this amendment is accepted.  What I think will happen is this, that it will encourage the small farmer to build a house.  That man would not undertake the building of the house at all if it were not for this subsidy, but he does undertake to build it because the subsidy is there.  What the President will do if he rejects this amendment is to make that man build a smaller house. The difference between the limit set in the Bill and the limit set in the amendment is not such that it would bring in a special class of people who would be able to build a house without the subsidy. As Deputy Baxter explained, we all know that conditions in the country are different from what they are in the towns.  The site, for instance, would not be so valuable in the country as it would in the town, and labour can be obtained on a different basis in the country from what it can be obtained in the towns.  The fact that a bigger house is being built will not, in the end, cost more to the individual in the country than the town house would cost to the individual in the town who is putting up a house within the limits set in the Bill.  The only thing that will be achieved by keeping the limit at what it is, is to force the individual, who would otherwise perhaps build a larger house, to have a smaller house, because in either case he would not build a house unless he got the subsidy.</P>

      <P>I think some of the Farmer-Deputies are labouring under a misconception with regard to this subject. Deputy Wilson was good enough to give us some figures with which I have been making some calculations.  I have figured out a house of five rooms, 15 by 11, which gives a total floor area of 825 square feet.  The Bill provides for 1,250 square feet, so that even with five rooms, 15 by 11, you have not exhausted all the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are going to exceed five rooms I think we will be carrying out very much what Deputy Johnson prophesied when we started on this Bill.  He then said he was afraid it was not a Bill that was going to make provision for those whom we were anxious to help in connection with houses.  I think the debate this afternoon, particularly in connection with this amendment, is bearing out that prophecy.  I notice that Deputy Johnson is assisting this amendment, and therefore is assisting to achieve the point of view that he set out with in connection with this Bill. I am quite with those who are anxious to build a good house, but I am not with those who are anxious to call upon the State to subsidise those who want to build good houses.  I think if the State is to be called on to give subsidies it should only subsidise those who are unable to help themselves, and, goodness knows, we have enough of these without increasing their number.  I would suggest to the Farmer-Deputies that if they want a house larger than one with a superficial area of 1,250 square feet they should not come to the Government and ask for subsidies to enable them to get a house of that description. <Col N="1690" /> I do not think that the amendment is one that ought to be supported.</P>

      <P>The outlook of the farming community on life is an excellent one if we are to judge the recent decisions at the elections.  They are sane, well-tempered, and stand for stabilisation, and so on.  Statements have been made that the adoption of this amendment would not cost the Treasury any more money, and that there are people who will not build if the section stands as it is.  If there are, then we are going to save money by not altering the section.  This is meant for an uneconomic class, and Deputies who are hard-headed, level-headed, and sensible business-men would not, I think, of themselves, if they were on these benches, seek to subsidise a class of the community who do not require it.  I think that will be admitted, and if that be admitted then there is no case for including such proportions as are suggested in this amendment.  Last year 1,000 square feet was the maximum. We have increased it this year by 250 square feet, making a total of 1,250 square feet.  That is a very <Col N="1691" /> marked increase&mdash;an increase of 25 per cent.  I thought, judging by the criticisms of the Government in the 1923 General Election and recently, that we would be attacked for our extravagance in increasing the size of these houses, but instead of that we are invited to be still more extravagant by the most economic party, I suppose, in this House.</P>

    <P>In connection with the houses to be erected under this Bill we put a minimum and we put a maximum as regards floor space.  In the reconstructed dwelling we put a minimum floor space, but here we have no maximum whatever, with the result that a man who reconstructs a house in Fitzwilliam Square and provides some flats letting at £300 a year can claim the subsidy.  Now, that is in direct opposition to what the President has just stated in reply to the last amendment, that the intention in this Bill was only to help those who were not in a position to help themselves. If we do not put in some limit with regard to the size of these self-contained flats the very reverse of the argument which has just been advanced will be applicable in the case of flats.  I do not know whether that is an omission or not, but I cannot understand if we put a minimum and a maximum into the Bill in the case of houses <Col N="1692" /> why it is we only put a minimum in the case of flats and no maximum at all.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 20: to delete Rule 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point of this rule, of course, is that it seeks to restrict the reconstruction of houses to urban districts and to towns having a population of 500 or those 880 yards outside a town.  I cannot understand by what means the President and the Ministry have arrived at the decision that it is right and just and feasible to reconstruct a house in a town of 500 inhabitants or within 880 yards of a town, and that it is not right to reconstruct a house in a <Col N="1693" /> town of 490 inhabitants.  Nor can I understand why it is not right to give a grant for the reconstruction of houses in rural districts.  I cannot see how that decision is arrived at.  The point whether it is just to promote the reconstruction of houses and to give grants for the reconstruction of houses in a town or city and prohibit the inhabitants of a rural district from receiving such grant is what we take exception to.  It is unfair discrimination that often makes itself apparent in legislation and administration against the rural inhabitants as compared with people in towns and cities.</P>
    <P>I know the President's point is that the conditions in regard to houses are nothing like so bad in the country as in the towns and the cities.  I agree with the President that the conditions are very bad in the cities and in some of our towns, but the conditions are just as bad in towns where there are only 300 inhabitants as in towns where there are 500 inhabitants, and if it is right to give a grant for reconstruction in towns of 500 inhabitants there is no argument against giving it to a town with only 300 inhabitants.  The conditions with regard to reconstruction in rural districts are the same as in the big towns or in the cities.  Many of the houses that farmers are living in on the hill-sides are just as bad as in Dublin.  I think Deputies on the Government Benches from rural districts will agree.  Some of them who have been in my constituency during the elections know the conditions of the small farmers there are as bad and deplorable as in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions are not comparable.  It is easy to say that this Bill is for the inhabitants of the slums.  We would all like to see the conditions better there, but we do not like to see our people discriminated against, and particularly when you come to the smaller towns and rural districts that are excluded from the operations of this section.  As I pointed out previously on another Bill, there are many people in the rural districts who are not, despite the advantage of the grant, prepared to tackle the proposition <Col N="1694" /> of building a new house.  It is too big a thing for them.  I have spoken to many of them who make that complaint. But these people would be prepared to reconstruct the houses they have, and I cannot see why these people who are contributors to the Exchequer should, because they live on the hill-sides, be denied the right accorded to the people of the towns and the cities. I do not think it is fair or just, and we on the Farmers' Benches cannot stand for that unfair discrimination against people in the rural districts.</P>
      <P>The President made the point on the Second Reading of this measure that the cost of administration had to be taken into account.  I say that the cost of administration with regard to the question of reconstruction can be borne as the cost of administration is borne in the matter of the grants for building new houses.  The fee of the inspectors that the Ministry send to see the sites and to see that the work is carried out to the satisfaction of the Ministry are paid by the men claiming the grants and whether the grants are given or not the fee has to be paid by the applicant for the grant.  I cannot see why the same rule should not operate in regard to the application for a grant for the reconstruction of houses, and the cost of administration in that way can be borne by the applicant just as it is in the case of the application for a grant for a new house.  I do not think that argument can hold water.  I think the President, in justice to the rural inhabitants, should concede to them what he is prepared to give to the people of the towns and the cities.  I cannot see why a man living in a town of 500 inhabitants can get the grant, and a man living in a town of 490 inhabitants cannot, and I should like to hear some arguments on that point.</P>

      <P>I wish to support my colleague.  I think I was the sponsor of the original amendment in the last Bill.  I have never been able to understand why the President has taken up such unbending opposition with regard to this matter.  I can assure him, with Deputy Baxter, that the necessity for housing in the country is very great.  I am not going to say that it is quite as great as in the towns, <Col N="1695" /> but we are giving our full support to construction and reconstruction in the towns and no other party is more anxious to see the slum population of the large cities provided with houses. We are not so sure that this and the previous Bill are going to do it, but we hope they will.  We think there is an unfair discrimination between the people in the country in so far as they are prevented from getting a grant for the reconstruction of their houses. Those people contribute more than their share of taxation, and they find that they are excluded from certain privileges which the people in the towns have.  From my knowledge of the country, there is a necessity for the reconstruction of houses.  Over and over again you will see farmers building on the old walls.  That does not happen very often in the towns. I received many applications asking me if there is any possibility that the Reconstruction Clause could apply. If it does, it will affect principally the small farmer with an old house which he wishes to improve.  He has not the funds to build a new house.  Very often he lives in a portion of the house while he is reconstructing the other part.  I would like to add my voice to the arguments of my colleague and ask the President to consider the amendment favourably.  I think he will have found out that since the passing of the last Bill there has been a demand for reconstruction.</P>

      <P>Then I will try to say now what I would have said on amendment 21, as owing to your ruling amendment 21 has got to die a natural death without judge and jury.  I do not agree with the section as it stands. To my mind, if the words &ldquo;rural districts&rdquo; were added, and the words after the figures 1854 were deleted, as in amendment 21, it would meet the <Col N="1696" /> case.  The President, when he was speaking earlier to-day on the necessity of considering those who built in 1920, stated that houses can be built in the country 20 to 40 per cent. cheaper than in the city.  If that is so, then it is essential that the people in the country should be encouraged by giving them an opportunity to reconstruct their homes.  According to last year's Bill, no person 880 yards outside a town of a population of 500 was eligible for the grant to reconstruct.  In the constituency which I have the honour to represent, there are at least 140 people anxious to improve their holdings if they get some little help from the Government.  The small farmer with 10 or 12 acres of land or less and the artisans and labourers in those rural districts are living at the present time under deplorable conditions as far as housing is concerned.  If they were encouraged by giving them the same facilities as are given to people in the towns, it would be a good thing.  When we are going canvassing and seeking votes we do not put any more value on votes in a town of a population of 500 than outside it.  We place as much value on the man in the country then as in the city.  If we do, why not recognise him now in the same spirit and say: &ldquo;We recognise you as a citizen when we want your vote, and we are now going to give you the same facilities as we give to the people in the large towns and urban districts.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Including the rural districts in the Bill will not increase the expenditure. I am not asking you to increase the £300,000 given by the Government, but more people would take advantage of it.  If the £300,000 given for the erection of houses is spread over a wider area, it will give better opportunities to people to house themselves than were given in the past year.  I cannot see why the President should deny to one section of the community what is given to another.  You are denying this to the workers, the small farmers, artisans and people who are not in a position to build because they are living in a rural district.  Why?  Because you imagine that those people must always continue to live in slavery and under deplorable conditions.  In your opinion they are only slaves.</P>

That is one of the things that I think has not been sufficiently stressed in the Dáil.  In country districts and in country towns the conditions of life are very drab and colourless. After working daily, week in, week out, at a dull and dreary occupation, the people have to go home to insanitary houses with little light and little ventilation.  There is very little reason in asking people to live in the country districts under such circumstances and in such surroundings.  If there is one thing that should recommend this amendment to the Government, it is the ease with which most of these houses lend themselves to reconstruction. Those who favour the amendment only want these houses made more convenient and more suitable for the necessities of the people. Speaking on this housing question last year, I stated that I heard no reasons advanced why the privileges extended to the towns should not be extended to the country districts.  If we want to make life in the country parts brighter and improve the mentality and the physique of the people, this is an opportunity that should not be overlooked.</P>

I think the return published in the Official Debates of the 26th March with regard to the grants given under the Housing Act of 1924 may be somewhat misleading.  As far as I can see, the return does not give any record of houses in towns or villages with populations under 500.  The numbers given include rural areas, but if the return is to be taken as accurate there should be a record of houses built in country districts, apart from small towns.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the amendment.  The class that appeals to me are small holders in rural districts. In my time I have heard frequent denunciations of British administration in this country owing to the way in which small holders have been treated.  We have had legislation to provide cottages and plots for labourers and also cottages for artisans. Farmers of a certain valuation could borrow money from the Board of Works to build houses.  What has been done for the small holders who, as Deputy Baxter stated, are living on the hillsides and in the bogs?</P>
      <P>I say that it is time that an Irish legislature should make provision and do something for that unfortunate class of people.  By extending the benefit of this Bill to the rural districts the Government would be doing the right thing.  I am not asking for charity but an act of justice.</P>

That has been done so far as one Act is concerned and I draw the conclusion from what the Deputy said that he suggested that reconstruction does not apply to the country.  So far as reconstruction is concerned, this clause would not be in the Bill were it not for the fact that there are barracks and workhouses which could be adapted for housing accommodation.  If during the coming year we have exhausted these barracks and workhouses in that connection, this reconstruction clause will not appear in any future Bill.  It was originally put in to endeavour to utilise some buildings, mainly in towns, cities and urban districts, which would be suitable for adaptation as dwellinghouses, flats or making some other use of them to provide dwelling accommodation.</P>

      <P>So far as the small farmer is concerned, he is included in the 2,462.  Taking the figures into account, they mean that the number amounts to 550 or 560 for the towns and cities and almost to 2,500 for the country districts.  Is that unjust to the farmers or the small farming community? <Col N="1701" /> This particular section dealing with reconstruction has been canvassed beyond what it is worth, and canvassed unfairly.  It was never intended to reconstruct dwellings for people who could afford to reconstruct them themselves.  Do Deputies consider how much it would cost to reconstruct these small dwellings?  Would it cost £100?  I doubt if it could be done for that, and is it fair to ask the State to pay half the sum for the reconstruction of these small houses?  I do not think it is.</P>

      <P>It is not necessary to get so excited over it.  If there have been 2,462 houses erected in accordance with the Act of 1924, they have been erected by people who wanted houses, and only for the introduction of that Act the majority of those houses would not have been built.  It is necessary, therefore, to apply reconstruction to country districts and to get as many houses reconstructed in 1925 as were built under the 1924 Act.  There are several people in country districts who cannot afford to pay £100&mdash;if it only costs £100&mdash;and the small farmer with five or six acres, who is very often worse off than the labourer, finds it impossible to maintain his children, especially if he has to pay Land Commission annuities at the rate of from £2 10s. to £3 per acre.</P>

      <P>Only this week I had to send to the Land Commission four or five most deplorably glaring and barefaced cases of robbery where from £3 to £3 5s. an acre was demanded, and I promise that if I do not get a satisfactory reply I will bring the question up in the Dáil.  These people are not able to pay £100 or £150 for reconstruction. I would give them the privilege, when they have carried out their reconstruction, of getting £20 or £30 as a grant. The President says that more money has been spent in the rural districts&mdash;<Col N="1702" /> £10,000,000 for labourers' cottages and other houses&mdash;than in the cities.  I quite agree that a lot of labourers' cottages have been built, but several of those who live in them are as badly off as it is possible for anyone to be. Nothing has been done for them either by the British or the Saorstát Government. I am sure that Deputy O'Connell will tell you that children cannot go to school in the daytime as they are really out all night, because you can see the sun, moon, and stars through the roofs of their houses, and when a shower of rain comes at night, the beds have to be moved, as the rain pours through the roofs.  It is that class that we are asking you to help&mdash;people who cannot afford to pay for the reconstruction of their homes.  I ask the President to reconsider the speech he has delivered, to try to be more patient, and, above all things, to facilitate the people who want these houses.</P>

      <P>I quite willingly withdraw if I have outstepped the bounds. I say that the President must be utterly ignorant of what is going on in the rural districts.  As regards the housing conditions, they are really a disgrace, and accommodation is much worse than even in the slums of Dublin.  In my own county, I am sorry to say, there <Col N="1703" /> are as bad houses as are to be found in any of the towns in the Saorstát.  I hold that it is no compliment at all to extend this Bill to the rural districts, where the people are paying their share of taxation just the same as the town dwellers.  The President has told us about the houses that have been built recently for the workers throughout the country, but I say that it is the country people who are responsible for these houses and not the Government, for they have to foot the Bill.  I think the President will be well advised to extend this reconstruction clause to the rural areas.</P>

      <P>I think the Bill will, in a short time, apply generally to the rural districts, because the Local Government Act recently passed provides that we are to have a whole-time medical officer who will look after the sanitation of the districts and the housing of the poor.  I agree with Deputy Lyons that a great many poor farmers are just as badly housed as the labourers.  It will be the duty of the whole-time medical officer to condemn houses that should be condemned.  I am sure that those who were responsible for the Local Government Act will act justly and provide funds to enable good houses to be substituted for the bad ones, and that will enable an improvement to be made in those houses that can be improved.  Under these circumstances I think it is not necessary that we should press in the present instance for the application of this to rural districts, especially if the Government will support in good faith the whole-time medical officer.</P>

      <P>In bringing forward this amendment we were doing what <Col N="1704" /> we considered fair to the rural community. In our opinion not a single house has been built in the rural area that was not built by a man who was already in possession of a house.  Every one of those 2,000 houses given in the schedule, as having been built in the rural areas, were built by men who owned houses, and more houses will be built under this Bill when it becomes law.  It is highly probable that very many houses will be built now where, in many cases, people would be satisfied to reconstruct, if possible, old houses if they got a grant for reconstruction.  That is denied to them, and the alternative is that they make application for a grant for the building of a new house and they get it.  In our opinion many houses in rural districts very badly need reconstruction.  If the Bill were amended to permit reconstruction of houses in rural districts there will not be that demand for new houses there otherwise would be.  It is easy to say that the conditions in the country are nothing like what they are in the city. They are as bad, and even worse, in the country.  Serious as the conditions in the slums in Dublin are, they are not so bad when compared with some of the houses in the country, the roofs of which are in such bad repair that they provide no protection against inclement weather, and let in the rain, as they did during the past year, which is one of the wettest we have had.  Bad as the housing conditions in Dublin are that cannot be said of them.  What is wanted with regard to reconstruction in the country is that something should be done to enable people to re-roof the houses.  That is very largely what I mean by reconstruction.  I cannot see why it is not possible for the President to reconsider his attitude on this matter. I do not think that the demand on the fund will be so much greater.</P>

      <P>I have listened with very much interest, and not a little concern, to the debate that has taken place.  I feel that in the circumstances in which the nation is placed the problem cannot be approached in the way in which it requires to  <Col N="1705" /> approached.  I am sure it is possible in the circumstances only to touch on the fringe of the question, but I can never see what is the necessity for the President standing firmly behind this door and keeping it closed against reconstruction, and the distribution of grants for that purpose.  Notwithstanding this, I am in the most complete sympathy with the case that has been put forward from all sides with regard to rural areas.  The position is bad in the cities undoubtedly, and very serious, but I feel that it is not really as bad as it is in many of the rural areas, particularly in the congested districts.  The conditions there are simply deplorable; the health of the people is suffering to an extraordinary extent, and many people are undoubtedly dying owing to the housing conditions in the rural areas.  A few days ago I had the pleasure of&mdash;I should say rather the misfortune of&mdash;having an interview in which the necessity for having something done to assist these people in having their houses made possible to live in, was put before me.  In the discussion on the subject I, of course, pointed out that the problem was such a big one that in the present circumstances it would be impossible to deal with it in the way it should be done, and that must be done.  I asked if they had any suggestion to make with regard to the way in which the problem might be met without involving the distribution of grants which are not available from the funds of the nation, and the suggestion was made, and I was asked to put it before the authorities, that provision should be made by which they would be enabled to cover their roofs over the thatch with corrugated iron, which is considerably resorted to in the Six Counties, and which was proved immensely successful, and has made a very superior roof, warm and comfortable, at the same time doing away with the necessity and extravagance of providing straw to keep these houses thatched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the things that I think is worthy of consideration.  It has been working already in other counties.  I have seen it myself, and I have heard a great many people boasting of its immense success and the very satisfactory <Col N="1706" /> roof that it gives.  Notwithstanding Deputy Baxter's hope, it is impossible, I think, that we can go to any further extent in this matter in view of the financial conditions prevailing.  You cannot go beyond a distance of 880 yards outside a centre of population of 500.  I think the whole pressure of the House will have to be brought to bear upon the Government to go even a step further in another direction, not in the way of providing grants, but in the way of giving the necessary facilities and the necessary easements by way of loans to those small holders, so that they will be enabled to put their houses into a living condition.  That is an absolute necessity.  It is much more of a necessity, to my mind, than the provision of new homes, excepting, of course, in the slum areas and in the backward parts of cities.  That is my suggestion on the matter, and I feel the President cannot do anything but stand behind this.  This problem is such a big one that, if carried out fully, it would consume the resources of the nation.  The course I have suggested, if adopted, will go a long way towards remedying existing evils.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the discussion on this point has been carried on under some misapprehension.  In regard to the reconstruction of houses, it seems to have been forgotten that there is already a definition as to what is a reconstructed house.  That definition differs from the definition in last year's Act.  Even though the amendment be carried, it would not allow a house to be re-roofed.  A reconstructed house, under the definition, means a house converted. The word &ldquo;reconstruction&rdquo; means the conversion of an existing building into one or more houses.  It does not include the repairing of the existing brokendown house and the making of it into a good house.  I suggest that most of the discussion is beside the point.  It is quite clear from the discussion on last year's Act, that the intentions were to make it possible for a large house to be so altered as to make it capable of being inhabited by more than one family.  While it did speak, in the definition clause last year, for safety sake, of repairing an existing house or building. I imagine the definition this year <Col N="1707" /> has been altered, and it quite strictly confines the meaning of the term &ldquo;reconstruction&rdquo; to converting an existing building into one or more houses. The advocacy of the amendment, with a view to making it possible for small farmers to re-build their existing houses, or repair them, is, as I said, beside the point, and would not be secured by the adoption of the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. CONLAN Mr. CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it must be admitted on every hand that the housing conditions of the small farming-class, and small holders generally, is woeful in the extreme.  Anybody who travels through the country must see that the houses of those people have been going to the bad, especially during the last few years.  That is due to one or two reasons.  In the case of old thatched dwellings there was great difficulty experienced in getting proper straw for repairing the roofs during the last two or three years on account of the very wet seasons.  Then there was the poverty of the people, and that has become more accentuated every day. Those people are placed in the position that they are forced to live in insanitary dwellings and at the same time they are repaying loans arising out of the expenditure of ten millions which the President has alluded to.  They have to contribute their portion of the amount that is annually raised in order to repay the loan.  As we all know, the provision of housing accommodation for the labouring classes has not been a success economically, inasmuch as the rents paid are not sufficient to repay the loan.  That being so, as I say, those people have the double grievance of living in wretched hovels and at the same time contributing to the repayment of the cost of building houses for another class.</P>

Deputy Baxter, in touching on the question of repairing roofs, did not assert that that was the only thing that should be done.  It may <Col N="1708" /> be possible in the case of small houses to extend them and so make proper provision for the accommodation of families.  I think it would be well if the President and the Government would hearken to what I may describe as the unanimous voice of the Dáil and extend the Bill in the direction indicated.</P>

      <P>I just want to gratify Deputy Baxter and to tell him that I have seen very bad houses in the constituency of Cavan, and that I have also seen very good houses in that constituency. I have seen very respectable houses there, and I was glad to see them. I hope those that I saw that were of a rather dilapidated nature will be improved on the next occasion that I visit Cavan on a mission similar to that <Col N="1711" /> on the occasion which he speaks of. One would think from the discussion here this evening that this Bill was introduced for the purpose of reconstructing houses generally.  I think we all agree that what is most wanted at the present time is to provide houses that people can live in.  In some of the country districts, even though the houses may be in a poor condition, the people have some accommodation, and there are very few of them that have not at least two apartments.  These apartments may not be all that is desired. In many cases they are not what I would desire.  I think they are not suitable for the people who have to live in them, but when we come to think of the way people are housed in towns and cities, when we come to find a family of five or six living in one room&mdash;I have known such cases in my own town&mdash; and paying perhaps from 7/- to 10/- per week for being housed under such conditions, I think that we should think twice before we proceed to spend the limited sum that is now at our disposal in reconstructing houses.  First of all we must provide every person housed under those conditions, and to whom we can afford to give a house, with a proper house to live in.  The Housing Act that was passed last year lent itself to a certain amount of reconstruction, but if we are to follow that up and to allow every person that comes along to get a grant out of this £300,000 that is made available at present for reconstruction, there will be very little available for the class of people to whom I refer.  I am convinced that what we should aim at is to find houses for those people who have no houses at present and those who are housed under conditions in which none of us would like to live&mdash; with a family of five or six in one room. Deputy Wilson referred to a room 12 by 11.  I have known cases where there are five and six people living in a room of that kind, and they were glad to get it.</P>

      <P>I think the President has not met us very fairly in regard to this.  I think the suggestion of a sum of £100 to reconstruct a <Col N="1712" /> five-roomed house in the country is ridiculous. I do not see why it would not cost as much to reconstruct a five-roomed house in the country as in the town, or very nearly as much.  There is one aspect of this that I can see. Even if the amendment is accepted it will not apply to a large number of people whose houses require to be reconstructed&mdash;that is, to the very poor small farmers who want to have the roof fixed so that the rain will not come in.  The same thing applies to these practically as applies to the grant for the building of houses.  It does not quite give houses to the people who really need them, but it will at least give houses to people who are a step or two higher up.  I think that there has been a most unfair discrimination in keeping this particular class of people from getting this grant.  The necessity for the improvement of rural conditions undoubtedly exists.  There are houses in the country which are little better than slums, and if the people could only get a certain amount of money to encourage them to improve these houses they would do so.  I think a very important point has been made by Deputy Baxter.  That is the fact that every house which was built under the last Act and for which a grant was given replaces another building.</P>
      <P>If the reconstruction clause is made to apply to the rural districts, instead of building new houses they will repair the old houses, and therefore will set a good deal of money free for the purpose of making a grant for the building of new houses in towns.  I think that is a point that should be stressed, and it is a very important one. I would ask the President to give the matter the very fullest consideration. Feeling in the country in favour of this is very strong.  People feel that they have not been fairly treated, that the interests of the Government are largely centred in the towns and urban districts, and that very little consideration is being given to the rural districts, except when it becomes a case of making election speeches.</P>

      <P>I wonder if Deputy Baxter would give his attention for a moment to the practical effect of the passing of his amendment. <Col N="1713" /> His amendment is to delete this rule. Let us suppose it is deleted, what then? There is no provision in the Bill nor in the schedule with regard to reconstructing houses, except the limitation in regard to the subsidy.  Consequently the Minister for Local Government, in making regulations under Section 11, could operate as he pleased.  I think that Deputy Baxter ought to weigh that well before he presses his amendment. Many of the speeches ostensibly in support of Deputy Baxter were really directed to the amendment that followed, proposed by Deputy Lyons, to introduce &ldquo;rural&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;urban,&rdquo; so as to make the grant for reconstruction of houses applicable over a wider area.  Deputy Baxter and Deputy Conlan seem to be under the impression, unless I greatly mistake, that if they succeed in passing this amendment they have secured for the whole countryside subsidies in aid of reconstruction.  They have not, unless the Minister for Local Government so decides by regulation.  Consequently they will really leave the matter at the discretion of the Minister, and no more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel in complete sympathy with the speeches they have made, except for this restriction, but the speeches were made on behalf of something quite other than the purpose of the present Bill.  There is no question whatever that the general health of the country would be almost immeasurably improved by the attainment of this ideal of Deputy Baxter's of better housing.  Unquestionably many of the houses in which even the better-off farmers are doomed to live are really unhygienic.  That is, as the President and as Deputy McGold-rick have already pointed out, part of a very big national problem which really would require millions of money to deal with adequately.  It cannot be dealt with, except in a very piecemeal fashion, through the operation of annual Bills for housing facilities.  Sooner or later the position will have to be taken up which, you might pardon my egotism in repeating, I outlined to this House on a former occasion, namely, to authorise, as, apart altogether from national loans for the purpose of running the country, a Premium Bond loan for the purpose of housing and reconstruction <Col N="1714" /> of houses.  That is one of the great things before this country, and it will have to be taken in hand&mdash;the removal of all the conditions that militate against health, more especially the health of the children.  A great deal has been done in the Local Government Act; it is an excellent beginning, but, with all respect to Deputies of the Farmers' Party who spoke on behalf of this amendment, I would suggest to them that while they have done a very great service in bringing this matter under notice, the proper thing for them to do is to agitate in favour of a great big scheme by which the whole housing problem would be tackled manfully, and tackled as it ought to be, but that they should not spoil an excellent Bill for the facilitation of house-building in a minor way within the competence of our Treasury at this particular moment by seeking to include in the Housing Facilities Bill something which is on an immeasurably bigger scale.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear, as Deputy Johnson has pointed out, and I had already pointed it out to my colleague here before he made his speech, that the Definition Clause of the present Bill was deliberately and consciously changed from the Definition Clause of the Act of last year, with special reference to the existing facts, namely, that what is desired is, in the interest of providing more houses, to try to utilise existing buildings of the type that the President mentioned and which are no longer required, such as unused barracks&mdash;not facilities for repairs of buildings, though I quite agree that a Bill to that effect, if the money were forthcoming or could be raised, would be a very desirable measure.  At the risk of repeating myself, I say, again, that sooner or later, if not the present Dáil, some Dáil not very far away from now in point of time, will be obliged to consider this question of raising millions, because it is a matter of millions; it could not be done if you triplicated or quadrupled the funds that are in contemplation in the present Bill.</P>

      <P>The same discussion will not take place on this amendment as took place on the last one, and at any rate I do not intend to say much on it.  I intend to direct my remarks chiefly to the military barracks.  I think the last amendment should not have been taken before this one, and if I had known the course which the discussion was going to take on that amendment, I would have asked the permission of the House to allow Deputy Baxter to move his amendment after mine.  I want to know what the intentions of the Government are with regard to workhouse buildings and military barracks which, in some cases, are unoccupied in a great many towns. Is it the intention of the Government to allow these buildings to remain there until they fall of their own accord?  The barracks in the town of Athlone could provide accommodation for over 35 families, and the barracks in Mullingar, which is four or five hundred yards away from the barrack square, could provide accommodation for about 36 families.  Several communications have been sent by the people of Mullingar with regard to this barracks, while questions have also been asked in the House about it.  The Government, however, have shown no sign of taking it over in order to relieve the housing conditions in the town of Mullingar.  In last year's Act, a section was inserted making provision for the reconstruction of such buildings. I am sorry that the Government did not show the example themselves by reconstructing some of these military barracks and making them available for the accommodation of families.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would go up to Kehoe Barracks in Inchicore, he would see that considerable work has been done there in that connection, and I understand that work is about to commence shortly in Tipperary on an old barracks there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand about the work that has been done in Kehoe Barracks.  What I am anxious to know is, when the Government propose to hand over to the people the disused portions of the barracks in Mullingar, <Col N="1718" /> Longford, and Athlone?  These barracks, if suitably reconstructed, would afford accommodation for 140 families in the three towns I have mentioned.  I was not at all convinced by the speech of the President on the last amendment, and I hold that if this Bill is to achieve the object aimed at, this section in it should apply to rural districts as well as to urban districts.  When the Bill becomes an Act, there is nothing to prevent the Minister putting into operation his suggestion that the county councils should provide two-thirds of the grant. I would welcome that.  On the last occasion that I spoke on the Housing Bill, I said, in reference to the section which provides that public bodies may give a grant equivalent to the amount given by the Minister, that the section should be altered to read by deleting the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substituting for it the word &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  If that were done we would be sure of getting houses built and reconstructed in the country districts. I would welcome the President's suggestion, and, indeed, would support it, that, county, urban, and district councils should provide two-thirds of the grants.  I think, too, that 40 per cent. of the members of these councils would agree with me in that.  Public representatives all over the country are crying out for improved housing conditions for the people, and I am sure that they would not object to the striking of a special rate of 1½d. or 2d. in the pound to enable the people to be housed better than they are at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to Farmer-Deputies that this is an amendment which they should support.  If it is adopted, it will produce wonderful results by providing improved housing conditions for the people in the rural districts.  Many of them, unfortunately, are obliged to live in hovels at the present time, but if this amendment is adopted they will be enabled to get suitable dwellings.  There are some Deputies in the House who belong to the medical profession.  If they were to go down through the country and witness the conditions under which so many people live, I am sure they would come back fully convinced of the necessity of supporting an amendment of this kind.  I recognise, of course, that the housing conditions in small and large towns are very bad <Col N="1719" /> indeed.  This housing problem is a burning question in the towns.  I agree, too, that county councils and urban councils cannot always be looking to the Government for help.  There is no use in crying out and saying that the Government will not do such and such a thing.  These bodies must give some help themselves, but at the same time, of course, it is the duty of the Government to realise the true position as regards housing in the rural districts, and to do their part in helping to relieve it. I hope the President will see his way to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;A house shall in respect of its site, aspect, planning, construction, sanitation and number per acre comply with the prescribed conditions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The words of this amendment are taken from last year's Act and are intended to ensure that the Minister shall prescribe conditions as to the site, aspect, planning, construction, sanitation, and the number per acre.  Without such conditions it may be possible to build a house higgildy-piggildy of any style and in any circumstances.  I do not think that that is intended, but it is not provided against in the Bill.

It is not proposed to make it a condition that they should conform exactly to those plans.  Under last year's Act there was a good deal of confusion raised on this account, and while, of course, there would be regulations regarding certain fundamentals in connection with the planning of the houses, it is thought that to include this particular amendment would add to <Col N="1721" /> the confusion and, possibly, delay construction.</P>

That would appear to me to make it clear that any house to be built the plans will be submitted, and unless they are suitable they would not be approved, and that the plans must be submitted, if you are not going to allow any sort of a house to be built and to receive the subsidy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between Section 2 of the 1924 Act and Section 2 of the present Bill.  In the present Bill there is this variation: Sub-section (1) of Section 11 of the Act of 1924 says, &ldquo;The Minister may by order prescribe all such rules, conditions, plans and other matters as are in this Act referred to as being or to be prescribed.&rdquo; Then in Section 3, sub-section (1) of that Act, paragraph (b), you have the following conditions:&mdash;&ldquo;The house shall in respect of the size and number of rooms and other necessary appurtenances, be in general accordance with prescribed plans or with such other plans as may be approved of by the Minister.&rdquo;  Obviously all the conditions set out in Section 3, particularly that one, are intended to conform to the requirements of Section 2, so that nothing should be overlooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in the present Bill where all reference to plans is omitted, it leaves it open to the Minister to make prescribed regulations and conditions which would be set out in some such publication as &ldquo;The New Housing Order, 1925,&rdquo; and <Col N="1722" /> which would run: &ldquo;enables the Minister to accept general description rather than determinate plans that would be reduced to diametrical representation.&rdquo; I went to the Government publishers, Messrs.  Easons, to buy these plans.  I found that for different types of houses, such as two or three-roomed houses, there were different sets of plans drawn out in detail by the architect, and, undoubtedly, anyone looking at these thoroughly individual plans, and reading the regulations here, would be under the impression that it was rather a dangerous course to adopt to depart from these in any important particular.  Whereas if, instead of having set plans and drawings, you had a New Housing Order, 1925, that would merely indicate a minimum floor area, and so on, and stipulate the necessary appurtenances in houses with a specific number of rooms, then the freedom of the architect in the construction of the plans would be secured, and I should say that a great deal of unnecessary correspondence would be obviated likewise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the President see that that would leave more difficulty than ever in the way of building, because if there is a doubt whether the plans on which the house are to be built are going ultimately to get the approval of the Minister, there will be hesitation on the part of the prospective builder.  If he knew he was building according to plans already approved, the only question that would arise is whether he was building properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he has to start building with a <Col N="1723" /> doubt as to whether, even having started, he is going to get the sanction of the Minister, surely that is going to delay the building more than the proposition of getting the plans passed first.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1724" /> In the case of the reconstruction of an existing building, that building shall be certified by an appointed officer to be capable of reconstruction as a house fulfilling the requirements of this Act, and such certificate shall be given before the reconstruction is begun.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to make a case for this.  I think we already heard a fairly good case made out for it on the discussion of a previous amendment. Deputy Baxter and others led the House to believe that the person who merely pulled down the thatch of a house and replaced it by a slate roof would be entitled to a reconstruction grant.  That belief is prevalent throughout the country.  It would save the Housing Department a great deal of correspondence if this amendment were accepted, and if, before people were allowed to become qualified for a grant, they got a certificate to say that the building was capable of reconstruction, and what particular course of reconstruction should be engaged on.</P>

    <P>NOTE:&mdash;Where the erection or reconstruction is not completed within eighteen months from the passing of this Act, and the time for such completion is extended, the grant shall, unless the Minister otherwise directs, be reduced by one-tenth for every month between the expiration of the said eighteen months and the date of actual completion of the erection or reconstruction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Part I. to delete columns 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and substitute the following: &ldquo;For each house erected and completed in accordance with the provisions of this Act a grant of £75 will be made by the Minister.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For each reconstructed dwelling carried out in accordance with the provisions of this Act a grant of £50 will be made by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>While I agree that this schedule is a considerable improvement on the schedule of the 1924 Act I have two objections to it.  The first objection is that it refuses a grant to private individuals. The 1924 Act, as the President pointed out, was one of the most successful Acts introduced in connection with housing, and the reason for that success, to my mind, was that it encouraged private enterprise.  Instead of continuing in this Bill the successful feature of the 1924 Act, private enterprise is handicapped.  Local authorities and utility societies are given advantages which are refused to private enterprise.  Let me remind the House of what private enterprise has done for housing in Great Britain in the last 12 months.  In a return recently issued by the Housing Authority there, I find that during the 12 months ended 30th September, 1924, 110,000 houses had been completed under the Housing Act. Of those, 95,362, or 86 per cent. had been carried out by private enterprise and 14,500, or 14 per cent., by local authorities.  Of the houses in course of construction on the 1st October last 1924, there were 92,000.  Of these 71,000 were being carried out by private enterprise and 21,000 by local authorities, so that the success, pointed out by the Minister on the other side, that has followed their efforts has been largely brought about by encouraging private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister brought in a Bill last year he encouraged private enterprise, and, as has been pointed out, his efforts were successful.  What I object <Col N="1727" /> to in this Bill is that, on the face of it, it handicaps those who were the means of making the Act of 1924 a success, and acts in an exactly opposite direction to what was found so successful by the housing authorities in Great Britain. I think that is a great mistake. For that reason I propose to amend the schedule.</P>
    <P>The second objection I have to this schedule is that it encourages the building of five-roomed houses.  As the President will remember, I took exception to that particular feature in last year's Act.  What has been the result of last year's Act?  Two thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine houses were erected.  Of these 2,008, or 66 per cent. were five-roomed houses.  Only 25 per cent. of the houses erected under that Act were four-roomed houses, and only 4 per cent. three-roomed houses. The whole tendency of that Act was to encourage the building of five-roomed houses.</P>
    <P>When the President was speaking on this subject the other day, I noticed that he again spoke in eulogistic terms of the work that had been done for housing by the Artisans Dwellings Company.  I think we all recognise that they have done really excellent work on behalf of housing in the city. I have before me figures in connection with the houses, as well as accommodation, in their different schemes.  In all they have erected in the city 3,580 houses or dwellings.  Of these 207 were single-room dwellings, 683 two-roomed dwellings, 1,471 three-roomed dwellings, 108 four-roomed dwellings, 101 five-roomed dwellings and 37 shops. Compare those figures with the figures that resulted from the 1924 Act. Under the 1924 Act we have 66 per cent. of five-roomed houses, while the Artisans Dwellings Company have only 2.82 per cent., so that their policy and ours do not concur.  With regard to three-roomed houses, that I was hopeful would be encouraged under these Acts, they have 41.08 three-roomed houses.  Nearly half their scheme is composed of three-roomed houses.  As a result of the 1924 Act we have got 4 per cent. of three-roomed houses. They have 30 per cent. four-roomed houses, and under the 1924 Act we <Col N="1728" /> have 25 per cent.  I find as a result of conversations with the Artisans Dwellings Company that the three-roomed houses are the most popular houses. That is confirmed by several local authorities that have considerable experience of housing problems in the city and suburbs.</P>
    <P>The reason I object to the five-roomed houses is, first of all, because of the burden of high rents on those who are anxious to occupy a modern house. The rents are more than wage-earners can afford to pay.  These people endeavour to get these houses and make sacrifices from their weekly incomes to meet the high expenses involved.  That has a two-fold objection.  It tends to increase&mdash;and this problem is becoming a very serious one in the Free State&mdash; the cost of living.  The policy of the Government should be in the opposite direction.  The cost of living is becoming a very serious burden and is already considerably in advance of what it is in Nothern Ireland or in Great Britain.  From that point of view alone this matter ought to have the serious consideration of the Government. When we build only that type of house, and this Bill only encourages that kind of house, the result is that people who are anxious to get housing accommodation apply for these houses and try to pay the rent.  They find after they have been a short time in occupation that the burden is greater than they can afford to carry.  They are faced with two alternatives, either to give up the house or adopt sub-letting. The sub-letting is being aggravated to an appalling extent by building larger houses than the people can afford to pay for.  The tenants are forced to sub-let.  They enter into agreements when going into the houses that they will not sub-let, but the rent they are called upon to pay forces them to do so.  As a result we introduce into these new dwellings all the objectionable features associated with tenements. In fact, sub-letting is becoming so bad in connection with new dwellings that cases are constantly coming before local authorities and others where families who took houses live in one room and have all the other rooms sub-let.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1729" /> Particulars were given me only a short time ago of a case, and it is not at all an uncommon one, where in one of these small houses there were five families, amongst whom there were 27 children.  That is a state of affairs almost worse than is found under the tenement system.  The policy being adopted by the State of encouraging the building of large houses is bringing about that state of affairs in connection with such dwellings.  I urge on the Minister that that policy is not sound financially, and is not wise from the point of view of the State. Amongst other objectionable features it is demoralising.  If we cannot see our way to encourage the building of three-roomed houses rather than five-roomed houses, at all events, let us see that the building of three-roomed houses is not placed at any disadvantage.  I have stressed the advantage of the three-roomed house on many occasions here. It is a house which is set at twenty-five per cent. less rent than a five-roomed house, and if we encourage that particular feature it will enable us to lower the cost of living.  It would do away with the mischievous system of sub-letting and would enable us to get far more houses for the same outlay.  These are features that ought to commend themselves to the House.  My amendment would meet those point in this way&mdash;we give, under the amendment, £75 to any house erected under this particular Act, and that would mean that whether it was a three, four or five-roomed house it would get the same amount.  The effect of that would be that while the three-roomed house is possibly not as cheap a structure to erect, from the point of view of cubic capacity, as a five-roomed house, it would give a certain monetary advantage and, therefore, I would urge that the schedule should be amended to stand in that particular way.  That is exactly the form in which it stands in the British Act to-day.  They do not give any preference.  They give one amount for an erected dwelling, and they do not give preference to a five-roomed over a four-roomed house or to a four-roomed one over a three-roomed one. With regard to flats, exactly the same principle would apply: a grant of £50 <Col N="1730" /> would be given to any reconstructed dwelling approved by the Ministry.  If that amendment were adopted it would get rid of a number of difficulties that arise in connection with floor space and so forth, because we have cases of floor space in connection with dwellings that create awkward features.  I think if the schedule were amended in the form I have suggested, we would find it very much more workable and practicable, and it would have the effect of encouraging the class of dwelling which many of us would like to see encouraged, and that is a larger number of small dwellings rather than a small number of large dwellings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see my way to accept this amendment.  I quite agree that abuses may creep in in connection with four and five-roomed houses.  My own view is that the same abuses would creep in in regard to three-roomed houses, and that it all comes back to the one question of the necessity for a larger number of houses than we have at the moment.  The Artisans Dwellings Company, the figures for whose particular class of dwellings Deputy Good has quoted, ceased operations, I think, possibly ten, twelve, or fifteen years ago.  Up to that time they were about twenty or twenty-five years in advance of their time, and the four-roomed house was regarded generally as a luxury.  Up to about ten years ago, I think, the Dublin Corporation had not more than about thirty or forty four-roomed houses, if they had that number.  In 1918 they put up their first scheme of two hundred four-roomed houses, and now they have gone in for five-roomed houses.  I knew cases in which the sanitary officer of the Corporation found that there were more people in a three-roomed house than were permitted in accordance with the cubic capacity of the room, and the position in which the Housing Committee were fixed was that these people should be prosecuted for having a number larger than that stipulated for the house. There must be reason for all this.  Sub-letting has its disadvantages to the person who is the first tenant, and to the second and third tenant, and unless there is a market for it, it is unlikely <Col N="1731" /> that the evil would creep in.  There is, however, a ready market for it, and I think that the only alternative is the provision of more houses.  There are people in Dublin who have been interested in housing for many years who condemn three-roomed houses as being insufficient for decent living and who claim that the parents should have one room, the boys another, and the girls another, if there happened to be boys and girls in the family.  There is a good case for that.  They claim that there should be one room set apart for cooking, so that people should not sleep and eat in the same room.  For a household run on decent Christian lines, four rooms are needed, and the case is made for another room as a meeting place. That is why we have hit on the five-roomed house; first by reason of its popularity, and secondly from the point of view of hygiene.  In addition, nearly all the housing reformers have favoured the five-roomed house as the only proper solution.  I would prefer to see a larger number of four-roomed houses, but I think that unless where there is only one sex in the family, so that they could occupy bedrooms separately, it would be inadvisable to have three-roomed houses.  As regards a two-roomed house, except for elderly people or those who have no children, it would be quite inadequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the principle that the President goes on is, we ought to aim at the ideal, whether the individual can afford to pay for it or not. If you were to apply that principle to ordinary life, how many of us would be in &ldquo;queer street&rdquo;?  We all have to live in houses we can afford to pay for, and not the houses, not the castles that possibly some of us have in our minds, and that some of us would look on as the ideal to achieve.  We cannot afford it, but the President tells us that is the house we should build for <Col N="1732" /> these people, and that having no other places to go into they will have to occupy them.  That, to my mind, is not sound.  It is creating a state of affairs that is very unfortunate.  This sub-letting is going further than I have mentioned.  We have cases cropping up where people are now beginning to live out of their houses.  I have a case in mind where a working man got one of these houses, and he has sub-let it, and is getting £1 per week profit by the sub-letting.  In addition to the dole, that enables him to live the life of a gentleman.  That is not a state of affairs we ought to encourage.  As the President knows, in all these houses set by a local authority there is a definite clause in the agreement whereby a tenant taking a house undertakes that he will not sub-let.  Now we are forcing that particular tenant through the economic factor to break that agreement, and when he breaks it we simply look on and do nothing.  That, as I say, is a system that we should not encourage, and if we find that the economic situation is such that these people cannot afford more than a rent of such-and-such an amount, we ought to see what is the best accommodation we can get for that rent, and meet it in that way rather than by putting up an ideal and forcing them into a situation we ought not to force them into. That is the effect of the Bill, and I hold it is wholly wrong.  For that reason I would like if the President would see his way to reconsider the problem, and give encouragement to four-roomed rather than five-roomed houses.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Good's case has, perhaps, a deeper significance and force than I would normally have thought, because of the difficulty of housing.  This problem of sub-letting is undoubtedly a very grievous one, and the instances he has adduced show that it is going to take place even in the three-roomed houses. To substitute a three-roomed house for a five-roomed house in the case of a man and family who are living by sub-letting is not removing the evil.  While it may be quite true to say that you <Col N="1733" /> would somewhat reduce the evil of sub-letting, I do not think you would to any wide degree remove the evil, but I think you would be creating another and perhaps even greater one than the one you are trying to overcome.  Let us say that the present problem of so much overcrowding will be overcome in 10 or 15 years, but if you start the fashion amongst the working classes with a three-roomed house as the house suitable for them, and you build a house for them that is going to last 60 or 70 years, then even after the period of pressure and overcrowding you have still fixed in the minds of the working man and his wife and children that the three-roomed house is satisfactory.  I think we ought not to do that.  I think we ought to bear in mind that the house you are building now is going to help to create the mentality of the next generation, and the three-roomed house mentality in the city is not one we ought to fix.  For that reason alone I am not inclined to support the amendment.</P>

      <P>While I disagree altogether with the amendment proposed by Deputy Good, I agree with a great deal of the speech he made in recommending it, but I think he ought to have the courage of his convictions. Not once or twice on earlier occasions he has denounced the building of the five-roomed house, and has advocated strongly the three-roomed house as the proper type, yet here he advocates a flat rate in aid of three-roomed, four-roomed, and five-roomed houses, and upwards, indifferently.  If he proposed to give a less subsidy for a house in excess of five rooms than for a house with five rooms, and less for a house with five rooms than a four-roomed house, so as to provide most for the three-roomed house, one could understand his position better.  One effect of the amendment is, that in the re-construction of a building&mdash;the amendment says &ldquo;reconstructed dwelling,&rdquo; but it becomes a dwelling only after reconstruction, for reconstruction is to make the building suitable for that purpose, but that is a mere trifle&mdash;he provides for the reconstruction of a building into a self-contained flat an allowance of £50 precisely as for the conversion of <Col N="1734" /> a building into a three-roomed, four-roomed, or five-roomed house.  I do not think that is quite defensible.  Is it not somewhat fanciful to say that the superior premium put upon a five-roomed house will have the effect of increasing the cost of living?  Let us contrast the subsidy that is provided for the five-roomed as against the four-roomed house.  The difference is only £15 as regards the Government grant, and even if the local authority give as much again the difference at the most will be merely £30.  The Deputy goes on to speak as if this allowance in aid to the amount of £30 was going to force the policy of building five-roomed rather than four-roomed houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, according to statistics.  The fact was that 66 per cent. of the new houses constructed were houses of five rooms, but something to explain that is provided by the very interesting statistics brought forward by Deputy Good as regards the operation of the Artisans Dwellings Company.  That association provided the greater number of houses of three rooms.  The very fact that those engaged in enterprise of this sort preferred to provide five-roomed houses, shows that unless they were working wholly without regard to actual facts and actual conditions, they were providing for a want which they had ascertained to be the want.  I think, therefore, the Deputy Good, in pressing this fact of the superior number of five-roomed houses built as subsidy houses, is rather arguing against himself, because he drives us to this dilemma, that those who built houses either disregarded the realities of the situation, or they were guided in what they did by their knowledge of what was required.  I would prefer to adopt the second alternative and to believe that those who built knew what they were about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President made, not this evening, but on former occasions, a most conclusive case against establishing the three-roomed house as the type that the State, by its aid, is to approve as the proper type of working-class houses. In the regulations which were sent out by the Local Government Ministry, to <Col N="1735" /> which I have already referred twice, the Housing (New Houses) Order, 1924, specifications are provided as regards floor space for the different kinds of rooms that are to be included in those houses, according as they vary and according to the number of rooms. In the three-roomed house, Class A, there was to be a living-room of 175 square feet, a first bedroom of 160 square feet, and a second bedroom of 120 square feet.  In the four-roomed house&mdash;it is very interesting in its constitution&mdash;there is a living room of 160 square feet, the first bedroom 145 square feet, the second bedroom 90 square feet and the third bedroom 75 square feet.  Anyone who takes into consideration an average family, will realise that the minimum is really in this four-roomed house.</P>
    <P>There is a technical term used here which I will take an opportunity of commenting upon as needing a little clearing up.  The word &ldquo;living-room,&rdquo; as applied in these specifications, evidently has in view a room of the sort that is found in non-parlour houses, as they are spoken of in other countries. That is to say, it is a room in which the meals are cooked and are also consumed. At one end of it is the cooking apparatus and somewhere in the rest of its floor space is the table at which the meals are taken.  But that is not what is understood uniformly by a living-room.  I have given very careful study in the last ten or twelve years to architects' plans of various kinds of houses of the modern sort.  In at least 60 per cent. of cases a living-room is meant to indicate the general room in which the family meet.  It is not a parlour in the technical sense of a parlour which is provided for in the five-roomed house, and which is meant to be a reception room in which non-members of the family are received and entertained.  The equivalent of a parlour for the family itself may come under the designation &ldquo;living-room.&rdquo; Now, it seems to me that the three-roomed house, of which one room is a living-room, providing, therefore, only for two bedrooms, ought to be discouraged rather than approved, and that the building of it should not be facilitated. <Col N="1736" /> It is a good enough house for the new beginner, before the children arrive.  After that there is congestion and then the family are put in the awkward position of trying to find a house with larger accommodation.  They very frequently are subjected to the painful necessity of leaving what was a nice little home in its own way and having to go into a tenement house, where they are under much more unfavourable conditions, but where they have something of the space requisite for a growing family.  When one takes into account not merely hygiene, but the decencies and amenities of life, the minimum accommodation should be a four-roomed house and, as far as possible, a five-roomed house.</P>
    <P>There is a slight departure in policy in this schedule which Deputy Good's amendment takes no cognisance of, and that is whereas in last year's Act the subsidy was given to a five-roomed house, and to nothing beyond that in the way of accommodation, in the present Act the subsidy is £75 for a house of not less than five rooms.  So long as the area prescribed is not exceeded, the ingenuity of the architect may be exercised to provide the requisite space for the important rooms, and then find space for additional rooms besides.  Anyone who has ever done what Deputy Good spoke of this evening&mdash;amused himself or occupied himself with planning houses&mdash;will have realised what an important difference there is as between an exceedingly good plan and a mediocre plan in dealing with the same limitations of space. The architect's genius can make a great deal more out of a given area than the ordinary practitioner, who is merely only a builder operating as an amateur architect.  It is worth while to become one's architect, on paper only of course, and not in actual fact, for the sake of realising the value that lies in employing a real architect when it comes to business.</P>
    <P>In so far as Deputy Good advocates private enterprise as against the subsidies to corporate bodies and utility societies, I am absolutely with him.  I thought at one time the President also had favoured that policy, but he seems to have been converted, or perverted, <Col N="1737" /> I think.  I think &ldquo;pervert&rdquo; would be a more correct term for, in the present Act, £75 is allowed for the five-roomed house erected by any person, whereas if it is erected by a public utility society the subsidy is increased to £100. Deputy Johnson and I have already taken the liberty of drawing the President's attention to how that difference can be worked upon, so that instead of A. B. providing his own fund to build his own house, he will get a number of his friends to combine into a utility society to build houses to a given number which, when the distribution stage is reached, means really a house for each of them.  Instead of the subsidy being £75, as it would have been had they operated separately, it becomes £100 for each because they operated conjointly.  I do not think the ingenuity of the President will extricate him out of that.  There is really no good reason for eviscerating the second schedule in the very drastic way that Deputy Good has done, because, on the grounds that I have suggested, of good policy, of promoting proper standards of living, indeed, of educating the public on the requirements of decent life, it is most advisable to give the higher subsidy for providing better houses.  Furthermore, his amendment, as I have said, excludes this excellent improvement on last year's Act by which houses are not restricted, for the purposes of the subsidy, to a maximum of five rooms.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest to the President&mdash;I do not want to take up any more time discussing this matter&mdash; that possibly he might undertake to consider on Report whether he could not see his way to bring in some amendment to the schedule whereby encouragement would be given for the building of four-roomed houses.  That would meet us.  Perhaps he would also consider the second point and see if he could remove the handicap from private enterprise.  If he considers those two points, I am quite satisfied to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment is obvioulsy consequential on two amendments moved to-day by Deputy Duggan. Since these amendments were inserted some doubt has arisen in my mind as to its effect and really as to its intention.  It seems to me that under the revised scheme it may be intended &mdash;it certainly is possible&mdash;for persons to build new houses for the purpose of letting them in flats.  Whether that is the intention or not I am not sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It only relates to reconstruction.  It may be observed that there are two vacancies in the portions of the schedule which refer to new buildings, and it is only in respect of reconstruction that the sums are inserted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in regard to the theory that I want to say a word or two, and to find out if it is intended or desirable that we should pay the same subsidy for the purpose of encouraging the building of large houses which will be turned into flats.  For instance, I can see three flats being made out of one house, a new house, each flat containing three rooms, being a house under the Bill.  If that house is erected by a public utility society it will receive £180 as a subsidy from the State and presumably an equal subsidy from the local authority and freedom from rates or, at least, a remission in regard to rates for 20 years.  I think that will allow a very considerable amount to be spent in the building of a house and yet allow of a fairly good profit to be made out of it.  If it were a larger house even than would allow three flats, three groups of flats with three rooms each, or three flats of four rooms each, I can conceive of a sum of £480 being paid to the builder of that group of houses, termed flats, and a still larger inducement being held out to the builders from the obvious result that these flats will be occupied by people who can afford to pay considerable sums in rents.  We look at advertisements in the papers and see these flats being let at £100 a year or round about that.  Specially constructed four-roomed flats of that kind in a big house might well bring a big revenue if you can get £480 out of the State and municipal authorities towards the building.  I do not know whether that is contemplated or intended but if it is, it will require some consideration.</P>
      <P>In respect of the particular amendment before us it is obviously consequential, and that being so, it may be thought that it is a little late at this stage of the Bill to discuss the question I have now raised.  Possibly if the Minister can give us some assurance on the point it will not be necessary to raise it again on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>No such application involving a sum, such as was mentioned by Deputy Johnson, has been made.  As a matter of fact, the reconstruction clauses of the Act of 1924 were a failure, an absolute failure, if it were not for the case of the Kehoe Barracks.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister missed my point.  I am suggesting that it was largely an inducement for people to build new houses in the form of flats, and to have three or four flats in one building which would be tantamount to three or four houses in one building. Under these amendments it seems to me that that policy is possible, and I doubt whether it is not contemplated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The same argument more or less applies to this amendment as applied to the amendment of Deputy Good.  I want to try, if possible, to give persons who wish to erect houses the same opportunity, or at least very nearly the same, as is given to local authorities. Under the Bill a local authority gets a grant of £60, £80 or £100, while a person building for himself only gets a grant of £45, £60 and £75.  I would like to remind the President that under previous Acts local authorities had to increase their rates by something like 1/- or ? in the £.  A lot of the money is still outstanding, and they are not in a position at the present moment to increase <Col N="1741" /> the rate by another 1/- or beyond 1/- in the £, for the purpose of erecting houses.  I think that they will not take advantage of this Bill.  The local authorities are few and far between who will erect any houses.  By giving the increases I ask for and bringing the grants up to £50, £70 and £90, the same as they were in last year's Act, you will be encouraging people to erect houses for themselves; and that will not be an incumbrance on the ratepayers.  If any local authorities were to erect twelve or fourteen houses they would have to raise a loan of at least from £5,000 to £7,000.  That money placed on an urban district would mean that the ratepayers there would have to pay 6d., 8d. or 1/- in the pound for four or five years.  Furthermore, you must remember that the borrowing powers of nearly all local authorities are almost exhausted.  The local bodies that I know are very much in debt, and they are not in a position at the present moment to borrow any further sums for the building of houses.  It is for that reason that I say if you do not agree to increase this amount, or make it equivalent to the loan given in last year's Act, you are not encouraging the erection of houses.  A person who wishes to erect a house at a cost of £450 will get £45.  That is a very small sum for him to look forward to when he has the house erected.  At least it might be expected that the Government would encourage enterprise in this direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good has spoken at length on his amendment.  I do not wish to go into details or to repeat what he has said in favour of his amendment in urging mine.  In both the same argument will apply.  I think the President might look at this with a benevolent eye and say that he will accept this amendment for the sake of encouraging private enterprise and the giving of employment to the people in the country.  As matters stand under this Bill, the urban council, town commissioners and county councils will not build houses.  In the first place they have not the finance at their disposal. In the second place the rates are too high.  In this way you will be depriving <Col N="1742" /> people living in these areas of the privilege of having houses erected for them, and you are moreover depriving the workers&mdash;builders, labourers, carpenters and masons from getting employment. If you agree to give the same grant as in the last year's Act you might get people who would be prepared to come forward and erect houses for themselves.  Although the President says there were 2,462 houses erected under the Act of 1924, there should be double that many houses erected.  What is wrong is that the people who require houses have not the money at their disposal to start.  In order that they be eligible for this grant they must, first of all, have the house built and roofed, and then they get half the grant, and when the house is completely finished and passed by the engineer they get the remaining half.</P>
    <P>If the Government were really serious about giving an opportunity to people to have better housing conditions they would give a more substantial sum.  I am aware that the Government have a lot of liabilities and for that reason I know it is hard to expect them to increase the amounts that they are prepared to give.  I take it that the Bill would not have been introduced were it not for the fact that the Executive Council and those associated with them were serious in their view, that they really mean to improve the positions of the people as far as housing accommodation is concerned. But then, being really serious, why should they offer a small grant to the person who built a house for himself and give £10 or £15 more to the local authority who, they know, will not build?  It is only in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford that advantage will be taken of this Bill.  The local authorities in a town of five or six thousand of a population cannot afford to build houses.  I ask the President to accept this amendment and so give to a three-roomed house a grant of £50, to a four-roomed house £70, and to a five-roomed house £90.  If he does that, he will find that not only will you have 2,462 houses additional in the country but that twice that number will be built under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Schedule as a whole I would like to ask the President if his attention has been called to the condition under which grants are made in the Northern Ireland area.  He has referred to the subsidies being smaller there than the subsidies proposed here, but I will inform him that one of the conditions for the payment of the subsidy is that the materials that are used in the building of these houses shall, as far as possible, be provided from the area of the jurisdiction of the Northern Government.  That has special reference to bricks, cement, and certain other things that are produced in that area.  The effect of it, of course, is to prevent the possibility of any supplies being sent from this part of the country, but it induces the sending of supplies from that area into Dublin and other towns.  I would like to draw the attention of the President to the desirability of introducing some provision of that kind here before making grants under this Schedule in cases where it is possible to obtain material produced within the Saorstát.  Reference was made during Question time to-day to the closing down of the cement works in Wexford, a cement works owned by the same people that supply the cement that is sometimes sent from Magheramorne in the Six County area, and sometimes sent from across the water.  There, obviously, is a case where the supplies from the country which is paying the subsidy should be called for, and I commend that idea to the President for his consideration, to see whether it would be desirable to put such a condition, either in the regulations or in the Bill, or in some way to ensure that the supplies, as far as reasonably can <Col N="1744" /> be, shall be produced within the Saorstát.</P>

First of all, it might create a difficulty whereby the price would be higher for the houses so built; secondly the one works would not be capable of making all that would be necessary.

      <P>Might I ask the Dáil to accept the amendment made in the Seanad to the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Bill, 1925.  It is simply a better and more considered definition of the word &ldquo;prison&rdquo; than appeared originally in the Bill.  I move:</P>

      <P>I am sure that you, sir, and the House will appreciate the very great difficulty that there is in dealing with the question of which I have given notice, especially in view of the fact that the Boundary Commission is sitting.  Of course, according to all etiquette regarding judicial procedure the case is still <i>sub judice.</i>  Therefore, having taken that primary fact into consideration.  I do not propose to proceed to discuss the question of which I have given notice, beyond expressing the view that I think that diplomatic usages should be respected in connection with this State.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 3 o'clock on April 2nd.</P>
