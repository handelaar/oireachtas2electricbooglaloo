      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that during the refitting of trawlers for foreign purchasers in Haulbowline Dockyard from October to December, 1924, the hours the staff worked were from 7.15 a.m. to 10.30 p.m., a period of fourteen and a-half hours, reckoned as seventeen hours for purposes of pay and overtime pay, and whether he will take steps to ensure that in future such excessive hours are not worked, and that any extra work required will be dealt with by the employment of some of <Col N="580" /> the tradesmen at present unemployed locally.</P>

      <P>During the refitting of trawlers sold for foreign destinations at Haulbowline Dockyard between October and December, 1924, a certain amount of overtime was worked, as the purchasers were anxious to have the work completed quickly.  The exact amount worked cannot be stated without reference to Haulbowline, but it was not excessive, and was less than that suggested by the Deputy in the question.  Instructions were given in December that in future no overtime is to be worked at the Dockyard without special authority.</P>

      <P>I made the following statement in the Dáil on the 30th October last:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The unemployment figures have failed to appear for some time.  This has been deliberately done, because it has been found that the figures were not being properly understood. There was no distinction made in those figures published as between unemployed and in insurable occupations, and the unemployed generally, and the figures did not represent a true index of the unemployed problem in the country; as they were being misconstrued, it was thought better to discontinue them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is not proposed to publish corresponding figures until some better system of unemployment statistics has been set up.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that much expense is incurred by farmers and others, west of Macroom, owing to the Circuit Court being held at Cork instead of at Macroom; whether the present Judge has refused to sit in the Town Hall, the Court House being <Col N="582" /> burned, and if he can do anything to remedy this, or if steps will be taken to expedite the rebuilding of the Court House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that much expense has been incurred by farmers or others owing to the Circuit Court being held at Cork instead of at Macroom.  Only 38 civil cases were listed for hearing at the Hilary Sittings at Macroom, and of these but one was defended, so that the number of persons affected was very small.  There were, in addition, four appeals from the District Court.  Furthermore, I understand that the distance from Macroom to Cork is twenty miles, and that there is a good train service, so that the additional expense incurred by the few persons obliged to travel was in no way serious.  I am aware that the present Judge has refused to sit in the Town Hall as that building does not provide proper accommodation for a court, in that it is draughty, with windows broken, and bad heating arrangement. Further, the local dispensary work is carried on at one end of the room in which the court is held.  The duty of providing proper court accommodation is imposed by Statute upon county councils.  I have attempted to get the Cork County Council to discharge its duty in this respect at Macroom, and elsewhere in the County of Cork, but without success.  The finding of a remedy for the present state of affairs at Macroom rests with the Cork County Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Pension Officer lodged an appeal in this case against the rate of old age pension&mdash;nine shillings a week &mdash;allowed by the Naas South Pension <Col N="583" /> Sub-Committee on the 9th ultimo, and a decision thereon has not yet been arrived at.  He reported that the claimant is maintained by her sister, who owns a cottage and 16 acres of land, valuation £30.  He estimated the value of the maintenance at £26 a year.  On that figure a pension of six shillings a week only is allowable under the 1924 Act. The Pension Officer's estimate appears to be moderate in view of the valuation of the farm.  If, however, there are any exceptional reasons for placing a lower value on the maintenance, and the facts are supplied, the matter would receive full consideration.</P>

      <P>Owing to the destruction of many of the farm buildings, it has not been possible to farm the lands as in former days, but land other than that let for grazing is put under cultivation.  An extension of tillage will occur this year. Eight to ten acres are being ploughed for corn.</P>

The Department of Agriculture have, in effect, prohibited the landing in the Saorstát of hay or straw from every country in regard to which there is reason to suspect the existence of cattle disease, or reason to doubt that the laws for preventing the introduction or spread of disease are not effectively administered. Canada does not come within that category. The whole position continues to be carefully watched, but at present I see no reason for taking the action in regard to Canada suggested by the Deputy.</P>

    <P>This estimate is rendered necessary by the fact that since the beginning of the financial year a decision has been come to on the question of the scale of increments for Secondary Teachers. It was only in recent years that the Exchequer resumed responsibility for the payment of salaries to Secondary Teachers.  A great deal of pressure has been applied for the increase of that provision, and the putting of it on a more satisfactory basis.  It has been realised that the most satisfactory basis on which it could be put at present would be one providing for the payment of annual increments to teachers by the Government, and for the payment of a basic salary by the schools. The payment of the basic salary will, of course, include a share of the public money, because there are payments made to the schools.  Those payments will also be increased.  The estimates for the coming year will provide for an increase in the amount actually payable to the schools.</P>

      <P>I think the Dáil generally will agree that in discussing this very important estimate they will be at a great disadvantage by not having present the Minister <Col N="591" /> charged by the Dáil and the country with the control and administration of education.  I quite understand that other duties have been entrusted to him which may necessitate his absence; but, at the same time, I think it is only right to say that such a very important service as the education of the country should not be dealt with in the more or less haphazard fashion that seems to have been adopted recently.  The special matter now before the Committee was raised on very many occasions during the last two or three years, and on every occasion on which it was before the House there was general agreement that the position of Secondary Teachers was disgraceful.  There was general agreement, too, that immediate steps should be taken to remedy the condition of affairs, and there was a promise given that that would be done.  It has taken the greater part of three years to bring forward, or extract from the Government, this measure.  I am sorry to say I cannot congratulate the Government on what has come forth from this long period of incubation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me the scheme which we are asked to pass this estimate for is incomplete, and is niggardly in outlook. It is one more example of the economy which seems to be fashionable nowadays, and which seems to assume that it is by cutting down expenditure of all kinds, irrespective of the direction in which it is applied, that money may be saved.  That is the view taken in preference to the broader and longer outlook of spending wisely.  If there is one service in the State which would benefit by a wise expenditure of money, it is education, and if there is one department of that service on which money should be spent, it is in the procuring of good teachers.  The teacher is the hub of a good educational system, and if you do not get good teachers all the other money expended on education cannot count for very much.  If you want good teachers you must pay well for them, just the same as if you want a good commercial commodity you must pay well for it.  This scheme seems to me to be incomplete. The demand of the Secondary Teachers, and of the country on their behalf, has <Col N="592" /> been for a scale of salaries.  This is not a scale of salaries.</P>
    <P>I remember a young lad once writing a composition about a cat.  He described the cat as something with a head, a tail and a middle.  This scheme has neither a head nor a tail; it has only a middle.  We have a scale of increments; but a scale of increments should have a basic or minimum figure, and it should have a maximum figure. The basic minimum figure here seems to be missing, as also does the maximum figure; we have only got a scale of increments. It is like a cross-word puzzle; you have the clues across but not down.  There seem also, just as in the cross-word puzzle, to be a good deal of black marks and blank spaces in the scheme.  Until it is known what the minimum figure is to be, the Dáil cannot express any definite opinion as to the scale which is introduced here.  In any of the rules that have been circulated, or in the Supplementary Estimate itself, there is nothing to indicate what the minimum figure is to be or what is to be the possible maximum figure.  We do not know the nature of the provision made for the secondary teachers.  All we do know is that there will be certain increments awarded by the State and we can, at least, infer that the schools will be expected to pay a certain minimum rate of salary.</P>
    <P>I think it was on the occasion of the last debate that the Minister for Education made a reference to the fact that we might take it that the minimum rate of salary which would eventually be fixed would be in or about £200 for men.  We have nothing definite with regard to that.  We know from experience that promises of this kind do not always materialise.  I might refer to the actual increments.  In the rules that have been circulated in connection with this Supplementary Estimate we are told, on page 4, that for men there are to be ten annual increments of £12 and subsequently six increments of £15.  That would be a total of £210 in ordinary normal increments.  If we assume that £200 is fixed as a minimum salary, that would give the ordinary normal maximum, payable to a teacher, £410.  I respectfully submit that you <Col N="593" /> are not going to get a good secondary teacher for £410.</P>
    <P>Recently there was introduced a scale of salaries&mdash;not a scale of increments&mdash;in Northern Ireland.  They have done much better than what is now proposed here.  I think it is not anything to be proud of that in the matter of paying for education we in the Free State should lag behind those in the six county area.  This is not the only instance in which we lag behind them.  There is no reason why we should, in setting out to adopt a scale of salaries for secondary teachers, put ourselves in the position that our best men and women will be continually going over the border to better their financial position.  That is not a satisfactory state of things to contemplate. The maximum salary in the North will be higher than ours, unless it happens that the basic figure will be increased over and above what seems to be in contemplation, and the scale of increments generally is much better in the North than here.  In England and Scotland the scale of salary obtainable by men with the same qualifications is very much higher than in the Free State. That is another cause of the emigration of our best teachers.  They can get higher remuneration for their services in England and Scotland, and even in the six county area.</P>
    <P>What seems to me to be one of the worst features of the scheme, from the point of view of men and women in the service, is the method adopted for placing them on the scale.  It is what is familiarly known as the carry-over. When they introduced a new scheme of salaries in Scotland and England under the Burnham scheme, the method adopted&mdash;and what would naturally seem to be the correct method&mdash;was that of placing the men where they would have been placed if the scheme had been in operation from the time they entered the service.  For instance, if there were sixteen increments on the scale and the man had given sixteen or more years' service, he was placed automatically at the maximum.  That was the system adopted in England.  In the North of Ireland when they introduced their scale they were not able to do quite so well and they adopted a plan <Col N="594" /> of allowing only one increment for each two years' service.  They had a system of seventeen increments, and everybody with 34 years' service went automatically to the top of the scale.</P>
    <P>In the twenty-six counties we cannot even do so well as they did in the North.  We have found it necessary to go one worse than the North.  We adopted the plan of allowing only one year's incremental service for each two years of actual service, and we went to a certain limit, allowing only ten increments. It is set out that in no case shall a teacher be credited under this rule with more than ten increments in respect of approved teaching service. No matter what service a man has given, he can only get ten increments. No one is then placed on the maximum, because before he can reach the maximum he must serve six further years, irrespective of whether he may have, as some have, 35, 36 or 40 years' service. That is the very worst feature of the whole scheme.  Surely there is nothing to justify this limitation, even if we have to go to the extent of adopting the plan adopted in the North of Ireland, allowing one year for incremental purposes for each two years served. We should not put any limitation of ten years in the scheme.</P>
    <P>We should allow anyone who has the necessary number of years' service to go right to the top of the scale.  There is one feature of this to which I would like to call attention.  We have been trying to deal with the question of secondary teachers for the last two or three years by a system of interim grants.  A lump sum was voted and divided, according to certain regulations, among the teachers.  This was passed from year to year until such time as a permanent scale could be set up, such as seems to be attempted here.  This money is being substituted for the interim grant.  As it happens, very many teachers were getting more from the interim grant than they will get for many years under this permanent scale.  The net result is that every teacher who has given up to twelve years' service stands to lose in the matter of the carry-over.  Women teachers will not do as well under this as they did under the temporary <Col N="595" /> grants, which everyone admitted were insufficient.</P>
    <P>There are some other features of this scheme deserving of attention.  For the first time, so far as I have been informed, a distinction is to be made between grants payable to men and those payable to women.  I think that is a very bad principle to adopt, and I do not see why we should feel ourselves bound to continue what is, in my opinion, eminently a bad and mischievous principle, and that is drawing a distinction between the remuneration paid to men and that paid to women for exactly the same type of work. There is no distinction made between men and women in the matter of voting or in the matter of income tax. They have to pay the same price for a stamp at the post office.  They have to pay the same taxes.  The rates on a house are not reduced because a woman happens to live in it.  I do not see why it should be thought necessary to make a distinction between the remuneration paid to men and women when the same work is done by each. I enter a protest against the introduction for the first time into the scale of salaries of that distinction which should not appear there and of which the Dáil should not approve.</P>
    <P>That is rather a small matter in comparison with the other things to which I have drawn attention, but I think it is nevertheless worthy of note. I see from the first page that a headmaster may be recognised in a school of sixty pupils and over, in addition to four teachers, and in such a school it is not necessary that the headmaster should be normally engaged in actual teaching work.  With all respect, I would say in a school of sixty to eighty pupils that to recognise four teachers and a headmaster is not essential.  I cannot imagine what a headmaster would do if such a school in addition to a number of teachers, or that he should be recognised and receive increments if he is not engaged in actual teaching work. I make that comment from a casual reading of the rules.  There may be a very good reason for it, but I must confess that I do not see it.  I wish to say that I consider that, in addition to what <Col N="596" /> I might regard as the general niggardliness of the scheme, there is the point of carry-over which I press on the Minister responsible.  The Minister for Education is not here, but I am quite sure we would not be justified in throwing all the blame for this on him, as I think I can trace the hand of another Minister all over the scheme.  If that Minister has anything to do with this part of it I put it to him that this particular part, especially regarding the carry-over, badly requires to be remedied.  It is a small point.  We must, I suppose, only wait for the time when we will get the general scale revised. The Minister ought to give way on this point, namely, that the older people with thirty and forty years' service should be allowed to go direct and at once to the maximum scale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the point of view taken by Deputy O'Connell, and I join with him in regretting the absence of the Minister for Education, which, as we know, is on account of important matters affecting this country.  It makes it a little more difficult, however, to speak about this question, because one has to refer back to many things that have been said here before when the matter was under discussion, and one is loath to make such references in the absence of one who is largely responsible for those utterances.  I think it, is necessary for us to be clear about the position which the Government has taken up in this matter up to the present, and for that purpose, and with the leave of the Dáil, I propose to make short quotations from three public utterances of Ministers on this matter.  I go back in the first place to December, 1922, when Professor MacNeill showed that he, at any rate, completely recognised the case put up for the unsatisfactory position of secondary teachers.  He said:&mdash;&ldquo;I say that it would be not only a calamity but a very gross injustice if funds that may be forthcoming in any shape or form were not provided for continuing the provision of the late interim grant.  There are three points&mdash;salary, tenure of office, and pensions, on which I do not think there is a single person alive who, speaking conscientiously, would deny <Col N="597" /> that in these respects the position of secondary teachers is gravely unsatisfactory. I do not say it with regard to justice, with regard to the men and women concerned, but in regard to the public interested and the right education of their children.&rdquo;  That puts the case of the teachers and the recognition of it by the Government very well and very concisely.  In July, 1923, Professor MacNeill followed that up by saying that he was quite certain that if the Dáil could make a substantial increase on this Vote over the heads of the Ministry it would do so.  It would not, however, be necessary.  &ldquo;I have the authority of the Ministry and the authority of the Minister for Finance in particular, to state to you that it will be the duty and the pleasure of the Minister for Finance himself to propose a very substantial increase in the amount already set out in the Vote as available for the improvement of the salaries of secondary teachers.&rdquo;  Later on in the year the President, at the close of the Session, said that it had been found, because of pressure of business, it was not possible to introduce the necessary resolution to provide for a larger distribution of funds in respect of this service.  He further said:&mdash;&ldquo;I do give this guarantee that we will recognise and hand on to the people who come after us, that we will regard this as an obligation on the part of the succeeding Ministry to discharge.  The sum involved is something like £30,000 or £40,000.&rdquo;  I sum up the position from these utterances to be this, that the Ministry recognise that the State grant for secondary education is at present insufficient to the extent of at least something like £30,000.  My special reason for putting that matter in that way will be given in a moment. Last July we were told by the Minister for Education, when discussing the Vote on Secondary Education, that, although he was not able to give exact details, there were two points on which he was able to give definite assurances &mdash;that the Minister for Finance had agreed to two proposals put before him as vital.  &ldquo;The first was that the salaries of secondary teachers should be put on a professional basis by the institution of a fixed minimum basic <Col N="598" /> salary to be paid to the teachers by the schools.  I take as a representative figure in that case £200 for a man. Secondly, a system of yearly increments is to be paid to the teachers by the State, these increments to be based on the length of service and merit of teaching, and so calculated as to bring the teachers' salary up to a good maximum in, say, ten or twelve years.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister very properly did not go into details because the Minister for Finance was absent.  We were assured that practically a scheme was completed except for minor details, and we were assured that on the two main points agreement had been reached between the two Departments.  I suppose all of us have heard of the great mountain, after being in labour, bringing forth a mouse.  After nine months I propose to show that the Minister for Education on this occasion, with the collaboration or assistance of the Minister for Finance, has brought forth a negative quantity.  Instead of there being a proposal to increase the grant allotted to secondary teachers it seems to me to be quite clear that, for this year at any rate, there will be actually a diminution in the amount allotted to secondary education.  If I am making a mistake I am sure the Minister will correct me.  I do not think it is possible that he is under a misapprehension, and it may be that I am making a mistake, but I propose to show how I regard the matter.  It is true that in the total estimates for the year ending April, 1925, there would be a sum of £100,000 as an interim grant and the supplementary sum of £30,000 now being put forward by the Minister.  That does not mean that in any school year the secondary teachers are going to get more money, but it arises from the fact that the £100,000 interim grant was a belated grant and was applied to the teachers for the year of service that they were then giving, that it was a grant which dated back into the previous year of our finances and that the effect of that grant came to an end in July, 1924.  If we carry on in the same way, we must, I think, regard this matter which we are considering, as to what is being done for the good of secondary education, in terms of how much the <Col N="599" /> teachers are going to get in any particular year of school service.  If this corresponding interim grant had been continued, there would have been available the sum of £100,000.  It is quite true&mdash;and I regret it&mdash;that in the period ended July, 1924, the sum of £100,000 was not distributed.  £100,000 was voted by the Dáil as being required for the service of secondary education but, owing to the rules, only £89,000 of that was actually distributed.  If a corresponding vote were to come up in the next year, it would mean that there would be a sum of £100,000 available for the encouragement and help of secondary education.  Owing to the attempt to get more up-to-date, it is quite true that into this year's vote we are going to bring the £100,000 voted, and half of what will be required for secondary education under the incremental system which is being inaugurated by the Minister for Education and the Minister for Finance.  But the fact that more money falls upon the Dáil in this year's vote does not imply at all that more money will be available for secondary teachers.  It seems to me to be perfectly clear that in the school year ending last June or July, the sum of £89,000 was distributed as interim grant, but for the year ending July, 1925, there is only going to be available £42,000 for the first half year under the incremental scale, and a certain sum, owing to increases and increments, for the remaining half year.  The total sum is very unlikely to reach £89,000, which, as I have stated, was the amount given under the interim grant for the year ending July, 1924.</P>
    <P>At the start, the actual effect of this incremental system will be that less money rather than more money will be coming to the teachers as a body in any school year.  I would like the Minister to show me where I am wrong in that calculation, if I am wrong.  I say that that is a complete failure on the part of the Ministry to keep up to their recognised duty to do something more substantial for secondary education than had been done in the past.  I quite recognise the Minister's position.  I sympathise with him.  In this, I am sure, I shall have <Col N="600" /> the full support of the Business Deputies. I fully realise the urgency to the Government of cutting down expenses as much as possible.  But on this question of secondary education we cannot afford to be cheeseparing or economical.  That does not mean that we cannot afford the money, but rather that we cannot afford not to encourage secondary education.  That is one of the most vital things required, if there is to be any real progress in the country.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Connell said, it is exceedingly difficult to criticise this scheme, coming before us piecemeal, as it does.  We know nothing as to what is proposed regarding the basic salary, or how it is to be secured.  I do not assume that the Minister has dropped the principle of the basic salary altogether. I assume the reason that he has not put it forward is that he has not been able to see how he is going to enable the schools to pay that basic salary.  But until we know the basic salary, we are in the difficulty which Deputy O'Connell explained, in criticising this scheme.  In so far as new teachers are concerned, we recognise the scheme is a distinct improvement and that the Ministers have done something substantial to enable those who will become teachers in the future or who are starting to teach at the present moment, to look forward to better conditions than their predecessors had. So far, I am prepared to say that the Ministry have done well.  But that, I think, is only a very small part of their duty in this matter.  They have a very important duty indeed to those who have been serving as teachers, if not for a considerable number of years, for so long that they are coming to the stage when they are too old for their work.  Deputy O'Connell referred to this point and, therefore, I do not dwell upon it.  But I would urge upon the Minister for Finance that in this matter he should do something substantial to recognise the claims of those teachers who have been serving so long.  The effect of these proposals will be that the older teachers will have to keep on teaching long after they have ceased to be efficient if they are to get anywhere near the suggested <Col N="601" /> maximum.  The very least that might be done would be to allow them their years' service without the proviso which has been referred to.  If they were treated in the manner suggested by Deputy O'Connell they would be treated with some approximation to justice.  It would not place a great burden on the Exchequer, and would not necessitate expending anything more in the initial stages than the sum the Government has recognised they ought to spend on this matter.</P>
    <P>There are two or three other points I would like to refer to.  One of these points refers to pensions.  When we were assured last year that the Government had agreed upon the basic salary and an incremental scale, we agreed more or less that we would let the question of pensions lie over for a time. But here we are faced with a piecemeal scheme, not with a full scheme. Therefore, I contend that the whole question is reopened and that we are justified in putting forward, as an argument at this stage, that it would be really wiser action on the part of the Government to face the whole question at once and try and get a real decision on it.  It is the first stage in these things that counts.  Once we have got a step taken in the right direction, time will bring about such improvement as we should hope to see secured.  I think it would be quite possible for the Government to take a step in this direction without any cost to themselves.  I might remind the Minister&mdash;I am sure he knows of it&mdash;that under the old system there was £1,000,000 which came from Irish Church Funds which was assigned to Intermediate Education. I think it would be a proper use of that money to earmark it for this purpose.  No doubt, the Minister for Finance will tell me that he is using it for something else.  But the question arises whether, in utilising it for other purposes, he is going back on the original purpose for which the money was allotted.</P>
    <P>Another point I would like to make is that the effect of the rules proposed by the Minister will be that a very considerable number of registered teachers will not benefit by this incremental scale at all.  To that extent, <Col N="602" /> the scheme will not only be deficient but harmful.  Lastly, I desire to stress as strongly as I can a point made by Deputy O'Connell.  It is surely a regrettable thing that a large number of secondary teachers in this current school year will get a lesser grant under the proposed system than they would have got if the old interim grant had been continued.  I think that in the case of women teachers there is not one who will not get less this year under this proposed scheme than she would have got if the old interim grant had been continued.  There are many men who will get less this year than they would have got under the old system.</P>
    <P>There is one point to which Deputy O'Connell did not refer and which I was nearly forgetting.  It may be arguable that inasmuch as the men teachers will have a household to keep up&mdash;they may be married and have a wife and children to maintain&mdash;they ought to get a higher maximum salary than women.  I am prepared to admit that, but I think you are pressing that difference entirely too far if you say that the &ldquo;extras&rdquo; which are allowed specially qualified teachers should be different in the case of men and women.  You give certain additional increments to men and women who have taken an Honours Degree.  Exactly the same preparation is required in one case that is required in the other.  There is exactly the same expense on one as there is on the other.  It seems to me that in justice, when additional efficiency is secured by a teacher in taking out an Honours Degree, the reward from the State ought to be the same for both sexes.  I can see no justification for allowing these two additional increments to be based on different scales.</P>

      <P>Deputy Thrift illustrates what is a very common attitude&mdash;&ldquo;taxation must be reduced; the charge upon the public is too high; it must come down; but spare the particular interest which I represent.&rdquo;  The slogan that used to resound from the Liberal platforms in England was &ldquo;Peace, Retrenchment and Reform.&rdquo;  Peace, stabilisation of Government, security of life, retrenchment, diminution of the burden of <Col N="603" /> taxes, whether national taxes or local rates and reform, as a great measure of social betterment, is the policy of the Party which, in the usual language, is said to give &ldquo;habitual support to the Executive Government.&rdquo;  My reason for giving the measure of support I give to the Government is precisely that that is its policy.  It has, it is true, become identified in the very recent past with one of those three great elements of policy more than, perhaps, was necessary.  Retrenchment, reduction of expenditure in every direction: that is the insistent cry not merely from our benches, and from the benches of those who are styled, somewhat facetiously, the Business Party, but from the citizens almost unanimously.  There is no doubt that a Government that claims to function for the best interests of the people could not, even if it wished, be deaf to those cries.  What is a law for the citizen as an individual is a law for the State.</P>
      <P>The citizen must, if he is an honest and an honourable man, live within his income.  He must balance his budget, and if he cannot earn more then he must spend less.  That is the only remedy&mdash;if he cannot earn more than he must spend less.  And that holds good for the State.  I say that by way of prelude to a further remark on the necessity of long vision in the pursuit of a policy of economy, for there is a true economy and a false economy.  There are some who think that by cutting down expenses indiscriminately you economise.  That might very well take the form, if blindly operated, of destroying sources of national income and national strength.  Where is the &ldquo;Freeman's Journal&rdquo; to-day?  What put it out of existence?  It is not difficult to trace it back to the economies that were practised by an eminent financier who believed that by cutting down the salaries of journalists, by dismissing men and reducing the staffs, he could make a great daily newspaper, which would have a great influence upon public opinion, and at the same time be a source of dividend to the shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very necessary, I insist, to discriminate between expenditure that is fruitful and expenditure that is waste <Col N="604" /> I am dreadfully afraid that in this new zeal for economy we are likely to cut down expenditure that would, not merely in the immediate future but in generations to come, be highly profitable as a national investment.  I do not agree with Deputy Thrift in attacking the Minister for Education for this. I took a note of what he said: &ldquo;The Minister responsible is not here.&rdquo;  The statement on the front page of these rules for the payment of increments of salary to secondary teachers, I think, is an example of what the theologian calls <i>suppressio veri et suggestio falsi.</i>  It says &ldquo;the rules are made by the Minister for Education&rdquo;&mdash;<i>suggestio falsi</i>&mdash;&ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;&mdash;<i>suppressio veri.</i>  These rules bear the impress upon them, in every line, of being the work of the Ministry of Finance.  I do not blame the Education Ministry at all.  The responsible officials of that Ministry have a long acquaintance with the work of secondary schools, and of their necessities.  They are sympathetic to these claims of secondary teachers.  That this came from their hands I refuse to believe.  I think the secret is disclosed in part and we may from our own conclusion when it is stated, in accordance with the requirements of the Constitution, that it is with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  In the pursuance of our great policy&mdash;I say &ldquo;our&rdquo; because, after all, I regard myself as one of the Government party&mdash;of retrenchment and reform we have not been niggardly as regards road making, as regards housing, as regards provision for public health.</P>

      <P>Those are only details.  I am looking at the broad policy that we are pursuing.  Why, the Minister for Local Government is pilotting through the Seanad a great Bill, one important item of which is provision for public health!  When it comes to something that goes down to the foundations of national prosperity and greatness why do we draw back? Why do we suddenly tighten our purse-strings and feel that we are too extravagant? A million pounds for roads! Oh, that is a bagatelle!  After all, the <Col N="605" /> roads are the great highways of commerce. They are the arteries of the commercial life!  Education, as I have said on a former occasion here, seems to be regarded as the setting up of a number of schools to which children of one age are sent to get them out of the way of home&mdash;a system of creche.  Another is a place or state of punishment&mdash;I described it as a purgatory&mdash;where some souls suffer for a time before they can go to work and earn wages.  And what are the secondary schools for?  Really it would be very hard to say.  But there is a lot of clamour made from time to time in the Dáil and in the newspapers, and to appease that clamour we will arrange for public expenditure upon it. Surely that is not the attitude of a Government that has open-eyed vision of the needs of the country and has a clear conception of what the prosperity of the country, both now and hereafter, is based upon.  We are confronted with this grand dilemma.  If we are going to have a policy of social betterment it must include a better system of education, and we cannot have that without paying.  That is the great law of life. Democratic government, it has been repeatedly said, is a very expensive form of government.  Any legislation or administration democratically carried out involves an enormous amount of expenditure, and you have got to pick and choose as to these things that are paramount necessities if your budget is limited.  But surely no one in his senses would make education the Department in which the principal savings were to be effected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is portion of these rules which I think much more objectionable than any other.  It has been dealt with by Deputy O'Connell already, and by Deputy Thrift.  That is the discrimination between men and women&mdash;&ldquo;The increments of salaries to be paid to recognised teachers in respect of any school year shall, subject to the condition of these rules, be,&rdquo; etc.  &ldquo;Men&mdash; Ten annual increments of £12 each, and subsequently six annual increments of £15 each.  Women&mdash;Twelve annual increments of £10 each&rdquo;&mdash;not ten of twelve, but twelve of ten.  The total amount at the end of the appointed <Col N="606" /> period is £120, but the women are longer in reaching it.  Then two increments of £20 each in the case of men, and two increments of £10 each in the case of women holding an honours degree. Why should the position of honours degree mean £40 more at the end of the time to a man and £20 more at the end of the appointed time to a woman if, as Deputy Thrift has told you, and told you correctly, it costs the same in fees and it costs the same in time of attendance at lectures.  The ordeal of the examination is the same.  The course is different in no way.  The standards applied are equal.  Yet the attainment of this status in a University on the part of a woman is regarded by the State as half the value of the status if attained by a man when they proceed to do precisely the same work under precisely the same departmental supervision. If women are so inferior as teachers, why employ them at all? Why not have the courage of our convictions and declare that we shall not tolerate them in the schools?  We are going to set an example to the world, the Minister told us yesterday.  We are creating our own precedents.  Let us be precedent-makers now and give a lead to the world that women could not give value in the educational sphere. That is an intelligible position to take up.  But to take up the position that they are excellent teachers, that they are capable of receiving University education and profiting by it, and that they can attain to the same academic status as men and then to proceed illogically and to declare that the reward for them shall be half in the case of women is utterly indefensible.</P>
    <P>I asked a few days ago a number of very able witnesses who were experienced in life, and in business, which did they prefer, a pound's worth of value to a pound's rates, or 13/6 worth of value with a rate of 15/-.  I think that would appeal to a business man even though he were a member of the Dáil&mdash; a pound's value for rates paid to the amount of a pound or fifteen shillings paid for what is actually worth 13/4. Everyone of them, without hesitation and without exception, said he would rather pay a pound and get a pound's value. <Col N="607" /> The alternative here is to get rid of women teachers altogether, if you do not pay them on the equitable basis of a fair return for a fair day's work. Of course, you are not applying that at all to the men, and I dare say that is the reason why it is not to be applied to the women, but that only makes the inequity in the case of the women greater, because the men are not being paid what they ought to be paid and the women are being paid considerably less than the men.  As was already pointed out, I need not try to emphasise it, because repetition would only weaken it.  Women are equal with men under the Constitution; their civil and political position is the same.  I doubt the political wisdom, to put it on no higher plane, of declaring officially in the name of two Ministries that the women whose votes we will ask for in a few days are so inferior that when it becomes a question of disbursing public funds in payment for their services it must be at the rate of something like half what has to be accredited to a man. Even in the case of men, what are those increments?  After forty years' service a man has £120.  I figured it out that at the age of 70, when, in fact, he should not be in school, he would be arriving at his maximum.  It is a grim jest to say to the teacher: You shall have to arrive at your maximum when you have attained an age at which you are past your work and when a properly worked Department of Education would not tolerate you to continue your supposed services any longer as a teacher in the school.</P>
    <P>There is another injustice:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In determining a recognised teacher's place on the incremental scale, in the first instance, one increment may be allowed for every two years' approved teaching service up to and including July 31st, 1924.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, we take an arbitrary date&mdash; 1924&mdash;and we divide the years of service of a teacher up to that date by two in order to arrive at the number of years' service that he shall be deemed to have for the purpose of this increment. One would imagine after that has been done that the corollary to it would be that he would then get the carry-over that is provided for in England <Col N="608" /> under the Burnham scheme, but he does not.  Under the Burnham scheme, to begin with, the service is not cut, and the correct position of a teacher on scale is the position which the teacher would have reached on the date of introduction of the scheme, if that had been in force throughout the term of service.</P>
    <P>There is another respect in which this is defective.  I am glad to be able to say something, even a little, in defence, or apparent defence, of one of these provisions.  It is obvious that if the State is to provide moneys in aid of the teachers in secondary schools that it shall keep a watchful eye to see that the schools are not overstaffed. That is a view that the taxpayer is entitled to take: that you shall not have too much of a good thing.  A school to be efficient must be properly staffed. How many is too many is a very difficult problem of educational policy to determine.  But, at any rate, assuming that the Department of Finance as the supreme educational authority has a right in deciding&mdash;I am not speaking of the Minister for Finance; I extend to him my heartiest sympathy; I do not hold him personally responsible for any of these things of which I have been speaking when I referred to the Department of Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He is constitutionally responsible, but I am speaking in the Pickwickian sense.  We are quite familiar with this in other countries.  There is no Government in the world that has a Treasury in which the permanent official of the Treasury does not take command.  That that is one of the unfortunate blots in a democratic system of government, even one like me, who is an enthusiast for democracy, must admit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann, as enacted here, the Department of Finance is the paramount authority and has the last word to say in regard to all the spending departments.  That is perfectly true. I foretold&mdash;I am very sorry to discover I was a true prophet&mdash;that what would happen in regard to many departments was that the Ministry of Finance would <Col N="609" /> take command and have control.  One of the great difficulties, if a department has to decide what expenditure it will not allow, is: how are we to concede it that privilege and at the same time withhold from it control of public policy?  In determining that expenditure shall not be permitted, that expenditure must be cut down, it might happen that, in effect, the whole trend of public policy is being determined, so that in the last analysis the country is governed by the decisions of the departmental officer in one department. That is what I have before my mind in all these criticisms that I make to-day.</P>
    <P>The number of recognised teachers in a secondary school who may be paid increments of salary shall normally not exceed the authorised quota as determined in accordance with the table set out in the first schedule to these rules.</P>
    <P>I turn to the first schedule of the rules, and I find that the authorised quota of recognised teachers depends upon the number of recognised pupils. Less than 15, not more than one teacher; more than 30, but not more than 45, then no more than three recognised teachers.  One does not require to have educational experience to see how arbitrary this scheme is&mdash;that the provision of staffing in a school is to depend upon such a variable thing as the number of pupils and the attendance at a given period.  Things beyond the teachers' control, things that are set and fashioned by the hand of Heaven, are to be the final determinants.</P>
    <P>Suppose I were a secondary teacher and the attendance in my school fell below this prescribed level, I go out of employment.  I try to find employment in another school, but they have no room for me, because that would bring the quota to a plus.  Who is to decide in these matters as to the teacher who is to be let go?  You touch upon a very delicate matter, for many schools are private property and the extraneous teacher will be the first to be let go. That is a very serious consideration&mdash; a very, very serious consideration.  I would need to go into educational policy to pursue that further, and I do not think that I am entitled on an <Col N="610" /> Estimate to discuss educational policy. I might just dismiss it in one remark. In these definitions on page 1 we are told that a recongised teacher, amongst other things, is one &ldquo;who is normally engaged in teaching in one or more secondary schools for not less than eighteen hours a week in the aggregate a subject or subjects on the Department's programme.&rdquo;  I should have thought that the first thing to be determined was what subjects ought to be taught; and, in the next stage, how many hours would be sufficient, how many hours would be adequate for the proper teaching of a subject; then to insist that in the staff of a school there should be someone competent to do that work at all costs, irrespective of the variable number.  In other words, to approach the problem from this avenue: what does educational efficiency demand?  What are the conditions of staffing an Intermediate School in view of our conception of Intermediate Education?  and then follow on.  But here is the mark&mdash;I have almost said the hoof-print&mdash;of the man who deals in figures, figures, figures!  to whom living realities are never present even imaginatively, but who is balancing budgets, considering calculations&mdash;the arithmetical soul.  His idea of a proper secondary school, and of the conditions to determine remuneration within it, is figures.</P>
    <P>That is what we have come to now. Now that we are masters in our own house, now that the alien is gone and has left us to set up the scheme of education that is dear to our hearts, this is how we begin.  We begin by counting figures and doing sums in arithmetic, and the life of the teacher, his career, and his heart in his work, count for nothing.  When we go outside these walls we say that the greatest dowry a parent can give his daughter is an education that will put her beyond the reach of want, as she can earn her own living anywhere. That is what we say outside.  When we come in here we are asked to vote for something that would doom the teacher that could give that education to an inferior status educationally and to an inferior income.  We talk about the whole of the world being open to the <Col N="611" /> boy of ambition who has got energy and who has got his brain and his mind well-trained, and then, when we face what the State is going to do for the man who will give him that training, that will turn his ambition into the right course, direct his mind to right ends, make him the good citizen&mdash;the least we can spare; less than that if we could contrive it.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to speak with patience on the dealings of the Government in education when one looks to other countries.  England went through all this and England paid for it.  England bitterly regretted the way in which she starve education when she had to face on the battlefields the forces of a country that had spent freely and gave of its best for education.  Now Mr. Winston Churchill, as one of the first enterprises of his position as Chancellor of the Exchequer, adds upwards of a quarter of a million to the grants payable to the universities.  Simultaneously with that, our Department of Finance issues these niggardly rules and calls them rules made by the Minister for Education.  I think that we will have to give up talking about our race as a race that loves education.  That will be one of the many bubbles the existence of this Dáil has contributed to burst. I marvel at Deputy Thrift's patience when he read out from the official reports of the Dáil the statements made by the Minister for Education at different dates: &ldquo;Right education is the proper claim of the people for their children; not to deal justly and equitably with the secondary teachers would be a calamity and an injustice.&rdquo;  And the quotation from July, which reminded me of the verse:</P>
    <P>Hope told the flattering tale</P>
    <P>That joy would soon return.</P>
    <P>Neither the Minister nor the joy is present with us to-day.  I regret the absence of both.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies I would like to speak as the only constitutionalist in the House&mdash;as I have been alluded to&mdash;perhaps, one might also say, the only conservative in the House.  Deputy Magennis had to assure the House that he was still a <Col N="612" /> supporter of the Government and a member of the Government Party.  It is well we had that assurance.  The criticism of his speech, and I think of the speech of Deputy Thrift, lies in the attempt&mdash;presumably in the case of Deputy Magennis for the purpose of proving his contention that he was still in the Government Party&mdash;to shield Ministers by using the permanent officials as the object of attack.</P>

I had the impression that he suggested the evil genius in this matter was the Minister for Finance.  However, I want to throw responsibility upon the Minister for Education and make him assume responsibility, not only for the educational scheme that is presumed to be behind this scheme of increments, but also for the scheme of increments.  He, at least, is as much responsible to the Dáil for the finance scheme as is the Minister for Finance.  If he had disagreed with it in any way he was entitled to come here and tell us.</P>

      <P>It is quite unwise.  I think, to suggest that the Minister for Education may be excused for non-attendance to his duties, whether in the House or elsewhere, by reason of his being engaged in other work of great national importance.  I think the fact <Col N="613" /> that he is engaged in that work of great national importance should not be allowed to interfere with his duties as a Minister for Education.  Deputy Magennis is quite right in insisting, as other Deputies have done, that the educational problem is sufficiently grave and important to require the continuous service of a Minister.  Long absence from the duties appertaining to his office will, I suggest, allow the work that ought to be in course of preparation to get into arrear.  I think we ought to have been presented to-day with a statement on the educational policy of the Department; what they are working at in respect of secondary education; and whether they have any scheme of co-ordinating secondary with ordinary primary, University and technical education.  We had hints, on two separate occasions when we were discussing estimates before, that the Minister was quite in accord with the idea that our educational schemes should be co-ordinated.  This is the time when we should have had that scheme propounded to us in so far as it deals with secondary education.  We have not that; we have only a scheme in respect to the partial financing of the prevailing system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is entirely unsatisfactory.  The Minister for Education is primarily responsible, and the whole Executive Council has to bear the burden of that responsibility.  They are all equally blameworthy, but the Minister for Education has to bear an added portion of the blame.  I am afraid the propaganda of the &ldquo;Daily Mail&rdquo; is having its effect here, if it is not in England. Perhaps that is the reason for the wide circulation of that newspaper in Ireland. Certainly it appears to be more effective than some of the propaganda of Irish newspapers.  The attack upon educational expenditure has undoubtedly affected the Ministry.  I support the contentions of Deputies that the method of economising in this matter is not going to result in economy ultimately. I cannot pretend to deal with the details of this scheme in anything approaching the way in which they have been dealt with by Deputies who have spoken.  My complaint is that the proposals here are not related to a general educational scheme, and we <Col N="614" /> have to assume that in the future, as in the past, we are going to continue the secondary school system, although perhaps a slight improvement has taken place, in a manner divorced, to a great degree, from the primary system, and with the teaching profession not related in any direct way as regards primary and secondary tuition.  Particularly in respect to financing these proposals, the point has been raised that they are incomplete.  Speaking as one not conversant with the technicalities embodied in these rules, I am quite in the dark as to what the effects of the increments will be.  I do not mind very much how the Minister arrives at the figure, but I do mind a great deal what the figure is.  I refer to the figure which represents the amount of salary the teacher will have to spend.  We may speak of increments, but these are increments upon a basis unknown.  I think Deputy Thrift quoted the sum of £200 as a possible basis, but that was mentioned in a speech a year ago. Many things have happened since then; many promises have been made, but not fulfilled; many reconsiderations have been given to proposals, but those proposals have been dropped.  What is the position regarding this basic salary?  If we knew the basic salary we might, by close examination, find out what the teacher having a particular period of service and particular qualifications would likely receive, say, next year; but conceivably, so far as this scheme is concerned, as soon as it is passed by the Dáil, schoolmasters, with the consent of the Minister for Education, may reduce their basis. They may become the beneficiaries of any scheme of this kind and teachers may be worse off and even lose more than the amount suggested by Deputy Thrift.  I would urge on the Minister that he should give us a definite statement as to the intentions regarding the basic salary.  I think the term basic salary is used here somewhere. It is at least implied that the increment is upon something of a definite character.  Until we know what the basis is we are not able to calculate what the meaning of this new scale is to the teacher.  I do not know whether we will hear from the Minister any statement regarding what the educational <Col N="615" /> policy is to be.  Perhaps, being a wise tactician, and knowing he will have the last word, he prefers to make his statement regarding educational policy in respect to secondary schools after the debate.  I trust we shall have that statement and that he will be able to give us some satisfaction regarding the intentions in respect to the basic salary upon which these increments are to be paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it can be justly said that the Government and the Oireachtas have not made reasonable provision for expenditure on education, having regard to the resources of the country.  We have a tax revenue of £22,000,000 or £23,000,000. We expend on education over £4,400,000 in one form or another&mdash; something like one-fifth of our total revenue.  In Great Britain the proportion of the total revenue that they spend on education would be nearer one-fifteenth. When Deputy O'Connell spoke in regard to this scheme, he talked about our policy of cutting down expenditure.  The proposals that have been brought forward have certainly nothing to do with cutting down expenditure; they are proposals for increasing expenditure.  They may not increase it as much or as rapidly as some Deputies would desire, but that is no reason for representing them as something they are not.  In the financial year 1921-22, the British Government provided, as an Interim Grant for Secondary Teachers, a sum of £50,000; in the financial year 1922-23 a sum of £63,000 was provided; in 1923-24 a sum of £63,000 was provided; this year, under the head of Interim Grant, a sum of £88,300 has been spent.  Next year under this scheme, apart altogether from assistance that will be given to the schools in order to enable them to pay higher basic salaries than before, there will be £92,500 spent.  Now that £92,500 will, in a very few years, with the coming of additional increments on the Vote, amount, at least, to £150,000. I do not think that £150,000 will be the ultimate maximum by any means; but, in any case, within a very few years, the sums spent by way of teachers' salaries, or part of the teachers' salaries <Col N="616" /> paid by the Government, will be increased to £150,000; and that means that the Government expenditure will be trebled.  I do not think that that can really be regarded as niggardly. It may be that £410 will not keep a good teacher from going over the Border.  That is one of the difficulties in our situation.  The best men in many walks of life will go out of the country, and I do not see how we can help it. The same thing can be said of the Civil Service.  It is said that for the higher ranks of the Civil Service we will not get the best men, as they will go to the British Civil Service, where they will have better prospects.  I do not think that would justify us in putting up the higher salaries to the British level. We have to hope that there will be a development of culture and nationality in the country that will make people prefer to serve in their own land, even if they do not get just all the advantages they would get abroad, rather than go abroad.  I see no prospects in many walks of life that opportunities for people can be provided here which can be provided in a rich neighbouring country.  It may be that certain people will do a little worse under the new scale than they did last year under the interim grant.  I do not think that they will do worse than they did in the years before last year under the interim grant.  That is an accident.  They have, at any rate, definite prospects now of going to a maximum which they would not reach before.  It is a common thing in the Government service, when a temporary clerk is established as permanent, that he gets an immediate drop in his salary.  I have known many men recently who were very glad to come off temporary work and to go on permanent work at a lower salary but with definite prospects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the principle of differentiation between men and women, I have already indicated in the Dáil that that is a matter which requires revision and consideration.  My own view is that, whatever a private employer may do, a Government cannot make a permanent practice of paying less to a woman as a woman, than what a man gets as a man.  My own opinion <Col N="617" /> is that this particular problem must be met by differential scales for married men with dependants, and for single women and single men who will get the same rates.  I think that men with families and dependants should get special scales, and that widows with children should also get suitable allowances. That, however, is a personal opinion.  The whole question involved in that point is being investigated.  Figures are being prepared with a view to getting information&mdash;especially with regard to the cost of any change that may take place, or that may be suggested.  Meantime, while the problem has not been dealt with, and while we have simply a rough rule to carry on with, we must have regard to what you might call market rates.  If you pay every secondary teacher&mdash;man and woman&mdash;the same scale, you will have your men teachers not at all as capable as women teachers. You will not get the same type of man to go in for the same salary, because men, equal to women in ability and willing to take that salary, will not remain in the profession of secondary teachers, or, if they do remain, they will remain in a state of perpetual irritation and discontent, because they could not find any other opening.  The principle of differentiation is a very rough principle.  It is not perfectly equitable, and it is liable to grave misrepresentation and misunderstanding, but the principle of differentiation which exists in this scale is all through Government employment.  It is in the Civil Service up and down, and, to some extent, it is in the national teachers' scales.  I believe that that principle and practice can only be regarded as a temporary expedient which will serve until some better principle can be worked out.  If you were to take any particular service and give a scale for men that would bring you a suitable type of man into that service and keep him there in some moderate state of contentment, and if you paid the same salaries to women as to men, you would be paying considerably more for women than the price at which you could get the most capable women to do the work.  That arises from the fact that under the present arrangement you have to make your scale for men suitable for men who are married and have dependants, <Col N="618" /> although many of them may not have dependants and may not require such a scale to live in a reasonable way.</P>
    <P>With regard to the placing of teachers with considerable service on the scale, we have to look at the question of the good of the service.  We are not doing too badly by any of the teachers in giving them this scale and these increments.  If we look at their conditions a few years ago, and if we do not have regard only to what I may call ideal conditions, I think it will be admitted that even teachers who come worst out of these arrangements are in a much better condition than they were in previously.  People who are in this particular profession are not going to leave it, especially people with long service, because they get a couple or three or four increments less than they might have got if the rules had been arranged in another way.  On the other hand, the arrangement in the rules to limit the number of increments teachers may get at the beginning, will not deter suitable candidates from entering the profession.  So far as that limitation is concerned, it will not operate against service.  I think, on the other hand, especially considering the financial state of the country, that it is not unfair to the individual.  They will be better off than there was any prospect of their being some little time ago, with certainly a better prospect than they had when they entered the profession. They did not enter the profession with the idea or prospect that they would be put on a permanent scale.  Some of them entered it as a stopgap employment, and for various reasons their position was most unsatisfactory in the past, and several of them drifted into it because nothing better offered, and while they did not intend to stay in that profession, they did so.  At all events, no prospect was held out to them that they would have such a scale of salaries and increments as it is suggested we should give to them on service.  If they have not got all they would like&mdash;and it would be hard to give them that&mdash;I think they certainly have got what are reasonably substantial advantages.  With regard to the basic salary, the amount that will be regarded as basic has not been definitely <Col N="619" /> fixed, but there is no reason to vary the indication already given by the Minister for Education in the discussion in which he spoke about the matter. I think that that may be regarded as the true statement of the position. It has not been definitely stated, because discussion is still proceeding upon it, what the amount of money will be that ought to be provided for the schools as distinct from the sum that will go actually to the teachers themselves.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of pensions, I think Deputy Thrift admitted that it was a big question, but I certainly was not blind to the fact that the question of pensions was sure to be pressed on us once the question of the provision of increments was settled.  I think we have gone as far as we can be expected to go at present.  As I said before, these people entered the profession at a time when their prospects were poor, and they cannot complain if that profession is not converted at one step into one with excellent prospects, and into a profession in every way equal to others where pension schemes and scales of salaries have been in operation for a very long time.  Deputy Thrift argued, I think, that though the Dáil was voting more money, the teachers would get less.  The teachers will not get less.</P>

      <P>I am not taking into account the overlap.  The money that is being provided now is provided for the year of which the first quarter ends on 31st October.  The interim grant was paid for some period prior to that. For this period we will provide a sum of about £92,500.  The sum that was actually spent in the previous period was £88,700.</P>
      <P>I want to refer now to the £100,000 that was mentioned.  The £100,000 was a rough figure, put down before the effect of the rules had been worked out.  That was suggested to the Dáil as the sum that would be required for the grants provided for by the rules, but the matter had not been sufficiently worked out and there was a margin. The fair sum for the Deputy to work upon is not that rough figure, which would not have been provided again if we had not had the increments, but the sum that the rules require to be expended. Suppose we had not brought in this particular scheme, the figure in the coming estimates would not be £100,000, but £88,700&mdash;the sum actually required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I need deal with the point which Deputy Magennis raised in regard to responsibility for proposals that are laid before the Dáil.  The responsibility is the responsibility of the Ministers concerned and can only be theirs.  As a matter of fact, it is quite wrong to suggest that officials in any Department can decide what the policy of the Government is to be.  A considerable amount of routine work is naturally done by officials.  No Minister wants to see that.  But every matter <Col N="621" /> of importance must be brought to the notice of the Minister.  Nothing is done in regard to policy in any Department without the full consent of the Minister.  It is a common thing in Departments for acts to be done by Ministers quite contrary to the advice of the permanent official.  It is the duty of the permanent official to give advice.  He is, in a sense, the expert. He has been, perhaps, a long time at the work.  He has given thought to it. It is his duty to advise the Minister in regard to all acts.  But the Minister may accept that advice or reject it, or he may accept it in part or reject it in part.</P>
      <P>As regard the suggestion that the Department of Finance can over-rule another Department, that is fallacious. The Department of Finance is responsible to the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance is a member of the Executive Council.  He cannot stand for any policy unless he gets the support of the Executive Council on it.  If he does not get the support of the Executive Council on any matter on which his Department may be challenged, there is no option for him but to modify his policy or go out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Magennis seems to suggest that it would be an ideal thing to provide grants for schools, irrespective of the varying numbers.  I do not think that that would be practicable.  I think you must lay down certain conditions. To prevent waste and to prevent scandal, you must lay down rules with a certain amount of rigidity.  It may be that the rigid regulation will be hurtful in a particular interest.  It is very difficult to find any regulation which is not inconvenient at times, but everybody dealing with expenditure of public money knows that if you have not rules you are forced into courses that are unjustifiable and that people take advantage of the loopholes that are given them.  It will not be suggested that the people who are concerned with the management of schools are different from any other class of people in the country.  I do not think it will be suggested that you can do without rules for the guidance of those administering this money any more than you can do without rules in respect <Col N="622" /> of any other class in the community.</P>
    <P>We realise that education is one of the great needs of the country.  I do not think that anybody in the position of a Minister can fail to be impressed with the need in the country for education of every sort.  Education that gives us special knowledge and special skill, education which leads to research, education that gives us a more intelligent public opinion, education that enables people to do their business more efficiently&mdash;all this is necessary. I have not any qualms about saying that the Government have not dealt in a niggardly way with the problem of education.  We realise that our resources are limited and that sudden increases in expenditure do not always give good returns.  In fact, I may say that sudden increases in expenditure give poor returns.  If you take a class of existing officials, and if you suddenly increase their salaries you do not get better work; you get the sort of work they are able to give.  You might, if you were recruiting anew, get better people for the service by offering increased salaries.  To the extent that you were recruiting, the increases might be justifiable and fruitful, but if you give increases to existing officials, or workers of any particular class, you will get no return from your extra expenditure. I think that principle of husbanding our resources and trying to get the best possible return for them is a principle that nobody can object to.  We are likely to have many further calls upon us in the matter of education&mdash;calls which I do not see can be resisted.  Even such a measure as the Compulsory School Attendance Act will involve charges.  That Act will not be held up a single moment by any consideration of the charge that will be imposed on the Exchequer by reason of its being passed.  We will not refrain from doing necessary things, and things that we see will give good results, because they will mean expenditure of money.  On the other hand, we do not wish to be rushed into expenditure without seeing precisely that a good return will come from it.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be too persistent, but I want to be quite <Col N="623" /> clear about one point, and I want the Dáil to be clear about it too.  Is it not a fact that the real figures for comparison in this Vote are those under this heading, &ldquo;Incremental Scales of Salary&rdquo;&mdash;apart from some other scheme which may or may not come before us in 12 months for basic salary &mdash;and what was voted last year?  And are not the proper figures for comparison, therefore, £92,000, under this scheme for secondary teachers in 12 months, as against a Vote of £100,000 previously, as an interim grant, or the actual sum demanded of nearly £89,000.</P>

      <P>The increase will be small in the first year.  It will be an increase from £88,700 to £92,500, but in each year the teachers will be getting their increments, and the falling of those increments in the Vote will lead to a rapid increase in that amount to, at least, £150,000.  The increase in the first year will be small.  It is the beginning of a slope, as it were.</P>

      <P>I would like, before this matter is finally decided, to press the Minister to reconsider favourably one point, to which I will confine my attention now&mdash;that is the question of the limitation of the number of increments which may be payable to 10.  The Minister has said that there is no use in this country, with its limited resources, trying to compete with a rich neighbour like England.  But surely no responsible Minister of the Saorstát will say that our resources are more limited in this respect than those of the Six-County area or more limited not alone in this respect but in respect of the whole question of education? The Six-County Parliament has gone very far beyond anything we have done, not alone in this matter of making provision for secondary teachers, but in so far as all branches of education are concerned.  I submit that that question of the limitation of our resources cannot possibly hold as far as the Six-County area is concerned. They have not done as well in the Six-County area as they have done in England or Scotland, but I think we should do at least as well as they have done in the North in regard to <Col N="624" /> this question of increments.  The increments are not as great here as in the North.  The basic salary, so far as I can gather from the suggested figure, will not be as great as it is in the North. To me, this limitation of the increments to ten, instead of allowing for the whole service and permitting teachers with 34 or 35 years' service to get the maximum, is the last straw.  The Minister has rather stressed the point that they ought to be glad to get what they are getting, that they came into the service not expecting so much. That is a principle that can be pushed very far.  I would prefer that the faith that these men had during the years of stress and hardship, that when their own Government would come they would receive that relief they had been looking forward to for many years, would not be disappointed.</P>
      <P>It is not the teachers alone that are concerned.  We must remember the actual work in the school during the years that these teachers have yet to serve.  It is but right that they should receive an incentive to work and to give of their best.  The Minister may say that by making a suitable scale you will get into the service well-qualified and contented people, and that it is not essential to treat those already in the service quite so well.  But you cannot simply wipe out all who are already in the service.  While the new people are coming in, the work of the school must go on.  I would really stress the point strongly, that the Minister should reconsider the limitation of the increments to ten, and that he should allow those teachers who have long service to go to the maximum of the scale on the basis of one increment for each two years' service actually given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Mr. ALTON Mr. ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to subscribe to Deputy O'Connell's plea, and I make another plea also.  Common gratitude demands that that plea should receive favourable consideration. Ingratitude is detestable in the individual.  It is more detestable in the State.  These are men who have laboures at a thankless job for very poor remuneration through a very hard lifetime, and you, by one blow of these rules, cut away twenty years of their services.  I do urge that this discrimination <Col N="625" /> of ten years' annual increments should be removed, and removed entirely if possible, and, if not, that the scale should be raised to at least twelve years, as it was under the Provisional Scheme.  I would like to impress that on the Minister with all the force that I can.</P>
      <P>Another plea I would make, not in the name of gratitude, but in the name of common justice, and that is on behalf of the women teachers.  It is not fair, it is absolutely inequitable, that they should lose one and all under this present scheme.  I do not see any way to gloss over that fact.  They were receiving poor enough salaries under the Interim Grant Scheme.  They will be receiving less now.  I do not see how they will be in the years to come any better off.  Their lot seems to be one without hope.  Something can be done for the male teachers in the future.  The younger ones will become more vigorous and they will agitate, and I can see that the scheme can be made into a feasible, practical working scheme.  The Minister estops us with the plea that we are a poor country and cannot afford to pay more.  I will take £4,400,000 as all that we can afford for education.  But I do urge that £200,000 (for that is the total sum that we at present are spending upon secondary education) is a very miserable fraction to spend on the most vital sphere of education.  I recommend that fact to the Minister's consideration, and I do press the Minister to fix this question of a basic salary and to fix the minimum to be paid as soon as possible. It is important from the teachers' point of view that that should be done. Such men have every right to know where they are and what their salary is to be.  Finally, I urge on the Minister not to postpone too long the question of the pension scheme.  This pension scheme, as put before us, is headless and tailless.  The basic salary is not fixed, and the natural corollary to such pension schemes is wanting.  I do press upon the Minister to repair these defects. I do not want to seem altogether thankless, because it is something to have such a scheme.  I do say that.  We have waited a long time for it, and I now press the Minister on these points.</P>

      <P>One great hardship under these rules I would like to ask the Minister to reconsider.  I will say that certainly the scheme gives some encouragement to secondary teachers. If it is not as generous as it was expected by us it should at least offer as good terms to our old teachers as the Northern Government has given to its teachers.  I would not expect, at all events, that we should ask for the same terms as they get in England.  One point I would urge on the Minister is that no teachers should suffer under this scheme.  I understand that a small number of teachers are suffering, and that they are to get less this year than last year.  That would be a great hardship on these teachers.  They had a right to expect an improvement of their status and of the profession as a whole, but by this they will suffer for a year or two.  I think that is a great hardship. I do not think that anyone in the Dáil would approve of that.  I think provision should be made in the scheme whereby no one should suffer under it and that no teacher should be poorer this year because of this scheme than he was last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge on the Minister very seriously to consider whether he could not at least raise that minimum ten to fifteen years.  The Minister has stressed that our last year's Vote of £100,000 is an Interim Grant merely, and that only £89,000 was called on.  I do not think he is entitled to assume from that that had the conditions worked as intended the full £100,000 would not have been called on this year.  I say that, because the rules were made rather late, and the schools had no knowledge of these rules at the beginning of the school year.  For that reason I think it is extremely probable that the whole £100,000 will be called on this year.  I could not state exactly what the additional cost to the State would be by increasing the minimum ten to fifteen years, but I should say that the total claims on the State for the twelve months would not bring the £92,000 up to the £100,000 which the Dáil voted last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further point I want to make is this: that at least the Minister should <Col N="627" /> assure the Dáil that the basic salary question will be settled at the earliest possible date and that it will be settled in such a way that it will be made applicable like the increment rate of salaries, so that it will be from the beginning of the current school year.  That is essential, and I daresay it involves an equally essential point, that payment to the schools will also be from the beginning of the current year.  I would press upon the Minister the necessity of the case and would urge that this is a piecemeal scheme and cannot be satisfactory unless he accompanies it with the basic scale which should apply from the beginning of the current year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a great deal of hesitation I rise to say anything on this matter.  In connection with the Supplementary Estimate it seems to me that the case for the secondary teachers is in very good hands.  We have heard from very authoritative sources about the grievances under which secondary teachers labour.  I would not for a moment minimise any claim secondary teachers may have for better conditions.  At the same time I think that Deputy O'Connell in introducing the matter mentioned that economy was the order of the day.  As an outsider as regards educational matters, I would like to emphasise that the great part of the community to-day are in a very difficult position on account of the very high taxes that are being imposed on the country, and that they have not the same advocacy, perhaps, as has been put forward in the case of secondary teachers.  With regard to the Supplementary Estimate before us one would imagine from what one has heard that it was a case of cutting down the estimate rather than increasing it, whereas the actual facts of the case are that the Minister has come before the Dáil and asked for an additional £30,000 for those teachers.  Under the conditions that rule at present one would have imagined that that would have been acknowledged as at least a contribution towards remedying the state of affairs which has been elaborated, if I might say so, by the different authorities on education.  It seems to <Col N="628" /> me that this has been put before the Dáil as a grievance rather than a palliative, and to that extent only I take exception to the criticism that has been levelled at the proposal of the Minister.  Occasion has been taken of this Supplementary Vote to go through many phases of the question of the remuneration of teachers, but ordinary commercial men must realise that we have not had any comparative figures with regard to what is done elsewhere, and more especially we have not had any figures or any information as to the relative efficiency of the various systems in the different countries.  I know that secondary education in Scotland costs, I think, £7 10s. per head, and in Ireland it is, roughly speaking, £7 10s. also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  In England the rate is, I think, somewhere about £10, but I cannot verify that now.  If that information is correct, that they are paying £7 10s. in Scotland and that we are paying the same here, the relative position of the two countries would seem to indicate that we as a taxpaying community are more heavily taxed in proportion to our means for the purpose of education than they are in Scotland.  It is, I think, very desirable that the standard of secondary teachers should be raised to the highest possible point.  As a business man I think none of us would take exception to a reasonable rate towards securing greater efficiency in connection with secondary education, or even in connection with primary education.  I do not think it will be found that any section of the business community would advocate any lowering of the standard, but would rather favour the raising of it.  It is a question as to whether the amount of money spent on our whole system gives as good results as we might expect for the money.  There may be a difference of opinion about that, but I submit that before any radical or drastic changes take place with regard to pension schemes, and so on, that the whole position should be reviewed, and that <Col N="629" /> whatever basis will ultimately emerge we should secure that the maximum benefit will accrue to the pupils attending the schools.  It is certainly very desirable to have pension schemes, and I have listened in the Dáil to very able advocacy of pensions for civil servants and others.  In the ordinary course of events a man who chooses an occupation or profession might have reasonably the same claim that he should get assistance in his old age.  In the commercial community that does not operate as a rule.  I have often thought, is it quite just that schemes of this sort should apply only in certain directions?  The question should be dealt with on broad lines.  Where bodies of men spend the greater portion of their lives in one occupation pension schemes for their benefit should be on a contributory basis where it can be done.  It is very desirable that people should be enabled to make provision for the time when they cannot ordinarily carry on their work.  It is a very big question.  Deputies have envisaged a better order of things in the future, and which we may all hope we are going towards, but at present I do not think that the country can stand any greater amount of taxation than they have to bear and I think any improvement must run more or less concurrently with the increased prosperity of the country.</P>

      <P>There is just one word I wish to say on this matter.  I think Deputy Hewat was referring to me when he was throwing scorn on the suggestion that pensions should be given to secondary teachers.  I would like to point out to him how uneconomic and how unbusiness-like it is not to provide pensions.  Of course, he speaks from the plain business point of view, but nearly two thousand years ago men were talking in the same kind of way.  A Roman satirist said that everybody wanted teaching, but that nobody wanted to pay for it.  You cannot get good teaching without paying for it, and, indeed, you can get very little of anything without paying for it. Apart from the life tragedy of seeing old men who deserve well of the State, men up to 60, 65 or 70 years of age <Col N="630" /> still teaching&mdash;because school managers are not quite so harsh as Ministers or as business Deputies and do not wish to fling these old men out on the road&mdash; it is bad for teaching that these old men should be kept on when they are past their work.  You are undermining salutary teaching when you subscribe to a scheme like that.  It is in the interests of teaching and in the interests of true economy that I am an advocate of pensions for secondary teachers.  I think it is a businesslike proposition, and in that respect I claim to represent business more than the Deputies who spoke as business representatives.</P>

      <P>I just wish to deal briefly with the words of wisdom which my friend, Deputy Hewat, has vouchsafed us.  He says that the whole position should be reviewed. Surely that sums up in one sentence the whole doctrine of education as enunciated by Deputy O'Connell and the rest of us who speak here time after time on behalf of educational progress. Has not the clock struck the hour for having the whole thing reviewed?  We were under the impression that after months and months of consultation between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Education, something was to come forth that would be the basis of the beginning of a great scheme that would serve the future hour and the future generation educationally.  And this is what we have to deal with: this is the product of their joint efforts.  I am delighted to have Deputy Hewat on our side.  The whole position, he said, should be reviewed.  He does not take up the cynical position of the Minister for Finance, who told us, with an affectation of callousness that I know does not belong to his true nature, that these teachers will not leave the service merely because these terms are so inequitable.  We all know that is the fact.  We all know, unfortunately, that the teacher who has been 35 years in a secondary school, even if he had belief in himself and even if the fire of ambition had not been damped down in him many years ago, could not turn to another profession.  He might, of course, begin to be a bookmaker and turn his ability to account in that line, but there is no other opening for him.</P>

It is very disappointing for me, as a supporter of the Government, to find that this is the best they can produce. Deputy Hewat, as a business man, lays down the doctrine which he seems to think is teachable and capable of being advocated only by business men, namely, that the load of taxation must be lessened, and that if this country is to make any headway the burden that business is expected to carry must be lightened.  Why, in the last Parliament, and in this, I, who am only a professor, and not in that high level of business men, enunciated that doctrine. Of course, at that time it was a heresy, it was the idle dream of the professor, who might very well have been better occupied.  But now that all the newspapers, with their leading articles and letters to the editor, are clamouring for a reduction of taxation, it is the true gospel, and business men come forward to propound it here and elsewhere.  But when those who thought that they had given some study to the matter pointed out that the history of every other country proved that business enterprise was deadened, that the expansion of business was impossible where taxation was too high, they were told that they were only professors and that it was only a professor that spoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education may enable a man to know something about public affairs as well as to be immersed in the counting house or engaged in the exploitation of companies. <Col N="632" /> I am not now referring to Deputy Hewat.  It is necessary to say that, as I began with a reference to business men and Deputy Hewat is well known in business circles in Dublin as a man of the highest credit and of the utmost integrity and as having no connection whatever with the exploitation of companies.  I said in my last speech that the same rule applies to the State as applies to the individual citizen.  A man must either increase his earnings or cut down his expenditure if he wants to escape from bankruptcy.  What has not occurred to business men is, how this State could increase its earnings without increasing its taxation, and though that may be embarking upon another subject, may I make a rapid and passing reference to it.  If the State were well advised in regard to either the future flotation of a company or a new development, and more particularly if the State is to give its countenance and aid, the State should be entitled to receive portion of these earnings when dividends are being distributed. In other words, the principle that applies in the case of deferred ordinary shares in a company should apply so that the State should be the holder of the deferred ordinary shares in all these companies, and when the proper rate of dividend has been given to the ordinary shareholder the remainder should flow back into the coffers of the community.  That is a way in which the State could get more money to spend upon its vital needs.</P>
    <P>Education is a vital need in Ireland. To tell us that the proportion that is expended in England is so much less than that already expended here is to ignore one of the great enveloping factors of the situation.  England is not building from the ground up.  England is carrying on a going concern that has been financed for centuries with rich endowments and with rich accumulations of money.  We are here struggling to make a beginning and to put things in order, and everyone who has experience of business affairs knows that in the initial stages you have high outlays to incur.  It is at this stage that the overhead charges are felt.  If we are seriously putting our hand now to the great task of constructing a new <Col N="633" /> Ireland we shall be blind to all the lessons of history if we do not begin with education as the very centre of reform. Education has been proved to be everything in the making of a nation and the country that is cheeseparing and grudging in its contribution to education is securing a very backward place for itself amongst the rest of the nations.</P>

      <P>With reference to the placing of teachers on a scale, I think we must not forget that however much Deputy Alton may talk about gratitude the State has no particular obligation to those people as individuals. There was no contract with the State. We have no interest in them except this that they are doing work which is of interest to us, and our expenditure on education should be the expenditure which is necessary to get better results, and I do not think we should allow feelings of gratitude, as has been suggested, to apply to those who entered upon private employment years ago to lead us to expend sums beyond those that are necessary to keep the service improved.  That is, roughly, I think, how we must look upon this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to people being worse off under the increment scheme than they were last year, I again suggest that that is not a fair comparison. Last year we gave a considerable increase in the interim grant as a purely temporary arrangement.  We did hope to have the increment scheme in operation a year ago.  Delays occurred, and as it was not possible to do anything we increased substantially the interim grants so as to fill the gap in some way.  We had no intention of keeping the interim grant at that level.  We had no intention of making a permanent arrangement that would involve an interim grant of something like £100,000.  The figure of the interim grant was, for a couple of years, £63,000.  If we are to compare how people will be under this scheme with the way in which they were before we ought to take the year when the <Col N="634" /> grant was £63,000.  I am not suggesting that we should go back to the £50,000 they had before we came, but take the £63,000, and I think it will be found that very few teachers are worse off than they were in the two years in which we gave £63,000.  At any rate, those with short service have prospects better than they had before.  I do not want to say anything that may seem to convey that the secondary teachers do not deserve consideration, but up to the present they have had no different contract with the State.  They were just in the same position as every other citizen.  They were employees of private institutions.  We are not really bound to consider their case more than we are bound to consider the case of an employee of the Tramway Co. or of the Railway Co.  Now a new position is being created.</P>

    <P>As will be seen by the Estimate, this additional sum is all practically accounted for under sub-head A.  This is a necessary estimate.  We are making an appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary.  I have indicated to the Dáil on many occasions that the Department of Finance is a Department in which a Parliamentary Secretary is urgently required. Many matters require what you might call Ministerial consideration, matters that cannot be determined or proceeded with by civil servants and matters which it is impossible for the Minister for Finance to find time to deal with, particularly in what may be called the outlying or sub-departments of the Ministry of Finance&mdash;the Board of Works and the Stationery Office, for instance.  I myself, since I have been Minister for Finance, find it impossible to do more than really decide some urgent matters that would be put up to me from time to time, but I found it impossible to give the consideration that should be given by somebody other than an official&mdash;somebody who would have a public point of view, and bring to bear upon this matter the particular sort of knowledge and the particular sort of interest that a representative of the people and a member of the Dáil would give.</P>
    <P>There has been an appointment of a Government stockbroker.  That appointment was made because we failed to reach agreements with the Stock Exchange in regard to an arrangement for a reduced commission on Government transactions.  Our idea had been that the Government stockbroker should do Government business at half the usual commission.  That arrangement could only be come to if the Stock Exchange would make a rule allowing it to be done.  They would not make such a rule but they allowed an arrangement whereby a salary might be paid to the individual in lieu of commission.  By fixing a salary instead of paying commission on transactions we estimate that there will be a substantial saving. An Assistant Secretary was appointed to that Department, and this officer takes the place of the British civil servant who was on loan.  This particular office was not provided for in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>There was at that time, when the original Estimates were framed, three British civil servants on loan in the Department.  They have gone, and their places have been taken by other officers of the Ministry of Finance or by officials brought in.  There was an officer brought in to do one section of the work.  The most substantial item of the sub-head is the Temporary Clerical Staff, that is, the Temporary Staff it was found necessary to employ in addition to what was provided for in the Estimates in order to deal with the work of Compensation.  As Deputies are aware from the number of questions asked, we have an enormous amount of work in the Compensation Section, and it was found that we had not made sufficient provision in the Estimates to enable the work to be done as expeditiously as we would like.  The allowances for temporary staff on loan from other Departments are partly due to that and to the fact that the British civil servants whom we had on loan were continued for a few months longer here than we had originally anticipated. I think the last of them left at the end of October.  The other items on the Estimate are small.  Item (d) is due to under-estimation.  The sum set down was arrived at after consultation with the Post Office, but it proved to be insufficient. <Col N="637" /> In sub-head (f) the amount required for telephones and telegrams is very small.</P>

      <P>It does, but in the case of some other officers there are allowances for instance where an officer is brought in to do a scale of work which would mean promotion. Pending his transfer he will be given an allowance, but his substantive salary will remain on the Vote of his original Department.  Some of those Staff Clerks set down under (a) are officers who were in a Department and their transfer was effected during the year in respect of the beginning of it.  It would be probably better to have allowed them to remain at their salary on the original Vote.</P>

      <P>I would like to be clear as to what the duties of the Parliamentary Secretary are.  From the explanation given by the Minister the term Parliamentary Secretary does not seem to apply very aptly.  I have no doubt whatever of the necessity for such an officer, but I would imagine that under that term at least he would be an officer who would relieve the Minister of certain obligations regarding his duties in Parliament.  Otherwise we might imagine that another official without such a title would be the person to be appointed.  I think the fact that an officer is called Parliamentary Secretary should suggest a more definite relationship with the Parliament than we have yet experienced.  I think it well to learn the mind of the Minister as to the particular relationship with the Dáil itself of the member of the Dáil appointed to this office.  The title suggests some relationship with the Parliament and we have yet to learn what is that relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The relationship with the Parliament is that he is a member of the Parliament.  I do not know that it is the best title, but it was put into the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  I think when that Act was going through that I stated that in dealing with certain work in my Department it was necessary that assistance should be given in this particular way.  What has been arranged at present is that while as Minister, I must in the ultimate result take responsibility for everything that is done, I do not deal with the ordinary work of the Board of Works or Stationery Office as I did in the past, or, rather, failed to do in the past.  The ordinary work that requires Ministerial sanction or direction is submitted to the Parliamentary Secretary.  Matters only come to me if I ask for them, or if the Parliamentary Secretary feels that they ought to come to me.  I am satisfied that he is as capable of giving as good a decision and direction as I can give, and I do not ask for matters to be submitted to me unless he cares.  It means that the Board of Works, which continued since the change of Government, much as it did before, is now brought into relationship with the Government.  It is work <Col N="639" /> of an entirely different nature from the work which is the main work of the Minister for Finance, which is Treasury and Revenue work.  I found it impossible really to give any detailed attention to any matter or to get any grasp of the work.  I was before this arrangement came, very much in the position the Chief Secretary was in, and I only signed papers as they were submitted to me.  Under this system there will be direct touch.  It might be a desirable thing if there were questions dealing with the Board of Works that they should be answered here by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pleasant to hear Deputy Johnson putting up again exactly the original criticism raised by him and by others when the Ministers and Secretaries Bill was before the Dáil.  The same point that he has now made was made then, but, I think, it has been a little previous, if I may so suggest.  At the time it was suggested <Col N="640" /> that the title &ldquo;Parliamentary Secretary&rdquo; was not accurate, as the relationship of the particular person to fill this particular post was not one directly in connection with the Dáil, but directly in connection with the Minister himself.  Therefore, if a title had to be chosen, the title would have been, not &ldquo;Parliamentary Secretary,&rdquo; but &ldquo;Assistant Minister.&rdquo;  Why, I think, Deputy Johnson was perhaps a little premature in the matter is, that when criticisms are made on any Bill in the Dáil, generally they are ultimately adopted by the Ministry and put into practice.  That has never yet occurred under two years, so that Deputy Johnson is just a year short.  Probably, in a few years time, it will be decided to call this person whose need has been demonstrated by the Minister for Finance by the title that would accurately define him and accurately describe his work, and that is Assistant Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is an opportunity the Minister might avail of to explain the difference between Commissions and Committees, leaving out bureaux.  One would imagine that the idea of a Commission would be to raise the status of the body that is enquiring into a particular subject, as contrasted with a Committee.  Certain Commissions have been set up and, no doubt, their duties will be to examine witnesses and enquire closely into the pros and cons of any proposals put before them, and make a report.  Following the usual course, I take it that there will be a nine to one chance that the reports of Commissions will be shelved and that the public will have the advantage of reading the report alone, because, contrary to the usual practice when setting up Commissions, there seems to have been an objection raised against reporting, and, presumably, publishing the evidence given before these Commissions.  I suggest it has been the experience&mdash;I do not intend to be cynical in this matter&mdash;that the chief value, probably, of matters of inquiry has been in the evidence adduced; the evidence being made <Col N="641" /> available for people interested and made the basis of future public education on public questions, and the advocates on one side or another using for the purpose of their advocacy the evidence that was submitted.  We have a right to assume that evidence submitted by responsible persons before a Commission will be evidence that will be carefully thought over.  Examination of witnesses, no doubt, proves whether they are responsible and competent to give evidence of an authoritative kind.</P>
      <P>I believe much of the value of Commissions of Inquiry would be, not in the report, but in the evidence submitted, and if this evidence is only to be made available for members of the Commission, it has lost, probably, three-fourths of its value.  I know the objection. It is one of cost; and, no doubt, the cost is very heavy.  But I think some arrangement should be made whereby the whole of the evidence, or a clear and carefully prepared summary of the evidence, could be submitted for consideration to the witnesses, to see if there was any misrepresentation of their views, and that it should then be made available.  Of course, it is true that much of the original evidence, or evidence given in cross-examination would lead to a great deal of padding and unnecessary printing, but in the absence of verbatim reports, I think it is desirable, if a Commission is going to be of any real value that the evidence submitted should be made available, as well as the reports of the Commission.  After all, it will be agreed, I think, in practice, that persons who give evidence on particular subjects are more likely to be able to give evidence based on experience, knowledge, study, and examination of the subject, than the Commission, even after it has heard all sides of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of a Commission is going to be a very narrow one if it is only going to bring out a report, and if the evidence submitted is not going to be available for the public.  I do not know what the intentions are with regard to the Liquor Commission, or whether there is to be any publication of evidence or not.  I suggest that the value of that Commission would be nil <Col N="642" />&mdash;certainly not more valuable as a Commission than if it were a privately setup Departmental Committee of the Ministry&mdash;unless the evidence is published.</P>
    <P>I understand that there has been a decision that the evidence of the Greater Dublin Commission shall not be published, and that they are trusting to the newspaper reports to educate the public.  That is rather a slender reliance, because it depends entirely upon the amount of interest in other subjects that are available for a particular day how much of the evidence will be published in the newspapers.  I would urge upon the Ministry the importance of considering this matter, and that with a view to the general education of the public in matters of political, social, and economic importance they should have the evidence available.  While there is going to be expense in the matter, I suggest that the cost is an essential part of the setting up of the Commission.</P>
    <P>In respect to the Boundary Commission we have a sub-head here of &ldquo;Fees to counsel, etc., £800&rdquo;; &ldquo;Refund to British Government of one-half of the estimated cost of the Boundary Commission,&rdquo; and the explanation is given:</P>
    <P>It has been agreed between the Government of Saorstát Eireann and the British Government that the salaries and expenses of the Chair man and staff of the Boundary Commission are to be divided equally between the two Governments.</P>
    <P>I wonder are we to take it from that agreement that there is an admission that the issue as to the Boundary is one between the Saorstát Government and the British Government.  Is that a reasonable and correct deduction from the terms in which this agreement has been made?  A good deal will depend upon that.  If the agreement between the British Government and the Saorstát Government is not that the issue is one as between these two Governments alone. and that the Northern Government has a say in the matter, then our share of the cost should not be one-half but rather one-third.  Perhaps we shall have some light thrown upon the work of the Boundary Commission, the negotiations that have taken place in <Col N="643" /> regard to it, and agreements that have been made in respect to the financing of it while this Vote is under discussion. I do not know whether it is reasonable to ask the Minister to tell us when he expects the Boundary Commission to conclude its labours.  Is this the final Vote?</P>

Can we expect that the Vote that will be brought forward in, say, a month's time, will be the final Vote, or will there be another Vote in 1926, or possibly 1927, so that all the queries that may arise or have arisen will be thoroughly threshed out and decided amicably, and there need be no more fear as to the settlement that the Commission will decide upon.  Seriously, I think we ought to have some indication of when this Commission is likely to conclude its labours.  Since the last discussion on this question the people have been very patient.  It may be that the Minister for Justice has satisfied the public  the best policy in respect to this is quietness, to raise no voice in the matter, to allow things to carry on in the hope that a settlement will come by slow growth, and everybody had better remain quiet and not raise any noise or fuss.  Possibly that advice of the Minister has been generally accepted. Certainly since Deputy Milroy left the House&mdash;ex-Deputy Milroy&mdash;nobody has had anything to say on this matter.</P>

      <P>I had intended to ask the Minister with regard to these points as to the Boundary Commission that Deputy Johnson has quite adequately covered except for one point which the Minister may throw some light upon.  If we are now incurring new expenses in regard to the Boundary Commission, what precisely is the value of continuing the function of the North-East Boundary Bureau?  Exactly how, administratively, are the two different bodies, one called a Bureau and the other called a Commission, situated?  I would have thought that a great deal of the work that hitherto has been carried on in connection with the Boundary Bureau would in future fall under the heading of the Boundary Commission and that a great deal of the work that has hitherto been necessary in connection with the Bureau would be dispensed with now the Commission has started its sittings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped rather that the Minister would be making some more extended reference than he did in regard to these various committees, commissions, bureaux and special inquiries.  But there is one that a statement from him would be valued in respect of, and that is &ldquo;L,&rdquo; the Commission of Inquiry into the preservation of the Gaedhealtacht. The information that has hitherto been available in connection with this very important Commission has been very slender.  When is it expected to start, has it started, and how long is it proposed that it should continue? Exactly what body will be the body to which it will make its reports, because I notice some of them will be dealing with linguistic matters, some with educational matters, and some with economic matters.  These are all various subjects upon which information might have been given to the Dáil.  The actual announcement regarding this commission was made while the Dáil was not sitting and appeared in the public Press.  I think if the Minister would take this opportunity to make a fuller statement than he yet has made in regard to the work that is going to be done by this body and the expenses that will be incurred by it, it would be <Col N="645" /> useful for Deputies in regard to that particular matter.</P>
    <P>I had intended also to have asked if we could have fuller information in regard to the Greater Dublin Commission, but I notice that the Greater Dublin Commission which was present a few minutes ago in the Dáil has now removed itself.  Perhaps the Minister would, in the absence of the Commission, give the Dáil some information as to when we might expect a report from this body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one sub-head amongst those Temporary Commissions that I think the Dáil should not pass.  It is sub-head <i>(i)</i>&mdash;Board of Assessors, Military Service Act, 1924. That Act was passed by the Dáil last summer, about June or July.  After it was passed about three months were wasted, and then this Board of Assessors was set up on the 4th October, as I observe in the footnote.  Now, that is about five months ago.  Since then this Board has conducted its operations in a manner that has given great dissatisfaction, and in a manner that has laid it open to the charge of very gross favouritism.  It has been conducted, in the opinion of a great many people, in a partisan spirit.</P>
      <P>There is one instance of which I am myself aware.  It is the case of late army officers whose certificates were handed in last November or December, and they have not yet heard anything in regard to their pensions.  Others, who had friends in court, and whose certificates were sent in only last February, have already been paid pensions. As far as my information goes, officers who disagreed with the Government have been given pensions, while others, who did not adopt that attitude and whose certificates were sent in many months ago, have not yet had their cases considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard it said that even people who fought against the State have been given pensions under this Act.  I do not know if that is true, but at any rate it is stated that those people have been given pensions.  There are others who actually fought for the State, who helped to establish it and who defended <Col N="646" /> it afterwards and because subsequently they resigned through disagreement with the Government policy, they have not so far got any pensions.  Possibly they will never get any pensions.  We are asked here to pay the salary of the Secretary of this Board of Assessors, which comes to nearly £1,000 a year. One would have thought when the Act was passed that an endeavour would have been made to see that this Board of Assessors would be strictly of an impartial character.  Yet the gentleman who was selected to be secretary&mdash;I have nothing whatever against him&mdash; was one of the central figures, one of the ringleaders in the vendetta which tore the army in two during the course of last year.  If he has not now to adjudicate on, at any rate he has to deal with, the pensions of his late rivals.</P>
    <P>I think this sub-head should not be passed by the Dáil.  I think it is highly unpleasant that civil servants, officials, or whatever they are, should in this way be allowed, by postponement or by some other means, if not actually to block the operation of this Act, at any rate to pervert its intention and to work it in a partisan spirit and a spirit of favouritism.  For that reason I propose that this sub-head be not passed.</P>

      <P>I should like to correct Deputy Esmonde's view of the work of this Board of Assessors.  It is not true to say that the work which they are doing is done in any partisan spirit, and the selection of the Secretary to this Board was made solely because of the more intimate knowledge possessed by this particular official than by any other person in Ireland.  No other person in Ireland was in possession of the same information as he had, and no person, I believe, would be done any injustice by this official in the discharge of his duties.  Even if he were inclined to be in any way partisan, the other two or three members of the Board of Assessors could be relied upon to maintain absolute impartiality in discharge of their very important duties.  Now, it so happens that not many cases have been passed by this Board of Assessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-day I got from the Minister for <Col N="647" /> Defence a return showing the number of cases dealt with.  The principal cause of the delay is that persons who were given as references by the applicants for pensions have not replied to communications sent them seeking information that is needed by the Board.  The work done by this Board has been done systematically and very thoroughly, and it is inevitable that there should be delay.  As a matter of fact, up to date something like 150 pensions only have been passed by the Board.  The Board of Assessors have had to go through various channels.  I have been speaking to one of the Assessors in connection with this matter, and I know that even if the Deputy himself were one of the members of the Board of Assessors, the administration of the Act by that Board could not have been more just.</P>
    <P>With regard to what Deputy Figgis and what Deputy Johnson said about the north-eastern boundary, I wonder what those Deputies would say if, let us say, they occupied the positions of the President and the Minister for Education&mdash;one being the President of the Executive Council and the other the person appointed by the Government of Saorstát Eireann as a member of the Boundary Commission&mdash;and they opened the paper some morning to find that while they were occupying those positions, the very question they raised here concerning this Boundary Commission had been raised in the British Parliament?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I, for one, have not done anything of the sort.  I was dealing purely with the administrative question; I was dealing solely with the function of the Oireachtas in regard to moneys as between the two bodies.  I was not dealing with the duties of the Boundary Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Boundary Commission's work and the expenses incidental to its work have been brought into existence by reason of an agreement between Saorstát Eireann and the British Government.  I suppose that will not be denied?</P>

      <P>That is very good.  Those two parties agreed to the setting up of this particular body, and it is those two parties who will apportion between them the cost incidental to the administration of the work.  I myself would consider it rather an impertinence to ask that body, even if the two parties were agreed on asking them, how soon this particular operation they are engaged in would be likely to finish.  I do not think it would be good business to do it.  I do not think anybody should raise the question.  Suppose, for instance, a case were going on in court and was lasting over a week.  I would like Deputies to realise what the position would be if a member of the Dáil asked the Minister for Justice how long the case was going to go on in court and if he could not see his way to have it expedited.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy Figgis was probably with regard to the North-East Bureau.  That is work incidental to the Commission which must be brought before the Boundary Commission on behalf of those anxious to be brought into the area of jurisdiction of Saorstát Eireann. It justifies itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the heading Boundary Commission we have an item of £800 for fees to counsel.  The brief for counsel, whom we have quite rightly appointed, will be prepared from information at the disposal of the Boundary Bureau.  Why, then, divide it into two heads, when it ought to be put under one head, in order to get more quickly at the expense of the tribunal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that the Deputy was rather aesthetic in the presentation of accounts.  That would be a nice hotch-potch arrangement&mdash;to include within the term, &ldquo;Boundary Commission,&rdquo; the costs incidental to the preparation of statistics and other matters required.  This is information that has got to be acquired, and the expense of counsel and other expenses of that sort is quite naturally put in a <Col N="649" /> compartment by itself.  It ought not to be mixed up with the items which appeared in our estimates before, and which would not be proper to include under the heading, &ldquo;Boundary Commission.&rdquo; As regards the larger question raised by Deputy Johnson, I am not altogether in agreement with him that very great public service can be rendered by the publication of evidence. I remember on one occasion reading the evidence taken at a housing inquiry in Dublin.  It was published in the form of a Blue-Book, and there was closely printed matter probably an inch deep. I think that, outside myself and the members of the Commission, nobody else read it.  I think that, in order to get an exact picture of evidence given, it would be necessary to read the whole of the evidence presented at any commission of inquiry.  To take out one particular individual, or range of individuals, and to read that evidence only, and close one's eyes to the evidence given by other parties&mdash;perhaps not in agreement with them, or perhaps in agreement to some extent with them&mdash; does not give a really true picture. There are people to whom the whole of the evidence is a matter of vital consideration, and these are the people engaged in compiling the report.  Reading through evidence of that sort is rather wearisome, but, as I have said, it is essential, to form a correct judgement. It is certainly necessary to read it if one is going to analyse the report issued in connection with it.</P>
      <P>Personally, I am not satisfied that there is a case made for the publication of evidence.  I recollect in the particular case in question that the index, which was otherwise very accurate, had omitted one particular item, and I had to inform counsel employed by one side in what part of the evidence he would find the information he was looking for. Even in that case, where counsel was employed in connection with an inquiry on which this previous inquiry had a bearing, the evidence was so exhaustive and took such a considerable time to read. counsel was not able to recollect in what part of the report the precise information looked for was to be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Gaeltacht Commission, it opened its first session this <Col N="650" /> morning at 11 o'clock.  I think Deputies, generally, will not be inclined to criticise either the length of its sittings or the length of time it will take to make up its report if that report be a good one.  We are satisfied from the personnel of the Commission that the report will be a good one.  If unusual time be absorbed in doing its work, anybody who has any experience of that subject must realise that if the wisest men in the world were placed on that Commission, with the best intentions, it would take probably some generations to solve all the problems connected with the Gaeltacht and to get from it for the rest of the country the advantages which ought to be derived.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not intend the Deputy to draw any such incorrect conclusion from what I said. Having got the report and the solution from it, I would advise patience in its working out, and, even if it be the best report possible, it will take a long time to effect the real purpose which the Commission has in mind, the preservation of the language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a word on the Boundary Commission from quite a different point of view to that touched upon by previous speakers.  I think we all realise that the work of this Commission is work of very great importance, and also that it is work which will take a considerable amount of time.  That being so, I think it is exceedingly unfair that our representative on that Commission should also have to carry the many responsibilities of the Minister for Education.  I seriously suggest to the Executive Council, through the Ministers present, that that particular aspect of the question ought to have their attention, because I feel it is detrimental to the work of the Boundary Commission that our representative there should have to carry burthens other than the difficult burthen which he has to bear in his capacity as our representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied from every point of view that it is exceedingly bad for the <Col N="651" /> education of the country at this particular crisis that it is without a head. We had an example of that here this afternoon.  We were considering important matters in connection with education, questions of policy, and other things on the Vote taken to-day. Yet we had to keep silent on some of these questions, because the responsible Minister was not present, and there was nobody here to speak on his behalf. That, to my mind, is an exceedingly unfortunate state of affairs.  We have been pressing for improved measures in connection with some aspects of education&mdash;school attendance and others. We had several promises from the Minister that Bills would reach us in the past session, but these Bills never reached the Dáil and, so far as I see, there is very little likelihood of these important measures being brought before the Dáil this session.  That is not as it should be.  I urge that no more important matter should engage the attention of this House at present than the question of educational policy. That seems to me to be the one question of which one never hears.  I hope the Ministry, or the Executive Council, will consider this aspect of the question and free the present Minister for Education from his other responsibilities, while he has to discharge the very important work which he is at present discharging as our representative on the Boundary Commission.  I hope that somebody will be appointed who will be able to give information to the Dáil and discuss these important questions which arise on educational policy.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I would like to raise.  It is in regard to (e)&mdash;the second Vote on the list that has been supplied to us.  It deals with the Winding-Up Commission in connection with the Dáil Eireann Courts.  We have recently been dealing with questions affecting judges who presided over those courts.  Does this Vote include any portion of the pensions or salaries of the judges who acted in connection with those courts?  Apparently the original Vote was for a period of six months.  To run this Commission for the first six months of the year required <Col N="652" /> £5,982.  Deputies will see, in the detailed information supplied that it was the intention when the Vote was passed that this Commission should have its work completed by September.  It has now been found necessary to carry on the work of the Commission until the end of the financial year&mdash;that is, for a further period of six months.  While it cost £5,982 to carry on the work of the Commission for the first six months of the year, it is to carry on its labours for the other six months at a cost of £1,668.  I take it there has been some very considerable reduction in the staff and in the amount of work. That being so, how comes it that the travelling expenses for the first six months amounted only to £750, and for a smaller staff for the second six months they amount to £730?  I would like an explanation from the Minister on that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>A large number of the points raised have been dealt with by the President.  Up to the present we have not been very clear as to the difference between a Commission and a Committee.  Quite recently, in discussing the Liquor Commission, it was suggested that for the future we should confine the use of the term &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; to a body which would sit and hear its evidence in public and that a body which heard its evidence in private should be called a Committee.  It is intended that the Liquor Commission shall sit and hear evidence in public. I agree that there are special cases in which it would be worth publishing the minutes of evidence in their entirety, but those cases would be few.  If a body sits in public, you will get a moderately-fair summary of the most important evidence in the newspapers. Typescript reports of the evidence will have to be prepared for members of the Commission, and I think it would suffice, in most cases, if some of those typescript copies of the evidence were deposited in, say, the National Library, where they might be consulted by any interested member of the public, who would get a clue to the evidence from the newspaper reports, or from inquiries he might make, or from references in the report of the Commission itself.  To make available typescript <Col N="653" /> copies of the evidence, would be a middle course between printing the entire evidence and having no official report available at all.  In a great many cases I think the typescript would suffice.  I would agree with Deputy Johnson that there are cases where the issues would be so important that even though a small number of people might read the report, it would be of value to have it available for consideration and to have it on record.</P>

      <P>In view of what the Minister has said as to the difference between &ldquo;commission&rdquo; and &ldquo;committee,&rdquo; are we to take it that the Old Age Pension Commission, which is described as a &ldquo;Committee&rdquo; here on the Estimates, will not hear the evidence in public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no intention that that body should hear evidence in public.  I think very few people would be able to conduct that inquiry in public without giving way to the natural inclination to make political capital out of the inquiry and to play up to a certain audience.  I think that is the sort of inquiry which can be more properly conducted in private than in public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that this body was set up as a Commission?  The invitations which the members received are invitations from the &ldquo;Secretary of the Old Age Pensions Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I said it was only in the past few days that there had been any discussion, to my knowledge, of the distinction between &ldquo;Committee&rdquo; and &ldquo;Commission,&rdquo; and the suggestion was made that for the future the name &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; should be confined to a body sitting and hearing evidence in public, and that the name &ldquo;`Committee&rdquo; should be given to a body sitting and hearing evidence in private.  That would not apply to the past, since in the past we simply slung names on to these bodies by chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that a Committee or Commission, which is dealing with a problem which <Col N="654" /> affects a large number of people and which creates a large amount of feeling in the country, will be helped in the good work it is hoped it will do if it is prevented from having public sittings, should the members of the body think it is desirable to have such sittings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say that I do not agree with the Deputy.  I do not think I need supplement what the President said about the North-Eastern Boundary Bureau.  The Bureau has to do with the collection and preparation of evidence and matters that are not within the purview of the Boundary Commission, which is itself a Judicial Tribunal.  Deputy Johnson asked whether the issue was between the British and the Saorstát Governments. At any rate, the Treaty is between the British Government and ourselves, and the duty of carrying out the Treaty lies between the British Government and ourselves.  There are only two Governments really participating in the Commission. The Northern Government refused to participate, and it was felt that as this is an international tribunal, we ought pay our full share, as one of the participating Governments.</P>
      <P>The Gaeltacht Commission will report to the Executive Council.  I think that appears in the Terms of Reference.</P>
      <P>I might supplement slightly what the President said with regard to the Board of Assessors.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I do know that the Board of Assessors have granted, or recommended, certificates to people who resigned last March.  So that the charge that the Board of Assessors was pursuing a vendetta against anybody or that they were discriminating against anybody is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. OSMOND ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I did want to say that certain applications were sent in for pensions, and that applications that came in long after them from others who were not concerned in the events of last March, have been dealt with, and that not a single officer who resigned because of his disapproval of Government policy has been paid a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know who <Col N="655" /> resigned because of his disapproval of Government policy.  I do not want to go into the question of why they resigned. No good can come of pursuing that now.  As a matter of fact, I do know myself one officer who resigned last March and who has got a pension.  I have seen his papers and I know he has got a pension.  I do not want to mention his name.  There might be others who have also got pensions.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Winding-Up Commission, I think there were at one time four Commissioners working.  Now there is only one.  The number has been reduced.  The amount that occurs in the Vote in the matter of travelling expenses does not necessarily relate to this later period.  I cannot say definitely at the moment.  It may be that if the Commission had ended on the 30th September as originally intended, there might be some deficiency in expenses and something might have to be taken out.  Perhaps there might be a saving in salaries that would enable the travelling expenses to be paid.  I do not think that the extra money, apart from travelling expenses, relates entirely to the second period.  As to whether the pensions proposed to be given to the Dáil Eíreann Supreme Court Judges are included in this amount, I would say that one of the judges of the Dáil Eíreann Supreme Court was for a time one of these Commissioners. He is the only one who can be regarded as very likely to get a pension under the Bill.  There is another possibly.  The only one who is likely to get a pension under this Pensions Bill was for a time a member of the Commission, and for the time he was a member of the Commission no pension will be payable.  The pension will be included in the salary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just say with reference to that, that it is only very recently that the Minister for <Col N="656" /> Education has had to go so much away to deal with the working of the Boundary Commission.  Certain papers and documents have been coming along for some time, but it is only recently that the Minister has been much away.  I do not antncipate that the sittings of the Boundary Commission will extend for a very long period.  The type of evidence that will be given can be given within a very short period. Any Minister might be absent from his post for a time, and the work of the Government would have to be carried on and the administration of his department would have to be carried on.  I was absent, the President was absent, and I remember the Minister for Lands and Agriculture was absent.  Various Ministers have fallen ill and been absent for a period of a month or two, and their departments have carried on. I think we must look upon this absence of the Minister for Education in much the same light as we would look upon a short temporary absence which causes a certain amount of inconvenience, but which is not worse than the inconvenience that would occur if the Minister got ill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>While the other Ministers were away the work of their departments was done by others, but it is not so in the case of the Minister for Education.  I need only remind the Minister for Finance that we were actually promised a Bill by the Minister for Education.  He promised us a Bill last session which never appeared. This session we have not seen the Bill and we have scarcely seen the Minister himself.  I want some enquiry into this matter.  Education, as I have said, and, as I think, the Deputies agree, has not got its due measure of attention, and I want to have enquiries made by the Executive Council to find out whether the demands on the Minister in the future are likely to be large, and, if so, whether they could not make some arrangement whereby the important duties of that department will be carried on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister for Education has been absent more than seven or eight days on the work of the Boundary Commission. <Col N="657" /> It is not the same as if he had gone away for some time and been absent continuously for a long period. He has made occasional trips to London that have only lasted two or three days. With regard to the Bill for compulsory attendance of school children, I want to say that the work of the Boundary Commission has nothing to do with delaying that Bill.  That is a Bill which involves not only the Ministry of Education but Local Government and the Department of Justice.  The proposed suggestions of using the Gárda Síochána for the carrying out of the duties under that Bill may have caused difficulties as to the giving of a decision as to the exact form the Bill should take and as to the exact machinery that should be set up to carry it out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want just to state a point of view regarding the question raised by Deputy Esmonde.  I think that there has been tactlessness in the appointment of the Secretary of this Board of Assessors.  I do not attribute, nor have I the slightest thought that there is, any prejudice arising against any of the claimants through the personality of the Secretary.  But we must bear in mind incidents which led up to the change in the Secretary's position. A certain number of the officers of the Army resigned.  A certain number of other officers were, in fact, dismissed. The two sides had a quarrel.  A large number of other officers were implicated in that quarrel.  Many of them were demobilised afterwards, and many of them resigned.  I do not know whether there are going to be any grievances or not.  It would be strange to hear of a Board of Assessors that did not create grievances.  But knowing that surely it was certainly an undesirable thing to appoint as chief officer of that board, as secretary of that board, one of the men who was a party to that controversy and one of the men who was called upon to resign.  As a matter of fact, he was practically dismissed. If there is dissatisfaction with regard to the assessors, whether there is occasion for it or not, and whether there is justice in it or not, it is as certain as anything can be that these charges of prejudice will be due to the appointment as secretary of one who <Col N="658" /> was an old-time comrade, but a recenttime enemy.  On that ground alone it seems to me that there has been a lack of tactfulness in the selection of the secretary, notwithstanding the fact that he might be, as the President truly said, the one man above all others for the position.  He might know the records of the careers and the facts regarding the services of the people applying for pensions.  That would be true in ordinary circumstances, but one might ask was he the right man for the place in view of the circumstances surrounding the resignations, surrounding the quarrels that occurred, being, as he was, a party who was so closely implicated in that quarrel.

      <P>Certain certificates were made out, and certain pensions forwarded for sanction to the Department of Finance.  The great majority of those have been sanctioned and got through.  A certain small number of the others have been held up for consideration by the Executive Council. These relate to a certain number of men who went out last March, but about whose present good behaviour, looking at it from the point of view of the State, the Executive Council is not satisfied.  Deputies will remember that before Christmas certain action had to be taken by the Executive Council, because they discovered that an attempt was being made to set up new trouble in the army&mdash;to organise a conspiracy. Certain officers, non-commissioned officers and men were removed from the army.  Our information was that certain of those officers who resigned last March were connected with that, and in consequence a small number of pensions&mdash;four or five&mdash;that had gone through the preliminary stages, have been held up for consideration by the Executive Council.  That consideration has not yet been given to them.  Of the other officers who resigned last March, I know the name of one, but I believe there are more than one, about whose conduct since there has been no ground for complaint, and who, in the words of Deputy McGrath, has quit, and his pension <Col N="659" /> went through.  We understood these men were quitting then, and as a result they got demobilisation pay, and supplemental grants.  It appeared to us, from information which was good and perfectly sound, and it was carefully examined, that a certain number had not quit, and were still acting in a way that was not right.  It was not considered that men like these should get their pensions as a matter of course, and have money to go on and be active against the State.  It was decided, therefore, that their pensions should be held up at the last stage before they would be paid, that is the stage of financial sanction, with a view to having them examined by the Executive Council.</P>

I have heard complaints that men who have given very good service to the Government, and had actually suffered wounds in giving that service, but who unhappily were mixed up in the events that took place last March have not been paid pensions, while other men who fought against the Government have been paid pensions.  I cannot say whether that is correct or not.  I am merely mentioning a matter of hearsay, but I would be anxious to know that these men should not be in any worse position if the Executive Council eventually decided to pay their pensions by reason of the time that these pensions were held in suspense.</P>

I would mention the case of Dan Breen, who was given a pension&mdash;I do not know whether he actively fought against the State, but he was associated with those who did.

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice last evening that I would raise, on the motion for the adjournment, the question of the growing distress in the County Clare, and the prospect of that distress becoming more acute as time goes on.  Because of the infrequent sittings of the Dáil, I felt that this was a matter that should be taken in hands at the earliest possible moment.  For a number of years conditions in the County Clare have been going from bad to worse.  They are largely climatic, political and economic, and they are so inter-related that they have brought about a very serious position indeed in the county.  As everyone knows, last year was a very wet season.  Over large areas of the county the land became water-logged.  That favoured the development of the fluke parasite, with the result that very serious losses have been entailed amongst the live stock of the county, especially amongst yearlings and two year old cattle.  The position in West Clare, which is the poorest part of the county, is very bad indeed.  All parts of the county have, to a more or less degree, suffered, but, relatively speaking, the conditions in West Clare are worse than in any other part of the county.  West Clare is the impoverished district of the county.  The holdings all over the county are, on the average, small, but they are unusually small in West Clare.  The land there is poor, mostly bog or marsh, and the unfortunate people who reside in that area have the greatest difficulty in eking out a living.  Notwithstanding all that, they are compelled, through force of circumstances, to pay the highest possible rates for their land and to receive the poorest possible services. In addition they have to pay the highest possible charges for the necessaries of life, and their means of production are very low.  Even at the best of times there is only a small margin <Col N="663" /> between them and starvation, but after the series of disastrous seasons that we have had, their position at the moment is really deplorable.  Large numbers of their live stock have died.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to high taxation, especially local taxation, during the last four or five years, for which the present Minister for Finance in his then capacity as Minister for Local Government, is in no small measure to blame, these people are without funds and without ready money to repair the ravages caused by fluke.  The question now is, how are we going to serve these wretched people?  Various remedies have been suggested.  The question of a moratorium has been mooted.  That would be a very difficult matter to deal with, involving as it does many problems, and, on the whole, I do not think it would provide a suitable solution. I suggest that we ought to endeavour to get to the root of the difficulty, which is the high rate of taxation that obtains.  The local taxation which prevails in this district amounts to something like 15/- in the pound.  It is that that is condemning these people to a hopeless and a helpless servitude, and nothing has been done to relieve them from the burden.  I appreciate the good intentions of the present Minister for Local Government.  It is true that we are getting a little temporary relief through the Relief Rates Act, but despite that a very heavy burden remains on the farmers, and no serious attempt at internal economy has been made.  I put it to the Minister for Agriculture and to the Minister for Local Government, who, I am sorry to observe, is not in his place, that these people have lost a great part of their live stock through the fact that they had no capital to enable them to purchase a little concentrated food to keep the animals alive.  The question must be faced at once, that these people are no longer able to meet the inflated taxation which is demanded from them.  It is true, of course, that if they do not pay, you can put the machinery of the law in force against them, and that you can seize the few old cows they may have.  In most cases you will not get any more than 30/- for these beasts. <Col N="664" /> The only thing valuable about them is their hides.  If you put these people out of business you condemn them to hopeless and perpetual poverty.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this distress should engage not only the serious attention of the members of the Executive Council but also that of the External Ministers concerned, the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Agriculture. It is necessary, I suggest, that the land should be drained.  This land is infected with the fluke parasite, and until it is drained the people who own it, even if they had the money, would be running a great risk if they were to put fresh stock on it.  In addition to the wet season that we had last year, there has been what we might call a great deal of intensive flooding of the land in that area due to the extraordinarily large number of bridges that were blown down during the last five years.  The stones from these bridges were left in the bed of the stream, and in a case where temporary repairs were carried out at Corofin, of which I have experience myself, the County Council employees who were engaged on the temporary structure, instead of removing the stones out of the bed of the river, left them there.  I suppose that from 20 to 30 acres of land in the vicinity of that bridge were so badly flooded that it was rendered absolutely unsafe for cattle or sheep to graze on it.  I want to put it straight to the Dáil that I am not seeking for charity for these people.  As a matter of fact, if I were to put the question right, I would simply say that I was demanding reparation. I repeat that I am not seeking for charity.  I do not want anything from the Ministry that would demoralise these people or that would lower their self-respect.</P>
    <P>The real question is how best to maintain the public solvency on which the stability of both county and national administration depend.  You can do a great deal by the provision of state rules, but you cannot do everything. But I would suggest if it was possible to adopt some means of liming the land, which is a radical cure for those large areas.  Then get the county council to clean the beds of the rivers, blocked up with the debris from the broken and <Col N="665" /> destroyed bridges.  If you do that you will do something.  In addition to that, compel the local councils to reduce expenditure, and, if needs be, take statutory authority by which they cannot exceed a certain estimate for the coming 12 months.  You will then have done something, perhaps only a little, but, at all events, something to prevent people from falling not alone into absolute despair, but into actual destitution.</P>

      <P>The county of Clare is not in a good condition, but the same applies to most other counties in Ireland.  The country as a whole is not as prosperous as it was three or four years ago.  On the other hand, Clare is better than some of the counties, though it is worse than others. It is better, for instance, than the counties within the congested districts. There is not the same poverty in Clare as in Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan, parts of Monaghan, Roscommon, the Connemara portions of Galway, Kerry, or parts of West Cork.  That is the plain fact.  It is a comparative matter.  The potatoes have not failed in Clare, except in small proportions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been failure in parts of the rural districts&mdash;Corofin, Ballyvaughan, and Ennistymon, and that is hardly West Clare.  In West Clare there has been a certain failure. But the turf has been saved fairly well in Clare as a whole, and very much better than in 75 per cent. of the other counties in Ireland.  The standard of living in Clare is of a sort that is far higher than in the counties I have mentioned. Everyone concentrates upon his own particular area.  But it is a comparative matter, and it is necessary to remember that to get a true perspective. The Deputy suggests that the rates are high and that the County Councils, for instance, do not work properly in respect of the bridges.  He complained that there are stones lying in the rivers, and he talks about draining <Col N="666" /> and liming the land.  You could go through a lot of those questions, but leaving the rates out of the question for the moment these projects and propositions that he put forward and which he said the Government should take in hands, cannot be undertaken without more money and more taxation. It will be interesting to hear what the Deputy will have to say on the Budget upon those matters.  He suggested a relief scheme, but it is due to the country to be told by others than those sitting on the Government benches that relief means more taxation and more money.  It is due to the country to be told that by people besides those belonging to the Cumann na nGaedheal party and those on the Government benches.  In saying that I do not suggest for a moment that something should not be done; but in regard to the provisions he suggested, such as liming and drainage, he will admit that liming is not relief&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No; I believe not.  You are generally dead when the quicklime is put in.  Liming is not relief, and the same applies to drainage.  Besides. drainage cannot be done in a hurry.  It would take five, six, or seven years to make a real inroad into the drainage problem; so when he suggests that Clare or any other part of the country should be drained as a palliative for immediate distress the Deputy makes a suggestion which leads nowhere.  The question of drainage is a very big thing in this country; it will take a lot of money, which probably will have to be borrowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now with regard to rates, the Deputy has told us that a real grievance in Clare is that the rates are very high. He comes here to the Dáil and actually tells the Government that the rates in Clare are too high.  If the rates in Clare are too high, whose fault is it? Some people will say we have not had elections recently.  They are entitled to any point they can make on that score, but nevertheless the people of Clare elected the representatives on the county council and apparently have not <Col N="667" /> the real interests of the people of Clare at heart.</P>

      <P>That is the people's look-out&mdash;the people who elected them.  We will see what will happen at the next election.  I am sure there is going to be a tremendous revolution in the Clare County Council.  All the Government has to do is to make arrangements for the elections, and then nobody but representatives of the people will get into the County Council of Clare, and when they do they will remove all the grievances of which the Deputy so rightly complains.  Now these are the facts: the county council strikes high rates.  Every county council in Ireland, we are told, is doing something in a most shameful fashion.  In Clare the county council employees will not remove the stones from the bed of the streams.  In a case of this kind would not the farmers stretch a point and remove those stones themselves?</P>

      <P>Yes, and the road workers. It is the duty of the county council to do it, but if the obstruction caused by these stones is resulting in so much distress as the Deputy says, I suggest that a few farmers should join up together and remove these stones from the bed of the river.  On the question of drainage we have nearly reached a point which should gladden the heart of Deputy Johnson, who looks to a system of State socialism.  Everything is to be done by the State.  Every drain is to be cleared by the State, and everyone is to preach that doctrine.</P>

      <P>I do not except Deputy Johnson.  He started on those lines, but being a wise man he allowed the other man to go ahead.  That is the position we are coming to.  The Government must do everything.  Ninety-five <Col N="668" /> per cent. of the persons making that claim know that it is not a business one.  If the Government do half what they are being asked to do they must make available larger revenue and therefore increase taxation.  Then this money will be spent more wastefully than it would be under private enterprise. The Deputy is a member of the county council, and he can ventilate that in Clare.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a good many ways of ventilating that in Clare.  At the next election you should put in men who will administer local taxation as it should be administered, but it is absurd to come here and blame the former Minister for Local Government.  The country is on trial at the present moment not only in regard to its fitness for self-government but in regard to its fitness for local government. That is the cold fact.  The abuses mentioned by Deputy Hogan are common in those counties, but it is not the business of the Government to send down their representatives to run the local councils.  Where they do that it is an admission of the fact that those councils are not able to do their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may get up and ask questions with regard to the fluke.  It is a serious matter for the farmers not only in this country, but in England, Scotland and Wales.  It can be cured as easily as influenza by a medicine known as Extract of Male Fern.  The difficulty is to get that medicine with the active principle in it.  You can get consignments of medicine which will cure because the active principle is there, but other consignments will not do because the active principle is not in them.  Experts tell me that the explanation is that the stalk has to be collected at a special time.  We realise here that spraying land is a large proposition for men who considered they had enough to do to spray their potatoes. The Department of Agriculture endeavoured to get large quantities of this medicine three months ago and to test it.  No one knew last year that fluke would be as bad as it is, and the <Col N="669" /> normal supply of this medicine is small. We tested the consignments we got. Some were all right and some all wrong.  Finally we got considerable quantities of that medicine from France, and it is on sale by a firm here at the rate of 3d. per sheep or 5d. per beast.  Every consignment that goes out is tested and it will cure fluke unless the animal is on its last legs or unless the liver is so haemorrhaged that nothing will cure it.  So far as I know, all farmers are taking advantage of this medicine.  I agree with the Deputy that before that scheme could be put into operation a large number of sheep and cattle died, and that is due to the fact that not only had they contracted fluke but they were in bad condition owing to the bad season.  I am not going into the question of poverty or bad farming.  In some cases probably it was one, and in some cases it was the other.  That terrible epidemic might become worse but the medicine is available to the people at 3d. per sheep or 4d. or 5d. per bullock, and if it is not availed of it is not our fault.  Clare wants lime and so does Kerry, and we have been experimenting on this question of lime.  Lime is no good to a farmer unless he gets it at £1 a ton. Basic slag is at a price which makes it as available as lime would be if got at the price we suggest, namely £1 per ton.  Lime for counties like Kerry, with rough, heathery land, is needed badly for tillage and reclamation. It is not so badly needed in Clare.  Lime at £2 a ton is no good to the farmer.  We turned our attention to ground lime.  It was a success in England and America, but no use to us. English limestone is soft and Irish limestone is hard, and the machine that will be effective in England with regard to chalk is not effective with regard to Irish limestone.  I have come to the conclusion that it will be difficult to get a machine to turn out ground limestone at a price to make it as available as burned lime.  Our experiments have shown that there is not much success in that direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has missed the main point the Deputy was making, that is, that a considerable <Col N="670" /> number of the farmers in Clare and Kerry have lost a considerable percentage of calves.  Those people made a point of feeding their calves well, and yet the calves have died of fluke.  They have died during the wet season.  I think what the Deputy wants to draw attention to is what can be done for the people who have suffered those losses.  Personally I see nothing facing them but absolute ruin.  That is the position we want to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point which I do not think the Deputy raised, but it is a relevant one.  I did not say that those cattle died of hunger.  What I did say is that some of them died because of fluke, and were not well fed.  Others died of fluke simply, and others died of &ldquo;T.B.&rdquo;  All those reasons were connected with the bad season, shortage of fodder and so on.  A considerable number of animals died because farmers did not treat them as they should. Undoubtedly, in Clare, as in Galway and everywhere else, there are a certain number of farmers who did not feed their stock rightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the people whose stock has died, I will not pretend to solve the problem of what could be done for them at the moment.  There is nothing like stating the position accurately.  It is not accurate to give the impression that very large numbers of cattle died. They did not.  Considerable numbers of cattle died in districts of Clare and North Roscommon.  Very large numbers of sheep died in a limited district in County Galway, but, taking the country as a whole, I doubt if five per cent. of the sheep died from fluke. Certainly, I would not say that one per cent. of the cattle of the country died. Of course it is very little consolation for the man who had 25 or 30 ewes that died, to know that no sheep in the rest of the country died.  That man is ruined.  Supposing it was possible that something could be done, is it not almost impossible to find out accurately where the sheep died?  Let Deputies envisage that problem for themselves and find out the number that died from this particular disease.  It is not right <Col N="671" /> that we should subsidise inefficiency and laziness.  There is some of that there.  To envisage that problem you must find out whether the sheep or cattle died from this particular disease. It would be necessary to know when you dealt with that problem how many you paid who were not entitled to the money and how many you left out who were entitled to it.  There are difficulties there that everyone must realise.</P>

    <Title>QUESTIONS ON THE ADJOURNMENT. - RAILWAY EMPLOYEES' INCOME TAX ASSESSMENTS.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to confine what I have to say to the question of income tax charges against railway employees.  I do not want to discuss the Cork proposition or the general question of assessments of income tax. I make that statement, as it is quite possible that other Deputies might want to enlarge on the subject.  In his speech on the Finance Bill in June last the Minister for Finance made a statement regarding the Second Schedule, which deals with a large number of repeals.  I asked the Minister what was the meaning and effect of that schedule containing repeals of previous Acts of 1916-18.  The Minister answered that the repeals were provisions relating to quarterly assessments under previous Acts.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The whole business of the quarterly assessments was suitable enough when you had rising wages and when you had quite a number of weekly wage earners by which the amount of income tax would be assessed in the ordinary way according to these proposals.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With that assurance we assented to the section enacting the repeals, so that for the future, instead of having quarterly assessments, as embodied in earlier Acts, the provisions for income tax relating to wage earners would be that they would be assessed in the ordinary way.  That was the assurance given by the Minister for Finance. What is the outcome?  I have here a circular issued towards the end of January by the Great Northern Railway Company to employees pointing <Col N="672" /> out that the company had been required in the past to furnish quarterly returns of those whose remuneration exceeded £150 per annum.  They were assessed under Schedule D, and the company made deductions.  The company points out that the Finance Act of 1924 provides that all manual workers are to be assessed for the year 1924-25 onwards under Schedule E.  That meant that such assessments will be made upon the company and the amount collected through the wage sheets.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the event of the company being assessed on your behalf, I shall advise you in due course of the amount of the tax, and arrange for the necessary deductions to be made from your wages in respect of same.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A later circular, dated the 19th February, simply informs the wage earner or the railway employee that the Commissioners of Income Tax have sent a list of assessments against the members of this company's wage staff, the first instalment of which is demanded immediately and the balance before the 30th June.  It states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You have been assessed for £8 18s. 5d., which will be deducted at the rate of 18s. per fortnight.  If you are not satisfied with the assessment, you should communicate with the Surveyor of Taxes, as I am not supplied with details as to how the amount is arrived at.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Note the difference.  In the ordinary way, as promised by the Minister, the taxpayer will be requested to fill up a form giving the amount of his income, on which there are hints and suggestions as to abatements to which he will be entitled under certain conditions. That form is filled up, and the person is informed at a later stage of the amount assessed against him.  What has been substituted is that the company is asked to make a statement of the income, or estimated income, of the workman, and the workman is then informed of the amount of the tax.  If he has any complaint to make he has to make enquiries of the Surveyor of Taxes.  What is the position of that workman?  As far as I can gather all workmen employed by the railway company are deemed by the Acts of Parliament to be unmarried men, without dependents, and <Col N="673" /> working a full year without a break. They are assessed on that assumption, and as having no right to abatements. If they complain that they are assessed too highly they are obliged to make an appeal to the Surveyor, and, in many cases, make a personal visit, which means loss of time and loss of pay.</P>
    <P>The Great Southern Railway intimates that they have been obliged to furnish the income tax authorities with an estimate of the earnings for the current year.  Apparently the estimate is upon the ordinary weekly pay, without reference to possible overtime, or possible breaks or deductions owing to sickness.  The effect is, in the first case I quoted, that the man is assessed at £232, based upon his earnings a year ago.  There have been changes in the class of work that person is doing and his actual earnings for this year will probably be £40 less than the actual earnings of the year before.  He is assessed as an unmarried man.  No account is taken of claims for abatement for insurance, dependents, or anything of that kind.  And on the mere notification of the Income Tax Commissioners to the railway company that the tax to be charged against a workman is so many pounds, they begin to deduct at the rate of 2/-, 3/-, 4/- or 5/- per week.  As I say, the onus of finding out what amount the assessment was on is thrown upon the workman after deductions have begun to take place.</P>
    <P>In at least two cases brought to my notice, after the deductions were made it was found the man was not liable to pay any income tax.  In one case a man has been assessed on practically £4 per week, and deductions were begun to be made on the assumption that he was a single man without dependents, with no right to abatement. He happens to have been sick for thirteen weeks during the current year. The assessment is made on the assumption that he is earning this year exactly what he earned the year before.  He happens not to be a single man without dependents.  He is a married man with a family and is far below the income tax level.  He has to lose time to go and plead his case, because he cannot afford to have two or three shillings per <Col N="674" /> week deducted from his wages.  He prefers to lose a half day in order to make his case before the inspector.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that, if that is the method that the Commissioners are adopting to recover income tax from the employees of railway companies, they are doing injustice to the workmen, injustice to the railway companies, and they are simply going to make their income tax returns for this year appear to be higher than they legitimately should be, because there will have to be very considerable repayments, if justice is to be done, in most of these cases.  There is, however, every possibility that, once this money is taken out of the wages paid by the workmen, they are not to get any back. They can, no doubt, combine together; they can threaten to strike; they can down tools and make a mess of things to compel attention to be paid to their grievance.  There is no suggestion that they will do that yet, but I can say, from the feeling that has been exhibited during the past three or four weeks, if this kind of deduction is to be made, if there is no consideration to be given to the method of assessment, there is so great a heart-burning amongst these workmen that I would not be surprised to find that they are capable of holding up, or at least of threatening to hold up, the railway services until they find those deductions are repaid.</P>
    <P>The method of assessment is not in accordance with the promise made by the Minister.  It is not the ordinary way.  Before any deduction is made, a workman should have the right to know upon what amount he is being assessed.  He should have the opportunity to make his claim for abatements, and when all this procedure is gone through, then, if necessary, the question of deductions can be dealt with.  Surely we have the right to ask that the workman who pays income tax ought to have an opportunity of knowing on what sum he is being assessed, and the right to make a claim for abatement in accordance with the law, before any tax is taken from him, especially from weekly wages.  The position of a man who is assessed as an unmarried man and has four shillings <Col N="675" /> or five shillings per week deducted for so many weeks to the end of June is one of very great difficulty.  You are practically putting him in the position of working for a lower rate than his neighbour who happens to be in the same trade, but who is not working for a railway company.  The only difference is that the man in the railway company is presumed to have steady employment.  My present complaint is not of the fact that he is paying income tax, but of the method of assessment&mdash;the unfair treatment of the workman as compared with any other income tax payer who has right to claim abatement before any tax is demanded from him&mdash;that he is considered to be in the first instance liable to the whole of the income tax that would be chargeable if he were an unmarried man and had no dependents.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister's earnest consideration of this matter.  I ask him to cease, or give the companies authority to cease, making these deductions until each case has been inquired into in respect to abatements.  The companies are placed in the unfortunate position of having made a return of the estimated income and are compelled to pay the tax.  Then they may make the deductions at any rate they please from the workmen.  They may take it off in one week or three weeks, so far as the law goes.  That is unfair to the railway companies, but I leave the railway companies to make their complaint in regard to that.  I claim on behalf of the workman that he ought to have the right to have the whole case reviewed before any deduction is made&mdash;the right to have abatements made, and to know exactly on what basis his assessment is made before any deduction is made from his wages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Finance Act was being discussed in the Dáil in June last, I protested against the insertion of this clause.  I realised that it would not give any return to the State for the amount of money that would be involved by the employment of additional clerical labour in order to have it carried out.  If, before inserting a clause of that kind, the Minister had made enquiries <Col N="676" /> as to the number of men likely to be affected, and the wages they would receive, he could at a glance, if he had the correct information at his disposal, have easily seen that it would not mean any additional advantage to, or revenue for the State.  According to the last statistical return, touching on the number of employees engaged by the Irish railway companies, the total is given at 28,000, less than 4,000 of whom are engaged in the clerical and administrative sections and who, by reason of their designation, are classed as salaried employees.</P>
      <P>A salaried employee is in a slightly different position from that of an ordinary operative or weekly wage-earner on the railways, in so far as under the provisions of the National Health Insurance Act he is guaranteed a payment of three months' salary if he falls sick or meets with an accident. A weekly wage-earner must, and does, suffer loss of pay through absenting himself from work by reason of illness or any other cause.  He suffers the loss of a day's pay, or a week's pay, as the case may be be.  Taking the average wage of the weekly wage-earner as ranging between £2 10s. 0d. and £2 15s. 0d., and extending that over 24,000 men, I really think the Minister has made a bad mistake.  I would like to know from him what has been the cost of the administration of this particular clause and what has been the additional revenue derived from the operation.  He might also tell us what extra labour he had to employ in the Revenue Department.  I speak as one who has been, for a number of years, part of my time engaged in the preparation of returns connected with weekly wage-earners.  These returns have to be supplied to the headquarters of the company and they are then sent on to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of this clause, as far as I am aware, has caused a great amount of unnecessary irritation and inconvenience between the employee and the individual who happens to be in charge at the station or headquarters of the company, wherever men are employed.  During the last week, numbers of men employed where I work as a part-time employee received a <Col N="677" /> form which I will now read to the Dáil. I received a copy of this form myself. I suffer loss of my pay whenever I attend the Dáil, and that happens over a considerable portion of the year. Consequently, I am in the same position as other employees.  The form I received reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have received a communication from the Inspector of Taxes, Dublin, informing me that you have not returned Claim Form 38 (Railway) sent on to you some months ago by the Irish Revenue Authorities. The effect of the non-return of this document will be that you will be assessed without being given any statutory allowances you may be entitled to.  I shall be glad if you will please fill up and return the document at once in order that credit may be given to you for any abatement to which you are entitled.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How would it be possible for a clerical worker who is instructed by the railway company to make out the return, or how would it be possible for the weekly wage-earner concerned to render a return of the wages he would earn up to the 31st March, a date which we have not yet arrived at? How does the individual know even that he would be alive by the 31st March?  How can he find out the loss of pay that possibly would be suffered by him during the period that this form refers to?  Deputy Johnson has correctly covered the points that really affect the case he has put to the Minister. So far as this matter is concerned I can speak from practical experience and I can state quite emphatically that Deputy Johnson's argument is perfectly correct.  The Revenue Commissioners have adopted the attitude of assessing every individual as if he were a single man earning his full wage for the year.  That is an unfair attitude, and especially is it so in the case of clerical workers.  They have sent in the form laid down by the Revenue Authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The men I refer to got no form.  The clerical workers may have got forms, but those men have not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know, the wage-earners, if they received the particular <Col N="678" /> form I have read out, are quite prepared to fill it in.  There is no question of refusing to fill it.  But I suggest that they cannot fill in the amount of wages they have actually earned until the end of the period has arrived&mdash; that is, the 31st of March of this year. I objected to the insertion of this clause in the Act also because I object to the railway company, or the employer in any business concern, being made a tax-gatherer for the State. That is absolutely wrong.  It is wrong from the Government point of view to compel such people to adopt the position of unpaid tax-gatherers.  That condition of affairs leads to a good deal of irritation as between the employees and the head of the company concerned.  I think I am safe in saying that the insertion of such a clause in the Act will mean very little, if any, additional revenue for the State; it will mean a good deal of trouble without gaining anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister and the Revenue Authorities insist on the company acting as tax-gatherers, they should not stop at that.  As the company is accepting the position of agent and tax-gatherer, if it tells the employee he is responsible for so much income tax, it should also be left in the position of giving details to the individual concerned as to how the amount is made up.  It is very unfair to be sending railway employees to the Castle to Parnell Square, or to Dawson Street, where they have to take their place in a queue and probably wait for hours. They very likely lose their day and may have to come a second day without being able to see the individual who would be in a position to give them information.  Possibly after all their trouble it will be found they are not liable for tax, and when the explanation is given the Revenue Commissioners will decide that the sheriffs and other officials need not bother to take furniture away in lieu of payment. As a matter of fact, I myself have got a &ldquo;red&rdquo; notice for the payment of income tax.  I was told I would be waited upon by some uniformed official of the State to collect an amount of £12 6s. 0d. on a sum of £10 earned income.  I have never come across such <Col N="679" /> a case in my life.  I aw waiting for the sheriff to have an interview with him and to save myself the trouble of going to 21 Dawson Street in order to find out how they make this ridiculous claim against me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will.  Last year I also got a notice through the company.  I did not answer it.  First it stated that I owed £12 to the Revenue Commissioners.  They assumed I was a single man earning a full salary.  I got a second notice and then a rather curt one from the staff officer of the company, so I got up early one morning and went through the salary list to find out what I earned during the year.  Instead of paying the Revenue Commissioners £12 I was agreeably surprised to find that I was due a refund of £4.  That was a profitable morning's work.  I am not complaining about this matter on my own behalf, but I know from personal experience that this is the case with most of the wage-earners to whom Deputy Johnson has referred.  If the Minister accepts that he will readily recognise it is impossible for him to pursue these individuals through the companies for money which he will find they do not owe.  The highest paid railway supervisory foreman in the operative grades of the Irish railways earns £3 2s. a week.  The average wage of porters in Dublin and Belfast is £2 9s.  Applying that to 24,000 railway workers, I think you will find that there is a good deal in the argument of Deputy Johnson and in the need for the relief called for by the railwaymen in this matter. I think the Minister will recognise that the majority of Irish railwaymen are a constitutionally-minded body and that they never acted in a manner that would prove that they were animated by the opposite point of view.  I can say that what Deputy Johnson has stated is not untrue, and that if the companies are going to pursue this attitude at the dictation of the Revenue Commissioners, undoubtedly in the near future they will be up against an <Col N="680" /> agitation which will be impossible to control, and will mean trouble for the companies and the Commissioners.  I ask the Minister to give attention to the representations of Deputy Johnson and to give some undertaking to relieve the situation and not cause the trouble which I foresee will come if the railway companies and the Commissioners insist on pursuing this attitude.</P>

      <P>I am at a loss to understand what Deputy Davin means when he talks about a clause being introduced. There was no new clause introduced or no new principle introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I might explain under the British law that up to last year it was for the clerical staff that the companies were compelled to act as tax-gatherers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no new clause.  There was a repeal of a special provision introduced in 1916, or perhaps later, which gave a great deal of trouble and caused a great deal of expense and really produced no revenue. That was a system of quarterly assessments. Prior to 1915 workmen were in the same position as other employees of the railway, but, of course, they did not generally come within the limits of taxable capacity or exceed the exemption limit, and they were not charged with the tax.  In 1915 the exemption limit was lowered to £130, and at the same time there was a great increase in wages.  The system of quarterly assessments was then introduced.  That system, although it was very expensive and very troublesome, worked well enough during the period of high wages but when wages fell it became a farce. The system of quarterly assessments carried on for the last few years was really in the nature of a joke, as the amount of money expended on labour in the Revenue Commission for collecting the tax was more than the total amount of tax obtained through that system.  It often happened that a man was assessed for two quarters and that after all the trouble of assessment and collection was gone through he fell out of work, so that the tax had to be refunded. Every possible kind of trouble <Col N="681" /> arose in that way.  It was felt last year when the Financial Bill was being introduced that there could be no justification for continuing a system of collecting taxes that led to the expenditure of greater money on the labour in the Revenue Department than would be collected.  For that reason the section setting up the system of quarterly assessments was repealed.  So far as I am aware, nobody thought that that was a bad thing.  It was troublesome to everybody who came in touch with it, even outside the Revenue Commissioners. I am sure it was troublesome to the railway companies, to the people who had to supply particulars, and to the men affected.  When I said that it would be collected in the ordinary way I was not adverting to anything except that the tax would be collected apart from quarterly assessments, and that no special arrangement would be made for a particular class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that we had a right to assume that there would be no such special arrangement made for a particular class of wage-earners, when you spoke of the &ldquo;ordinary way.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No special arrangement is made.  The people who happened to be in railway employment, and who were subject to quarterly assessment, fell back into the ordinary position that railway employees had always been in.  Quarterly assessment gave them a special position, as it gave a special position to other people subject to assessment in the same way.  If you divide the people subject to quarterly assessment into railway employees and non-railway employees, they merely fell back into the position which they were in before the system of quarterly assessment was introduced. Railway employees have for a long time been in a separate position from other employees.  I do not know why the system was first established.  It dates back to 1860.  It may have been because railway companies are given monopolies and special privileges and that it was thought that certain duties might rest on them.  But I have not explored the history of the matter and <Col N="682" /> I am not aware of what the cause for establishing this system was.  The position was that railway companies were assessed on the income of their employees and that they were given the right to recover the tax paid by them from their employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>From all railway workers.  The position before 1915 was that those other workers did not come within the tax limit.  The exemption limit was £160, and so although they were under this system it passed, so to speak, over their heads.  No change was made in the law regarding railway workers other than was made in regard to manual workers who had been subject previously to quarterly assessment.</P>
      <P>I was not aware that forms for claiming abatements and allowances had not been given to manual workers.  I certainly think they should have been given.  I understand that, in the ordinary way, clerical employees of the railway companies get those forms sometime about May or June, before the railway companies send in to the Revenue Commissioners their estimate of the earnings of the men during the current year.  I always assumed that the same thing would be done in regard to manual workers as is done by the railway companies in regard to their other employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>If the estimate is wrong an adjustment can be made.  I think it will be found that in the case of those who will be liable to tax, estimates which are reliable enough can be given.  In any event, the estimate would not reach the Revenue Commissioners in the ordinary way until October. By that time, the railway company should have some fair idea of the earnings of their employees.</P>

      <P>In any case, they would know at that date, when more than half the year has passed.  Only the first instalment of the tax would be paid during the year&mdash;before the 31st March&mdash;so that if a man is given his form to claim abatement for dependants in May or June, there is no reason why he should be charged any more tax than he is really liable for. I can only say that if there has been any failure in the machinery to work&mdash; as it would seem there has been failure, as the men did not get their forms&mdash;it may have been due to the application of this system afresh to these particular men, and we will see in the future that these men will get the forms.  In the ordinary way, I think forms in the past were given to the company to be distributed to the employees, instead of sending them direct to the persons concerned. That, however, is only a matter of method.  We can see for the future that these forms will be supplied so that the men will be able to claim these abatements for dependants.  If that is properly done, I think you will find that the number of railwaymen who will be liable for any tax at all will be very few indeed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, of course, that is the general system all along.  I do not think it works unfairly, because it can be adjusted long before the second instalment of the tax comes to be paid. The second instalment is never paid within the year.  It will not be paid by the railway company, and I think the matter can be adjusted, so that no man will suffer a deduction beyond what he has to suffer except through some exceptional circumstances arising.  In regard to the man who did apply already the machinery was in operation. It is the railway company that deducts from him.  If Deputy Johnson will give the name afterwards I would take it up as a sample case and examine it in detail, so as to see just how such a case could be remedied, why such a case occurred and how it could be avoided in the future.  I was not aware until Deputy Davin spoke to-night that there were great grievances in the case of clerical employees. I thought that people like them find it better to have their income tax deducted by a series of instalments than if they had to pay large sums together and perhaps be prosecuted for arrears that had been allowed to accrue.  I find that wage earners find it better to have it deducted in this way than to be called upon to pay a lump sum at once.</P>

      <P>The position need not be more onerous in the case of wage earners than in the case of clerical employees. In the cases that have arisen I do not know whether there is any fault so far as the employees themselves are concerned.  Deputy Johnson says that he did not get the forms.  I am not in a position to say that they did get the forms, but I know that very often people do not fill up their forms. They throw them aside and take no notice of them, and then they have a grievance afterwards if they are not given the allowance that they should be given.  That may well be the case in regard to some of the people.  Really, if people get forms and do not fill them they have nobody to blame but <Col N="685" /> themselves.  The Revenue Commissioners do not know the man intimately or know his circumstances, or know whether he is married.  If he had a wife last year she may have died since. They have no way in which to make allowances for people who do not fill up their claims.  If there has been failure of the machinery we hope to remedy that failure in the future.  If they have not got the forms I can only promise that arrangements will be made in the future by which they will have the forms in good time to get the allowances. I will make the arrangements necessary to expedite the adjustments and to expedite refunds in the case of people who are not liable, and adjustments in the case of people liable, but who have been assessed for larger amounts than they are due to pay.</P>

    <P>Whatever trouble there is in connection with this system, it is a system that causes less unnecessary trouble, once it is properly in operation, than that absurd quarterly system it replaces.  I can say that there is no justification for continuing the other system.  I do not think this is a system which would work unfairly at all if operated as it should be.  I was going to say when Deputy Johnson rose that the number of workers who will really be charged a tax, if the forms are properly filled, is small.  If a man is married he will pay no tax on an income up to £250 a year.  A single man with £250 will pay about £11 tax, which, if deducted well over the year, will not be a heavy <Col N="686" /> burden.  People who are married and have families would, if manual workers, not, I think, be liable for the tax at all. It practically comes down to a certain number of single men who are in comparatively well-paid jobs.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider the advisability at a future date of having a conference between the Revenue Commissioners and representatives of the companies and the men, so that suggestions might be put forward to simplify the procedure and remove irritation?</P>

      <P>I cannot give that promise at the moment.  I will consider the suggestion and investigate the position, and if I see anything that might be cleared up by a conference I will not hesitate to call such a conference.  If what is wrong is that the machinery is rusty, or in some way or other not put into operation properly, then I can only see that the men will get their forms in proper time, and that assessments will not be made on men who are not liable to pay taxes.  If it is a matter of getting the system to work properly, then there will be no trouble at all.</P>
