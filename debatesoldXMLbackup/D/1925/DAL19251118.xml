      <P>Mr. McCarthy failed to satisfy the Committee of Enquiry into Resignations and Dismissals from the Constabulary which investigated his case very fully, that his resignation from that force in December, 1917, was caused by his national sympathies. After a careful review of all the facts and circumstances of the case, I can see no good reason for disagreeing with the unfavourable view formed by the Committee, and I have accordingly informed the applicant that I am unable to authorise the grant to him of a pension.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if there is an Army Pay Commission at present in existence, and whether same is composed of Army officers, and, if so, what is their rank and powers; whether any recommendation has recently been made for an increase in the pay of officers in the higher ranks by this or any other body, and whether same has been sanctioned by him.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for DEFENCE (Mr. Hughes)</NameTxt>
      <P>An inter-departmental <Col N="482" /> Committee under the style of the Army Pay Commission has been in existence since September, 1922, for the purpose of advising the Minister for Defence on matters of Army pay, allowances and pensions.  Its membership at present includes the military members of the Council of Defence, whose rank, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, is not below that of Major-General. This so-called Commission has no power of decision, but makes recommendations for consideration by me in the first instance.  For reasons relating to the proper conduct of the work of a Government Department, I regret that I am unable to disclose any of the proceedings or recommendations of this or any other similar committee.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he can state the number of Volunteers, married and unmarried, in the Army Corps of Engineers who are not receiving any additional pay, and the number who are in receipt of 9d., 1s. 6d., 2s., and 3s. each per day, and the qualifications and classification of each section who are in receipt of the respective amounts; also whether or not the Officer in Command of the Army Corps of Engineers has full power to decide what additional allowance each soldier is entitled to receive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of private soldiers in the Army Corps of Engineers who are not at present receiving additional pay is 44 married and 125 unmarried.</P>
      <P>The number who are in receipt of such pay at the rates of 9d., 1/6, 2/-, and 3/- a day are respectively:&mdash;</P>
      <P>married privates 3, 14, 25 and 74.</P>
      <P>unmarried privates 2, 6, 35 and 56.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employments fall into two groups for the purpose of this pay.  At present the 9d. and 1/6 rates are being issued to technical storemen, plate-layers and blacksmith strickers, according to degree of proficiency at their work, and the 2/- and 3/- rates on the basis of skill to draughtsmen, carpenters, <Col N="483" /> bricklayers, electricians, plumbers, fitters, painters, blacksmiths, slaters, plasterers, engine drivers, searchlight operators, rivetters, boilermakers, drillers, fetlers and riggers.</P>
    <P>The grant of the particular rate in each case is determined on the recommendation of the Officer Commanding the Corps, which is based on special trade tests or inspections of actual work done as reported by his subordinate officers.  His recommendation is ordinarily accepted, provided that the number of soldiers prescribed by regulations for the particular employment in the Corps is not exceeded.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that in some cases where applications were made for Army service pensions, replies were sent to the claimants to the effect that owing to their applications being received after the appointed day in March, 1925, they could not be considered; that many men who rendered service to the State are thus deprived of the advantages of the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924, and if he will extend the time by a reasonable period so that all claims could be considered on their merits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it to the Minister, or the President of the Executive Council, that when new Regulations are made affecting a number of military men whose claims were refused consideration and when these new Regulations are practically pigeon-holed and these men have no means of seeing them, that it is not too much to ask that a guinea or two should be spent in having them advertised?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am concerned I must follow the Regulations made by the Dáil.  I am doing so in this case.  I have taken the only course open to me; that is, to allow those Regulations to be laid upon the Table for twenty-one days, to see if the Oireachtas approves or disapproves of them.  If the Oireachtas approves of them, then I will be in a position to say what I can do in regard to the views the Deputy has put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention has been called to the report of the Commission appointed by the British Government to inquire into food prices; whether he is aware that the recommendations of that Commission have been partly adopted by the British Government, <Col N="486" /> and a Food Council established; whether it is the fact that subsequent to the establishment of the Food Council the price of bread in Great Britain has fallen to a greater extent than the price of bread in the Saorstát, and whether he is prepared to establish a Food Council for the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the facts to be as stated in the question, but the latest information available would suggest that the establishment of a Food Council does not entirely solve the problem of reductions in the cost of living.</P>
      <P>The Executive Council is, however, prepared to move a Resolution in each House of the Oireachtas to the effect that it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into a matter of urgent public importance, namely, the cost of certain articles of general consumption.</P>
      <P>Should that resolution be adopted by the Dáil and Seanad, it would then be possible to establish a Tribunal under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, and to confer on it powers to summon witnesses and to examine them on oath and to require the production of documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Will that Tribunal have a permanent existence, and will it have a permanent secretariat collecting information for it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That, I presume, would depend upon the terms of the Resolution.  I have not, as far as my Department has given any consideration to the matter, thought it necessary to decide now that a Tribunal of this sort should be established permanently and have a permanent secretariat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>In order that we may have more information on this matter, I beg to give notice that, on the adjournment to-night, I will raise the question of the British Commission on Food Prices and the control of food prices in An Saorstát.</P>

      <P>asked the <Col N="487" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the statement of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in the Dáil on November 3rd, that that Minister had &ldquo;no knowledge as to any consequences which may have followed to any firm which did not succeed in competition for current contracts,&rdquo; he will make arrangements to ensure that the Advisory Committee established under the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1925, shall be kept fully informed of the possible effect in increasing unemployment in this country of the placing of contracts abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no reason to suppose that the Advisory Committee is not as competent as I am to form its own opinion on such a matter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is whether the Committee will be &ldquo;kept fully informed of the possible effect, in increasing unemployment in this country, of the placing of contracts abroad.&rdquo;  In placing any particular contract abroad the question for consideration is what effect the placing of that contract will have on unemployment here in the trades affected by the contract.  Will that be placed before the Committee?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he is aware of the unsatisfactory conditions prevailing in the Saorstat as regards payment of arrears of Land Commission Annuities, Interest in lieu of Rent; that most of the forced sales to realise amounts due under these heads have proved abortive, and whether, in the circumstances, and in view of the existing depression he will consider the question of adding the arrears to the purchase price, and thus avoid the deadlock and evictions which must necessarily arise if the present policy is pursued.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the opinion of the Land Commissioners the suggestion made by the Deputy, that arrears of Land Purchase Annuities and of Interest in lieu of Rent be added to the purchase moneys of tenants' holdings, is not a practical proposition. The arrears of Land Purchase Annuities outsanding at 27th October last amounted to £421,349, and if the proposal were entertained, the required advances could not be made under any of the existing Land Purchase Acts.  Special legislation would be required either (1) to make the advances in 4½ per cent. Land Bonds, which would have to be converted into cash to liquidate the arrears or (2) to enable the amount required to be provided from the Exchequer by means of a Vote of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy includes in &ldquo;Interest in lieu of Rent&rdquo; not only the Interest in lieu of Rent payable under the agreements entered into by tenants with their landlords under the Acts 1903-9, pending the making of the advances, but also Payment in lieu of Rent under the Act of 1923.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Interest in lieu of Rent the Land Commission is under a statutory obligation to collect it and to pay it as collected to the landlords.  The agreements under which it is payable are pending Purchase Agreements within the meaning of the Financial Agreement of 12th February, 1923, entered <Col N="494" /> into between the British and Free State Governments, under which the advances will be made by the British Government.  An increase of price by addition of arrears would alter the existing agreements and take them out of the category of &ldquo;Pending Purchase Agreements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Payment in lieu of Rent under the Act of 1923 is payable by the tenants pending the vesting of their holdings in the Land Commission on the appointed day and a sum equivalent to the amount collectable is paid to the landlord whether collected from the tenants or not.  As the amounts due to the landlords have already been paid they could not be added to the Purchase Moneys they will receive for the holdings.</P>

      <P>As to the point of order, Private Members' <Col N="501" /> business comes on as a matter of right on Wednesday and Fridays at certain hours.  The President, or a Minister, may move that specified Ministerial business shall not be interrupted for the consideration of Private Members' business, or in default of making a motion under Standing Order 74 arrangements may be made with the Private Member who has the business on the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>With regard to the position of a Bill as against a motion, there are two motions on the Order Paper to-day, one by Deputy Baxter and the other by Deputy Roddy.  The Bill, The Shop Hours (Drapery Trades, Dublin and Districts) (Amendment) Bill, 1925, has been introduced and has been ordered for consideration to-day, and that being an order of the Dáil, the Bill to-day would take precedence in the ordinary way of either of the motions. Neither the Bill nor Deputy Baxter nor Deputy Roddy's motions would have any standing to-morrow (Thursday) on the Order Paper except with the consent of the President, who can, if he chooses, put these matters on the Order Paper in any place he likes, as on Thursday he has the regulation of the Order Paper.  If the Deputy consents, and if the President is agreeable, either of these can be put on the Order Paper to-morrow in a place fixed by the President, otherwise the motion would be adjourned until Friday or some other day when Private Members' business can be taken.  As regards to-day, the Bill takes precedence, and, as to to-morrow, if the Bill appears on the Order Paper, it will be taken with the consent of the President in Ministerial time.</P>

      <P>I think that Standing Order No. 74 gives a Minister power to move that specified Ministerial business shall not be interrupted if under consideration at the time of taking up motions or Bills moved by Private Teachtai.  The President has a right to move and take a vote that certain business will not be interrupted in favour of Bills or motions of Private Members.  In that case the Bill would come on automatically on Friday, which is the next day upon which there is time fixed for taking Private Members' business.  Instead of taking a motion an endeavour is being made to make an arrangement between the Deputy in charge of the Bill and the President.  Deputy Morrissey is right that the Dáil would have to make an Order at 7 o'clock to postpone the Bill until to-morrow.</P>

I have previously given an undertaking to Deputy McCullough that his motion will take priority to-morrow, and will be first under consideration. Having disposed of that, it is my intention, if it suits the convenience of Deputy Dr. Hennessy, to take the Shop Hours Bill also to-morrow, and, if time permitted, to allow the consideration of the adjourned motion by Deputy Baxter.

    <Title>CIVIL SERVICE REGULATION (AMENDMENT) BILL, 1925&mdash;SECOND STAGE.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on the First Reading of this Bill, it has been introduced principally to deal with the difficulties which arose when it was discovered that under existing legislation the Civil Service Commission had not power to confine examinations to members of one particular sex.  I think Deputies will understand that it is necessary in certain cases that members of a particular sex should hold particular appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are cases, for instance, of certain inspectors who must be of one or the other sex.  Then there is the general usage of confining classes, like shorthand-typists, typists and telephonists, to women.  As the matter stands at present, it would be impossible to confine an examination for shorthand-typists or typists to women.  The recent examination could not be confined, but in that particular case, as no great number of men expected that they would be eligible and no great number was prepared, very few passed and no great inconvenience was occasioned; but it would upset the existing organisation and would, of course, lead to difficulties that were overcome when it was decided some years ago, in the Civil Service at any rate, to confine classes for shorthand-typists and typists to women.  It is not intended that any class should be confined to men only.  In the case of the Customs, it would be necessary, frequently, I think, to confine a particular examination to men.  The number of women who could be employed, without inconvenience, in the Customs service as officers of Customs and Excise, would be limited, and, consequently, it would not be possible to have the examination open.  An officer of the Customs and <Col N="504" /> Excise has sometimes to carry on his work in remote and isolated places, and frequently he has to take charge of a Customs preventive staff, which is really a police staff.  He has frequently, too, to take charge of rummaging parties, and to search boats, and in the case of a breakdown in a distillery or, say, in the new sugar-beet factory which is being set up, he would have to attend at any hour of the night that he was called on.  It is felt, therefore, that for the general work in the Customs and Excise service, women would not be suited.  On the other hand, there is certain Customs work that might be done by women quite as well as by men.  For instance, there is Customs work done in the Post Office, and there is no reason why that should not be done by women, but the general view taken at the present time is that only a small proportion of the Customs service could consist of women unless the efficiency of the service were to suffer.</P>
    <P>At the present moment, in the case of the Revenue staff, we are very, very short of inspectors of taxes.  On the other hand, only a limited number of cadets can be trained and we will be in difficulties in regard to that staff in the service for some years.  Now it is a recognised fact that there is a greater wastage amongst the women staff than amongst the men.  Considerable numbers of women leave, for instance, to get married, and we feel that it would not be in the interests of the service in the next examination, or perhaps the examination after the next, to admit women cadets because we feel it would prolong the period during which we would not be in a satisfactory position in the matter of the staff.  But after that difficulty has been got over the intention would be to admit women and men equally to the examination.</P>
    <P>As regards all the ordinary examinations for general staff, such as clerical, executive and administrative, etc., the intention will be to have the examinations open equally to both sexes. Occasionally, of course, for special posts, discrimination has to be exercised. There are posts for which you will require a man, just as there are posts for which women will be required. <Col N="505" /> For instance, we have two inspectors of industrial schools; one is a man who inspects the boys' schools and the other is a woman who inspects the girls' schools.  If the woman inspector left and a vacancy occurred, it would be necessary to have a woman in her place.  On the other hand, if the man left the service, it would be necessary to have a man in his place.  Occasionally for special posts, the examination or the selection will be confined to members of one sex, but as far as the general classes are concerned, I think the position would be that for shorthand-typists, typists and telephonists and any classes of that sort, the examination will be confined to women.  The Customs service will be, in part, confined to men; that is to say only a small proportion of the posts will be filled by women, but frequently examinations will be held which will be confined to men.</P>
    <P>Our Act is based on the British Orders in Council.  It was thought that we could confine the examinations to members of one sex as the British do. In fact certain examinations were confined to one sex, but it was discovered, when the point was raised, that the power did not actually exist in the Civil Service Commission as the legal power which the British reserve to their Commission in the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act of 1919 is not applicable here.  That is the principal matter dealt with in the Bill although the Section covering it is a very short one.</P>
    <P>The second point that the Bill deals with is the power which is given to the Commissioners to make special regulations confining a competitive examination to persons who belong to a specified class, delimited in such manner or by reference to such matter as the Commissioners shall think proper. That is in substitution for the sub-section which enabled the Commissioners, by special regulation, to confine an examination to persons belonging to a specified class, or being in a particular employment, or possessing some other similar special qualification.  That sub-section would not enable the Commissioners to confine an examination to people resident in a particular locality. <Col N="506" /> There are a number of part-time posts, such, perhaps, as officers of district courts, as well as a variety of other local posts which are part-time, and it is thought that it may be desirable, when these are being filled by examination or by selection, to confine the applications for entrance to such examination or selection to people resident in a particular locality.  There might even be an examination where, say, a person had to be a certain height or possess a qualification of that sort. As the present Act stands the Commissioners could not confine the examination in such a way as to exclude those who did not fulfil the requirements. Section 3 of this Bill deals principally with two matters: with persons possessing professional or other peculiar qualifications, and persons whom it might be in the public interest to appoint to posts in the Civil Service.  The section of the existing Act was, as I explained to the Dáil some time ago, not rightly understood when the Act was being passed.  However, the effect of that is in the case of a person possessing qualifications wholly or in part professional or otherwise peculiar, and not ordinarily to be acquired in the Civil Service, the Commissioners may, if it is proposed by the Minister in charge of a Department, appoint such a person, and the Commissioners may, if they think fit, grant a certificate under the section, in respect of such a situation, upon any evidence which is satisfactory to them that the person proposed to be appointed is fully qualified in respect of sex, age, health, character, knowledge and ability for such a situation.</P>
    <P>That regulation, as it stands, although it was not so intended, leaves the nomination of the person for this professional position to the Minister, and simply leaves the Civil Service Commissioners to grant their certificate upon such evidence as is satisfactory to them.  Now we change that and substitute the Selection Board machinery for it.  We give powers to the Commissioners, in such a case, to prescribe by special regulation the method by which they will select the person to be appointed to such situations, and <Col N="507" /> they may by special regulation confine the right to apply for such situations to such persons as pay fees, if any such are prescribed, by the regulations.  This new Section 3 of this Bill, but which is Section 6 of the old Act, allows the Commission to have definitely the Selection Board procedure in the case of those appointments, and enables them to charge fees to persons who come forward for positions to be filled by the Selection Board.  It is doubtful, as the Act stands at present, whether there is power to charge fees in Selection Board cases.</P>
    <P>I need not go over the ground again that I went over when the original Act was going through the Dáil.  It is necessary, in the case of those appointments, to deal with them otherwise than by the competitive examinations.  By competitive examination you bring in the recruits as they leave the school or the University, but when filling positions, where experience and knowledge of the world is required, you must have something like a Selection Board, and the Civil Service Commissioners have used that Board very widely, and a great number of posts have been filled as a result of recommendations of the Selection Board which, under the previous regime, were filled otherwise.  Sub-section (2) of Section 3 is a new sub-section, and it deals with the question of persons in respect of whom the public interest is certified.  As the matter stands, at the present, if the Minister for Finance, and the Minister in charge of the Government Department, consider it would be in the public interest that rules in regard to age, let us say, or that the whole or any part of the examination for a particular situation should be dispensed with, the Commissioners may grant their certificate of qualification on such evidence as may be satisfactory to them.  Now we have altered that in this way; that instead of having the Minister in charge of the Department, and the Minister for Finance, deciding public interest, the public interest will be decided by the Executive Council, and then the Civil Service Commission has power to decide whether the examination should be dispensed with in whole or in part.  As <Col N="508" /> the Act stands at present, and, as I say, it was not so intended, it would be the two Ministers who would decide whether the examination would be dispensed with in whole or in part.  We feel, as it is the Civil Service Commissioners who make the regulation for examinations, that they should decide whether the examinations should be dispensed with or not.  Cases will occasionally occur where it will be in the public interest that a particular person should be appointed to a position in the Civil Service.  I would hope that these cases would be very few and far between. There might be the case of a person who rendered some very special service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be, but in any case if you have people who want to abuse the provisions in relation to this Bill they can be abused.  There might be cases where you want persons of some special eminence for particular positions and where the Selection Board procedure would not rightly apply. The Selection Board procedure works in in this way.  The Selection Board has the appointment and candidates come before them.  You may want for a particular position somebody to enter the Service specially.  In our own case that has occurred.  I am thinking of the position of State Chemist.  The person who fills that position was not anxious to take it but he was persuaded to take the position.  I can imagine, in connection with the Shannon Hydro Electric Scheme, that if you wanted some really competent person who was in Australia or Ontario, but who was really the man you required, the business-like thing might be to make an offer to that person and to induce him to come over and take on the position here.  It might not be proper or sensible to issue an advertisement in some journal, and then risk the best person coming forward and applying.  There are some positions in <Col N="509" /> which you cannot really rely on that. It would be wrong to make a farce of the Selection Board procedure and to approach somebody, and to assure him he would be specially dealt with by the Selection Board.  These are the sort of cases in which this particular power which is in the existing Act in a stronger form should be continued. There are other cases in which it might be desirable, for instance, if a civil servant&mdash;I do not suggest it will be used in this way and I do not want anybody to think it will be, but I suggest this case&mdash;in a time of strong national and political excitement was dismissed and, shall we say, rightly dismissed, that dismissal would cancel his Civil Service Certificate, but in calmer times it might be felt desirable to take him back into the Civil Service.  But he could only come back under some such procedure as this.  It is the sort of emergency power necessary for dealing with special circumstances, and we think that we have it here in the form in which it is least liable to abuse. It was felt in discussing the matter, when this present Bill was drafted, that it was undesirable that two Ministers should have power to decide the public interest.</P>
      <P>If you ever find abuse in these things, it is where an individual can exercise what may be called the power of patronage.  Where you have the whole body of the Executive Council it is felt that there will be no danger of abuse. The third sub-section deals with the power of dispensing with examinations and transferring on promotion in certain cases.  The existing provision says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall not be necessary for any person in respect of whom a certificate of qualification shall have been issued by the Commissioners to obtain a new certificate of qualification on being appointed either by transfer or promotion to a situation which, in the opinion of the Commissioners, is similar to the situation in respect of which such certificate shall have already been issued.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to widen the powers of the Commissioners in that respect, and to enable them to dispense with examinations in certain other cases. <Col N="510" /> The necessity for that has been revealed in the practical operation of the Act.  For instance, cases will occur in which a Post Office assistant, which is a Departmental class, will be promoted to be a clerical officer, which is a general service class, and where you have not the question of customary promotion. There were cases recently in which, owing to the shortage of Customs officers, clerical officers were promoted to be Customs officers.  A clerical officer might, in the ordinary course, be promoted to be an executive officer, which is a grade equal to the Customs and Excise grade.  They would not be ordinarily, and could not be in the customary course, promoted from clerical officers to Customs and Excise grade, which deals with a different class of work.  It is felt that these promotions, which are quite legitimate and proper promotions, but are not given in the customary course, will, from time to time, occur, and that these somewhat wider powers should be given to Civil Service Commissioners.</P>

      <P>The Minister's speech would lead the Dáil to believe that this is only one of the Bills we have every day which are intended to rectify the mistakes we made in our legislation last year and the year before. It is somewhat wider and a somewhat more far-reaching measure, if my reading of it is correct.  This Bill raises at least two very important principles, and on this Second Stage we have to satisfy ourselves that these principles are sound principles.  To begin with, the first principle which it raises: it is a Bill with two horns, like a dilemma, and I must discuss them in detail, as the Minister did.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The second section of the Bill creates the principle of sex-disqualification, which does not at present exist in our legislation.  I am not entirely convinced with the arguments of the Minister, which are only arguments of administrative difficulties at the best, and are not sufficient to induce us to override the principle implicit in the Constitution.  Article 3 says that <Col N="511" /> every person, without distinction of sex, shall be deemed a citizen of Saorstát Eireann.  That being so, is not every citizen entitled to equal opportunities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain exceptions like the police and the army for which women are not fitted, just as men are not fitted for hospital nursing.  I do not think there are regulations debarring women from these professions.  It is because things are just as they are.  The Minister gave us one or two instances and said that two men presented themselves at an examination for female typists.  I do not know why a man should not be as useful a typist as a woman.  I have known men who made very good shorthand-typists and clerks.  I think the practical contingency which arises when men present themselves for posts that only carry women's rate of wages is only a remote one.  It is scarcely worth legislating against that danger.  The Minister said that there were certain posts in the Excise in which the officers were required to get up at all hours of the night and that women were not suitable.  I wonder if he has not heard of hospital nurses and women doctors who are called out at all hours of the night.  I have known women performing that duty and performing it very well.  I do not see why, if they were in other respects suitable, the mere fact of sex should disqualify women for posts of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave us, on the First Reading, details of the position of women going up for examination as Customs searchers.  I am inclined to think, having regard to the trend of our legislation in imposing protective tariffs on clothing for men and women, that there is a necessity for a certain number of women in the service.  I pity the man who has to estimate the value of women's clothing and decide whether a women's clothing has been worn or not, when it is neatly folded in tissue paper.  Again, I pity the man who has to repack a woman's box.  I am not sure that the Minister's information is quite sound, that there is <Col N="512" /> not a certain number of women in the Customs service.  There must be, as otherwise smuggling amongst women would be carried on with comparative impunity.  I read of a case at Dover twelve months ago where a lady was stopped with twenty-seven pairs of stockings fastened round her body. That would be a common case.  I am not satisfied by this specific instance and I am of opinion that provisions such as there are in Section 2 are contrary to the spirit of the times.  We may dislike that spirit.  I am an old-fashioned person and frankly not enthusiastic about the modern change in the relation of the sexes.  It is the most revolutionary thing that has happened in our time.  I believe that 200 or 300 years hence, when a historian writes the history of the last fifty years, he will not speak of wireless or the development of the motor car or of the Shannon scheme as the most striking fact of the last twenty-five years of the nineteenth century and the first twenty-five years of the twentieth century. He will say the change in the position of women is the most significant and striking fact.  It was in that epoch that woman left her home to take up a career and, in consequence, you now have woman in almost every sphere of life except the Church and the Army, and in Russia, I believe, there have even been women soldiers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>And in Ireland. The chief disadvantage attaching to the employment of women soldiers is their undue ferocity.  Therefore, outside the Church, and to a limited extent the Army, occupations are open to women.  Does the Minister not know that there are policewomen in the United States and Great Britain and that their services have been found valuable?  Everywhere women have been admitted to the Bar.  Women are able to qualify as doctors and women have entered the solicitors' profession. The Minister said it was not intended to exclude women from the higher ranks of the Civil Service.  He may not intend it, but under this Bill it can be done by another Minister.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Gorey and everyone else are too wise to commit themselves on that point before they take office.  The fact remains that the power exists to do this, and to give that power at this epoch is a retrograde step and I do not think you will be justified in doing so.</P>
      <P>As to the second part of the Bill, the power to dispense with examinations, that is a power which must be sparingly exercised and which needs right safeguards.  My quarrel with this section is that the safeguards are almost illusory.  I will not dispute the fact that there are certain posts which cannot be filled by competitive examination. To add to the instances the Minister used I should say such posts as a Director of the National Gallery or of the Museum are examples.  You require certain technical and educational qualifications that could not be possibly obtained by a man submitting himself for examination for those posts and you would have old men unpractised in examinations reluctant to submit themselves to them.  Another example would be, supposing the Minister for Industry and Commerce considered he needed the help of a labour adviser.  Obviously the best qualifications for a post of that kind would be Trade Union experience and not the ability to pass an examination in precis writing.  There are those tests but they are very few.  The Minister will tell me the number.  My view is they are so few that we are barely justified in making a general provision.  We should deal with such cases as they come up and give the Minister authority by resolution to dispense with examinations in those cases.  That would be a greater safeguard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take exception also to the changes made.  The judges now will be the Civil Service Commission.  Formerly they were the Ministers.  If it were desired to dispense with examinations the judges were the Ministers.  Ministers <Col N="514" /> are answerable to this House, and the Civil Service Commission are not. We can challenge the conduct of Ministers in many ways, and especially in the House, by a reduction of the votes. I do not wish to criticise the present Civil Service Commission, but they are not the only Civil Service Commission that will ever be, just as the Ministers are not the only Ministers that will ever be.  This Commission is rightly an irresponsible body.  Its members are unpaid, and at present the majority of these members are Civil Servants acting under the control of members of the Executive Council.  Now, this Bill puts them in the most extraordinary position that the Executive Council should suggest a particular person to the Civil Service Commission, and then the Civil Service Commission have to satisfy themselves whether he is qualified for the post. In other words, you are inviting the Civil Service Commissioner to overrule a body of which his Parliamentary chief is a member.  I do not think it is a fair position to put the Commission in, and, therefore, I think it is a retrograde step.  The last Bill was not ideal.  I did my best, playing a lone hand, to amend it, without much success. Instead of making the rule of examination more strong, we are creating a system by which another Executive Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no one in this Dáil more interested in this Bill than I am, and for that reason I do not propose to give a silent vote on the Second Reading. During the past few days I have been canvassed by very influential <Col N="515" /> members of my sex to vote against this Bill.  I have the section of the Bill which affects my sex almost off by heart, and I fail to read into it the meaning of Deputy Cooper.  I cannot see that it infringes our rights under the Constitution in any respect.  I am not enamoured of this Bill.  I am by no means in love with it, and I must admit it limits to a certain extent the appointments for which women are eligible.</P>
      <P>It might be asked why I am voting for the Bill.  I will try and give my reasons.  When I was elected to this Dáil I was not elected on the question of sex.  I gave a pledge to my constituents that I would do my best to serve them and the State.  While in this Dáil I intend to carry out my pledge and to do the best I can for the interests of the community at large.  The more I study this Bill the more I see that I would be injuring my sex by voting against it.  The number of appointments women would be excluded from would be very small and the Minister has given us a good explanation.  The appointments he mentioned could not very well be filled by women.  He stated that the appointments in the Customs could not be filled by women and that there would be certain appointments for which women would be eligible.  All I can say to those people who canvassed me to vote against this Bill is that women, when the next election will come on, will have an opportunity to return women on the Government ticket to this Dáil who will have the power to amend this Bill if it is passed. I think I have given a sufficient explanation why I am voting for this Bill, although, as I have said, I am by no means in love with it and I ask the Minister and the Government to limit the number of appointments as far as possible for which women would be ineligible under this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Bryan Cooper has expressed most of the views I hold in the matter, but I think one or two points should be emphasised.  In sub-section 1 of Section 2, and in other parts of the Bill, it will be noted that the words appear <Col N="516" />&ldquo;and shall be deemed always to have had effect.&rdquo;  That is to say, whatever is enacted in respect of sex qualifications in this Bill shall be deemed to have been enacted in any previous legislation. I do not know what the intention of the Minister may be in respect of that, but we have heard it said from all sides of the House that retrospective legislation is, on the face of it, undesirable and that a very special reason must be given why any retrospective clause should be inserted in any enactment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But we are asked here to say that the amendment of the principal Act respecting sex disqualification shall be deemed to have been enacted when it was before the Oireachtas. I wonder whether that section has anything to do with the proposal which was made some time ago following upon an advertisement which limited a certain Civil Service examination to men only.  I understand that an attempt was made to have a declaration made in the courts that this was unconstitutional.  I think it a great pity that a proposal of that kind, which was not by any means frivolous and which was quite seriously intended, should not have been allowed to go to the courts, and have a declaration made. The Attorney-General refused to give it his fiat, which is necessary when taking action against a Minister.  I think that is the position.  If the Minister says that that is not correct, I have nothing more to say on that point.  My information was to the effect that the Attorney-General had refused to give his consent to the action being proceeded with against the Minister, and it was for that reason that the action for the declaration in the courts was not proceeded with.  (Mr. Blythe indicated dissent.)  Then, why are we to insert in this Bill these words saying that the sex disqualification should always be deemed to have been the law?  Whatever may be the merits of the case in respect of the future, we ought not to legislate in respect of the past and nullify any rights which any citizen may have or may have had under previous legislation.  I do not know what they may be, but there should be a very strong case made indeed <Col N="517" /> before we should be asked to pass legislation covering any period anterior to the date of the Bill.  I do not think the Minister has made a case even for the removal of the sex disqualification. I do not think that there is any group of cases outside the present powers of the Ministry which ought not to be open to both sexes as they have been in the past.</P>
    <P>Then we have the proposition in sub-section (2) that the Commissioners may, by special regulation, confine any such competitive examination to persons in any specified class, delimited in such manner as may be thought proper. That action is to be deemed to have been always in existence and to have been always the law.  Again I say we should have very special reasons before we should legislate retrospectively.  I think Section 3, with its three sub-sections, is not justified by the statement made by the Minister.  He seemed to argue that the effect of the section was to limit the authority of Ministers in respect of making personal appointments or using their patronage.  At least his explanation was that the effect would be to throw a share of the responsibility on the Civil Service Commission. I may misunderstand the effect of this section, but, as I understand it, it is opening much wider the door to appointments outside the competitive examination region.  It is proposed to give Ministers power to make regulations, and then, within those regulations, to make appointments of individuals. They can make the regulations as close and as tight as they wish.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Commission, as Deputy Bryan Cooper pointed out, is not an entirely independent and free body.  The majority&mdash;I think all but the Chairman&mdash;are bound to take into account the Minister's view on any proposition because they are directly under Ministers.  Consequently, we cannot consider the Civil Service Commission in any matter on which the Ministry has expressed a view, a free body.  Under sub-section (2) any person whom the Ministers desire, may in practice be appointed to any post in the Civil Service.  It may be said that that is already within the powers of the Ministry.  I suppose it is within the <Col N="518" /> powers of the Ministry if they like to use all their powers. I am not sure whether that is true or not but this certainly gives them powers to do that, to make a wide meshed net and in effect to secure that the only people that will be caught in that net will be the persons who are required.  The existing regulations and the existing law give Ministers power, and it is not at all an uncommon practice&mdash;I think it is a necessary privilege&mdash;that for special requirements, special posts which are not covered by the ordinary Civil Service practices and qualifications, persons are appointed, otherwise than through the competitive examination method.  That is already the practice according to regulation but the modification or change of that regulation has not been justified by the Minister's statement and I fear that the effect of this is to give privileges to Ministers in respect of appointments which will enable them to put into the public service a larger number of people who have not gone through the examination process than the regulations at present in operation provide for.  Unless there is a very much clearer explanation of the effect of the Bill than the Minister has yet given to us, I shall vote with Deputy Bryan Cooper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>We must all recognise that there are certain appointments that cannot very well be filled without recognition of the differentiation of sexes and the recognition that special qualifications may be required.  At the same time I think that the Minister has not made out any case whereby such broad and far-reaching authority should be placed in the hands of the Executive.  I am, therefore, prepared to support the opposition to the Bill as it stands, at present, on account of the tendency that I think exists in connection with the Executive Council of taking provisions and powers beyond what are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the difference in sex, I think we all recognise that there are comparatively few professions or occupations, except where physical differences make it necessary, where women are not allowed to compete with men.  We have seen these disabilities <Col N="519" /> being got rid of gradually, and of course we must recognise that women occupy a position of equality to-day with men that never would have been contemplated years ago.  That being so the Bill that is before us takes very wide powers as far as the Executive Council is concerned, and I think the House must safeguard its position in this matter of giving powers to the Executive Council.  It seems to me that the number of cases that would require to be reserved might very properly be put as a schedule to this Bill, or at all events that the exceptional cases ought to be defined if they are going to be recognised, otherwise the door is obviously being opened for a state of affairs which I do not think the Dáil would wish to see put into operation.</P>
    <P>We all have a great deal of confidence in the present Executive Council, and I think that we all recognise that the Minister for Finance had no ulterior motive beyond the good of the service when he introduced this Bill. At the same time I think that the House is sometimes led into placing too little importance on some of the legislation that comes before it, and that it does not recognise that in passing some Bills it is creating a precedent for future loose legislation, for which I think the House will be sorry at some later stage.  If I may say so, without disrespect to the Minister, I think that this Bill is loose legislation, and as far as I am concerned, all that I would be prepared to admit for the Minister is that there are and may be certain provisions from time to time to which the argument that there should be sex qualification would be open, or in respect of which special qualifications should be recognised. What I say is that if you eventually did go so far as that, it should only be done, in this or any other Bill, by means of a distinct definition of what the scope of the authority is that you are giving to the Minister.</P>

It is a well-known Parliamentary rule&mdash;Deputy Byrne knows it himself, or has heard it before&mdash;that Deputies come here to express their own views.  It is not competent for a Deputy to say: &ldquo;These are the views of X, Y and Z, and I agree with them, and I read them out as the views of X, Y and Z.&rdquo;  That cannot be done.  It is very clear that it would lead to extraordinary abuses.  It has frequently in other places been ruled to be absolutely out of order.  Deputy Byrne, I am sure, has heard that before.</P>

      <P>The Minister himself has nodded assent.  What I wanted to draw attention to is this, that it has been stated that the Civil Service Commission attempted to make rules which were contrary to the Constitution, and that this body, when certain examinations were advertised, took legal advice and were advised that the Minister and the Civil Service Commission were entirely wrong and could not do so under the Constitution.  Am I to understand now from this Section 2 that the Minister desires to make a law to cover himself and his Civil Service Commission for something that was done within the past twelve months?  If that is so, it is very unfair, and, I certainly agree, unconstitutional. Besides, I think that these efforts&mdash;this is the second attempt <Col N="521" /> that we have had&mdash;are rather haphazard ways of introducing amendments to the Constitution.  I do not think that the Constitution and the citizens generally should be treated as they are by the Government.  In the past these examinations were, according to the Constitution, open to both sexes.  The Civil Service Commission, for some reason or other, attempted to confine at least one of the examinations to men, and having got advice it was decided that the Government could not take up this attitude.  The result is that this Bill is brought forward, with a view to amending the Constitution.  I am satisfied, since the Minister has nodded assent, that he has got this case, as stated by the Irish Women Citizens and Local Government Association, that he will pay some attention to the objections that are raised in the circular, and that he will avail of the opportunity to reply to the arguments in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne declares that this is an attempt on the part of the Minister to reform the Constitution.  We give the Ministry credit for a fuller knowledge of the Constitutional position than that alleges.  There is no Minister, certainly there is no member of the Executive Council, who is not fully aware of the fact that the Constitution can be amended only by express legislation directed thereto, and that if in any particular the Constitution is to be altered a Bill framed for that explicit purpose must be introduced.  Therefore, it is clear that the Minister does not desire to amend the Constitution. What, then, does he desire?  When this Bill has become an Act it will be cited as &ldquo;the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act, 1925,&rdquo; a pleasing euphemism; it runs trippingly off the tongue, pleasingly seductive.  Consider the Title of the Bill, and consider the substance of the Bill in detail, and it will remind you of the advice given by the crafty and designing wife of an aspiring politician: &ldquo;Look like the innocent flower to the bee that circles about it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, in so far as the later clauses are concerned, may more aptly be described as a &ldquo;Bill for the Facilitation <Col N="522" /> of Jobs,&rdquo; and in its earlier portion, &ldquo;a Bill for Sex Disqualification.&rdquo; The reason that was given some time ago&mdash;the reason which I heard, because, unfortunately, I had not an opportunity of hearing the opening speech&mdash;was that on a recent occasion an audacious man had actually succeeded in penetrating that holy of holies, the staff of typewriting clerks. It is to prevent more of this desecration of Government offices that the earlier part of the Bill was designed.</P>
    <P>On one occasion it was my happy lot to interview the secretary of a Minister with a view to the reception of a deputation.  I noticed, what I had the first opportunity of noticing&mdash;later I had further opportunities in other Departments&mdash;the delightful picture gallery a Ministerial office can be made into with the living picture, a pretty typist or a pretty secretary.  Evidently that is to be the order of the day and a mere man must not replace those ornaments of the staff.  Is it alleged that a man would not be able to typewrite, that he would not have that gracious delicacy of touch that is requisite for swift typewriting?  Are men not accurate writers of shorthand? Are we to remove the official Press and substitute for them those more competent girl clerks?  That would be consistent.  When was it discovered that women were incompetent to fill the higher offices and that in the interest of the public service they should not be allowed to attempt to secure those positions?</P>
    <P>Are we consistent?  We are spending out of the public purse close on £5,000,000 a year on education.  In July last, speaking on the Estimate&mdash; I was the only one who did, by the way, speak on the Estimate when it was an Estimate&mdash;I calculated that the total sums devoted directly and indirectly, and likewise the amounts paid by way of private fees by parents, indicated that we were spending upwards of £6,000,000 per year on education.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>What for? Why was not Deputy Gorey here to ask that question when I was dealing <Col N="523" /> with the subject at the time?  It, at any rate, purports to prepare girls and young women for life.  We are now to announce that the ambition of filling the higher offices of the Civil Service is not a legitimate ambition on the part of our University graduates.  I shall be told, no doubt, that they are not excluded; that the Bill is merely permissive. That is all very well while we have an Executive Council that expressly binds itself, by declaration, that it will not do the evil things which the Bill, when enacted, would permit it to do.  My friend, Deputy Hewat, has hit the nail on the head.  We are asked here to give away by this Bill the power that we ought to retain, to constitute the Ministry the first and last authority as regards the fitness of the applicant for certain official duties.</P>
      <P>Once we have passed the Bill the Ministry becomes omnipotent in the matter.  That is why I described it&mdash; I do not hesitate to repeat the description&mdash;as a Bill for the facilitation of jobs.  It is not a Bill for the regulation of the Civil Service, for it practically abolishes the Civil Service in certain Departments in certain respects. I cannot find that Section 3 (2) does anything else but open the door in the same way in which the professed abolition of the Civil Service would do it.  If the purpose were to secure by legislation what could be secured by natural selection&mdash;if that were declared to be the intention&mdash;I would point out that we have too much legislation.  There is hardly a single field of human exercise in regard to which it is not the intention of this House to introduce legislative control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is bureaucracy run mad, to substitute the fiat of a particular individual who is in office for the regular process of Civil Service examination and the application of tests of fitness. I am an enemy of bureaucracy.  So long as I am a member of this House and have breath to speak, I shall protest against anything that tends towards bureaucracy.  It is the denial of democracy. We are sitting here as Deputies under a Constitution the most <Col N="524" /> democratic in the world, framed designedly to be a model to other lands as a democratic Constitution.  We were the first in the world to introduce equality between man and woman, to recognise a common citizenship irrespective of sex, and now we are proceeding to do away with that.  Why? If that is to be done, let it be done regularly.  If it is to be done, let it be justified.  What has occurred in recent history that would justify us in doing away with that equality?  Take the higher administrative posts, the Ministries. Are there tests applied to them?  Is there any standard to which they must conform?  Is there any decision as regards their peculiar fitness? Because of traditional custom that is unnecessary; but a Minister without an efficient Civil Service would not be able to carry on and, consequently, we who are interested in good government must be interested in the proper constitution and regulation of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Now, under the Constitution, men and women or, should I say, youths and girls, have the franchise.  They are entitled to exercise their share of citizenship in the decision as to who shall represent them in the Oireachtas. And yet they are to be told, as regards one division of these voters, that they are proscribed by the fact that they were born feminine, not masculine.  They are supposed to become happy and contented citizens under that disqualification. It is not good policy; that ought to be a consideration for politicians.  It is not just or equitable; that ought to be a consideration for men.  It is quite easy to get over this difficulty that has presented itself.  No woman will apply for appointment to a position where the fact of being a woman is an obvious and natural disqualification.  Neither will a man of commonsense apply for the position, say, of warder or matron in a prison for women convicts.  It is unnecessary to lay down the law in that respect, because in certain matters we can rely on commonsense and on ordinary prudence.  It is quite sufficient to schedule certain posts; but to enact a measure which throws the door open <Col N="525" /> to all sorts of irregularities, merely in order to secure that people shall behave sensibly, is like the old story of burning the house to roast the pig.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say a few words in support of Deputies Cooper, Magennis and Johnson.  I am not inclined to lay very much stress on the aspect of it that has been so ably put to the Dáil by Deputy Magennis.  My point of view with regard to it is this: we, in the Constitution, have accepted sex equality, and this Bill is undoubtedly an attempt to make sex differentiation. As we have accepted sex equality, let us stick to it and let us not try to undermine the Constitution by means of a Bill which is put forward for another purpose, and not specially to amend the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The passing of this Bill will, in my opinion, give power to the Minister to restrict and confine positions in the Government to any particular sex which he desires.  It is my opinion that this matter might be met by other means.  It might possibly be met by means of special regulations placed on the Table of the Dáil, or something of that kind, having reference to a particular examination with regard to which it was found necessary to exclude one sex or the other.  My opposition to the Bill is based very much more on the sections which give power to the Executive Council and the Ministers, acting through the Civil Service Commissioners, to set aside the regulations with regard to competitive examinations.</P>

      <P>In my opinion, if the Dáil grants this power, it opens the door to all kinds of possible jobbery, and the giving of appointments to men who have earned the right to the appointments not because of real ability, but because of political services.  I do agree with the Deputies who have already spoken that the present Minister has no intention of that kind in his mind when introducing the Bill.  But the fact remains, in any case, that it can be used for that purpose.  It is my opinion that there are very few appointments <Col N="526" /> that cannot be filled by competitive examination.  I think it should be the ideal to be aimed at that every possible appointment should be filled by means of competitive examination. It was the ideal put forward by Sinn Fein.  It was the ideal which an attempt was made to enforce in the local boards throughout the country, and I personally am not going to give my vote for a Bill which will set an example from headquarters, so to speak, and give appointments for other reasons than real work and real ability as proved by competitive examination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Mr. ALTON Mr. ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised at this Bill.  The Minister, when he announced its birth last Thursday, appealed to our chivalry and appealed to us to protect the women typists from the intrusion and aggression of those rude and thoughtless males who thrust themselves into examinations where he considered they ought not to be.  I think that the Minister meant more than he said last Thursday.  I am not saying that he has deliberately taken us in, but I, for one, had no idea that the scope of this Bill was going to be so wide as it apparently is.  The Bill seems to me, as has been pointed out by previous speakers, to be utterly retrograde in spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More and more, women are making their way, and rightly, into the higher posts in the Civil Service, into the executive and administrative posts, and I think this country, which proposes to be progressive, should fall into line with this principle.  We should not, except in the very rarest cases, make any discrimination of sex in our public appointments.  Deputy Cooper has dealt very fully with that point, and I will not stress it any more.  It is with the latter part of the Bill to which Deputy Magennis takes such exception that I direct my remarks.  I see the difficulty under which the Civil Service Commissioners are.  I realise fully that certain appointments must be made for which an examination is not a fitting test; but I think the regulations which should guide the Commissioners in making such appointments are matters on which the Oireachtas should have a direct decision.  I am willing to leave a lot to the discretion of the Minister <Col N="527" /> and to the Civil Service Commissioners. I would not leave these regulations completely and entirely in their power.  I think it would embarrass the Commissioners and, in case we had Ministers and Commissioners not so scrupulous as the present ones, it would lead to grave irregularities. Sub-section 2 of Section 3, as Deputy Cooper pointed out, is certainly too wide.  I would not leave it free to the Commissioners.  I cannot see how the Commissioners, if the appointment of a certain individual was indicated to them as desirable by the Minister or the Exectuive, would be likely to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to his appointment.  I think that in cases of that sort the initiative should come not from the Minister or Executive but rather from the Civil Service Commissioners themselves. Therefore I would leave the question, as to what credentials or certificates should be presented, to the Commissioners. Recently we made one or two appointments of that sort and I think they were made well and that the right people were appointed.  On two grounds I certainly am opposed to the Bill.  It is tending to put back the clock and to drive women down into the lower Civil Service posts and to confine the higher administrative and executive posts to men only.</P>

      <P>I oppose this Bill on principle.  I think it is another case in which I am perfectly ready to believe, and do believe, that the Minister has no intention beyond what he has declared, but it seems to me plain that the powers given to the Minister in this Bill are much wider than those required to enable the Minister to carry his wishes into effect.  I am, therefore, going to vote against the Bill and to oppose it as strongly as I can.  The arguments have been put so well, especially by Deputy Magennis, there is very little left for me to say, except to dot the i's and cross the t's of that Deputy.  I would like to stress one or two points.  We thought we were doing a good thing when we passed our first Civil Service Bill.  I think it is a good Bill, as it puts our methods of filling appointments on a sound basis, but it seems to me to be perfectly obvious if you pass this Bill with sub-section 2 of Section 3 in it you need not have passed the other Bill.</P>

It means that you must have certain examinations for certain posts, but what this Bill means is that you may fill any post without examination.  What force is then left in the other Bill?

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I shall be put right if I am wrong in my interpretation of it.  The Minister asks me to read Section 6 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1924.  It is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" />&ldquo;In case the Minister for Finance and the Minister in charge of a Government Department shall consider&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  That the qualifications in respect of knowledge and ability deemed requisite for any particular situation to which this Act applies in that Government Department are wholly or in part professional or otherwise peculiar and not ordinarily to be acquired in the Civil Service, and the Minister in charge of such Government Department shall propose to appoint to such situation a person who has acquired such qualifications in other pursuits; or</P>
    <P>(b)  that it would be for the public interest that the rules in regard to age and the whole or any part of the examination for such a situation as aforesaid should be dispensed with;</P>
    <P>the Commissioners may, if they think fit, grant their certificate of qualification in respect of such situation upon any evidence which is satisfactory to them that the person proposed to be appointed to such situation is fully qualified therefor in respect of age, health, character, knowledge and ability.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think I have done what the Minister asked me, and I therefore submit that, having read that, I ought also read, but perhaps it is unnecessary, sub-sections 2 and 3.  I submit that the case is this, namely, that if the Minister says that everything is covered by Section 6 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, he does not need further power.</P>

That is as to the general point.  I am afraid that instead of dotting the i's and crossing the t's of Deputy Magennis's argument in this friendly controversy with the Minister for Finance, I have drawn away the attention of the Dáil from the force of those arguments.  However, I want to draw special attention to the arguments used with reference to women.  I will not go into the point as to whether the Bill is or is not in accordance with the liberty on which we pride ourselves on having given in our Constitution.  That, no doubt, will have to be settled elsewhere, but it seems to me that in this Bill, particularly when taken in conjunction with our experience in reference to the filling of appointments in the higher grades of the Civil Service, we are practically closing the door of the higher grades of the Civil Service to women.</P>

      <P>It is important that the Minister should have an opportunity of saying why that impression is unfounded.  We should be doing a great injury to educated women, and to their hopes when getting higher education, if we allow that impression to go even momentarily abroad that there is an intention to close these higher posts to them.  There is no doubt they have already formed that impression, and I think when we analyse the situation we will find there is justification for it. Notices have been given on two occasions of examinations.  According to the first notice, the examination was declared to be for men only.  On protest the notices were withdrawn, and examinations were not held because it was found they could not be legally held under the provisions of the then Civil Service Act.  Now the Minister brings in a Civil Service amending Bill which certainly, on the face of it, shows he had attempted to do certain things, and when he found he could not do this, then it would appear that the amending Bill was introduced to remedy the defects <Col N="532" /> from his point of view in the previous Act, and to give him further powers to carry out the intentions he had in mind in his original notices.  I must say that women would be justified on referring to those notices of examination, and to the provisions of this Bill, in thinking that it was the intention of the Ministry to fill these higher posts of the Civil Service in future with men only.  The Minister is going to deny that, and I am glad to give him the opportunity of saying that I am quite wrong, and I hope he will satisfy us that it is not only not the intention to do that, but that it will not be possible to do it under this Bill.  I am willing to accept that the Minister's intentions are good, but what is the force of the Bill?  That is the important thing for us to satisfy ourselves about.</P>

      <P>I have a little difficulty in replying because certain Deputies have apparently read the Bill and have not read the Act to which it applies.  They have consequently misunderstood the Bill.  In addition, some Deputies were absent when I attempted to explain the Bill, and I may have to go over the same grounds again.  Deputy Bryan Cooper indicated that we were throwing certain responsibilities on the Civil Service Commissioners in sub-section (2) of Section 3 which were somehow different from the responsibilities they have under the present Section 6.  I do not think that that is so at all, as at present, in Section 6, the Civil Service Commissioners have to be satisfied in any of these special cases as to the age, health, character, knowledge and ability of the persons to be appointed.  They have not to decide whether or not they will dispense with an examination, but they still have the definite duty of giving no certificate to any such person who is not fully qualified in respect to knowledge and ability.  That is not a very different thing from the responsibility they will have in the future of deciding whether or not an examination shall be dispensed with or otherwise. When Deputy Bryan Cooper talks of the lack of safeguards, and of the patronage that may be exercised, he reminds me of Rip Van Winkle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained that. Perhaps the Deputy was one of those who were not present when I made the explanation.  The fact of Deputies not having been present makes it extremely difficult for me, and I can hardly quite go over the whole ground again.  There is no use in talking about the principles in the Constitution. There certainly is nothing implied in the Constitution which would oblige us to make any discrimination between men and women.  When we were filling up our Army, and when selecting our police force there was nothing in the Constitution which would prevent us from making discrimination between men and women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are filling up posts in the Civil Service there is no intention, as I have explained, to exclude women from the higher posts.  The only cases where I anticipate that may be done is in regard to certain appointments where you require a particular sex, say, for posts like inspectors of certain sorts.  The only posts where there is likely to be for a considerable time, or permanently, a discrimination made between men and women are positions in the Customs and Excise. As I explained, there are good reasons for that.  I believe that the efficiency of the Service would suffer if we had men and women in equal numbers.  On the other hand, there are duties to be discharged by those officers that could be quite well discharged by women, and it would be possible to have, without any injury to that particular service, <Col N="534" /> a substantial number of women in it; but if we found in that service that the examinations were giving us a larger number of women than could be efficiently employed, it would be necessary to hold an examination or two that would be confined to men only.</P>
    <P>In regard to any other general positions in the Civil Service, if there is an examination confined to men only it will be simply to get over certain difficulties that exist at the present time, but that will not be continued. It was intended to hold one particular examination confined to men only about a year ago, and that examination led to the whole question of the legality of confining the examination to one sex being raised&mdash;that was the junior administrative examination.  It was felt, owing to the present constitution of the service, and when we were only appointing six people, that if four or five women were appointed it would be difficult to use them satisfactorily in the way of discharging the duties of the positions as efficiently as was desired.  That is due to the fact that, owing to past regulations, there has been a comparatively small number of women in the higher posts of the Civil Service.  If it were to happen, over a series of years, that you got in for examination for junior administrative posts a majority of women, certain difficulties would arise, and that particular grade would not be able to do its work as efficiently as if it were more mixed.  As a matter of fact, in the examination that was held the candidates at the top of the list happened to be men.  That means that even if they were nearly all women in the next examination no harm would be done.</P>
    <P>We would have a fair division in that particular grade for a certain number of years, and there is no reason therefore why examinations for that grade should be confined to men.  As a matter of fact they will not be confined to men because my own view is that, unless in some particular position where physical ability comes into the matter, once you admit women to a grade they cannot afterwards be excluded. You may, in the case of the Customs, take a certain number of <Col N="535" /> posts as women's posts, and allow the others to be considered as men's posts, but unless you divide the service in that way, once it is open to women it must remain open to them.  As far as the ordinary grades of the service go&mdash; with the exception of the Customs and perhaps the next examination for Inspectors of Taxes&mdash;they will be open to women equally with men, and to suggest that anybody can put the clock back is to suggest an absurdity.  We know that the majority of voters in the country are women, and no one who is in any position where he has to take note of political considerations, can attempt to put back the hands of the clock.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson asked why we put in the words: &ldquo;Shall be construed and have effect, and shall be deemed always to have had effect, as if the word &lsquo;sex&rsquo; were inserted therein immediately after the words &lsquo;qualification as to.&rsquo;&rdquo; The reason for putting in these words is this: that the Civil Service Commissioners at first did not realise that they had not the power to confine the examination to members of one sex. They issued advertisements for examinations confined to one sex.  The examinations were actually held and people were appointed and are in the Civil Service.  Their position is somewhat doubtful because these examinations seem to have been illegally and improperly held.  However, we cannot go back on that now and turn these people out of the Civil Service, and I think there is nothing to be done except to legalise what was done then. But once the point was raised, and once the Attorney-General advised that the Commissioners had not power legally to confine the examination to one sex, then that was accepted, and the reason the recent legal proceedings were stopped is that the Commissioners withdrew the regulations and the advertisements which they had issued when they found in the refusal of the Attorney-General to give his fiat that their action would be ultra vires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to make it legal.  The wording of the previous Act was simply &ldquo;open competitive examination,&rdquo; and it simply referred to every person.  The Act said that the Commissioners were to inquire into the qualifications of every person, which meant man or woman, and then said that the Commissioners might confine it to a particular class of person, but they were given no power to confine it to the members of a particular sex.  We are proposing in this Bill to confine it to the members of a particular sex.  Certain Deputies have suggested that we should schedule the positions to which this power might apply, but that is difficult to do.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>As I suggested to the Dáil earlier, there are certain positions, like inspectorships, in which it would be difficult to apply it.  I mentioned that we had two inspectors of industrial schools, one a man and the other a woman.  The woman inspects the girls' schools, and the man the boys' schools, and I think in the case of vacancies occurring you must have a woman to inspect the girls' schools and a man to inspect the boys' schools. There are odd positions of that sort, not a considerable number, that you could not always call to mind, and that you would be likely to leave out of any schedule that might be drawn up.  A difficulty would then arise when a vacancy occurred, and it might not be practicable to come to the Dáil for an amendment.  What Deputies have to rely on as regards the use of this power is the general trend of events in the outside world.  No Minister and no body of Civil Service Commissioners can go against that, and nobody will attempt <Col N="537" /> to go against it.  Deputy Johnson referred to another point&mdash;to sub-head (2) of section 2, where there is power in the Commissioners to confine, as you might say, the applicants in the smaller classes, and to make a finer mesh than they could have done under the existing Act.  The reply I will give to that is that the regulations made by the Commissioners under this new sub-section (2) must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas at least one month before any of the examinations to which such regulations relate are held.  So that while this power would certainly enable the Commissioners to exclude classes of people that their present powers would not enable them to exclude, there is this safeguard which should weigh with Deputies, that the regulations must be laid on the Table of each House of the Oireachtas at least one month before the examinations are held.  I explained already that wider powers in that respect were sought to enable examinations to be confined to residents in particular localities in cases, perhaps, where part-time positions were to be filled.  Deputy Professor Magennis said that this Bill was a Bill for the facilitation of jobs, and he also talked a lot about women being proscribed: that the higher positions in the Civil Service were being denied to them.</P>
      <P>As I have said, that is not the intention, and it is impossible.  He also said the Bill was for the facilitation of jobs.  I think the Deputy cannot have compared the Bill with the Act which it amends, because if this Bill were withdrawn and proceeded with no further, Ministers would have greater powers of filling positions without examination than they will have after this Bill is passed, and to describe it as being retrograde in that sense represents a thing entirely contrary to the facts of the situation.  So far as this Bill changes the present position, it restricts the power of Ministers.</P>

      <P>Deputy Thrift, at my suggestion read out Section 6, which empowers Ministers in certain cases to put up candidates to the Civil Service Commissioners for their certificates. <Col N="538" /> That is the effect of the section at present. If a Minister in charge of a Department decides that the qualifications, wholly or in part, professional or otherwise peculiar, and not ordinarily to be acquired in the Civil Service, are requisite, he can propose to appoint a person to that situation, and he can put the name of that person up to the Civil Service Commissioners for their certificate. That is a power that is not used, and a power that it was not intended to take.  That is a power that would have done away with the entire selection board system if it had been used, but that is the position at present.  Instead of that position which enables the Minister to select a candidate and put him up to the Commissioners, we have enabled the Commissioners to make regulations deciding the methods by which they will select or discover the person to fill a position for which qualifications in whole or in part professional or otherwise peculiar are required.</P>

      <P>The position is this, that, supposing we want a woman inspector for a girls' industrial school, the position may not be filled by examination.  Competitive examination will enable you to get a good clerk or a young person to be trained, but competitive examination does not get you persons with experience of the world and with the common-sense qualifications that you require.  You must fill a position of that kind by a selection board.  There is no other way.  What we do in the future is that we prescribe that we want a woman inspector for the girls' industrial school.  Candidates would come before the Selection Board, and a choice would be made.  At the present time, with the powers we have, we have simply to advertise for an inspector of industrial schools.  Men and women may apply.  If a man is the best candidate the Selection Board would have to go outside its duty and rights and recommend the woman, although the man was the best qualified.</P>

      <P>The Minister will forgive me if I ask for a more particular answer.  He stated the intention of those who framed this Bill. I want to test what is the power given under it.  There is at present a woman Commissioner of National Health.  Is it not possible, under this, to declare that such a position should be filled by a man and disqualify the woman because the Minister, in his indulgent answer to me, gave a case where obviously a woman ought to have the position, or where obviously a man ought to have the position?  What we want to be satisfied about is this: Is it not possible through this legislation to disqualify a woman candidate for a position which is not so specifically <Col N="540" /> marked in itself as to be one for a man or one for a woman?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The special regulation will require to state whether it is a man's post or a woman's post or a post open equally to man or woman.  That would have to be decided, and an advertisement issued accordingly, but it would not enable the position to be advertised as an open post and the best candidate to be disqualified in the end because she was a woman.</P>
      <P>In regard to sub-section (2) of Section 3, the present position is similar to that in regard to the qualification of professional or otherwise peculiar.  The position is in case the Minister for Finance, or the Minister in charge of a Government Department, shall consider that it would be for the public interest that the rules in regard to age and the whole, or any part of the examination for a situation as aforesaid should be dispensed with, the Commissioners may, if they think fit, grant a certificate of qualification for such a situation upon any evidence satisfactory to them that the person proposed to be appointed is fully qualified besides. That is the position as at present, that the Minister for Finance and the Minister in charge of a Government Department may decide that it would be in the public interest that a specified person should be appointed to a particular post, and they may decide moreever that the rules in regard to age, and that the whole or any part of the examination should be dispensed with, and they may put forward that person's name for a certificate to that position to the Civil Service Commissioners. This Bill modifies that.  First, instead of two Ministers agreeing, you must have the agreement of the whole Executive Council.  Secondly, you say that it is the Commissioners shall dispense with compliance with the regulations in this Act in relation to examinations or selection for the appointment. That is not a substantial change.  The real substantial change is from the two Ministers to the whole of the Executive Council, and so far as that alters the present position it restricts the power of Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as this Bill is concerned the <Col N="541" /> effect of Section 3 is to restrict the powers of Ministers and in one important respect to restrict them considerably. If this Bill was to be withdrawn or not passed the power of Ministers would be greater than it has been in the past.  I think that is all I would like to say.  A certain amount of propaganda has been carried on on the question of confining the examination to members of a particular sex, but that propaganda was based upon misapprehension and misunderstanding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>We were dealing last night with the general question of the provision, upkeep and maintenance of schools and in the course of the discussion I referred to the Commission which sat in 1918 and made certain recommendations with regard to the appointment of committees and the setting up of machinery to deal with this particular matter we were discussing. The Minister, at the close of his remarks, made, what I take to be, an extremely serious statement and I would like to know what his position is with regard to it.  He said, as far as I understood him, that if the local committees were set up such as are suggested in that unanimous report that they could not impose those committees without interfering with the managerial system of schools at present in practice.  That is a system I believe to be the most jealously guarded of any in the present practice with regard to our schools.  If that statement were to hold good then I have no doubt that the prospect of getting those local committees set up would be a poor one, but I cannot conceive how the Minister could have made that statement or whether he quite appreciated its importance in view of the fact that on the committee which made that unanimous recommendation there were three or four school managers, representatives of the School Managers' Association, and they attached their names to the report. The present secretary of the Catholic Managers' Association, Dean Macken, Dr. O'Donnell, Dr. Plunket, Bishop of Tuam at that time, now Bishop of Meath.  Canon Kennedy, and Canon Gordon Strahan were on the committee.  It was definitely accepted at that time that the committees I <Col N="544" /> spoke of should be set up and they say one of the duties and powers of such a committee would be the maintenance, repair, heating and cleaning of national schools unless adequate provision is made otherwise.  I want to give the Minister an opportunity of making a considered statement as to the position with regard to that, whether he believes or holds that to set up committees such as are recommended in that report would, in fact, mean a change in the managerial system.</P>
      <P>It has been asserted by those entitled to speak that the real point in the managerial system is the right to appoint teachers, and I know many managers who repeatedly pointed out that it was impossible, for them to continue the voluntary system.  They were quite prepared, as was indicated in this report, to pass on the duties that are imposed on them now to committees of this kind.  The Killanin Report is, as I explained a few days ago, a unanimous report published in 1918 of a committee presided over by Lord Killanin, and consisting of representatives of the then Commissioners of National Education, the school managers, the teachers, and various other people interested in educational affairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I pass from that point now because I take it that has set the matter right.  I refer to the question of amalgamation of schools, and I ask the Minister for his policy on the matter.  He took the line in his general reply on Friday evening that he would not tell us his policy in detail and that it would be time enough for that when we went into the particulars on the Estimate.  We have not succeeded in getting very much further when we have discussed the details.  I do hope that on this question of the amalgamation of schools it will be possible for the Minister to give a very definite reply as to what his policy is, because the first question I shall put to him is: is he prepared to carry out in <Col N="545" /> all cases his own rules, the rules of his own Department in the matter?  There have been several cases within the last twelve months in which the rules of the Ministry have been departed from in that respect, and I think some explanation is due to us as to why that should be the case.</P>
      <P>On the general question, I ask the Minister to state what exactly is his policy with regard to this question of amalgamation of schools, which has been so often raised and put forward as a policy which would evidently secure, not only economy, but the more important matter, efficiency.  In the Saorstát there are 950 separate boys' schools, having only two teachers, and there are 870 girls' schools of the same class&mdash;separate girls' schools, with only two teachers.  I would say, of that number, at least four or five hundred are boys' and girls' schools side by side, in the same building, or immediately adjoining, and the arguments would go to show that amalgamation of these schools would at least cut the present work almost in half.  It would allow for better staffing, and it would be economical and efficient.  I think that if economy and efficiency can be secured by such a policy there should be no delay in putting it into operation. I think the Minister should say definitely whether he proposes to do that in the future.  Above all, he should say what his reasons are for failing, as it can be shown he has failed, to put the present regulations into operation in particular cases.  I think it would be possible to name four or five, or half-a-dozen cases perhaps, where amalgamation could be carried out according to the rules, but where it has not been carried out when the opportunity arose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="Professor MacNEILL Professor MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recognise that I distinguished between the general and distinctive educational policy of the Government and administrative details of this kind. I did so in order that the case might be clearly considered, and considered on its merits, by Deputies.  I think it is evident that if, on a discussion of general policy, we mixed up administrative details, important as they may <Col N="546" /> be, of this kind, we should have a turgid issue, and not a clear issue. With regard to this particular point, my endeavour has been to secure amalgamation of schools where that amalgamation would lead to superior efficiency, and the only plea which I have admitted as valid against amalgamation&mdash;for the other reasons appeared sufficient&mdash;was the plea that amalgamation was contrary to the spiritual interests of the children concerned.  As Deputies are aware, in the vast majority of cases, in nearly all cases, the managers of schools are those who also have the spiritual guidance of the children and their parents, and whose spiritual direction is admitted by them.  I have not that responsibility. I do not enter upon it.  I do not try to enter upon it.  I do not wish to enter upon it.  And that may arise in two ways.  It may arise on ethical grounds or it may arise on doctrinal grounds, and when it does arise I feel that I am not entitled to disregard that feeling.  In all other respects I have done my best, and my Department has done its best, to secure amalgamation, and is continuing to do its best to secure it.  I think every Deputy here will understand that, whether or not they may be in agreement with the line which I feel it my duty to take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be clear on this point.  When the Minister refers to the spiritual interests of the children does he wish us to believe that he has taken the line that he will not amalgamate a school where the children are of different religious persuasions, that he will not amalgamate Catholic and Protestant schools? If that is his line I would like him and the Dáil to understand that I have not advocated amalgamation of that type. That is not the position that is necessarily advocated, and these are not the kinds of cases that I have in my mind. The present position is that out of five thousand odd schools over three thousand are at present mixed schools&mdash; boys and girls&mdash;the vast majority of the schools.  What would be the position of the Minister supposing somebody suggested that these schools should all be separated into separate boys' and girls' schools, and used the <Col N="547" /> argument which the Minister has used now as a reason for doing so?  Would he offer any opposition to that argument, or would he agree to set up these separate schools if the demand were put up to him in the case of these three thousand schools all over the country? If there is no valid or good objection to these three thousand schools I cannot see what valid objection could arise when the case of the amalgamation of adjoining boys' and girls' schools comes up for consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not dealing generally with the question of the amalgamation of Catholic and Protestant schools, which the Deputy does not, I note, advocate, although apart from spiritual grounds the same reasons exactly would exist for it as for amalgamation in other cases.  Dealing with that aspect of it, it might be the case of Protestant schools of different denominations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say that any of the schools that have failed to become amalgamated because of spiritual reasons are within that category?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="Professor MacNEILL Professor MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy O'Connell does not seem to have appreciated the force of my remarks.  In the case of the three thousand odd schools which have been amalgamated I think we may take it that the countervailing reason which I mentioned did not exist, or that it did not exist in the minds of those concerned to an extent to make it a dominant reason. &ldquo;Somebody,&rdquo; was the Deputy's word. It is not the case of somebody; it is the case of a particular person whom the parents and the children accept as their spiritual guide, not somebody, but that particular person.  I do not put myself in the position of a judge in matters of that kind.  I refuse to put myself in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure if we are benefiting the progress of the amalgamation of schools by this discussion, but I will give you an illustration which will show the attitude I take up, taken from a different matter.  Very shortly after I became Minister for Education I was approached by the representatives <Col N="548" /> of several religious bodies with regard to the matter contained in some of the text books in use, and I said to them: &ldquo;Your objection to this is to me all-sufficient.  I do not place myself in the position of a judge as to whether your objection is well based or not. When it is based on the grounds that you state, I accept it.&rdquo;  I do the same in matters of this kind.  If those who are responsible for the moral guidance of the community to which the children belong state to me that amalgamation would be morally disadvantageous, and if they state that in a way that carries to my mind a conviction that such is the view taken by them seriously and carefully, and is likely to be the view taken by the parents of the children themselves, then, as I say, I do not make myself a judge in matters of that kind.  It is a thing of very great difficulty, and I have approached it from the point of view of administration, from the point of view of educational efficiency, with the object of bringing about amalgamation wherever it can effectively be brought about.  That is the way in which it has been approached by my Department, which is honestly endeavouring to bring about amalgamation of schools where it would tend to efficiency.  But when this bar arises it will be seen at once that we, as a Department of State, are placed in a rather serious difficulty about it. Deputies may come to a different conclusion, but I think that the majority of Deputies will agree with me that it is not, in all such cases, a matter of using the strong hand of the Government and saying, &ldquo;It shall be done.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the contribution of the Minister is very valuable on a very important subject.  Obviously there could be no question of compulsory amalgamation under the conditions which the Minister outlines. But in this matter I think that possibly the Government might do what I sometimes feel they have not sufficiently done in other matters, that they might give a lead to public opinion so far as they can.  Deputy O'Connell I think very rightly says that there is a great redundancy of schools, leading to comparative inefficiency as compared <Col N="549" /> with larger schools if amalgamation could be managed.  I think that that would appeal to everybody and I think it should be emphasised that the cost of education is largely increased by the large number of schools that are scattered all over the country.  I think it ought to be put to the people themselves that in this matter of economy and efficiency they have got to think out the problem for themselves and, given the position that better education and more economy of working would be effected, that they ought themselves voluntarily try to get over some of the difficulties that arise through the large number of scattered schools.  The decision might be left in the hands of the people.  I think that if that were done the people themselves would try to get over some of the difficulties of the problem by coming together and not keeping so much aloof, as different denominations have done in the past.  I think that if it were put up to the people as a matter for themselves to settle something might come out of this discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Under subhead D there are two or three points I wish to raise.  These are with regard to the superannuation of teachers.  I want to ask the Minister, in the first place, if he is yet in a position to say whether two classes of teachers, who are at the present time outside the pension regulations, should be brought in under the pension scheme.  The National Teachers Pension Act was passed so long ago as 1879, and a special fund was set up at that time.  Owing to the wording of the Act, or some peculiar interpretation of the Act, it has been held that certain classes of teachers who have come into the service since 1879 did not come within the Teachers Pension Act.  There are two classes.  One of them is a class of teacher engaged in Convent Schools. There are about six or seven hundred, or less, of these in the country.  These teachers are in this position: they are engaged as assistants in what are called Convent Schools, schools taught by religious communities mainly.  They are paid by the State just the same as the teachers in the ordinary National Schools.  Their service is exactly on <Col N="550" /> the same basis.  They get their increments on the same conditions, but when they retire at the end of their period of service they are entitled to no pension whatsoever.  We are told the reason for that is owing to some peculiar wording or interpretation in the Act which says that a Convent School is not an ordinary National School. That is the only ground that I can find for such differentiation.</P>
      <P>One can take the case of two teachers, both fully trained.  One enters an ordinary National School, taught by a lay principal.  The other enters the school where the principal is a nun. Both give the same class of service, do the same kind of work, and give the same number of years' service to the State.  The teacher who is engaged in the Convent School has no right to a pension when she retires after forty years' service.  The teacher in the ordinary National School is entitled to a pension.  Now, this kind of thing has been going on for a long number of years, and we are still in the position that all we know is that communications are passing between the Minister's Department and the Department of Finance.  It is a very grave injustice to have those teachers in this position without any reason whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other teachers in our schools known as the Junior Assistant Mistresses.  The word &ldquo;Junior&rdquo; was put in to give the public some kind of an impression that they were not adult, full-time teachers owing to the fact that, at the time they were appointed, they got the munificent salary of £24 a year.  The people who did this, the Commissioners of National Education, introduced, twenty years ago, a separate class of teachers, and deliberately called them &ldquo;Junior Assistant Mistresses,&rdquo; to indicate to the public that they were not, as I say, adult women, although at the same time they made the regulation that all of them should be over eighteen years of age.  Many of them in the class that were transferred and called Junior Assistant Mistresses were on the other side of forty.  Twenty years have gone by, and they are still called Junior Assistant Mistresses.  Some of them have left the service at the age of sixty. <Col N="551" /> Others of them are reaching a ripe age, and they still write themselves down as Junior Assistant Mistresses. Because they are not termed &ldquo;assistants&rdquo; they are left outside the pension scheme.  When that Act was passed in 1879 there were no Junior Assistant Mistresses.  There were principal teachers and assistant teachers, but because they were deemed not to be assistants or principals, but only Junior Assistant Mistresses, they do not come within the scheme.  Now, these two classes, on reaching the age of retirement, having given forty years' service to the State, are entitled to no pension or no retiring gratuity whatsoever. That is a condition of affairs that the Minister will, I am sure, say at once is not desirable.</P>
    <P>In 1920, when the negotiations took place between the Commissioners of Education, the Treasury and the teachers, and when the new schemes of salaries were introduced, they were framed and accepted on the distinct understanding that these two classes would be brought in under this scheme. If the Minister looks up the records in his office he will find that that is so, and the only thing that prevented them being put on the pension list was the fact that the members of the Civil Service Arbitration Board, who made this settlement, were not empowered to deal with pension matters.  The matter was taken up immediately by the Commissioners of National Education. Then the change came, and we are waiting still for something to be done.</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister a type of case that is occurring, and occurring rather frequently.  The Minister knows that the fully-qualified assistant who is on the pension list in a school in the country must give up her position if the average falls below forty.  She is then eligible to be appointed a Junior Assistant Mistress, because these can be appointed on a lower average than in the case of a fully-qualified teacher. There have been cases of women with over twenty years' service who have lost their position as fully qualified assistants, and have become Junior Assistant Mistresses.  Really, and as a matter of fact, nothing has happened in the <Col N="552" /> actual schools.  To-day she is an assistant teacher and to-morrow, because of the reason I have mentioned, she is a Junior Assistant Mistress.  As a result of that she is knocked off the pension list.  A case has occurred quite recently which has created a very peculiar hardship. One of these women had twenty years' service.  She would thus be entitled to a quarter of her salary after twenty years' service; that is to say, twenty-eightieths of her salary.  The average went down and she became a Junior Assistant Mistress.  A few months afterwards her health broke down and she had to retire, and was entitled to no pension whatever, just because she was called a &ldquo;Junior Assistant Mistress.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister knows and realises the position.  It has been brought to his notice on many occasions. I hope he will be able to say this evening, with some degree of definiteness, what is the position at the moment and what he intends to do with regard to bringing these two classes of teachers within the pension list.  It has been done in Northern Ireland.  The Northern Ministry have carried out the pledges that were made to the teachers as a whole in 1920, and the Government of Northern Ireland, as soon as they got an opportunity of doing it, made the matter right.  These two classes of teachers I speak of now are on the pension list of Northern Ireland.  It is a peculiar thing to say here, taking the case of convent teachers, that because a woman teacher in a Convent School rather than in a school under lay teachers, she is thereby debarred from the right of receiving a pension from the Free State, whereas if she crosses the border, if there is a border now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When she enters the Convent School in Northern Ireland she becomes entitled to go on the pension list.  I think it will require some argument on the part of the Minister to convince us that this state of affairs should continue.  In stating the position, the Minister ought to say something more promising than that the matter will be looked into, or that <Col N="553" /> it is engaging attention.  We have had numerous replies of that kind, but they do not get us any further.  Many of the points raised in the course of this debate were raised last year and the preceding year and we got very much the same type of replies.  I am just wondering whether the circulation of last year's debates would not have served the purpose of this discussion which has already lasted over two or three days.  I would press the Minister to tell us what the position is with regard to these two classes of people, what his intentions are, and how soon he hopes to be in a position to make the definite announcement that those teachers are brought within the pension list.</P>

      <P>I desire to draw the attention of the Minister to the case of some highly respectable old men and women, ex-teachers, who came into the service prior to 1879.  I understand that was the year the National Teachers' Pension Act was passed. These respectable old people are at the present time existing on disgracefully inadequate pensions.  In my own locality there is an old man who gave good and faithful service to the State and whose pupils are leaders of the professions in various parts of the country.  That old man is existing on the disgraceful pension of £70 a year, a sum hardly sufficient to provide food for him, not to speak of clothes and boots.  I maintain it is a disgraceful thing for the Department of Education to have these respectable old people living on pensions so miserable and inadequate.  I have not the slightest hesitation in describing that condition of things as disgraceful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also direct attention to the necessity for the provision of meals for school children in the congested areas. I have certain schools in mind in my own part of the country, and I believe that there food is more necessary than <Col N="554" /> education.  I do not think that any Deputy, or any substantial man in the country, would object to paying a small contribution for the provision of substantial meals for children in congested areas.  The time is getting very short and I do not wish to elaborate my argument. I would, however, strongly recommend the Minister to look into those matters I have touched upon.  If he can do anything for the respectable old people I have referred to, who are living on disgraceful and inadequate pensions, he would be merely doing justice.  Their cases should be inquired into, with a view to increasing their pensions and giving them at least £2 a week.  No man or woman can keep up a respectable appearance and live on anything less than £2 a week.  In some instances persons have not even £1 a week.</P>

      <P>What I was going to say has been anticipated by Deputy White.  Year after year, as has been stated in the course of this debate, these matters of pensions have been touched upon.  Such matters, and particularly the position of junior assistant mistresses, with their peculiar history, are a blot upon the decency of education. I am sure the Minister, with his broadmindedness, will probably have seen already that that is the state of affairs.  It is the fact that in these small things, which would mean an infinitesimal amount of expense to the Minister for Finance, very grave injustice and deep grievance are felt. Deputy O'Connell has forcibly pressed those matters on the Minister's attention. My purpose in rising is to appeal to the Minister, in whom I have every confidence, to remedy those matters. They are very small in the aggregate, and I hope that he will endeavour to <Col N="555" /> have them composed and that he will remove the existing grievances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies have been pressing in the Dáil for consideration of the whole question of pensions to teachers engaged in certain educational work.  It is not right that any one section should have preferential treatment. I want fair treatment with regard to pensions for all sections engaged in teaching.  Deputy O'Connell has rightly drawn attention to some exceptions. I would like to point out that there is a large number of teachers in connection with technical education for whom there is no pension scheme at all.  They are under the administration of the Minister's Department; they are engaged through the local authorities.  Before the Minister replies, I would suggest that this whole question of pensions wants careful consideration, and it should be put on a fair basis.  I think it should embrace all engaged in the teaching profession. We have had considerable differences with regard to school pensions.  I am a member of a local authority that was called upon to pay a considerable sum per annum by way of pensions to certain teachers.  That local authority did not pay one-third of the salary of those teachers, but it is called upon to pay the entire pensions.  That is common to all local authorities.</P>
      <P>So I say this whole question of pensions requires careful consideration, and ought to be put on a fair and businesslike basis.  I hope it is from that point of view that the Minister will consider it rather than from the point of view of remedying one or two individual cases.</P>

      <P>I rise only to seek a little information.  I have often said what I could in favour of old pensioned teachers whose pensions are miserably small.  I would again support those who put forward their claims, and ask the Minister's careful attention to their really sad case.  The information I want to get is as to the position of the National Teachers' Pension Fund.  I have been told that in 1917 the fund was over 2¾ millions, and that in 1921 it increased to 3¼ millions, <Col N="556" /> but I have not been able to get any figures indicating the magnitude of the fund at present.  If the Minister could supply them, I would be glad.  The fund probably has increased considerably since.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity of saying a word in favour of the claims of the lay teachers in convent schools for inclusion in the pension scheme of national teachers.  We all know the valuable work that is done by these lay teachers, but very few members of the House know their difficulties and how they are separated from other teachers in the way of treatment. This matter affects a number of teachers who have spent between thirty and forty years in the service of the convent schools.  It may be asked why the case of these teachers was not raised before and in another Parliament. For many years these teachers and those who were supporting them did not fight their claims with the necessary vim, because in doing so in a foreign Parliament they would have to raise a question of religion.  I was associated in the past with a party which was asked not to raise those points in a way that might bring any discredit on the convent schools.  We could not see our way to do so, and we were always told that very shortly we would have a Parliament of our own, and that these convent school teachers would get consideration from a home Government which a foreign Government would not give them.  Just before the Treaty was signed these teachers received recognition from the British Government, and they were placed in a little better position than previously, but they were told that, having got recognition, they would get consideration after one year, and their claims for pensions would be considered.  In the meantime the Treaty was signed, but the trouble started in Ireland, and the convent teachers, not anxious to embarrass the Government, did not press their claims.  I am aware that there is one teacher, at least, who has given her lifetime, practically forty years, to the service of the convent schools, As the law stands, teachers in convent schools similarly placed to that woman are not eligible for pensions.  I <Col N="557" /> think that the time has arrived when no member in any quarter of the House need be afraid of drawing attention to the condition of such teachers.  We are not going to be accused of raising an attack on the managers of the schools when we ask that a friendly Government should consider the claims of the Convent School teachers, and that such teachers be placed on a level with all others entitled to a pension.  There is no doubt that the Convent School teachers were under-paid for many years.  They have now their own Government and they hope that the injustices of the past will be remedied.  I join with other members in making a special appeal to the Government, especially to the Minister for Education, to see that these women, many of whom are almost ready to retire, will get fair consideration and that after their long service in educating the children of the State they will not be allowed to retire penniless.  I trust that the Minister will see that they will be provided with reasonable pensions in their old age.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy White, I should make it clear that I have no special authority over existing pensions.  There are cases of very much greater hardship than the particular instance which he has quoted.  Deputy O'Connell has almost indicated the reply which he would like to get.  I presume it is not an opinion that he wants.  I would be told at the next opportunity that I contented myself with an expression of opinion, but then the Deputy himself has stated that he is aware that my Department is in communication with the Department of Finance with regard to pensions for those two classes of teachers whose cases he has brought forward.  I wonder what he expects me to say under the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Dáil is of opinion that the establishment of Agricultural Credit Societies has failed to afford the necessary relief to farmers who lost their live stock through disease in 1924-25, and that other steps should be taken immediately to introduce a system of short-term loans at low interest so that the farms may be re-stocked.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This matter has been very fully debated already, and I have no desire to go over again all the facts and figures which have been given in this House. As far back as April last I tried to convince the Dáil and Ministers that a serious problem existed in the country and it still exists.  On the 29th April I moved:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Dáil is of opinion that immediate action should be taken by the Government, either by the granting of loans, or otherwise, to enable farmers to re-stock their lands, in cases where the owners have lost their stock through disease.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be said that the result of that motion was to bring about the decision by the Minister for Agriculture in conjunction with the Minister for Finance to set aside a sum of £100,000 for the establishment of credit societies throughout the areas where disease existed so as to enable farmers to do something towards re-stocking <Col N="560" /> their land.  That effort has not met with any success, and there is little possibility that that method then decided on will solve the problem; in fact, I am convinced it will not do so.  I wonder if the Minister is able to tell us what the problem really amounts to.  In May I put a question to the Minister.  Part of it was as to whether any steps would be taken, either by employing the Gárda Síochána, or otherwise, to ascertain the magnitude of the problem and the loss sustained.  The reply I received was in the affirmative.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell the Dáil approximately what the losses are. Since I put that question the Gárda Síochána have collected the tillage returns. If they have done their duty they have gone to every farmstead in the Saorstát, and should have been able to get those returns.  There would be little trouble involved in this.  It merely amounted to an instruction from the Minister for Justice, in conjunction with the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, that these returns should be collected and made available.  I hope the Minister will be able to produce them, and we will then be able to know what losses the farmers have really sustained in 1924-25.  We will have some idea then as to the amount of money required to make it possible for the farmers to do something towards re-stocking their lands.  I am one of those who hoped that the means adopted by the Minister for the solution of this problem would be successful to some extent at least.  I was prepared to do what I could, and did do it, to get the scheme taken up by the farmers, but I have to admit that I saw no possibility whatever of their doing so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In my county we came to the conclusion that if the project was to get a fair chance of success it should be outside politics altogether. Towards that end I had discussions with Deputy O'Reilly, who is <Col N="561" /> on the Government benches, and Deputy Cole.  As a result of these discussions we attended the first meeting of the new County Council in Cavan.  That Council is representative of every political party in the State.  I think 31 out of the 32 members are either farmers or business men.  We put before them the proposal to establish credit societies.  Many of them were Government supporters, and one would have expected them to be very enthusiastic about it.  I have to admit that our reception at that meeting could hardly be considered a favourable one.</P>
      <P>We were permitted to put our case, but it was very evident from the point of view expressed by the men present that they had no hopes that our suggestions would be taken up, or if they were taken up, that they would meet with any measure of success.  I was not satisfied with that, and I attended meeting after meeting in different parts of the county.  I attended three times in succession in one district.  The organiser responsible for the work in the district was present on the last occasion, but the result of all our efforts was failure to establish a credit society. If the Minister wants to put a question to me he can do so now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Now, apart from what I did, the Minister informed me yesterday that on the 26th June last a decision was come to in this Dáil that these credit societies would be set up. We are practically now at the 26th November, and in that time, as regards all the areas affected, the Minister informs me that there are eight new credit societies established.  Out of the sum of £100,000 which was voted in the Dáil, and which if not taken up will in the ordinary course go back into the Exchequer, a sum of £3,500 has been paid out to existing credit societies.  I do not know whether the Minister sees <Col N="562" /> in that the kernel of success.  To me at least, it points out one thing clearly, and that is that the method the Minister adopted for the solution of this problem was not sound.  It has not met with any measure of success, and is not going to, and it is because that has forced itself upon me that I put down this motion.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether it is necessary to go over the ground again and argue that there is a problem there.  I think that was accepted, because otherwise the House would not have come to the decision to pass this Vote at all.  Apart from what the Minister has done himself or has not done, I went into one district and asked the farmers there to get me a correct return showing the losses that had been sustained in it. The district is in my constituency.  It is a half parish, comprised of 22 townlands. I have the list here that I got, and I am prepared to pass it over to the Minister with the letter which accompanied it.  In this district, which comprises 22 townlands, the return shows, taking one farmer with another, that there was in it a loss of 380 head of cattle.  I see that the Minister smiles</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps you can afford to.  That total loss of 380 head of cattle is made up of 56 cows, 42 two-year-olds, and the remainder of yearlings. That is a district in which the farmers would be expected to meet their liabilities to the Minister's Department just as farmers in any other district are expected to meet their liabilities.  In that district, at the present time, the Ministry is pressing the farmers to meet their obligations to the State.  I am not going to go into Deputy Crowley's figures as regards Kerry, nor am I going to go into the figures given in this Dáil from Leitrim and sent up, I understand, through Cumann na nGaedheal, showing the conditions there.  I do reaffirm that the problem still exists, and that it is not going to be solved by the method the Minister employs.  The Minister has to face that fact, as has every other Deputy.  I do not think that we can be satisfied to <Col N="563" /> pursue a policy of drift.  We have given this method five months&mdash;since June last&mdash;to see what the result would be. How far have they gone?  The Ministry has paid over £3,500 in five months.  The losses are now 12 months old.  Very few of them have been replaced, and they cannot be replaced, if the Government do not consider that it is their responsibility to come to the assistance of the farmers in some way or other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the Minister will ask what else is to be done.  When the debate on this question took place in the Dáil in June last, I stated that I was prepared to do everything I could to help.  I also pointed out to the Minister that I felt that his method was not going to get the country out of the difficulty.  I felt it my duty to issue that warning, and I regret to have to say now that what I prophesied then has turned out to be true.  That is no satisfaction to us.  It would be much better if we had been able to get these societies brought into existence&mdash;to get them functioning and to get enough money through them to enable farmers to re-stock their lands and carry on.  We have not succeeded. What is the alternative and what can be done?  In these days, when some members of the Government Party and a great many outside this Dáil altogether seem very keen in trying to offer a solution for the difficulties the agriculturist has to meet: in tendering advice and suggesting new agricultural policies, all the time pointing to the one thing, or claiming the one thing&mdash;that the Government must come to the help of the farmer in some way or other&mdash; I want to give it as my opinion that it is no use for any party in this State to make the pretence of trying to solve the difficulties of the farmers either now or in the future by new methods in agriculture or by any change in the agricultural policy while such a problem as the present one exists, and while no real effort is being made on the part of responsible Ministers of the State to come to the assistance of farmers in a way that is going to be a real help to them.  It is very difficult to make farmers believe, when advice is tendered and suggestions are made about what is to be done for them <Col N="564" /> and what they ought to do for themselves, that many of their advisers and counsellors are sincere in their advice at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister smiles when I make reference to the district to which I referred as the half parish in my constituency. It is the half running along the River Erne.  In Northern Ireland across the Border the losses to the farmer were just as great as in the Saorstát. Now at the very time when the members of the Saorstát Government seemed to be very keen to help the farmer one would expect that the Government of the Saorstát would be prepared to do, at least, as much for the farmers of the Saorstát as the Government of Northern Ireland was not only prepared to do, but did, across the Border.  The Minister is aware how the Northern Government met this problem and the efforts that they made to try and solve it.  I have here circulars issued by the Government of Northern Ireland showing the methods that they were to employ to try to help the farmers in their districts over their difficulties.  With permission of the Dáil I will read them.  This is from the Ministry of Agriculture in the Government of Northern Ireland:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government has decided to consider applications for loans at 2½ per cent. interest, from bona fide farmers who, owing to the unfavourable season, have incurred losses of live stock since the 1st of October, 1924.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Loans will be granted only for the purpose of replacing such live stock losses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Loans will be issued through the various Northern Ireland Branches of the following Banks:&mdash;Bank of Ireland, Belfast Banking Co., Ltd., Hibernian Bank, Munster and Leinster Bank, National Bank, Northern Banking Company Ltd., Provincial Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Full particulars regarding these loans together with forms of application can be obtained from any Branch of the Banks mentioned above.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Forms of application will not be issued direct to intending borrowers by the Ministry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" />&ldquo;Applications on the prescribed form should be made immediately and no application received in the Ministry after the 31st August, 1925, will be considered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the same month that we were debating the problem here, and decided to vote £100,000 for the solution of this problem in the Saorstát. There is a further circular which was issued in August, and which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government of Northern Ireland has varied in certain particulars its scheme of short term loans to assist bona fide farmers who have suffered losses of live stock.  The latest date for lodging applications for these loans with the Ministry for Agriculture has now been extended from the 31st August to the 30th September, 1925.  A further concession has been made in the matter of repayment.  Instead of all loans being repayable on the 31st December, 1925, the repayment date will be the 31st December, 1926, and any loans already made which terminate on the earlier date will be renewed automatically to the later date. Forms of application, with particulars of the scheme and so on, will be available at all banks in Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And it goes on to say:&mdash;&ldquo;Loans will be granted only for the purpose of replacing live stock losses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have a communication accompanying that from a citizen of Northern Ireland stating that the farmers in his district get loans of from £15 to £200, Now the poverty-stricken Government of Northern Ireland, with its very limited resources, and what we are supposed to believe as its very little consideration for agriculture, can see its way to make arrangements with the banks, most of which are functioning in the Saorstát, to loan out money to the farmers at 2½ per cent. to enable them to re-stock their lands.  If a farmer in the Saorstát sought a loan from a credit society he would have to pay 5 per cent., and no loan could be available from a credit society if the farmers of the district, whether they had <Col N="566" /> it or not, did not come along to establish a credit society by paying down their money.  That is the real reason why these societies are not set up.  The Minister is conscious of the fact; he shakes his head, but my experience of the district I went into&mdash;and I took a particular interest in it, because it was one of the worst&mdash;was this: I had there all the men who wanted to borrow, but not one man who wanted to lend. They do not want to let out their money on loan simply because they were going to lend the money to their neighbours to re-stock their lands, and if they had money&mdash;and a few of them might have&mdash;they were not going to do any such thing, and the result was that in no district was it possible to get men together prepared to put down deposits to establish one of these societies.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Minister to show what the real magnitude of the problem is, what the real losses were, what the value of the cattle lost is.  He has got to show how that loss can be replaced, so that we can hope to stimulate production, or he has got to show what he is going to do to stimulate production, or what the Government party proposes in this way to stimulate production, or if anything is to be done.  The Minister has got to show, too, whether it is sound policy or not, to put the hard-working farmer, who has been unfortunate, on his feet again and enable him to carry on this work and pay his way, and the Minister has to look at the other side and see what the consequences are to be if that is not done.  Who has a greater obligation to the farmer than the Government?  I admitted, in other debates, that the difficulties confronting the Ministry in the matter of short term loans and the difficulty in administering these would undoubtedly be great.  The Minister, I know, will ask how we are to get the correct returns; how are we to know the man who really lost, and he may raise other points, but I say if the Ministry had gone about their work when the tillage returns were being collected by the Gárda there would be very little trouble in getting the correct returns to show what the losses were.  If we have to get men to make affidavits to <Col N="567" /> show whether they sustained loss or not that could be done.</P>
    <P>I say what the Government of Northern Ireland have done for the farmers of their area should be done by the Government of the Saorstát for the farmers here.  The farmers of the country expect it of the Government. I hope the Government are not going to say no.  I hope they will accept the situation as it is and try to find some solution of it.  If the Minister is not going to offer any addition to the offer already made he might as well withdraw his offer, but at the same time he will have to recognise, as I recognise, that the problem still exists, and if that is so, it is the Minister's obligation to try and solve the problem, and if he does not face his responsibilities in the matter I do not see how any other party in the State can do anything in the matter.</P>
    <P>One does not want to go further now than to try and represent things as they really are.  When the Minister moved towards the establishment of credit societies, I undertook to do my best in that direction, as I felt they should get every chance.  They have got every chance.  As far as I am concerned I did, at least, as much as any Deputy, and a good deal more than many Deputies on the Government Benches.  My efforts have not met with success, and I come here to say that the problem still exists, and to ask the Dáil to say that some other means must be employed by the Minister to solve the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDoyle" hpid="Mr. M. DOYLE Mr. M. DOYLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I thoroughly agree with Deputy Baxter's description of the situation throughout the Saorstát, as far as credit societies are concerned.  Like Deputy Baxter, I have done all that was in my power to establish credit societies in my own county.  On three or four occasions I travelled over 30 miles to meetings to try and establish these societies. I attended the county council meetings and brought the matter up there, and also at the County Committee of Agriculture. I tried to spread the light by having credit societies established in County Wexford.  In a good many districts the people are hard hit by the <Col N="568" /> losses they have sustained.  Many districts are practically without cattle, and others suffered great losses of sheep.  I hoped that the Minister's grant would have led to the establishment of credit societies and that they would have succeeded in doing something for the people.</P>
      <P>After my experience I have come to the conclusion that the scheme is an utter failure.  Credit societies cannot be established because people who have any money to put on deposit will not touch them, and those who want to avail of them have no money to put into them.  At one meeting it was suggested that a number of persons should raise money in one of the banks.  When it came to finding people to back the bill there were only two ready to sign. We could not possibly do anything towards establishing credit societies in the county.  I think some other plan must be adopted if anything is to be done for the people who have suffered great losses.  We had one supporter at the County Committee of Agriculture. He offered the aid of a society in his own district.  That district did not happen to be one that had been badly affected by losses of cattle or sheep, and the society was only carrying on in the normal way it did for the past fifteen years.  I agree with Deputy Baxter that something ought to be done.  If not, the farmers who have to pay annuities and taxes will have no means of doing so.  Their stocks and their flocks are depleted, and if something is not done immediately to re-stock their lands, I fear these people will not be able to exist on their homesteads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>When this matter was debated previously some Deputies had very little faith in the measures that were decided upon, because, measuring the general feeling from one's own experience, it was felt that those with money were not inclined to lend it out. It is only the Government can lend out money in such a situation, and it is only an independent body that is fearless and does not care what people think would have the courage to recover such money with the aid of the law.  That is past history, and there is no use going <Col N="569" /> back on it now.  What has been done has been a failure.  It has not met the situation.  Deputy Baxter referred to the Minister's answer last evening about the number of societies that have been formed in the Saorstát.  The amount of money lent out was £3,500. That proves that the scheme is a failure. Originally, we were talking about £100,000, and at the time all of us knew that £100,000 would not meet the situation. If it would not, how far could £3,500 go?  I do not think anyone will question the earnestness or the good faith of Deputies on the Farmers' Benches in trying to make the scheme a success.  I heard the Minister asking Deputy Baxter if he had acted on a Committee, and if not, why not.  We are not discussing that.  We are dealing with the question of what is best to be done.  The position is worse now than it was when we were dealing with it before.  Men have tried to carry on with reduced stock and on reduced capital. Naturally they are not in a position to meet their liabilities.  The position is worse not alone for the individual but for the State than it was six months ago.  I may be asked, what remedy do I suggest.  I think the obvious remedy is the remedy tried in the Six Counties. A loan was given there on very generous terms.  What we want here is a loan on generous terms.  I do not favour and I do not ask for grants.  Grants create an atmosphere that is altogether undesirable.  That atmosphere kills self-reliance, and, to my mind, creates a state of mind amongst the mass of the people that is not desirable here or in any other country.  Loans have been tried in this country before.  Loans were advanced by the Department of Public Works and advanced for land purchase.  They have been repaid cent. for cent.  Loans given on Government security will be repaid cent. for cent. and the Government has the machinery to see that they are repaid.  We know what the Six County Government has done in six months.  It has advanced loans at 2½ per cent.  It would be interesting if we had the figures as to what amount was actually lent.</P>

      <P>£37,000 operating in a few little counties while £3,500 has been advanced in the Twenty-six Counties.  I think it would be good business for the Government to guarantee such loans and good business for the banks, who are lending our money in England, to give this money at 2½ per cent.  It would be good business for the banks and better business for the nation.  It may be asked why the farmers do not come to one another's assistance and why men with money do not help men who have none.  Anyone who asks that question should ask himself what he would have done if the circumstances were his own.  We have not yet reached that ideal stage of human perfection and I think it will be some time before we do reach it.  I think the Six Counties method is good enough for us as a trial.  Something must be done as the problem cannot be allowed to remain as it is.  The distress and the need is greater to-day than six months ago.</P>
      <P>Look at our actual exports to-day. How much have they dwindled in numbers? Value may be misleading.  When I talk about numbers I am talking about something that requires a lot of explanation.  It is a loss to the nation apart from the loss to the individual. There is no use in asking &ldquo;What help did you give?&rdquo; The only question we can ask honestly is: &ldquo;What is the best to be done and what is the best way to go about it?&rdquo; This is a national and not an individual question.  We are looking at it from that point.  I know the same point was taken by the Government and certainly, by the Minister. I know the proposition has been put up by the Minister in the hope that he would get a response.  The response has not been given for obvious reasons.  It is up to us to meet this question in an effective manner and the only effective manner is that of a State guaranteed loan.  I have had occasion to meet people in North Kerry and Clare for the last few weeks and I am assured that the poverty brought about by this visitation is more apparent amongst these people than it was nine months ago.  Just now this effect is made more obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that I ought to say <Col N="571" /> this, but I will risk it.  In one sense we ought to be thankful that the loss to the country was not greater.  England will be in nearly a similar plight to us.  If you ask the butchers in our slaughter-yards about Scotch, English and Irish cattle, they will tell you that the livers of a considerable percentage of those animals, with our rainfall, were not in anything like perfect order, and are not yet.  The experience of men who have fed cattle consistently is that cattle never gave a worse response to food given them than they gave for the last six months.  Englishmen and Scotchmen have the same experience. I am sure we are going to be met in a genuine and business-like way.  We do not want generosity but a business-like method of dealing with the matter, and the only method is by a State loan at a generous and reasonable percentage.</P>

Every sensible man will agree that if this motion is passed, farmers throughout the country will take it that the movement to establish credit societies for this purpose has been a complete failure, and they will be very slow to start the credit society movement for any other purpose.  That is the great point I want to make.  I agree thoroughly that this problem is a terrible problem and that it needs to be dealt with, but I would point out that there are a great many other problems of the same kind as this which can be met by this means, and that these credit societies can be made into a permanent <Col N="575" /> means for dealing with every problem practically that affects the economic life of the small farmer.

I say that in this movement for the establishment of credit societies you have a means which enables the farmers by themselves and of their own strength, if they would only use it, to deal with a great many other problems that affect them, and affect them perhaps nearly as badly as this particular problem&mdash;the losses through fluke&mdash;and I point out one problem that exists in my own constituency, the supply of pigs.  I suggest that that could be met to a large extent by the development of credit societies on this basis, and I <Col N="576" /> hold that you will make it very difficult to deal with that or any other problem in this way if you pass the motion in Deputy Baxter's terms. What Deputies on the other side want to do is to go on the old system that we have always had, a system by which the farmers are prepared to do practically nothing themselves but simply to sit down and wait for the Government to do everything for them.</P>

      <P>And we have often had complaints from Farmer Deputies themselves that there was a great deal too much of a tendency in the country for people, instead of dealing with their own problems in their own way and in their own localities, to look up here to Dublin for somebody to do the needful for them and to do practically everything for them.  There is still available for the purpose of these credit societies, as has been pointed out, a sum of over £90,000 given by the Government, which would enable the farmers to invest their money very advantageously and at a very good rate of interest.  If it is not possible for the farmers to make use of that money to help themselves it is very hard to see how it is possible for them to be helped in any way.  It is a fact that societies of this kind have been set up in some counties since this arrangement was entered into, and these societies have been a success in themselves in some of the poorest counties. In giving an impetus to the setting up of these societies the Government took a means&mdash;that of inducing people in every locality to rely on their own resources, and of inducing them to make up their minds that their best help is themselves&mdash;of inducing the big farmers and the small farmers to come together and recognise that this problem, like every other problem of their lives, is common to them.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. It is really a wise amendment in so far that it only suggests that we should hold on to these credit societies for a little longer.  I think that both Deputy Baxter and the leader of the Party, Deputy Gorey, were skating on very thin ice when they stated that nobody would come forward to assist their fellow-constituents and their fellow-farmers, although they had the money on deposit in the banks.</P>

      <P>They come to us and they say to the Government: &ldquo;The <Col N="578" /> rich must assist the poor; the Government must help the people.&rdquo;  They are quite right from their point of view in suggesting that the Government should produce all the capital, while they keep their own money on deposit.  That is a very charming way to do it, but they do not suggest that the rich should help the poor.  You would imagine that one section would help members of the same section in difficulty if there were no very great losses attending the production of that assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BEAMISH</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about a far more serious thing, which is that the rich farmer does not come forward to support a reasonable society.  Deputy Gorey practically stated that if they lent the money, the Government would have to collect it, and he practically put the onus on the Government.  If that is the case, I say that the Government ought to be extremely careful in lending money to the farmers when a section of the farmers say that they themselves are afraid to do so, and that they would require the Government to get back the money.  That is not what I would call a reasonable loan.  Farmers know their own character a great deal better than we do, and if they warn us that there would be considerable difficulty in getting this money back, I say that they should not try to borrow money from the Government.  Let them go back again, having been refused it, and see if this credit question could not be reasonably supported by themselves.  If the danger exists that the money could not be recovered, I quite see why a farmer with money on deposit should not advance it, and, if that is so, it would be equally dangerous for the Government to do so, and equally dangerous for all of us who would have to pay for it.  It, therefore, seems perfectly fair that the amendment should be passed, with the object of affording the farmers an opportunity that they have often found in the fairs.  When they do not get the price they ask, they have to take a slightly smaller price, and that smaller <Col N="579" /> price here might overcome their natural diffidence in collecting this money and in producing it for the sake of those who have suffered.  Everybody recognises that they have suffered, but why should we not first see that they would be generous enough to go to these deposit accounts that Deputy Gorey mentioned and produce the money?  The Government will advance two-thirds, and they are asked to risk one-third.  If it is so dangerous that they do not like to risk one-third, I should think that the Government would refuse to risk two-thirds.  That follows from their argument: they have told us that it is too dangerous to advance this money.  I do not believe that it would be dangerous.  I believe that if the farmers would reconsider the matter, and see whether it would not be possible, through the deposits and by other means, to raise this one-third as a security, it could be done.  If they think that the Government might advance the whole of the money, naturally it will not come out of these deposits.</P>

      <P>I quite agree that the Northern Government did do the thing, but I do not suppose you will go to the Northern Government for every example of what you are going to do, or else we would have been together long before now.  The Northern Government are linked up with the British Government, and they may get assistance. We have no knowledge as to that, and until we have that knowledge we cannot argue the question, and certainly we cannot be dictated to on the grounds of what they do; we can take our own way.  The farmers come to the Government when there are certain deposits procurable in the banks to assist, but which are not procured because the danger of not being able to collect the money again is so great. The argument put up to the Government naturally is &ldquo;You must risk the danger,&rdquo; because we have been warned in the most kindly manner that there is this enormous danger.  I think that <Col N="580" /> we ought to try to see if it could be done, because the suffering is there and it ought to be met in some way.  That is actually agreed on, and nobody can go beyond that.  The only question is, what medicine is to be taken in order to cure.  The farmers want the medicine to be procured altogether by the Government, and we suggest in the amendment that we should again try to see if a third of the mixture could not be given by the patient and two-thirds by the doctor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the amendment is proposed on behalf of the Cumann na nGaedheal, inasmuch as it has been spoken to by two Deputies who are not usually in attendance, or at least who do not usually speak on these matters, and that it is followed by fair consideration and the prompting of the Minister.  It is quite clear from the speeches that we have just heard that, boiled down, the policy of the Government Party in this matter is that if the wealthier farmers refuse to come to the aid of the societies by giving their credit to the poorer farmers, then the poorer farmers may stew in their own juice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wealthier farmers have had an opportunity under this scheme of coming to the assistance of the poorer farmers who have lost cattle and other stock, and are thereby suffering.  The fact that so small a number of societies has been established, and the fact that so small a number of pounds has been advanced, notwithstanding the efforts of the promoters of the scheme, whether Deputy Tierney or Deputies of any other part of the House, still remain to be considered.  Notwithstanding the failure even in County Mayo or County Cork, these societies have not been established and only £3,000 or £4,000 have been advanced.  There was admittedly great need, or the scheme itself would not have been brought forward; admittedly it was an emergency.  That is admitted by Deputies in all parts of the House.  But, notwithstanding the advocacy of Deputy Tierney, Deputy Beamish and others in their own localities, they have failed to establish more than a very small number of societies.  They say that <Col N="581" /> because large farmers will not come to the assistance of the small farmers we are not going to assist the small farmers; nothing can be done for the small farmers; the State will not and must not be allowed to give to the small farmers, if they can help it, even though the large farmers will not assist them by adding to their credit. That is placing the small farmer in the west and south, and in other parts of the country, in a very peculiar light in view of the Government's attitude.</P>

Now, none of these things is a point of order. When these things are constantly being raised on one side we must allow them on both sides.  I would prefer if they were not raised at all.  Perhaps Deputies will remember what I suggested before: that we are here to listen to other people who do not agree with us and, possibly, if we listen patiently, we will explain ourselves more intelligently than by interrupting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the point of order is not accepted.  The Minister has tried to explain what Deputy Beamish intended to say, but I think that Deputy Beamish's speech was quite clear and understandable to the other Deputies in the House, if not to the Minister or to Deputy Beamish. The argument, not only of Deputy Beamish but of Deputy Tierney, was to the same effect.  It was not put quite so bluntly by Deputy Tierney as by Deputy Beamish.  It was that there is no necessity for any State assistance for the small farmers, that they can wait, be patient.  If they wait long enough the cattle will come to them somehow, in a Christmas stocking, perhaps. At any rate, there is no necessity for any State assistance.  There is no necessity to introduce a system of short term loans at low interest.  There is a method at hand in the system introduced in June by which, if they can only induce their richer neighbours&mdash; their neighbours who have not lost stock, the shopkeepers in the near towns, who are presumed to have plenty of credit&mdash;to come to their assistance, then the scheme that has been proposed is a perfect one, and will undoubtedly afford reasonable means of <Col N="584" /> relieving the farmers who have lost their stock.  That is a pleasant message to give to the constituents of the Deputies who have spoken.  I am rather surprised at&mdash;perhaps I should admire the hardihood of&mdash;the Deputies in putting forward that as a message to those farmers who have lost stock through fluke.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, a well-known trick to put an amendment forward asking the House to agree to a thing which they will all agree to unanimously in the hope that, by producing this amendment, which will be generally agreed to, they will be forced into refusing the proposition that was originally put forward.  The amendment is to the effect that the House also considers that the development of credit societies will provide a system particularly suitable to the permanent needs of small farmers.  That might be added; nobody would object to it.  I understand, at any rate, that it is the view of the majority of farmers in the country who have thought about these things that these societies do provide a means whereby men who are needing loans for the provision of stock, or such like, may be able to get them through the credit societies.  The credit societies are institutions for normal times and circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>That is the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The permanent needs of small farmers might well be satisfactorily dealt with by credit societies, but now you are dealing with an abnormal situation&mdash;one that involves the loss of a large number of cattle spread all over the country, owned by poor, small farmers, who have not the means of substituting new cattle for them.  They have lost their capital in fact, and, as has been pointed out, in some districts numbers of small farmers have lost all their cattle. The credit societies are supposed to be institutions which would allow, in normal times, all those small farmers to come together to assist each other in times of need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was never expected, and it is quite uneconomic to imagine, that if they are all in need at the same time, <Col N="585" /> if they are all bankrupt at the same time, their combined credit is going to be of value.  That is the proposition of Deputy Professor Tierney, that these credit societies afford a reasonable method of relieving the farmers who have lost their stock through fluke. Now, if he wanted us to accept that proposition he should have brought us some evidence that they did, in fact, afford a reasonable method of relieving the farmers.  He should have brought us some evidence of the success of his propaganda.  He should have brought us some evidence as to the number of societies that have been formed under his influence or the number of societies in any other part of the country that have been formed to meet this emergency.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the Minister's information was quite good enough.  In June last he gave us some kind of assurance that the credit societies would be effective, with the assistance that was given, to meet the emergency; but it is quite clear to me that if they have only developed to this extent, they are not going to meet the emergency, unless the possibility remained that the Minister is able to show us that there is a very large number just on the point of springing up.  That might meet my doubts and hesitancy. I am very much afraid that he will not have any evidence of that kind to put forward and, in the absence of any evidence that these societies are going to meet the emergency, then I think it is a reasonable proposition made by Deputy Baxter that other steps should be taken to introduce a system of short-term loans immediately at low interest so that the farms may be restocked. The case that has been made on behalf of the amendment, as I said at the beginning, is a case which relies upon the wealthier farmer or shopkeeper coming to the aid of the group of poorer farmers who have no credit, no stock, and no value to warrant credit, and, if they cannot get either the wealthy farmer or the shopkeeper to come to their aid, then nothing will be done for them.  That is the proposition of Deputy Tierney and Deputy Beamish and the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.</P>

      <P>Yes, meant seriously; the Farmer members of the Cumann Na nGaedheal organisation would have been put up to expound the benefit which it will confer on those poor people.  I hope before the discussion is ended we will hear these farmers on the Government side, and that they will expound, here, in the Dáil, the sentiments they have expressed in other parts of the country.  Now, we had a lecture on credit societies.  We had a lecture on the benefits that would accrue to the farmers by the institution of credit societies.  We agree that they <Col N="587" /> are a very fine proposition; but this is an emergency.  Credit societies are all very well in ordinary times, but when an emergency exists, are we to permit these men to be made bankrupt? You should start off by doing what could have been done ten years ago, and what can be done next year; but at the present time an emergency exists, and we are to do nothing because this co-operation has not been brought to fruition.  Is it not evident, if only £3,500 has been made available to the small farmer out of £100,000 that was voted, that in the circumstances that now exist, credit societies have failed?</P>
      <P>Deputy Professor Tierney brought forward his amendment because he said the adoption of the motion would destroy the people's faith in the credit societies.  That was the ostensible reason; but he let the cat out of the bag, because he said what he really meant was that it was politically inexpedient to permit Deputy Baxter's motion to be carried in the Dáil.  He did not care whether it was going to help the farmers.  It was a question with him how would the country accept the fact that Deputy Baxter had brought forward a motion here which would help the people, and it was not brought forward from the other side. There was another thing.  Deputy Baxter's motion did not hide the truth; it told the truth.  It expressly stated that the credit societies have failed to do what they were intended to do, and for that reason this amendment, the amendment brought forward by the two non-farmer Deputies, was brought forward with the idea of obscuring the truth and trying to save the face of the Government for their inactivity in a time of stress.</P>

      <P>I gave notice to-day that on the adjournment I would raise the question of the British Food Prices Commission and the necessity of controlling prices in the Saorstát. I did so with a view to getting more information with regard to the answer given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce at question time to-day when he said it was the intention of the Executive Council to bring forward a resolution in both Houses of the Oireachtas to establish a tribunal under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act of 1921, as to the cost of certain articles of general consumption.  Now, after hammering away at this question of the control of prices for more than two years at intervals, I feel as if I were entering the promised land when I have actually got a promise from the Government that they are going to take effective action in the matter.  Before I begin this evening's <i>Te Deum Laudamus</i>, I would like a little more information.  It would be a grave misfortune if this tribunal that is to be set up shared the fate of the Commission on Prices, of which certain Deputies were members about three years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to criticise that Commission, and, if I did, I believe Deputy Wilson would deal with me, but there is no doubt that the result of that Commission was not successful.  I think that that was partly due to the time at which it was sitting.  In the winter of 1922 and the spring of 1923 people were not so vitally concerned with prices as with the question as to whether they would be alive or dead next day.  Public opinion was not, therefore, in support of the Commission, and the Commission was also gravely handicapped because it had not compulsory powers to call witnesses and make them answer questions put to them.  I gather that this tribunal to be set up will have these powers under the Tribunals of Inquiry Act.  I gather that any person who refuses to appear as witness or refuses to answer questions put by the tribunal will be reported to the High Court, and the High Court, if they think fit, can deal with this as being contempt of court.  This will make the Commission a much more effective body <Col N="589" /> than the Commission on Prices.  There is another provision in the Act which I look on with some doubt.  It contemplates the inquiry being held in public.  I desire that everybody should have fair play.  I do not think it would be fair, perhaps, to single out one particular trader&mdash;Deputy Beamish perhaps&mdash;bring him before the inquiry, and make him give evidence on oath as to his business, while you may not call his trade rivals.  I think if the Commission is to be effective, and if it is to get the necessary information, it will require, at least in part, to sit in camera, as people should not fairly be asked to give intimate information about their business in public.  I wonder if the inquiry will have power to obtain information from the Revenue authorities not as to individuals but as to business as a whole.  The British Commission got valuable information from the Inland Revenue.  No names of individuals were mentioned, but they were told that groups of so many butchers and bakers had increased their income tax returns for such and such a period.  I believe that that would be valuable information for this tribunal to get.  I would also like to know when this tribunal will be established, and when will the resolutions be brought forward, as the question is one of urgency. Prices are already showing their seasonal tendency to rise.  I hope there will be no undue delay in establishing the tribunal.  I would not quarrel with delay if it meant getting a better tribunal of more representative men to sit on it, but the matter is one that will not brook long delay.  Then again, will the tribunal be a permanent body? The British Commission, of course, is not a complete guide for us, but it indicates in some respects the directions in which we can go:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What we feel to be required is a continuing association between some permanent organ of the State and the food traders whose business activities we have been examining.  We have, therefore, decided to recommend that your Majesty's Government should immediately consider the advisability of establishing a permanent body, to be called the Food Council, whose duty it shall be to study current and future <Col N="590" /> problems of wheat and meat supplies and prices and to issue periodical reports. We do not contemplate a new Department of State with a considerable staff.  We have in view the formation of a body which, by combining representation of economic, financial, administrative and consuming interests, would gain the confidence of the public and the respect of the business world....  It will act rather as a mediator between producer, trader and consumer, in reconciling for a common end interests which we do not regard as necessarily conflicting.  This idea we develop more fully later.  The Food Council should possess a small staff and should have, as assessors, representatives of the principal food trades. From the Departments of State it would, no doubt, derive the information and assistance which have been freely accorded to your Commissioners.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The tribunal should be permanent, because if you have only a temporary body, those traders and interests who do not wish to give information will stonewall and only give information gradually, and it will have to be drawn out of them, in the hope that they will be able to defer the evil day.  With a permanent body they cannot defer the evil day.  There should be a secretariat or small staff which would report, not to the Minister who could, of course, use the information if he thinks fit, but to a body in the State charged with the supervision of this problem of prices.</P>
    <P>To put it briefly, does the body that the Minister and the Executive Council contemplate correspond to the Commission which sat first or to the Food Council which was set up as a result of the report of the Commission?  I hope that the announcement which the Minister has made will not create false hopes.  There is no patent medicine to cure the problem of high prices.  It is a very difficult and complicated problem and I hope I have never, in dealing with the subject, maintained that it was anything else.  The causes of high prices are not, of course, confined or peculiar to the Saorstát.  They are world-wide and full of ramifications. The Minister, before he reformed, was <Col N="591" /> a professor, so I will not apologise to him for quoting Latin: &ldquo;<i>Felix, ille erat qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas.</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Happy is the man who helped to discover the cause of things.&rdquo;  In this case I think that this particular man, this particular Felix, will have to keep on walking for a considerable time before the causes of these difficulties are discovered.  There is a problem to which this tribunal will have to address itself at once, that is the problem of why the cost of living is higher in Saorstát Eireann than almost anywhere else in Western Europe; why, when prices rise in Saorstát Eireann they rise in double ratio compared with Great Britain?  The index figure of the cost of living goes up double in the Saorstát to that in Great Britain, while if prices fall in Saorstát Eireann they only fall half as compared with the fall in Great Britain. That is so in some cases at any rate.</P>

      <P>I am basing it perhaps on one thing, the cost of bread, which between September 22nd and October 15th dropped a penny per four pound loaf in Great Britain while in a similar period there was only a fall of a halfpenny in the same loaf in Saorstát Eireann, and there has not been a fall since.  I may, however, be generalising from too narrow a point; in any case there is a problem and the Minister will not dispute that the ratio rise in the cost of living figure is higher in Saorstát Eireann than in Great Britain.  I only want, finally, to emphasise the great importance of this problem which lies at the bottom of almost every problem, including especially labour and housing, and almost every difficulty that comes before the Oireachtas.  So, I hope, not merely will the Dáil take an interest in the problem but that they will have the support of the public behind them.  I hope, and believe, that this is a genuine endeavour on the part of the Government to bring prices down, but they cannot do so unless they have the support of the public in their attempt to deal with this problem. I hope, and believe, that that <Col N="592" /> support and interest which are essential to deal successfully with the matter will not be lacking.</P>

      <P>I welcome the pronouncement by the Minister, but at the same time I wish to enter a protest in regard to the manner in which personally I have been dealt with in connection with this subject. I put down a question which was answered in the House, I think last Tuesday, and I can only say that it was treated in a spirit of levity.  The final part of the answer was simply a jeer at me personally, rather than an attempt to deal seriously with this outstanding problem.  In the question I put down I asked the Minister if he would suggest to the Executive Council that it was advisable a commission of inquiry of a similar type to that established in England should be set up in this country to deal with questions of high retail and wholesale prices, which were generally acknowledged to prevail in the Sáorstát.  The answer was that the matter would be considered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and that he would be glad to get any information that I would be able to give him.  That is not the spirit in which to deal with an important problem of that kind, and I say that the answer given to Deputy Cooper to-day might just as well have been given to me.</P>

      <P>I must and will accept the President's explanation.  I can only say that was the impression I drew from the manner in which the answer was delivered.  Anyhow, I welcome the statement that a tribunal is to be set up.  I believe it has come none too soon, and perhaps it is a good deal too late, because the Government has shown signs of its determination to bring wages down to a certain level, and that is a movement which is, in my opinion, necessary with regard to certain industries, but, as I have already stated on another occasion, when the Government is dealing with the question of wages it should also deal with the question of prices and the cost of living.  I do not know if there is any better method known to Governments for doing so than by setting up a council of inquiry of the type which has been set up in England.  It should not be necessary for me to give information to the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to the necessity for a council at this time, or to furnish him with particulars as to high prices.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to give particulars as to profiteering, but it is generally understood that the retail prices are higher in Ireland than <Col N="594" /> those prevailing in England.  As the Minister knows, the cost of living is about nine points, and perhaps more, higher here than in England.  It is extraordinary that in a poor country like this producers are getting lower prices for their food products than can be got for similar food products in England.  That points to the fact that some people, retailers or middlemen, are getting more profit than they are entitled to from food products.</P>

      <P>We have concrete facts.

I believe the price we pay for the 4lb. loaf in some of the smaller Irish towns is 11d.  I know of no reason, except it be wages, why there should be a difference between the prices.</P>

I believe before we can have things going as they ought to be producers of food in this country should get their share of what they are entitled to, and the cost of living must be reduced.  We must take some measures so that the people who are battening on the products of this country, and who are getting more than their share of the food products, can be dealt with.  I welcome the tribunal, and hope it will be set up in the immediate future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I associate myself with Deputy Bryan Cooper in this matter.  I think the Ministry ought to <Col N="595" /> show at least as much keenness in dealing with the question of high prices as they are showing in dealing with, shall we say, wages.  If they ever bring the cost of living into conformity with that in other countries I think they would be helping to make for a little stability in the industrial sphere.  Deputy Cooper, and also Deputy Heffernan, spoke of the difference in the cost of living in this country as compared with England or Scotland.  It has always seemed to me one explanation that might be given is that economically this country is more or less lopsided. It will be admitted that there are too many people engaged in distribution.</P>
      <P>I think it will be admitted that there are too many people in this country engaged in distribution.  They are in nothing like the same proportion to the number engaged in production in England, and it seems to me that that is probably one of the reasons; that we have in this country too many people engaged in distribution, and these people are certainly reaping more benefits from the sale of commodities than the people who have the trouble and the work of raising them.  That is the main reason for the high cost here.  I hope the Minister will be able to say to the House that the Government are going to deal with this problem and as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>There is nothing about the control of prices in the Deputy's question nor in my answer. There is matter about the investigation of prices, but I do not believe that the investigation of prices is going to do any good without control later on, and when one begins to consider what control later on leads to one understands why there has been such reluctance to tackle this question in this way.  There <Col N="596" /> will be given, if the resolutions which will be brought forward by some member of the Executive Council pass, to, the Oireachtas powers to get evidence compulsorily.  The compulsory resolutions will be based upon the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921.  Deputy Cooper raised a point that it may be necessary to have evidence taken in camera.  My reading of the Act leads me to believe that evidence could not be taken in camera.</P>

At the moment it is the only instrument we have to hand for this purpose, and it is the only thing we could use.

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that I raised the point because I did not want the Government afterwards to be accused of taking the initiative in this matter of having evidence taken in camera.  It might be necessary in some cases to have evidence taken in camera, and therefore I wanted to take the initiative in the matter so that the Government would not be blamed afterwards for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can bring that matter forward again when the Resolutions come before the House. There will, of course, be some delay in getting the particular Resolutions framed, getting the terms of reference for the tribunal, and getting a suitable tribunal.  In addition to that, I would ask the House to bear with a few extra day's delay because developments are expected with regard to the Food Council on the other side, and these developments may, if they come along, seriously damp the enthusiasm of those who believe that anything great is going to come from a committee of this sort.  In fact, it may appear that a committee of this sort, unless some additional powers are sought for it, <Col N="597" /> would be entirely useless, and the proof of that will be in the proceedings of the Council on the other side if they develop as we think they are likely to from the information we already have. As I said to the Deputy, I had no intention when putting this before the Executive Council of asking that the Executive Council should move for any permanent body.  The Deputy has put the matter rather succinctly when he asks is the committee to correspond to the committee on food prices or to the Food Council.  To a certain extent it will correspond to both, with this limitation, that it will not have the permanent character of the Food Council.  It may have that character later on.  I think it necessary that there should be some inquiry to see whether a <i>prima facie</i> case can be made and that prices for any commodity are too high.  It may seem strange to a House which has listened to all the talk about high prices that I should dare to make such a remark as that. I make it in the light of Deputy Morrissey's point that the trouble here may be that there are too many distributors, no single one of these distributors being ordinarily liable to the accusation of profiteering, as the word is understood, but simply the added charges which each makes to the cost of any article amounting in the end to such a figure that the prices are higher here than what they are on the other side.  It is not a question of dealing possibly with profiteering, as the word is understood, but a question of dealing with the whole system of distribution in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has to be, therefore, a case made out that prices are too high and that measures to reduce prices can be found, and even when they are found, there is the further consideration: is it practicable to give effect, or is it possible to give effect, to the methods recommended. I think it better, therefore, that this should be discussed when the Resolutions come before the Oireachtas and that the committee sought for, in the first instance, should not have anything of a permanent character about it, but that there should be, in order to obviate the objections by Deputy Cooper, an intimation <Col N="598" /> that if it be successful it would assume something of a permanent character, and that no delay on the part of traders will be allowed to hamper its operations&mdash;that is to say, that there will be a fixed period given within which a report must be made, so as to prevent traders who might like, in the Deputy's phrase, to stonewall and render the whole thing abortive, doing such a thing.  If we were to proceed immediately to the appointment of, say, a permanent Chairman and a permanent Secretariat, on the analogy of the Committee on the other side, we might be setting up a new Government Department costing a big sum of money, and might discover, after the first inquiry into the first article selected, that the Committee was going to be no good, and that the money had, to a certain extent, been wasted.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the remarks of either Deputy Morrissey or Deputy Heffernan with regard to the Government's keenness with regard to wages. I suppose we shall hear more of that later on.  I do wish to join up one remark of Deputy Heffernan with a remark of Deputy Cooper, who asked why the cost of living was higher here than anywhere else.  The Deputy had raised this previously with me in a letter, and I had replied that it did not seem to me that the cost of living had increased in the period the Deputy spoke of, proportionately or disproportionately, to the increase on the other side.</P>

      <P>If you want to establish that the rate of increase here is out of proportion to the rate of increase on the other side we should have to get data going back as far as 1914. The Deputy, at present, is basing two things on entirely different years. There is hardly any basis for comparison between the two figures, and it is a misreading of the situation to say that the increase, simply on the calculation which the Deputy has given proves a disproportion in the increase. <Col N="599" /> I am asked why is the cost of living higher.  I do not want to make too much of that point.  Deputy Johnson made a speech in this House which I did not hear but which I read.  He may have pointed to certain reasons as to why certain things are higher here than elsewhere.  Deputy Heffernan, who is so anxious to have these commodities reduced, and who apparently, also, is anxious to have wages reduced, voted with Deputy Johnson when he made his announcement that evening.</P>
