      <P>asked the President whether any application has been made to the Executive Council by the Boundary Commission for facilities to enable them to ascertain by plebiscite or otherwise, &ldquo;the wishes of the inhabitants,&rdquo; of any area now within the jurisdiction of the Saorstát; whether he has knowledge of any application for such facilities having been made to the Government of Northern Ireland in respect to the area within its jurisdiction, and if no such facilities for ascertaining the wishes of the inhabitants have been asked for, whether the Executive Council proposes to take any steps to obtain for submission to the Boundary Commission before they come to any decision, reliable information as to the wishes of the inhabitants as required by Article 12 of the Treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No application has been received by the Executive Council from the Boundary Commission for facilities to enable them to ascertain by plebiscite or otherwise the wishes of the inhabitants of any area now within the jurisdiction of Saorstát Eireann.  I have no knowledge of any application for such facilities having been made to the Government of Northern Ireland in respect of the area within its jurisdiction.  So far as territory now within the jurisdiction of Saorstát Eireann is concerned, the contention of the Executive Council is that the provisions of Article 12 of the <Col N="114" /> Treaty cannot be construed as empowering the Commission to transfer to Northern Ireland any of that territory, and representations, oral and written, have been made to that effect to the Commission.  I am aware that a large volume of evidence as to the wishes of the inhabitants in the border areas has been placed before the Commission, and I do not know of any further information which could usefully be obtained by the Executive Council to supplement the evidence already given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the President whether he assumes that Clause 12 of the Treaty has been carried through unless the wishes of the inhabitants of whatever area might be decided have been consulted.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That question partakes somewhat of the nature of a hypothesis, and it asks me, in effect, as I understand it, to pronounce judgment upon what the decision of the Boundary Commission will be.  I do not think that I am authorised or altogether at liberty to answer that question.</P>

      <P>asked the President if he has given consideration to the present high prices of commodities in the Saorstát as indicated by the index figures of the cost of living, and the index figures of wholesale prices, and whether he will arrange for the appointment of a committee or commission with authority and powers <Col N="115" /> similar to those possessed by the committee set up by the British Government, in order that publicity may be given to the excessive profits enjoyed by certain middlemen and other intermediaries between the producers and consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is considering this matter, and in the meantime will be glad to receive from the Deputy the evidence on which his assertion that &ldquo;excessive profits are enjoyed by certain middlemen and other intermediaries&rdquo; is based.</P>

      <P>Arising out of that reply, I would suggest that it is unreasonable that I should be asked to give evidence.  It is current comment that there are unreasonable prices charged and that profiteering is going on, and for that reason I ask that a Commission of this kind be set up.</P>

      <P>asked the President if the deputation from the homegrown grain conference (appointed by the County Committees of Agriculture) which waited upon him on October 5th, 1925, placed before him certain proposals and recommendations which would tend to improve the present deplorable position of the tillage farmers of the country; whether he was requested to make representations to Messrs. Guinness and Son regarding the unfair price paid for Irish malting barley; if he will state what steps he has taken to comply with the wishes and recommendations of the deputation and whether, in view of the very low prices now being paid for farm produce, he will undertake to introduce legislation regulating prices and profits and relieving the producer and consumer from the control of combines.</P>

      <P>I am not at liberty to disclose what transpired at the interview with the deputation to which the Deputy refers.  The proceedings were understood to be private.

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing further to add to what I have already said.  I do not remember having read what the Deputy stated was in the Press, and if I did it would not have affected me, as what appears in the Press does not always affect me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the President overlooking the fact that the Governor-General stated in his address in the Dáil that prices, profits and wages would have to come down, and is the President only prepared to deal with that portion of the address in regard to wages and not to deal with that regarding profiteering?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information that would justify the statement that we had not interfered with profiteering and did not endeavour to do so.  We asked for advice and assistance in furtherance of that desirable object from the Deputy and others, but so far that advice and assistance have not been given to assist us in coming to the conclusion that we should take any other measures than those we have taken.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that certain Irishmen, Officers of Customs and Excise, transferred in or about March, 1922, from the British to the Saorstát Service, having, as the result of an official intimation and invitation, volunteered so to transfer and having, it is stated, been promised the consideration at a later stage of the question of their removal expenses; whether he is aware that such question, in spite of repeated representations to his Department on their behalf, was never subsequently entertained, and the officers, ten or twelve in number, consequently suffered serious financial loss; whether later volunteers in far greater numbers had their removal expenses defrayed in full; and whether he does not think that the claims of these men should receive sympathetic attention forthwith.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This question refers to certain cases of transfers which were effected in March and April, 1922, while the Customs and Excise Service in Great Britain and Ireland was being administered as a whole by the Board of Customs and Excise, London. It may be observed that there was no separate Saorstát Service at the period mentioned.  These transfers were made within the then United Kingdom Service at the request of the officers concerned, and were subject to the condition, applying to all transfers made at the transferees' own request, that the expenses of removal would be borne by the transferees.  This condition is not affected by the scheme subsequently drawn up for the allocation to the Saorstát of portion of the staff of the United Kingdom Customs and Excise Service.  At the time &mdash; December, 1922&mdash;when effect was given to this scheme, the officers referred to in the question were serving in the Saorstát area.  There are no grounds on which payment of removal expenses in these cases could be justified.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that a considerable sum of money, the produce of the sale of butter by the workers who were in illegal possession of the creameries of the Condensed Milk Company of Ireland in 1922, has been or is at present under the control of his Department or of some parties who have negotiated with the Department with regard to the disposal of this sum; if he is aware that the farmer suppliers who sent milk to those creameries for a time, in ignorance of the position existing in the creameries at the time, but who ceased supplying as soon as they found out that the workers had no legal authority for taking over the creameries, claim that they are entitled to a portion, if not all, of the money now available, and if he will see that any such sum of money under his control is not disposed of until an opportunity has been given to any parties interested to state their claims; if he will state the total amount of money from this source at present available, and in whose hands it is at present held.</P>

The total amount of compensation awarded to the Condensed Milk Company was £57,597 17s., all of which has been paid with the exception of £15,978 9s., which is subject either to a reinstatement condition or to the receipt of the <Col N="119" /> necessary report or decree in my Department. I am aware that representations have been made on behalf of certain farmers in connection with this money, but I do not agree with the suggestion that the farmers were unaware of the position existing in the creameries at the time.  I cannot give any undertaking such as that suggested by the Deputy in the third part of his question, and I regret that I cannot see my way to furnish any information regarding any money other than that which will be accounted for by my Department in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that the supply of game in the country is being seriously depleted owing to the enormous number of persons shooting same without gun licences, and some of whom come long distances in motor cars; if he will state what are the responsibilities of the Gárda Síochána with regard to the protection of game, and whether any further steps are to be taken to ensure close supervision in the matter.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the supply of game is being seriously depleted by persons shooting without authority.  Since the Firearms Act, 1925, came into operation, the vast majority of the guns in this country are held under proper certificates issued by Superintendents of the Gárda Síochána. The responsibilities of the Gárda with regard to the protection of game are, in the main, confined to the enforcement of the Firearms Act, 1925, and the Regulations made thereunder.  This they are doing and will continue to do. A Bill will, it is hoped, be shortly introduced to provide for the better protection of game throughout the Saorstát.</P>

Moran, of Dodder View Cottages, Ballsbridge, who were brought before the Dublin District Court on April 18th, 1925, on a charge of attempted murder, and were sent for trial at the High Court Circuit; whether the accused were not legally represented at the District Court hearing; whether, pending a sitting of the High Court Circuit, the accused have been held in prison and are unable by reason of lack of means to make application for bail to the High Court; and whether he can take any steps to remedy a state of affairs which has resulted in the accused being held in prison untried for over six months.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the men referred to in the Deputy's question were sent for trial as stated, and have been in custody since.  I believe that they were not legally represented at the District Court hearing, but I have no official record as to that. I am not aware whether the fact that they have not applied to the High Court for bail is due to lack of means, but I am aware that similar applications made to the High Court by persons who had the necessary means were refused by the High Court so that the alleged poverty of the accused in the present case has in all probability little to do with their continued detention.</P>

    <P>As regards the last part of the question, <Col N="125" /> I am to-day introducing a Bill for the express purpose of hastening the trial of these and other prisoners awaiting trial by the High Court Circuit, and the trials will take place immediately the Bill becomes law.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture <Col N="136" /> if he is aware that a considerable quantity of malting barley is still in the hands of growers; that the growers are unable to find sale for this barley at any reasonable price; that many of these barley growers are in financial straits owing to their inability to find a market for their barley; if he will state whether his Department has taken any steps to find an alternative market for this barley outside of the Saorstát, and if authentic information has been sought for as to the possibility of finding such a market outside of the Saorstát; if he is prepared to recommend to the Executive Council the introduction of legislation which will deal with the matter of the restricted market for barley in Ireland, with a view to preventing unfair combinations of purchasers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>(1)  The Department are informed that, while in some of the barley-growing counties the normal amount of barley usually sold for malting has already been purchased, there are certain districts in which barley that might ordinarily be disposed of for malting remains unsold.</P>
      <P>(2)  Since the maltsters have ceased to buy, barley prices have fallen, and, as is usual, the price of feeding barley is on a lower level than that of barley of malting quality.</P>
      <P>(3)  Farmers who grow barley as a &ldquo; cash crop &rdquo; and who have failed to sell their barley either on account of its inferiority for malting or because maltsters have completed their immediate purchases, have difficulty in realising ready-money for their crop at anything above feeding barley prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  and (5)  The Department have made enquiry into the possibility of selling barley outside the Saorstát, as the Deputy is aware, and have ascertained that the price which Irish malting barley of average quality would realise in Great Britain would not cover its cost to the merchant at the rates paid for such barley in Ireland this season, when due allowance is made for conditioning and bulking, and for freight charges.  Merchants in the grain shipping trade are closely watching the markets in Great Britain <Col N="137" /> and on the Continent, and are only too anxious to do business, but have been unable up to the present to sell Irish barley outside the Saorstát at a price which would cover their expenses, plus the price here in Ireland, of course.  A considerable quantity of barley has been purchased by grain merchants, and is being stored in the prospect of an improved demand.</P>
    <P>(6)  With regard to the inquiry as to whether I am prepared to recommend to the Executive Council the introduction of legislation which will deal with the matter of the restricted market for barley in Ireland, with a view to preventing unfair combinations of purchasers, I assume that the Deputy means legislation for the fixing of minimum and maximum prices for barley. I am not prepared to make such a recommendation.</P>

      <P>As Deputies know, it appeared in this morning's papers that the County Cork Farmers' Union have received a letter from their agent on the other side saying that Irish barley cannot be sold at a price which would pay them after giving 19/- or 20/- for it on this side, and paying 3/- or 4/- on the other side for other costs.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that the price of the article depends on the demand for it.  If there is no demand for Irish barley, while it may analyse as well as English barley&mdash;if there is no demand for Irish barley for malting purposes for some reason which is inherent in the barley itself, then there will be no price for it.  At present the price for Irish barley in the English market is about 23/-, while other barleys are quoted at 41/-.</P>

A scheme for the division of these lands is at present under consideration.  That means, in effect, that no other queries are likely to come in in connection with the estate once the price has been fixed.  It means that the other queries have been dealt with.  Inquiries are being made as regards the lands of Coolmine on the estate of H. Kennedy. The lands of Coalmanstown comprise a holding on the estate of Mrs. Margaret L. O'Carroll, Co. Dublin, for which particulars have been lodged by the owner under the Land Act, 1923.  The estate has not yet been reached in its order of priority to be dealt with by the Land Commission under the purchase provisions of the Act.  Perhaps what the Deputy referred to is a tenancy or lease on the Coalmanstown estate.  The particulars in regard to this estate have been furnished by the landlord and are being dealt with by the Land Commission in the ordinary way.  That is to say, the tenants are getting the usual reduction.  But with regard to the acquisition of the holding of one tenant on the estate &mdash; the particular holding which the Deputy refers to &mdash; the Land Commission have not come to a decision as yet, but are making inquiries as to whether they will acquire that holding or not.</P>

Only three <Col N="146" /> classes of criminal offences are outside the jurisdiction of the Circuit Judge: treason, murder, and attempted murder. On consideration, and having had the advantage of consultation with the judges who acted on the Rule-Making Committee, I have come to the conclusion that it is not necessary to constitute this Court of the High Court Circuit; that it can be abolished with advantage; that it would be likely to prove expensive in practice, and that the transfer of cases returned for trial to the Court of the High Court Circuit to the Central Criminal Court will impose no undue burden on that Court and can be adequately dealt with there. We can discuss the Bill more fully at a later stage.  I ask the leave of the Dáil to have it printed and circulated.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="148" />&ldquo;That, for the purpose of any Act of the present Session to make provision for the formulating and carrying out of a scheme of arterial drainage of the River Owenmore and its tributaries, it is expedient to authorise&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the advance by the Commissioners of Public Works, out of moneys under their control and applicable to loans of a sum of £8,860; and</P>
    <P>(b)  the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of so much of the costs and expenses incurred by the Commissioners in carrying such Act into effect as is not covered by the above advance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Owenmore drainage project is one that was inherited from the Congested Districts Board.  In 1913 and 1914 preparations were made to carry on this work and, in anticipation of the scheme being formulated, a certain amount of work was done by the Congested Districts Board.  During the present year money was provided in the Public Works Vote to the extent, I think, of £12,000.  Something like £9,000 or £10,000 were expended this summer.  The district is a congested one and the arrangements that are being made for financing the scheme are not such as can be taken as a precedent. The entire expenditure will be in the neighbourhood of £50,000 and the amount that will be paid by the inhabitants of the district will be £8,860.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an opportunity that one must take to raise a question appertaining to the work that will ensue under this motion and one of the consequences.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce were here he might be able to give us some information on the point.  When works of this character on drainage schemes of one kind or another are being operated, one of the consequences is that men working on the schemes are being deprived of rights which they would be entitled to were they working upon other works, because it is said it is agricultural labour.  The men, therefore, are being deprived of the right to unemployment insurance; and the boards <Col N="149" /> and, I take it, the Department of Lands and Agriculture, are responsible for saying that this class of work is agricultural work, and that the men employed on it are not entitled to have their cards stamped for unemployment insurance. This motion will give the Minister an opportunity of saying whether it is contemplated that this work is to be considered agricultural labour for the purpose of the Unemployment Insurance Act.</P>
      <P>I think it is entirely wrong to suggest that men working on drainage schemes should be classed for the purposes of the Unemployment Insurance Act as agricultural labourers.  I raise the question and perhaps some instances will be given of the way in which this class of work is being used to deprive workmen of their rights under other laws.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to supplement what Deputy Johnson has said in this connection.  Two or three drainage schemes are being carried out in the constituency&mdash;Wexford&mdash;that I represent and I know that this matter has been taken up on various occasions with the Board of Works.  Their answer is that they cannot, under the Act, stamp the insurance cards of these men.  I do not think that by any stretch of imagination anyone can say the work that is being carried out in connection with these drainage schemes is agricultural work.  It is work of a very different kind, indeed, and it has no relationship whatever, as far as I could observe, to agricultural labour.  I might say that a great number of the men engaged on these schemes are men who, prior to their engagement on this work, were not at agricultural labour at all.  I would like to hear from the Minister what justification he has to offer for depriving these men of the right to have their cards stamped.  I think that if he examines the question carefully he will see that they are entitled to have their cards stamped.</P>

      <P>This matter was raised with the Board of Works. We did not look upon it as agricultural labour, because there may be some people, quite a number of people, <Col N="150" /> connected with it who previously might not be connected with agricultural labour.  Yet it was really an adjunct to the agricultural work of the country.  It was mainly carried out by people in the district and it was intended to be so carried out.  Personally, we were anxious to get the cards stamped.  We sought advice and the answer we got was that there would be no use stamping the cards as that would not give any benefit to the people in question, and that the legal position is such that our stamping the cards would not effect what Deputy Corish desires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if his Department was engaged in making a road to a farm that that would be an adjunct to agriculture, and, therefore, he would not be entitled to stamp the cards of the man, or if he was building a barn, the men would not be entitled to have their cards stamped?  The barn would be naturally an adjunct to agriculture. Would that be considered agricultural labour?  Is it intended that the work under this scheme, which is now under consideration, moryah, will also be considered agricultural labour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that building a barn is not agricultural labour.  That is a very different class of work from the type carried on under an ordinary normal arterial drainage scheme, which is certainly much nearer to ordinary agricultural work.  In fact, it is another form of the very type of work that goes on in the first part of all agricultural work. If analogies are used, a much closer analogy is to be found in the thorough drainage of a farm than in likening the <Col N="151" /> work to building a barn or a hay-shed, which are very different things.  Here you have drainage of two types.  We can see no justification for making a distinction between this particular type of arterial drainage and the thorough drainage of a farm.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> In line 26 to delete from the word &ldquo;by&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;law,&rdquo; line 27 inclusive, and to substitute the words &ldquo;is in force in.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment raises a purely legal point, but I think it is a very vital one. In fact it seems to me to strike at the whole efficacy of the Bill.  Section I says that this is to enable the Executive Council to make modifications in any charter &ldquo;which by virtue of Article 73 of the Constitution has the force of law in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo; Now, if you turn to Article 73 of the Constitution you will see that it deals with laws, but that it does not deal with charters.  I understand that the law of charters is quite different to the law about laws, if I may put it so, and to say that a charter has all the force of law seems to me to be not brought in by Article 73 of the Constitution at all. That Article deals with the laws that are in force in the Free State.  I would suggest to the Minister in charge of the Bill that it should simply say that it gives the Executive Council power to make modifications in any charter which is in force in the country at present in order to give them full force and effect.  I think that would enable him to deal with the charters that are in existence in the country.  I suggest that the present section does not give him power to deal with anything, because I believe there are no charters in the country at present which have the authority of law.  That requires a charter to be definitely working under the authority of Parliament, and I do not think we have got any such charters in this country at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Thrift probably is making the mistake of thinking that the Executive Council wishes to interfere in connection with these charters of its own volition.  That is not the case. The Executive Council, in putting down this measure, in presenting it to the Oireachtas and getting it passed into law, does so, as I explained on the Second Reading of the Bill, to facilitate these particular institutions. It does not intend to act and has not acted in connection with these matters unless requested to do so for the benefit of these particular institutions. <Col N="155" /> This amendment does not, to my mind, make the situation anything better.  It is by virtue of Article 73 of the Constitution that all laws, common law charters, statutes, etc., are brought within the law, and some reference such as this should be made in this connection.  I do not know that we have passed any Act or given any charter since December, 1922, when Article 73 of the Constitution was passed.  It appears to me that these charters are in force by virtue of Article 73 of the Constitution, that the amendment would not effect any difference in substance, and that the reference to Article 73 of the Constitution places beyond question the charters which are affected by the section.</P>

      <P>It is not for me to argue a legal point as I have no pretentions to being a lawyer.  At the same time I do not think the President answered the point I made.  The question does not arise here as to whether a chartered body, whether voluntarily or otherwise, comes under the purview of the Act, but the question does arise as to whether a charter can be called a law.  I suggest that the legal interpretation is that a charter only has the force of law if it gets the authority of Parliament.  I do not know that it is the case that charters are covered by the laws that are mentioned in Article 73 of the Constitution.  I raise the point and am quite content in having done that in order that the legal authorities may give it consideration and see whether there is any legal force in the point.  To my mind it does not seem that there will be any chartered body in the Free State which would come under the purview of this Act if the wording is left as it is in Section 1.  I do not wish to press the amendment to a division, but I would ask the President to submit it at any rate to the consideration of his law advisers.</P>

      <P>I do not think it would be a good practice to put an Executive Minister in the position of saying that his law advisers say so and so.  It may be taken generally that a <Col N="156" /> Minister will not set himself up in opposition to whatever he is advised, and taking it in that way I can say that I am advised that the Bill as drawn fulfils all requirements, and that it would not be benefited by the amendment which has been put down by the Deputy, but rather might be slightly damaged by it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at end of section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An order made by the Executive Council under this section shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and shall not come into force and effect until the expiration of twenty-one days on which the House of the Oireachtas has sat after it has been so laid.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposition I put before the House is to add a new sub-section making it clear that any order that is to be made by the Executive Council in fulfilment of this section shall not have effect until it has been placed on the table of the House.  I would rather discuss the issues raised to some extent by Deputy Thrift's amendment although the point he made was perhaps too technical for my understanding.  I think the section itself is very dangerous in its present phraseology.  We are asked to give the Executive Council power to adapt, to modify, any charter so that it may have the force of law and so that the adaptation may have the force of law if, in the opinion of the Executive Council, that modification is necessary to enable the charter to have full force and effect in the Saorstát.  On the face of it the intention, I think, was to give the Executive powers to enable charters to have force and effect in Saorstát Eireann which they have not at present, owing to the change in the constitutional position.  But it is not that only that we are asked to agree to: we are asked to agree that the Executive Council shall be empowered to make such <Col N="157" /> adaptations as they consider are necessary, and I take it that if that section is passed in its present form there will be no appeal as to whether the opinion of the Executive Council as to the necessity for any particular adaptation was, in fact, required by the needs of the case.  To adapt a charter in such a way as to make the charter itself effectual in the Saorstát is one thing; to allow the Ministry to modify such charters in any way they may think desirable&mdash;they say necessary, but it is their opinion that it is necessary according to the phrase in the section&mdash;is another thing.  Then there would be no appeal from the opinion of the Executive as to whether any particular adaptation or modification, which means alteration in the charter, is required. There was recently an adaptation made of certain enactments altering the constitution, for instance, of a certain Nurses' Council.  It was altered rather considerably, not merely adapted to suit needs; that is, the technical phraseology was not altered merely to adapt it to the necessities of the Saorstát, but the actual constitution was adapted and what was equivalent to the charter was modified.</P>
    <P>I want, if possible, to prevent the Executive from taking powers to alter charters beyond what is absolutely necessary to make these charters effective in the Saorstát, and I think that the section, as it stands, goes much beyond that.  The amendment that I have put down, of course, does not ensure what I desire, but I am drawing attention to what I think is the defect in the section itself, and I think that the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Executive Council,&rdquo; ought to be deleted, though that is not my amendment. The amendment is a sort of second best, to ensure that if any Order has been made by the Executive Council in respect of a charter that that Order will not be effective until the House has been made aware of it, and has had an opportunity to disagree with it.  We are in the great difficulty that we have not any conception of how many charters are in operation, how many institutions are working under charters, and what is contained in those charters.  Furthermore, we have no idea as to what is in <Col N="158" /> the mind of the Executive Council as to the adaptations or modifications that they wish to make in these charters, and what we are asked to do is to leave the whole matter entirely in the hands of the Executive Council to modify, which means to alter, any of these charters in any way that they may think it necessary to make them effective in the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>I assume that the stress in this section is upon the word &ldquo;necessary,&rdquo; and I would assume, too, that if we leave out the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Executive Council,&rdquo; there might be some appeal to the courts as to whether any modification was necessary to enable a particular charter to have effect in the Saorstát.  But while we leave in these words, &ldquo;in the opinion of the Executive Council,&rdquo; it seems to me that we are leaving all power to the Executive Council in the manner of adapting, modifying, or otherwise altering charters.  The amendment, however, seeks to ensure that before any adaptation or modification is made the Order will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, and that the Order shall not come into effect until after 21 days during which the Houses shall have been sitting.  I therefore move the amendment.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy Johnson is really unnecessarily uneasy about this Section 1, though I rise to lay stress on something that the President has just said, with particular reference to the point raised by Deputy Johnson.

      <P>No, they are not the judges of what is to make a charter of full force and effect; at least I submit so.  I take it from what the President <Col N="159" /> said a moment ago that it is not the intention of the Executive Council to make any use of this except a chartered body wants it.  I ask him to point out the part of the Bill where that proviso is laid down.  We are legislating here, not for what this Executive Council wishes to do, but for what this Executive Council, or some future Executive Council, might be able to do by means of this Bill.  That is what Deputy Johnson has laid stress on over and over again.  It is not what the intentions of the Executive Council are in this Bill that matters but what is the legal force of the Bill.  It does not console those who are anxious, although it is very consoling that the President does not want to touch existing charters unless the holders of these charters want it themselves.  But I submit that it is what the Bill would enable some future Executive Council to do that is the real point.</P>

      <P>I was one of the people who were very anxious that some change should be made in regard to this matter.  A body with which I am connected is run by charter, and we found that there were some changes extremely necessary with regard to certain examinations. When we had achieved the changes that we considered necessary we found that our charter required that these changes should receive the sanction of the Lord Lieutenant.  The Lord Lieutenant had gone, and we sent them to the Governor-General.  The Governor-General said that he had no power to give his sanction to the changes.  He said he was quite sure that he could not.  He referred us to the Executive Council and he said that they had power to do what the Lord Lieutenant could have done.  The Executive Council found that they had no power either, and, therefore, we pressed upon the Executive Council the necessity for making some change.  So far as I was concerned I was quite satisfied that the Government had met us in the endeavour to make the changes necessary in the charter where these changes were recommended by the body concerned. Deputy Johnson has, of course, raised a wider question, that if the Government took power to themselves to alter <Col N="160" /> charters, which alterations were not required by the bodies holding the charters, it might become a rather serious matter.  But I was perfectly satisfied, as far as I was concerned, that the Executive Council had nothing more in their minds than simply making the charter available in the Saorstát.  That does not quite meet what Deputy Thrift suggests, that the Government are taking powers to do a certain thing which seems to be only necessary.  But, on the other hand, as he says, what would the legal aspect of the case be?  I am quite satisfied if the President says that he got legal advice on the matter that things eventually will be all right.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that there is a great deal of unnecessary nervousness and apprehension about this measure.  The three speeches I have listened to are indications, not exactly of a want of confidence in the Executive Council, or in future Executive Councils, as of nervousness in giving extraordinary powers to any Executive Council.  What are we concerned with?  This particular measure seeks to perfect something that has already been passed into law by the Oireachtas.  In 1922 one of the earliest Acts&mdash;I think it was the first Act after the Constitution&mdash;was a measure known as the Adaptation of Enactments Act.  I do not know whether Deputies have had time to go over the phraseology in that particular measure or not, but there are two sections to which I wish to draw attention, Section 12 and Section 19. Section 12, sub-section (1) reads:</P>
      <P>The Executive Council of Saorstát Eireann may from time to time, by Order, make all such general or specific adaptations of or modifications in any British Statute which, in the opinion of the Executive Council, are necessary in order to enable such Statute to have full force and effect in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any such adaptation or modification as is mentioned in this Section may be made notwithstanding that same is covered or effected by any general adaptation or modification made by this Act, but no adaptation or modification shall be made under <Col N="161" /> this section which is inconsistent with any adaptation or modification made by this Act.</P>
    <P>Section 19 reads:</P>
    <P>Every Order made by the Executive Council under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas forthwith and unless and until a resolution annulling such Order is passed by either House of the Oireachtas within the next subsequent twenty-one days on which that House has sat after such Order is laid before it, such Order shall have effect as if enacted in this Act, but no such resolution shall operate to prejudice the validity of anything previously done under such Order.</P>
    <P>That has been the usual practice with regard to such matters.  The amendment proposes to effect little more than the purpose that was intended by Section 19 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act.  It specifies that an Order made by the Executive Council under this Section shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and shall not come into force and effect until the expiration of twenty-one days on which either House of the Oireachtas has sat after it has been so laid.  There is evidently more suspicion in the minds of the members of this Oireachtas than in the minds of the members of the Oireachtas which passed the Adaptation of Enactment Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputies have had more experience a case ought to be made against some Order that has been made by the Executive Council, some indiscretion, some Order that had to be annulled, and some act which was made valid by the terms of Section 19, to which exception was taken.  But having passed through two or three years in which no case has been made against any Order made by the Executive Council, it is now asked: &ldquo;We have had experience of you, but what about others that are to come?&rdquo; I think there could be no more dangerous statement made than that, and I am perfectly satisfied in my own mind that any Executive Council in office during the next twenty-five years can be safely <Col N="162" /> trusted to make only sensible Orders.  Even if we were not in power for the next twenty-five years, if Deputy Johnson were here, I am perfectly satisfied that he will not have such a majority in the House as would enable him to pass any Orders he liked. It is most unlikely.  Why, then, should he be apprehensive or nervous about what an Executive Council may do?  As a matter of historical record, I would ask what confidence have you in the stability of governing institutions if you seek now to take back powers you gave two or three years ago, and for which course you have no grounds except, perhaps, a nervous feeling, and I do not think there is even that nervous feeling.  I could not accept the amendment as it is drawn.  I would accept the same class of amendment as is embodied in Section 19 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act.  If Deputy Johnson were willing to withdraw, I would undertake to bring up on Report Stage an amendment having the same effect as Section 19 of that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between the Adaptation of Enactments Act and this proposal in Section 1.  To begin with, the Adaptation of Enactments Act deals with Statutes, all of which are available to the public and may be known to any Deputy or any member of the public.  Charters are private and are not known.  I think they have not been published and are not available to the public, and modifications may be made which, in the opinion of the Executive Council, are necessary, and which may turn out in a year or two, when the public are made aware of the change that has been made, not to be necessary at all, but going beyond the necessities of the case.  I think that the phraseology of the Adaptation of Enactments Act went beyond the necessities of the case and that it should not have been passed in that particular form.  I think that we ought not to trust to the omniscience and absolute wisdom of the Executive Council.  Certainly we should not allow a charter to be altered by the Executive Council in such a way as will be irrevocable, merely because the opinion of the Executive Council is to be final.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the phraseology of this <Col N="163" /> section, although it is a copy of the phraseology of the Adaptation of Enactments Act, it makes the Executive Council's opinion the final court of appeal, or rather, it is final and there is no appeal.  The opinion of the Executive Council as to what is necessary is the law in the matter.  On the point of difference between the proposed sub-section and Section 19 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act, if a charter is altered and anything is done under that charter before the expiration of 21 days, it may be a very costly business to overtake the evil. I think that the proposition that no Order shall be made until the House has had an opportunity of disagreeing with it, is much more sensible as a matter of practical working than an Order which will allow the Minister to make an alteration in a charter.  Then you have the House told: &ldquo;Here is an accomplished fact.  There is no use trying to recall it.  You had better let the evil continue.&rdquo;  I think the proposed amended form is much better than the form in the Adaptation of Enactments Act, and if the President would think it wise to bring in an amendment to alter Section 19 of that Act to the form on the Order Paper, I think he would be doing satisfactory work and I would be prepared to support it.</P>

      <P>This question, as to whether a Minister or Ministries should have power to make Orders and then allow the Dáil to declare the Orders bad, has occurred a number of times and we have discussed the matter pro and con.  In general, the President has thought it well that there should be the power to make an Order in spite of what the Dáil may do. Nevertheless, the other proposition, to allow the Dáil and the Seanad an opportunity of saying whether a particular Order or a particular modification is a good one is much more practicable and much more sensible than to allow an Order to be made and any evil that is coming out of it to be accomplished before it can be recalled. <Col N="164" /> The offer of the President is much more satisfactory than to have no such proposition before the House.  If he is not prepared to accept the amendment, I will have to accept the decision of the House in the matter.  I hope he will agree to give the House an opportunity of saying whether the Order should be made or not.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), line 39, to delete the words &ldquo;and always to have been.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This phrase, &ldquo;and always to have been,&rdquo; makes the section have a retrospective effect.  On Second Reading I used arguments to show why this section should not be made retrospective, and no reply was given at that time to those arguments.  The President has appealed to us for our confidence in the Executive Council doing everything that is right.  I trust by insisting on the inclusion of these words in this section they will not give anyone the right to say that they have taken away rights from them which they believe they have up to the present.  I said on Second Reading, and I repeat it now, that there is at present before the courts a case in which the principal plea is founded on the construction of Section 7 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act, and by the inclusion of this phrase and the passing into law of this Bill that plea will be swept away, and, consequently, the right which a person has at present will be taken from him by making this Act retrospective.  I am quite sure that it is not the intention of the Executive Council to do a thing like that. It is not their intention to say that if they find, or if it has been shown, that something has been done contrary to <Col N="166" /> the law, and it is proved that they have done something contrary to the law, that they can go back, set it right, and pass an Act here making it retrospective. I cannot see what object is sought to be attained by the inclusion of this phrase.  If I understand what the President has said rightly, and from what Deputy Sir James Craig has said, the object of the Bill is to enable them to make changes at the request of certain parties who are governed by charter. If that is the object of the Bill it is not necessary to have these words included.  I therefore strongly urge that my amendment be accepted by the President.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This section shall not apply to <Col N="167" /> any University established by Royal Charter or to any body corporate similarly established for the regulation of the admission, qualification and conduct of members of any profession or business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Before Section 4 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This Act shall not apply to any board or body constituted by charter or statute or partly by charter and partly by statute for the purposes of any religious denomination, educational institution or any solely charitable purpose.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These amendments run together and I am afraid that I cannot separate them.  In my remarks on Section 1, I said that there was no real apprehension, nor, in a sense, am I apprehensive about this, but I think the reasons here are somewhat different.  Sections 2 and 3 appear to apply in connection with Section 7 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act and Section 9 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  That is to say, they appear to apply to statutory boards exercising functions of government and performing public duties.  In Section 9 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act there are certain words limiting the provisions to the statutory boards to which the provisions of that section apply.  It is from that section that the words of the amendment are taken.  When the Ministers and Secretaries Act passed, that proviso was necessary even though it follows an exactly similar definition of the statutory bodies previously given in the Adaptation of Enactments Act and the statutory bodies there.  My case is that if the amendment is necessary, as I believe it to be, in Section 9 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, when we come to apply Section 7 here to a similar set of bodies the provision is equally necessary.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure the President meant exactly what he said, that there was no intention of applying this Act to any other bodies than those of the nature indicated exercising functions of Government, or performing public duties.  But the question is a legal one as to whether there are statutory bodies which are governed by the section or <Col N="168" /> not.  There is no doubt of the proviso in Section 9 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, and I urge that a similar proviso is necessary when we come to apply Section 7 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act.  I put down a similar idea in different words in the second amendment.  The two things overlap, but do not perhaps completely overlap. What I would urge on the Minister is, that he would give an assurance he will have the points raised in amendments 4 and 5 carefully considered, and if he thinks, or his law advisers advise, that there is any legal force in them, that he will introduce an amendment to meet the points which have been raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that, in my opinion, there is no necessity for these amendments. This section is confined to boards, commissioners, or other bodies which exercise the functions of Government, or discharge public duties in relation to public administration.  I would like at this stage to emphasise this point in relation to this particular measure: when introducing a Bill of any other description an undertaking by a Minister may be taken at its face value.  The decision he has come to, or the advice he is giving, is his own opinion, and in the long run it may not turn out to be exactly according to his intention, or the intention of his advisers at the time.  With regard to this particular measure, members of the Oireachtas, and bodies outside, have an extra advantage in that they are given an assurance that if any Orders should be made by the Executive Council which would conflict with any undertaken that may be given here, it is open to the Oireachtas to take the necessary steps with regard to any such Orders, so that the Court of Appeal mentioned by Deputy Johnson is not the Executive Council but the Oireachtas. The question mentioned by Deputy Thrift is probably a question of law, and supposing it is, he has his security that it is still open to the Oireachtas to make a case against the Executive Council for endeavouring to have an Order made in conflict with assurances given.  I presume I have met that point to the Deputy's satisfaction. <Col N="169" /> These particular amendments are open to this disadvantage, that they would throw considerable doubt on the meaning and the effect of Section 7 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act.  I am sure the Deputy had no such intention. To my mind it is not at all likely that the Executive Council would attempt to use it in respect of bodies or institutions to which it is not my intention to apply it.  I think the Deputy ought to be perfectly satisfied now that there is no necessity for his amendments.</P>

      <P>I am sure that there is no such intention as the President has mentioned, and I have said that all along.  There is a legal point, and in saying that I am not speaking my own view.  I consulted an eminent solicitor, and I have before me a copy of the opinion of counsel, to whose opinion the Government attaches great importance, and both of these gentlemen have given me the assurance that the legal point is a valid and good point.  If the President will tell me that he will read their opinions, and if his opinions are changed after that, I will be satisfied.</P>

      <P>With reference to the President's point of view regarding Deputy Thrift's amendment, he asks the House to take the view that because the Executive Council has a certain intention in regard to any proposal it brings forward, the House need not examine with any particular care the phraseology of the proposal, because the present intention of the Executive Council is a valid guarantee that the law, or the intentions of the present Executive Council, will not be exceeded, and if they are, then the Oireachtas can bring the Executive Council to book in the matter.</P>

      <P>I think the <Col N="170" /> Deputy has misunderstood me.  I said that in the ordinary course, while a Minister may take every possible precaution to insure that Acts interpret exactly what he and his advisers had in mind, it is sometimes found Acts do not, on interpretation by courts, exactly carry out the intentions of the framers. I said that as far as this particular Bill is concerned, orders made under it, if they exceeded or contravened in any respect the undertaking given, would be open to appeal to the House.  In so far as this gives that right to such bodies as have been mentioned&mdash;universities or bodies established for the regulation of professions or business&mdash; then there is no case against the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>If the President has withdrawn the proposition he put forward in the earlier stages of the discussion, I have nothing more to say.  In reference to the reply he made to Deputy Thrift with regard to the intentions of the Executive Council, I was going to say that it was very closely approximating to the attitude adopted by the existing Ministries in Spain and Italy in regard to the advisability of legislating by decree of the governing body, or executive of the time, as distinguished from legislation by a parliamentary body.  I express my non-concurrence with that view, which the President has stated only little more explicitly than has been stated many times by Ministers during the last couple of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 5 to insert a new section in the words following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>5.  (1) If, within five years from the date when an arrangement for mutual assistance is entered into under or in consequence of this Act, any officer or servant who has been regularly employed by authorised undertakers or by the owners of a railway, tramway, or other generating station proves to the satisfaction of a board of referees or referee (hereinafter referred to as the board) and appointed by the Minster that in consequence of the arrangement he&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  has suffered loss of employment, diminution of salary, wages, or emoluments, otherwise than on grounds of misconduct, incapacity or superannuation; or</P>
      <P>(ii.)  has relinquished his employment in consequence of being required to perform duties such as were not analogous or were an unreasonable addition to those which he had been required to perform before the 1st day of July, 1925; or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iii.)  has been placed in any worse position in respect to the conditions of his service (including tenure of office, remuneration, gratuities, pension, superannuation, sick or other fund, or any benefit or allowance payable on retirement or at death, or otherwise however to himself or to his widow or children, whether obtaining by law or by customary practice); and no party to the arrangement proves to the satisfaction of board that equivalent employment was available to him on the like conditions as those obtaining with respect to him at the date when the arrangement was entered into, he shall, without prejudice to any other right, be entitled to receive from the parties to the arrangement or such one or more <Col N="172" /> of them as the board may think just, such compensation as the board may award, including any expenses which the officer or servant necessarily incurs in removing to another locality;</P>
    <P>Provided that it shall be lawful, without any such award but with the consent of the Minister, for any parties or party to an arrangement for mutual assistance at any time to pay to an officer or servant by agreement with him such compensation as the parties or party estimate to be the compensation properly payable to him under this Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  Such compensation shall be based on, but shall not exceed, the amount which would have been payable to a person on abolition of office under the Acts and Rules relating to the Civil Service in force at the date of the passing of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, but, in computing the period of service of any officer service under any authorised undertakers or under the owners of any railway, tramway, or other generating station shall be reckoned as service under the party to the arrangement in whose employment he is at the time he suffers such loss, diminution, relinquishment or other prejudice as aforesaid; and, where any officer or servant to whom this section applies was temporarily absent from his employment as such officer or servant while serving in or with the National Forces of Saorstát Eireann, or any Military Forces serving under the authority of the First Dáil, the Second Dáil, or the Provisional Government, or the British Army, Navy or Air Force, such period of temporary absence shall be reckoned for the purposes of this section as a period of service as such officer or servant.</P>
    <P>(3)  Any question as to whether any arrangement is an arrangement for mutual assistance entered into under or in consequence of this Act shall be determined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Minister may make rules as to the procedure before the board and may by those Rules provide for limiting the amount of costs and for <Col N="173" /> the taxation thereof and for fixing the fee of the board and determining by whom they are to be paid.</P>
    <P>The amendment is one to ensure that the working of this Bill will not deprive employees in existing undertakings of their employment without some compensation. The phraseology is in the main taken from existing legislation, and need not be detailed.  It will be noted that the Minister takes power to compel existing undertakings to enter into arrangements, and it is quite probable that such arrangements may, in respect to certain officers, mean, shall I say, economising.  Every precedent of recent years tends to support the proposition that if economy of that kind is made, the persons disemployed in consequence should have a claim for compensation for disturbance and deprivation of means of livelihood.  Let me point out that people of this character are specialised and are not easily reemployed unless there is a considerable extension of electrical undertakings. There is quite a number of Acts at present in operation both in Great Britain and Ireland which contain clauses dealing pretty much on the same lines with persons disemployed in consequence of arrangements of a statutory kind, like this.  I do not think it is necessary to go into the matter in any detail at this stage, and I will satisfy myself with moving the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we discuss this amendment on its merits I would like to have a ruling as to whether it is in order.  I should like at the same time to point to a difficulty that will arise if the amendment be passed in its present form.  The amendment speaks of proving &ldquo;to the satisfaction of a board of referees or referee (hereinafter referred to as the board)&rdquo;; and there are rules to be made as to the procedure before the board.  The new section proposes: &ldquo;The Minister may make rules as to the procedure before the board, and may by those rules provide for limiting the amount of costs and for the taxation thereof, and for fixing the fee of the board and determining by whom they are to be paid.&rdquo;  That entails money, and would necessitate a Money <Col N="174" /> Resolution.  No such Money Resolution has been moved.  I do not know how Deputy Johnson proposes I should fix the fee to pay the board, when I have no fund at my disposal for the purpose.</P>
      <P>I have the further point, that this is definitely outside the scope of a measure which is, and quite obviously is, of a temporary nature.  It is a measure which, as explained on Second Reading, was brought in to meet one set of circumstances, the set of circumstances being that certain existing undertakings find they cannot meet the estimated increased demand likely to arise, that certain existing undertakings will have surplus electricity to supply, that if machinery be now installed by those now short of electricity it will entail an expenditure of money found to be useless by 1930, when the national supply comes into being.</P>
      <P>There is no probability whatever &mdash;that was the word Deputy Johnson used&mdash;that there will be any unemployment of people.  If anything, the possibility is that with the linking up and with the increased demand, there will be new employment.  The Bill, however, is temporary; it is designed to meet a very temporary situation.  It is not a general electricity supply Bill. It is a question of machinery alone, and I urge and hold that the matter of provision for compensation of employees, whom the Deputy has indicated in connection with undertakings where disemployment was likely to occur, is outside the scope of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Bill authorises the Minister between now and a certain date, which is quite-indefinite, to oblige certain undertakings to enter into arrangements regarding the supply of electricity. Again I will deal with a point that was dealt with before.  Present intentions may be limited, but the possibilities under the Bill are much greater than the present intentions.  I want to guard against the possibilities which may lead to damage to the interests of particular persons.</P>

I am making that on a point of order as to the feasibility of this proposed new section being within the scope of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I agree, and am quite prepared to make the President <Col N="176" /> or Deputy Good pay the fees, but I accept that as an impossibility.  I believe that the existing legislation contains phraseology almost identical with that.  I want the general proposition, apart from phraseology to be embodied in the Bill as a consequence of the action of the Minister in pledging undertakings to enter into agreements one with the other, that displacement would give a right to employees for compensation for loss of employment.  If that proposition is accepted by the Minister I am not going to argue on the phraseology or drafting of the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is one that possibly requires a little more explanation than we have had from the Deputy.  I take it this Bill refers to two different authorities for the distribution of electricity at present in the Saorstát.  We have, first of all, electricity distributed directly through the local authority.  We have in other cases the powers of the local authority handed over to a private company, and administered by it.  The Deputy asks in his amendment that in the event of anything happening that would displace any of the employees&mdash;I am interpreting the amendment as I read it&mdash;of either of the bodies I have referred to, these employees are to be compensated. I take it that is the intention.  That requires possibly an explanation as to the difference of these two sets of employees as they exist at the moment under the Acts.  As the Deputy is aware, in the case of the services of any employees of the local authority being dispensed with under the existing Acts, those employees will have their rights of compensation and otherwise.  With regard to employees of private companies, the position is not the same.  If we are to assume for the moment that the services of those employees should be dispensed with, and that they should be compensated, let us see exactly the position that might arise.  The distribution of electricity would be taken on in that particular area.  Say, for argument's sake, where a private company carries on those particular duties at the moment <Col N="177" /> that that private company itself would come to an end, and that the particular services which it discharged would be discharged by another body. In all probability the employees of the first body who would be discharged would become employees of the second body, which would carry on similar duties.  Therefore, if you compensate these men for loss of employment, and they walk the next week into similar employment under different employers, what are you compensating them for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is designed, according to Deputy Johnson, to guard against what he describes as the usual procedure, the economising by reductions of staff.  I described on the Second Reading the circumstances under which this Bill came to be introduced at all.  Certain undertakings find that they have a surplus of electricity and certain others find that they have not sufficient to meet the estimated demand unless they put down an increased plant.  By the linking up of these different undertakings the necessity of putting down plant is obviated if this Bill be introduced and passed.  So far from there being any likelihood of unemployment arising through the operation of this Bill the probability is all the other way.  Let me take one instance.  Lucan at present is without electricity.  Under this Bill Lucan will be able to have electric light provided to it.  Men are at present out of employment through the failure of a certain body to supply electricity.  Those people will again be in employment if this goes through. There has to be met, some way or another, an estimated increased demand for electricity in and around Dublin alone up to 1930, and that can be met in either of two ways.  Either let certain undertakings instal additional plant at a heavy cost to themselves, useless expenditure in the light of what 1930 will bring, or else have this the inter-linking, and have pretty definitely the assurance that there will be extra employment and almost, without doubt, the assurance that there cannot be any unemployment arising from this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the introduction of this amendment which certainly gives room <Col N="178" /> for any amount of friction, and it is quite unneccessary in the circumstances I have described.  I have given something equivalent to an assurance on Second Reading and have repeated the circumstances under which the matter arose now.  I ask Deputy Johnson to consider, not some imaginary thing that is likely to happen by somebody operating this in a wholly unheard of way, but what is the normal probability of the use of this Bill between this period and 1930, and let Deputy Johnson discover for himself what is the likelihood of any unemployment arising as a result of it and then consider whether it is necessary to move this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>My proposition is that there may be changes in the organisation of the staff and that one, two or three men may be displaced as a consequence of the operation of the powers of the Minister.  I do not think it is going to be a very serious matter.  I do not think there are many men going to be displaced, but the people concerned are afraid there may be and at least there is a possibility that one or two men specialising in a particular class of work may be displaced as a result of the operation of the Act.  He may be a man not likely to be taken on in a new job because he served too long a period and is not young enough and it is desirable that the position of such men should be safeguarded, as they have been in respect of railway legislation, local authority legislation, and other legislation of a similar kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the working of this is not likely to mean a great loss to many men.  It may not mean a loss to any man, but at least we should safeguard the individual, even if it is only one person.  This amendment is not introducing any new principle. It is one which is already inserted in many Bills of a similar character. This is said to be a temporary Bill.  It is going to deal with special circumstances.  That does not obviate the necessity for meeting possible ills which might arise out of the working of the Bill when we are not introducing any new principle.  I meet Deputy Good's point as to whom the <Col N="179" /> responsibility will lie on by saying that the Minister will undoubtedly, in making his Order, take account of all the circumstances and that the organisation which is going to benefit by the mutual assistance scheme will necessarily have to bear the cost of the compensation. As I say, there is no new principle embodied in this, as similar provisions have been included in railway amalgamation Bills, local authorities amalgamation Bills, and other Bills of a similar kind and no great harm has been done.  If it is true, as the Minister says &mdash;and I think it is probably true with possible individual exceptions&mdash;that no persons will be disemployed, then the introduction of this provision will not do anybody any harm, as it will not be called upon.  But if it happens that some persons are displaced from their employment, then it is well that we should have their position safeguarded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy says there is nothing new in principle in this amendment, I suppose I shall have to agree with him.  He quotes the Railways Act.  The section was put in the Railways Act specially because there was an implication throughout that some of the economies were going to be effected by a reduction of staffs, and it was to meet cases where we saw that the cases were not merely likely but were certain, that a compensation section of this type was put in.  The Deputy also speaks of the likelihood of men not being taken on&mdash; the type of case which Deputy Good has given.  This amendment was first suggested <Col N="180" /> by the Electrical Power Engineers' Association.  In a letter in which they refer to it, they speak of those men who might fall to be unemployed under the operations of this, and they talk of the specialised character of their employment.  Precisely because the character of their employment is of so specialised a nature, they are not likely to suffer unemployment.  No undertaking about to enlarge its plant, its supply capacity, is going to take on unskilled men when you have men whose training is of this specialised character in an already existing undertaking ready to be taken over.</P>
      <P>The other argument is that this ought to be included because the Deputy agrees with me it is not likely there is going to be unemployment, and, therefore, the section will not be called upon. The section undoubtedly gives tremendous room for friction.  If a case has been made that there was going to be unemployment from this or that, the Bill was of such an extensive nature, or that it was going to last for such a long period of time that the danger was really to be apprehended of unemployment, I could admit the amendment.  I consider the amendment definitely appropriate for argument on the Electricity Bill with regard to the Shannon, but it has no footing here.  While I do hold that there is going to be no unemployment arising from the operation of the clause, I cannot accept the amendment simply because it is not ever going to be called upon.</P>

      <P>As this is the last section of the Bill, I should like to indicate certain circumstances in connection with it.  A series of amendments were suggested and discussed, and I thought myself that these amendments would have been put down.  I could then have indicated a composite amendment that I was prepared to accept to meet the not unreasonable fears of certain people that the word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; in Section 3 might be too widely construed.  What I feel I ought to do under the circumstances is to indicate that I will be prepared to accept at the end of Section 3 a new sub-section reading as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Where the premises to which a supply of electricity is proposed to be given under this section are situate in the area of supply of an authorised undertaker, the Minister shall not approve of the giving of the supply under this section unless or until he is satisfied that such authorised undertaker is either unable or unwilling to give the supply.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is designed to lessen the fears of those who believe that the right allowing statutory undertakings to have an area of supply limited to them was going to be broken in upon.  Deputy Myles raised this on the Second Reading, and I felt that he would be the person to indicate some amendment of the sort.  I have now indicated the amendment that I am prepared to accept if anyone moves for it on the Fourth Stage.</P>

A phrase runs through the Bill &ldquo;Electricity produced by the State.&rdquo;  I am not sure that that is the kind of phraseology one would desire to introduce into legislation. After all, while it may be produced in State-owned undertakings, it can hardly be said to be produced by the State.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Dáil approves of the policy of the Minister for Education.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I undertook, when the Estimates were under consideration last year, to afford the fullest opportunity as soon as the House met again for a discussion on the Education Estimates.  It was my intention at that time to have put forward a token vote which would enable Deputies to approach the consideration of the Ministry of Education from every possible angle, and to deal with all the Votes which affect Education just as if the entire Estimates were before them.  A supplementary Estimate in respect of the Ministry of Education will be introduced before the end of the year, and in consequence, as I did not like to introduce a supplementary Estimate now, I put down this motion: &ldquo;That the Dáil approves of the policy of the Minister for Education.&rdquo;  In moving that, we afford an opportunity for the fullest possible discussion of the Ministry just as if the several Estimates of that Ministry were before the House.  I just make that explanation <Col N="184" /> in order to make clear that any undertaking we have given in connection with the administration of this Ministry is now fulfilled, and I accordingly move.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of procedure, the President in June made a very definite promise that the first business of the Dáil, after the resumption, would be to deal with the Estimates of the Ministry of Education, and he promised to introduce a token vote, so that all the departments of the Ministry of Education might be dealt with as they would be dealt with if we were discussing the original Estimates, and if the Minister for Education had been able to be present.  I think it is not a fulfilment of that promise to say that there is to be a supplementary Estimate for this Ministry introduced before Christmas.  That Estimate, in any case, would deal with something specific.  I think, apart from the discussion which the motion itself would probably involve on the general policy of the Ministry of Education, the promised opportunity to discuss the Estimates in detail will not be fulfilled by the President's statement now.  I would ask that in the discussion on the motion which he is now moving we should have an opportunity to go through the Estimates on a token vote in fulfilment of the promise of the President.</P>

      <P>There are now under the Department of Education, as far as I can see, six Estimates&mdash;Nos. 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 and 46.  In the ordinary way, if the Estimates had been taken and discussed under the first one that would have arisen&mdash;that is Vote 41 for the Office of the Minister for Education, which provides for the salary of the Minister &mdash;a general discussion would have been in order at the beginning identical with the discussion which would normally take place on a motion such as the President has just moved.  This motion provides at least for that general discussion.  It is embarrassing, from the point of view of procedure, to open the Estimates and go through them presumably in Committee and under the rules which obtain in Committee without any motion whatever, but if the Minister for Education is prepared to answer on the Estimates, and if Deputies generally want to do that, my point of view is that we will have to do it.  I take it that that actually can be done; that is to say, we can take under this motion the general discussion that usually arises on the first occasion when a Minister's Vote comes up in Committee on Finance in discussing the Estimates, and then proceed to Estimate 41 and go through the sub-heads in Committee as well as through all the other Estimates if that is exactly what is required.</P>

      <P>At this stage, then, I am not quite certain at what length, or in what detail, I may be expected to deal with the President's motion.  The discussion on the Estimates will, no doubt, take very largely the form of criticism, and I imagine that the greater part of what I shall have to say then will probably be in reply to the criticisms of members of the Dáil. Just now I presume Deputies will expect from me only a brief preliminary statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>We would like a statement of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="Professor MacNEILL Professor MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>A statement of policy, I take it, has two aspects. First of all, there is the administrative <Col N="187" /> plan of education.  I do not say it is the first in order or importance, and along with that there is the general aim of education.  These are very wide generalities, and I did not come prepared at this stage to go into a general exposition of these matters; that is to say, I did not come specially prepared, but I am quite willing, according to the best of my ability, to state in general terms, to the members of the Dáil what, I think, most of them probably appreciate in a large degree already, I regard as the proper policy, and, therefore, the actual policy of the Department for which I am responsible.</P>
      <P>I have described elsewhere, under circumstances when I am more at my case than standing up to explain myself in speech&mdash; that is to say, when I have a pen at the end of my fingers&mdash;what I think is the proper policy of the Department of Education and its proper function.  I have described it in general terms as a conservation and a building up of the particular type of civilisation which is suited to the genius of the people of this country and concurrent with their traditions, and suited also to the lines of development that are before them.  And I have said, also, that in my conception, the two things are identical with the type of civilisation which is suited to us and our nationality and that, consequently, the business and main functions of the Department of Education in this country are to conserve and to build up our nationality, and I look upon that in every aspect&mdash;cultural, economical, political, and in any other way that it can be described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought it necessary to state that position because of the kind of counter position, or different aiming, which I could see underlying many things that were said on the subject of Irish education.  How that is to be done in detail I do not propose to attempt to expound here.  The exposition of it takes the form of administrative measures which are known to the public and in any other form than these measures I presume that the explanation of a policy of that kind might be described in the familiar <Col N="188" /> phrase as merely window dressing.  In July last, when I was not able to be present, the President, on my behalf, made a statement here which covered in general terms the ground of the administrative reform and proposals of this Department.  I need hardly recapitulate now or repeat what was said by the President then.  Briefly I recall to the minds of Deputies that it was pointed out by him that you are now in a position to deal with the work of the Department of Education as a united whole.</P>
    <P>Under your ruling, sir, the Estimates for education now come as one group together for the first time, under the consideration of the Dáil.  The President's statement dealt with the unification&mdash;I prefer that word to co-ordination&mdash;of the different branches of education which were formerly run practically as quite distinct branches. Almost at the root of that unification has been the joining together of the inspectorate of the different Departments. It will be agreed, I think, by those who have experience in education that a measure of this kind, bringing all the inspectors engaged in educational work under the Department into common counsel, is a valuable measure.  I ought perhaps to congratulate the representatives of one party here on having produced a statement on educational policy for the country.  I have this statement.  I have read it carefully&mdash;Labour's Policy on Education.  I consider it an admirable document.  I do not agree with every word and every syllable in it, but I think it is an excellent thing that, I suppose, we may say, a political party has for the first time concentrated its mind on the general problem of education.  I suppose it may be assumed that those who represent educational work in the Labour Party and are associated with it, are entitled to the chief credit for the production of this statement of policy that I refer to.  If that be so, I congratulate them, in particular, on it.  I have long personally looked forward to the time when those who were engaged on the work of education would themselves endeavour to shape out a policy of education for the public in general, and I wish to give <Col N="189" /> an assurance that if other bodies of public opinion, and other bodies of public representatives, follow this excellent example, I will do my best to study and understand every line and every word of any statement that they will produce on the subject.  That applies to the Farmers' Party, and it applies to the business men, and if there be any other sections that are not defined I shall also be glad to read and learn from any proposals that they may make.</P>
    <P>The President's statement explained, first of all, that matter of unification, and then what had taken place with regard to the programme of primary education drawn up in its original form some years ago by a representative conference which, I think, originated from the National Teachers' Organisation. The statement also dealt with the secondary programme.  With regard to primary and secondary education, with regard to education generally&mdash; for I never liked to separate them into these departments&mdash;I have in mind that the system should be&mdash;I might quote the words of a circular which was issued along with the programme to the schools&mdash;&ldquo;such as to turn the minds and the efforts of the bulk of the pupils towards the land of Ireland and the great agricultural industry on which for generations to come the economic life of the nation will be based.&rdquo;  I feel that a very large part of the policy of the Department of Education will consist in close co-operation and concordance with the development schemes put before the country by the Departments of Agriculture and of Industry and Commerce, a much closer concordance than anything of the kind that had existed, if anything of the kind has existed, in our experience in the past.  The question of attendance at schools has been brought before you time and again.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="Professor MacNEILL Professor MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained on a previous occasion that I am no great believer in using the compulsory powers of the State either to compel children to attend school or to compel them to learn any subject, no matter <Col N="190" /> what that subject may be, when they attend school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good promise for the Compulsory Education Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="Professor MacNEILL Professor MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not perhaps take as much satisfaction in the fact that that promise is to have its fulfilment as some Deputies may. Perhaps I have a different idea from them of the relation between the State and the individual.  However, there is agreement on that as a practical measure, whatever difference of opinion there may be as to the principles that underlie it, and as the President's announcement to-day has made known to you, a Bill providing for compulsory attendance will very shortly be presented to you.  The President's statement also dealt with steps that are to be taken to improve the training of teachers.  There is one matter of the greatest importance, with regard to which I know criticism will be forthcoming, and I will welcome that criticism&mdash;the more effectively it draws attention to the present condition of things the better it will please me&mdash;and that is the actual provision of school buildings.  It is a subject upon which I do not like to let myself go. Other Deputies, no doubt, will say, and say as forcibly as I should like to say it, the necessary things about it, and I am willing to yield the place to them. I certainly shall be very well pleased if the result of this discussion is to focus public attention on the actual school accommodation that exists, and also on how that provision will suit when, as I hope, more effective means are available for securing an adequate attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to administrative measures for development, it may be well that I should outline for you the kind of measures which I consider desirable and for which provision ought to be made.  The aim of the Department, which in part has already been carried into effect, and with which these various measures are regarded as fitting in, is to provide a clear educational highway from the most elementary to the most advanced stages of education, to provide for connection between the end <Col N="191" /> of each stage and the beginning of the next stage or stages.  In some cases there is, naturally, a branching of the ways, and the progress is not continuous in all directions.  In actual practice the system, when completed, should provide first of all that the primary stage should bring all pupils to the point at which they would be fit to enter into a more advanced stage, and prepare them so that they would be able to take full advantage of the instruction given in the continuation stage.</P>
    <P>To that end it is contemplated that the primary system should provide the final test in the shape of a leaving examination and a leaving certificate, and that these should form the ordinary means of entrance&mdash;the entrance door &mdash;to the initial stages of the post-primary system.  In the secondary system there are two well-defined stages, a four years' course of general education ending with the intermediate certificate examination, and a two years' course of more specialised, though still general, education, ending with the leaving certificate.  The technical and continuation stage is to have a post-primary or intermediate stage and a higher stage, and the post-secondary or university stage, entrance to which can only be obtained by passing the tests in respect of the primary leaving certificate examination.</P>
    <P>As regards the secondary, technical, or intermediate examination and the higher secondary or technical leaving certificate examination, this technical system would have at the end of each of these stages a suitable examination similar to those already in existence in secondary schools.  For the building up of that continuous process provision has already been made in part by the intermediate certificate examination in the secondary system, and by the coordination of the top stages of the primary system with the lower one of the secondary system.  The power is given to good primary schools to proceed at the end of the primary stage to give secondary education up to any stage which their teaching power and pupils' capacity permit.  There are the coordination of programmes of secondary <Col N="192" /> schools with those of the training colleges, the acceptance of a leaving certificate examination of the secondary system as entrance to the university, and the results of the test for awarding scholarships to the university, the acceptance by the university of training college course and examination as equivalent to part of their lower university courses and tests.  It is not possible at present to carry out completely all that this plan of education involves.  We have at present sitting a primary programme conference and we have before us this question of better school attendance, and we have, further, the organisation and re-organisation of technical and continuation education.  Until some definite progress has been made with these things it will not be possible for us to complete the system that I have outlined, but when we have reached that stage it will be possible to complete the plan by arranging, in the first place, for a primary leaving certificate examination as the door by which pupils will have to pass into any part of the post-primary system, and, secondly, by having the post-primary system thoroughly co-ordinated with the primary system and with the university.  That will give you three definite stages, marked best, perhaps, by the approximate ages of those who will pass through, namely, primary up to 14 years of age, intermediate from 14 to 16 years of age, and secondary from 16 to 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>I have spoken of branches of post-primary education.  The branches in contemplation are:&mdash;(1) Part-time continuation education up to 16 or 18 years of age for those who cannot get whole-time education after the primary stage; (2) for those who, though they remain under instruction and have not to take up work for their livelihood immediately after the primary stage, require immediate vocational, or semi-vocational, training, full day-time technical education; and (3) full day-time general intermediate education for those who can take advantage of it. Such general intermediate education will be given as at present either in a secondary school or, where the circumstances permit it, in a suitable higher <Col N="193" /> section of a primary school.  As I have said, part of this plan is actually in operation, and the system in operation has in view the completion of this plan. The technical side of the plan, I admit, is one which is still undeveloped, and it is one the development of which will require competent investigation.  These remarks give you, imperfectly, I admit, a sketch first of all of the general aim of educational policy and, secondly, of the framework of the plan of education within which that aim is to be carried out.  I have read in the Press a great deal of controversial matters with regard to the policy of this Department. I may say I have been glad to find attention directed to that extent on the problem of education.  I do not propose in this statement to enter into those controversies, or any controversy. I have no doubt that in the discussion that is before us, whether on the question of general policy, or on the question of detail arising in Committee out of the Estimates, I shall meet with a great deal of valuable criticism, and there will be opportunity for those who disagree with the general policy, or with any aspect of it, or with any part of its plan of working, to express their criticism on the matter.  I undoubtedly will find myself in a better position to meet the views expressed by Deputies, or through Deputies, when I hear them in criticism, than I am at the moment.  I consider myself at present as merely supplying the Dáil with a general statement upon which, and towards which, and, if necessary, outside of which, the criticism of members can be directed.  I trust myself that while I recognise the right, and even the duty, of hostile criticism, that most of the criticism, or at all events of the criticism I shall have to meet, will be constructive and helpful.  Before I leave this part of the discussion, and leave the field to other Deputies, I should like to express my sincere regret if my necessary absence has caused any public inconvenience, or any inconvenience to the representatives of the public here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House is: &ldquo;That the Dáil approves of the policy of the Minister for Education.&rdquo;  I wonder how many <Col N="194" /> in the House know what the policy of the Minister for Education is?  I am beginning to wonder whether we are really serious in this matter and whether this motion has been seriously proposed this evening.  I take it that I am in as good a position as any member of the House to be thoroughly acquainted not only with the policy, but the practice and administration of the Minister, and I certainly confess that I am not in a position to say what the policy of the Minister for Education is. I would like to know what the innermost feelings of any person in the Dáil will be who will vote for this motion, if we do not hear, when the motion has been fully discussed, something that will let us know more exactly than what we have heard up to the present as to the policy the Minister stands for. As I said, I wonder whether the Government are really taking this question of education seriously.  Honestly, I do not think they are.  In the absence of the Minister, when the Estimates were up last July, I complained seriously.  I said then, what I will say now when the Minister is present, that it was not in my opinion, or in the opinion of a great many people, treating education fairly to have the Minister who was charged by this Dáil with the responsibility for carrying on the work of education and taking charge of the education of the country, so long absent from his duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education above any other subject, above any other matter, was the one thing, because of neglect in the past, that required to be fostered by an Irish Government.  It was one of the things that we hoped the establishment of a home Government would do more than anything else to foster.  We looked forward to the home Government fostering Irish education, and now we find that the Ministry responsible for the Government of the country takes that subject so lighly that it can detach from his duty the Minister for Education.  I wonder what would the farmers say if the Minister for Lands and Agriculture were sent to do other work for twelve months.  I do not wish to dwell upon that aspect of the question any further. I would like to emphasise that the Government is now in office for almost four years; it has charge of the education <Col N="195" /> of the country for almost that time.  What it has done in that time for education is very easily summed up.</P>
    <P>The Minister more than anybody else has stressed the necessity time and again of associating the people with the work of education, bringing to the people the necessity for educational improvement and for attention to educational work.  One would think, seeing the necessity for this so admitted, that it would be the special subject to which the Department would devote its attention.  I wish the Minister for Education would take a leaf out of the book of the Minister for Justice and come down to brass facts, as the Minister for Justice often asks us to do.  I have been reading very attentively a series of articles written by the Minister for Education which have appeared in a Journal.  I wish in those articles, such as they were, that he did come down to brass facts.  I wish we could gather definitely what he was aiming at, what he was hoping to secure.  I wish that he would be more definite than he was in his statement here this evening when he said that the main business of the Educational Department, and his main policy, was to conserve and build up our nationality.  That is a very vague, a very general statement, It could be held that there were very many different ways, numerous ways, by which that end could be achieved; it could also be held, and undoubtedly it is held, that there are different ideas and different views&mdash;some of them even almost opposing views&mdash;as to what one is to understand by nationality. The Minister should know, if he were not, as he seems to be from his writings and statements, wholly detached from practical affairs, living in the air, as it were.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister should know that the one question that is agitating the minds of the people at present is the question of compulsory Irish in the schools.  The Minister has completely ignored that question in his statement. He has not said one word in defence, or in explanation, of his policy.  Forgetting that there is a positive motion before the House which requires argument <Col N="196" /> to recommend it, he has taken the line of sitting tight and waiting to be asked questions which he promises to answer on this and on other matters. That is not the proper way to treat the House on a very important motion of this kind.  I think it is for somebody on the Government Benches to make a case for the support of this motion; that case has not been made, I respectfully contend.  The Minister referred more than once to a programme, what is known as the National Programme, and he also referred to the President's speech on the occasion of the Estimates. If I would be allowed to make a comparison, it was a much clearer and, to me, more satisfying statement of policy than I have listened to this evening from the Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>At the same time that speech, boiled down, dealt almost entirely with two matters, the question of the school programme and the question of co-ordination.  Co-ordination has been secured in the upper regions of the system by the joining up of the inspectorate; but there is very little evidence of co-ordination in practice where the co-ordination is really wanted.  As evidence of that fact we had statements made in the Press a few days ago to the effect that a number of children presented themselves for examination at the Technical Schools and only a very small percentage was able to pass the examination.  There is nothing to show whether the examination had any relation to subjects being taught in the primary schools.  We do not know that.  There is no evidence of co-ordination there.</P>

    <P>The main purport of the President's statement had to do with the question of programmes.  The Minister, in one of his very few statements on educational policy, stated definitely in Clare that the programme of the National Conference was to be carried out in its entirety.  I wonder did the Minister realise exactly what he was saying, because the programme of the National Conference which the Minister says will be carried out in the schools&mdash;and he will insist on that as part of his policy&mdash;contained much more than a <Col N="197" /> programme.  There was something set out in it that the teachers of the schools were to carry out.  If the Minister reads the programme carefully&mdash;I hope he did read it&mdash;he will find also that there was a good deal in it that the Minister for Education was to carry out.  If the teachers or the schools were expected to do their part, it is only natural that the Minister and the Educational Department would do their share.  The National Conference that sat in 1922 had under consideration the question of attendance at the schools.  A definite report was drawn up, and in the programme issued to the schools by the Minister himself, recommendations were made with regard to the question of attendance.</P>
    <P>They said it was impossible to do any work while the attendance remained as it was.  What has been the history with regard to that recommendation?</P>
    <P>The people who signed that programme on that occasion and who have made the best efforts to carry it out were evidently assured that such a measure as would secure good attendance in the schools would be put into operation immediately.  Things dragged on, and in 1923 we had a statement from the Minister as to his own personal views with regard to compulsory attendance.  It was a statement of his own philosophy with regard to compulsion and the right of the State to interfere and so forth, perfectly discouraging to those looking forward for help to secure good attendance in the schools.  By 1924, however, the Minister had been brought around to the necessity for a compulsory attendance measure, and if he takes the trouble to read up the debates of 1924 he will find he was converted.</P>

      <P>He was converted to the necessity for a compulsory attendance measure.  He shakes his head now, and we have listened to him this evening practically reading his recantation.  I do not know what the policy of the Minister for Education is with regard to compulsory attendance.  A Bill will be introduced. <Col N="198" /> We have the promise of the President for that, but the Minister for Education does not believe in compulsory attendance. The Bill need never be introduced if this is to be the policy of the Minister for Education.  It is damned at its inception.</P>
      <P>There were other things recommended by this conference which dealt with education besides the mere school curriculum and the matter I mentioned a few moments ago.  There was the question of the school buildings and the question of equipment.  Again it was pointed out that proper equipment would have to be secured and proper school accommodation.  Four years have gone by since that programme was introduced or signed, and what has the Minister to report this afternoon with regard to providing those things which are so necessary to have any programme adequately taught? He has not given us any statistics with regard to the position of education in the country.</P>
      <P>I complained last year of the delay in publishing statistics and making them available.  The complaint may be made this year, though not to the same degree, but still we have no report available for 1924.  It is only brought up to April, 1924.  There are no reports with regard to the position of education generally in the schools and in the country.  There was a declaration of policy with regard to children generally made by Dáil Eireann and I believe I am right in saying that the Minister was present at the time the declaration was made and that he subscribed to the declaration and policy then outlined. The democratic programme of the first Dáil declared:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual welfare of the children, to secure that no child shall suffer hunger, or cold, from lack of food, clothing or shelter, but that all shall be provided with the means and facilities requisite for their proper education and training as citizens of a free and Gaelic Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Minister for Education, the Government and members of <Col N="199" /> this Dáil, to say how far has that policy been carried out?  How far even has it been attempted?  I have had the advantage of seeing certain reports from the officials of the Minister's own Department which I understand are being published and should be available in a few days.  They should have been available long ago.  It is one of the complaints I make that these things are not available.  If I were to go into any details on this occasion, to read extracts from these, they would show quite definitely that children are attending school cold and hungry and that there is no provision in the school when they go there, certainly no adequate provision for their relief either from cold or hunger.  Reports are available to show that very often what is deemed to be the low standard in some schools is due entirely to the fact that the children are very poorly nourished.  The state of the school buildings to which the Minister has just briefly referred can hardly be adequately described.  In a great many cases they are nothing more than thatched hovels.  Here is what one official of the Minister has reported with regard to school buildings in his area:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is with regret I have to record that a considerable proportion of the schoolhouses are of a poor and primitive type.  Old buildings with thatched roofs are not uncommon, and I have visited several quite unsuitable for school purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are the buildings that do duty for schools.  The Minister referred in his statement to a little booklet published lately by the Labour Party: &ldquo;Labour's Policy on Education.&rdquo;  I might say in passing that what I might call the people directly entrusted with education are not entirely responsible for the production of this document. It is the considered policy of the Party as a whole, considered by the annual Trades Congress and adopted and approved by them.  In that document there are definite recommendations which I commend to the consideration of the Minister &mdash; recommendations especially which will tend to solve this problem which the Minister evidently has found insoluble up to the present, <Col N="200" /> that of providing adequate school accommodation.</P>
    <P>He will find there also a suggestion which has been made on many previous occasions in the Dáil and which has not been referred to in any way in the statement of the Minister.  It is not an unusual thing&mdash;in fact it is quite usual&mdash;for Ministers to set up councils of one kind or another&mdash;consultative or advisory&mdash;and they bring into those councils people who are directly concerned with the matters dealt with by the Minister.  Before they take action in any particular direction it is the practice to consult such advisory bodies.  Repeatedly the Minister has been asked to set up in connection with education some advisory body: in some way or another to bring the people generally into touch with what is being done in educational administration.  There is no such body in connection with education, although one would naturally think that as education concerns the life of all the people, this Department more than any other would find the necessity for such a body absolutely compelling.  There is no mention of any intention on the part of the Minister to set up such a council or to associate his administration in any way, directly or indirectly, with the people. After all, the people of the country should be interested in education, and the Minister will be the first to agree with the statement that they are not sufficiently interested in educational matters.  I wonder will the Minister agree that some of the blame, at least, for that state of affairs must be laid at the door of his own Department. He has not told us what attempts have been made to associate the people, either nationally or locally, with the work of education, outside whatever discussions may take place in the Dáil. That is not sufficient.  I hope that the Minister will tell us whether, in fact, he has any intention of taking any steps to set up an advisory council of education or to introduce legislation which will set up in local areas some bodies which will have something to do with the administration of local educational services.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out more than <Col N="201" /> once that it ought to be the duty of a locality to look after the upkeep of its schools.  Some four or five weeks ago I had occasion to address a series of questions to the Department of Education, the object of which was to endeavour to fix the present responsibility for the provision of fires in the schools.  I have been unsuccessful.  I have not had any reply to my queries. Possibly the Department is not in a position to give a reply.  It may be that they cannot say at the moment who is really responsible for the keeping of a fire in a school.  It is stated in one of their regulations that it is the duty of the local manager to supply a fire.  Supposing the local manager does not do that, or has not the means to supply a fire, what is to happen?  At least one case occurred in which no fire was provided.  That did not occur under the present regime, but it is possible for it to occur as we are as much at sea in that particular matter as we were under the old regime.  In that case the teacher, out of pity for the children, simply closed the school.  The result was that the Commissioners stopped a day's salary from the teacher.  There is no machinery available at present whereby such a simple duty as the keeping of a fire in a national school can be definitely provided for.  It is left to the voluntary effort of the local manager.  Local managers have such calls on their energies and finances nowadays as to have nothing left over for the provision of fuel or for the cleaning and general upkeep of a school.  A small grant is available from the Oireachtas, a grant carried over from the British regime, but, as the Minister must know, that is practically useless for the heating, cleaning and general upkeep of the schools.  Obviously it ought to be the duty of the localities to see that the schools in which the children spend the greater part of the day are at least comfortable and, above all, that they are clean.  But the Minister knows that there is no machinery, and no steps are being taken to provide machinery. The Minister has not told us that he proposes to take steps to provide machinery; yet we are asked to support the policy of the Minister.  I <Col N="202" /> would ask the Minister has he any policy with regard to the provision of suitable schools and the upkeep and equipment of school buildings.  If he has such a policy, what machinery does he propose to provide for this very necessary service?</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of the health of the children and the sanitation of the schools.  Possibly that comes more within the purview of another Department than that of the Minister; but, at least, it should be known, and I am sure it is known to the Minister, that there is an Act of Parliament on the Statute Book since 1919 that has never been put into operation providing for medical inspection and treatment of school children. It ought to be the constant duty of the Minister for Education to bring pressure to bear on the Department responsible, which I take to be the Department of Local Government, to see that that Act is put into operation.  The children of the country are committed to the care of the Minister for Education, and it should be his charge more than any other member of the community to see that they are adequately and properly cared for, physically and mentally.</P>
    <P>In a little booklet to which the Minister referred, there is a statement with regard to the health of school children in other countries that is worth quoting. Reference is made to the necessity for medical inspection and treatment of school children and the steps to be taken generally in connection with the prevention of disease, and then it states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sir George Newman, in the report of the Chief Medical Officer for the British Board of Education for 1921, tells us that of the children who entered school at five years of age, 35 per cent. bring with them physical defects and the seeds of disease which gives them a very bad start in their school life.  The following report as to the condition of children attending English schools is interesting:&mdash;Two per cent. have a serious visual defect; 12 per cent. suffer from diseases of the nose and throat; dental decay is present in 60 to 70 per cent.; 2 per cent. suffer <Col N="203" /> from deafness; 2 per cent. from heart disease; 3 per cent. from anaemia; 5 per cent. from glandular enlargement; 2 per cent. from mal-nutrition. It would be interesting to know what are the comparative figures for Irish children.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister knows that we have no such figures, and that no attempt has been made to get them. Anyone who is in touch with the schools in cities especially, and even in the country, must know, from even casual observation, that our schools are not very greatly different from the state of affairs mentioned in the report. It has been pointed out more than once that money spent in preventing disease in the early life of the child will mean, perhaps, the saving of millions of money at a later stage, and also many thousands of lives.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the necessity for post-primary education, and I think in the statement made by the President last July a kind of tentative offer was made to set up a Commission to go into the whole question of post-primary education.  I did not gather from the Minister for Education&mdash;I do not know whether he referred to it to-day or not&mdash;if that offer stood.  It was contingent on an expression of opinion from the Dáil saying that it would be advisable or desirable that such a Commission should be set up.  I do not know whether to commend or disapprove of that suggestion.  If the Minister thinks it is a very desirable thing to introduce a system of post-primary education he can do so.  He has introduced other things and made very important administrative changes without taking the step of setting up a Commission, and he has defended that by saying: &ldquo;We do not want any Commissions; we know what the country and the people want, and we will just go ahead and do it.&rdquo;  On the other hand it might be, perhaps, evidence that he is willing to get advice from those whom he thinks are in a position to give it.  In so far as that is an indication that he intends in future to consult the people as to his proposed measures, I think it is to be commended.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> There is no doubt whatsoever that there is very great necessity for doing something in this matter of post-primary education.  I have made a pretty careful calculation with regard to the position of school-going children. I am sorry the Minister did not give it, as it would be more authoritative, and he would have recourse to many sources and statistics not open to the ordinary Deputy.  The calculation I have made goes to show that 90 per cent. of school-going children never go to any school beyond the national school.  There are at least from 10 to 15 per cent. of the children of school-going age between 5 and 15 who never go to any school or get on the rolls of any school.  Approximately only from 52 to 60 per cent. of the children of school-going age attend school with any measure of regularity, and only 9 per cent. of them get any education beyond the national school. They get no post-primary education. I am sure the Minister for Education will be the first to say that that is a thoroughly unsatisfactory state of affairs, if these figures are correct and, as far as my calculation and my information go, they are approximately correct in any case.</P>
    <P>The aggregate sum of money in the Estimates for Education is considerable. Some people possibly would go so far as to say that it is too much. There is one thing that has to be remembered in considering the amount of money voted here for education and it is that, quite differently from any other country that I know of, practically all the expense of education here is borne on the National Vote.  In England, the Vote from Parliament for Education represents only about 50 per cent. of the actual amount spent on education there.  In the case of the Scottish Education Department&mdash;I am speaking now for the year 1923&mdash;anyone who looks up the statistics will find that, whereas the amount voted from the State was something like £5,000,000, the total expenditure on education under that Department was over £10,000,000, the balance being made up from the local rates and by means of local contributions.  It should, therefore, always be borne in mind by <Col N="205" /> people who criticise the amount spent on our education services here that at the present time these services are, with the exception of a ½d. or a 1d. rate for technical education and a small rate for scholarships, borne entirely out of the moneys voted by Parliament. It has been stated, too, and this with more justice, that the amount of money voted is not always economically spent.</P>
    <P>I have said more than once in this House that I am not one of those who believe that economy always means saving expenditure.  I do, however, believe that there is great room for economy in one particular direction in the Department of the Ministry of Education.  This is a country with a very scattered population, and hence very many more schools are necessary to provide for the education of our children than if the people were concentrated in large industrial centres. While that must be so long as our country is as it is, I hold that there are far too many separate schools in the country.  Apart from schools conducted by religious communities, the number of ordinary national schools in the country at present is 5,388.  Of that number 4,679 are schools with an attendance of under 80&mdash;I will say schools with an average of around 50. They are what are called one or two teacher schools.  Now, quite a large number of these could be amalgamated. Such amalgamation would make, not only for economy, but for efficiency, which is the important thing.  We have been preaching this doctrine for many years.  Those engaged in the practical work of education know that it is as easy to deal with a class of nine or ten as it is with a class of four or five. We have, side by side all over the country, little schools with thirty boys in one room and 30 girls in the next room &mdash;that is to say, separate schools with separate staffs under separate roll numbers and entirely independent of each other.  I hold that there is no justification whatever for that state of affairs.  One of the senior officers of the Department of Education, writing on this subject, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The amalgamation of adjoining boys' and girls' schools affords a better <Col N="206" /> prospect of reducing the number of schools, and such amalgamation would be a distinct gain, economically and educationally.  The continuance of small schools side by side is sheer educational waste.</P>
    <P>Now, the Department is not taking any steps to amalgamate these schools and thus make for economy and efficiency.  It is efficiency above all that I am stressing now especially since the question of the teaching of Irish arose.  While it is not always possible to get all the members of a staff fully qualified to teach Irish, if you had an amalgamation of staffs one or two teachers could always be found who would be able to teach it.  But not only is the Department not taking any steps to bring about a policy of amalgamation of schools, but it has retrograded from the position taken up by the old Commissioners of National Education.  There is a regulation of their own made by the Commissioners of National Education, carried over by the present Department and put into operation sometimes.  I say sometimes advisedly, because numerous instances can be quoted in which, when somebody locally offered objection, the rule was not carried out of the two separate schools.  I commend this especially to the Minister for Finance, that the two separate schools were continued because of some local objection and some local resistance to the action which was proposed to be taken.  There are in the country 3,104 mixed schools, boys and girls, and yet the argument is sometimes put up when a case of amalgamation arises that these schools should not be amalgamated.  If it is wrong to amalgamate primary schools for boys and girls, then it is wrong to have 3,104 mixed schools, boys and girls, in the country.  I commend that especially to the Minister for Education as one direction in which he could secure economy and efficiency at the same time; that is, by carrying out a thorough and drastic policy, I might say, of amalgamation in the case of adjoining boys' and girls' schools.  He will find, too, on examination that in many districts there are schools within half a mile of each other&mdash;someone called them miserable little atoms of <Col N="207" /> schools&mdash;which could very well be amalgamated with advantage.</P>
    <P>This question of education is such an extensive one that it is almost impossible to deal with its various phases in a general way.  We shall have an opportunity, later on, of going into the various aspects of the question, but there is one point which I would like to touch upon before I conclude, and that is the question of the teaching of Irish in the schools.  It is a subject which, as I said some time ago, is agitating the minds of a great many people in this country at the present time.  I say, what I think the Minister might have said or adverted to, that the wholesale condemnation of the standard reached by the national schools is not justified, and is not borne out on examination.  I am satisfied myself that a boy or girl who attends school regularly up to the age of 15 or 16&mdash; the ordinary average boy or girl&mdash;has got as good an education now as was given at any time in the past, or that a similar boy or girl would have got, and can compare favourably with a similar boy or girl leaving school in any other country in the same conditions.</P>
    <P>Now when we talk of the poor standard of education reached by the majority of our children, we must remember this: that the majority of our children leave school at the age of 11 and 12 years, which is the average school-leaving age of children.  The children that present themselves at the technical schools, generally, are the type of children who have been three or four years absent from school, who never got beyond perhaps the third or fourth standard before they left school, as they are entitled to do under the law in many cases.  Then at the age of 15 or 16, when their parents begin to have some idea that they will grow up illiterate, they apply for admission to the technical school, and the general report of the technical school authorities is that such children are hopelessly backward.  What else can be expected?  What else is there to be expected?  But there is on record the statement of the heads of secondary <Col N="208" /> schools, who get what I may call the best of the children, especially those who have won local scholarships, to the effect that the children sent up to them from the primary schools are as far advanced, generally speaking, as children of the same standard and the same age have been at any other time.</P>
    <P>With regard to the teaching of Irish, I would like to make this quite plain, speaking now as representative, and on behalf of, the people on whom has fallen the heaviest burden consequent upon the introduction of the teaching of Irish, the teachers all over the country are not opposed to the introduction of Irish as an ordinary subject in the National Schools.  There is no such opposition to the general introduction of Irish.  The Minister can bear out the statement that where friction has occurred, where criticism has occurred, and it has occurred, where there has been criticism with regard to this question from the teachers, it has always centred round the methods employed by the Ministry, and not on the general principle or general question of the introduction of Irish as an ordinary subject of the school programme, and that criticism will continue, so long as the state of affairs that leads to that criticism continues.  But let me say that such criticism on the part of the teachers is not confined to the teaching of Irish.  There will be always, I am afraid, cause for friction.  It is only natural to expect when any new subject is introduced into the schools that there will be more reason for such friction than at other times, but I would like it to be made quite clear, that such criticism, as has emanated from the general body of teachers, has entirely to do with the methods employed rather than the policy adopted.  That is the position officially declared, and officially stated by the representatives of the teaching bodies.  I would like to say that so far as the methods are concerned, I shall have something further to say when that particular subhead comes up for discussion.  I should like to say this, that the Minister has not yet made it quite clear, and I asked him to do so on more than one occasion, what his ultimate aim is in the matter of Irish.  It is all very well <Col N="209" /> to say that his object is to conserve and build up our nationality.  That is not sufficiently definite.  Is the aim of his Department to make this country an Irish-speaking country, or is the aim to make it a bi-lingual country?  We want to know that definitely.  That has not been made sufficiently clear.</P>
    <P>I want to say, further, that while there is any possible chance of reviving the Irish language, the schools, and the schools alone, will not revive the Irish language.  Everyone connected with education can see what is going on at the present time.  Children are learning Irish in the schools, some of them learning it very well.  Some of them leaving the higher standards are well versed in it, and carry through their ordinary business in it, but they go out into the country, and do not go to any other school, and their Irish is forgotten because of disuse.  There is nobody in this country taking any steps whatsoever to take the child, when he leaves school, and encourage him to continue his study of Irish and his practice of Irish speaking.  He speaks Irish in the school, but not outside the school, and there is no organisation which takes charge of the child at that age and does the work that everybody must know is necessary if the object which seems to be aimed at by the Minister is ever to be accomplished. Surely if it is the aim of the Minister for Education to make this nation either an Irish-speaking or a bi-lingual nation he should see that the main link in the chain is fixed at that stage.  The child leaves the school and forgets his Irish, just as he forgets his rules of algebra, geometry, or anything else.  We all do.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect to which I would like to refer, and I shall then have finished with the general question. It is too often forgotten that a primary school is not a technical school or a university, though some people seem to think that it should fulfil the duties of both these institutions and that the boy leaving the National School should be a specialist in a great many things.  Everybody who has some particular subject in his mind that he thinks it would be advisable to have generally known says that that is the <Col N="210" /> subject that should be taught in National Schools.  You cannot teach a subject like agriculture in the National Schools.  An attempt, which was not successful, was made to teach cookery. You cannot teach trades in the National Schools.  The National School, the primary stage of education, must, after all, in the last resort, concern itself with purely elementary matters, and it is not so much the actual subject that is used, it is not so much the amount of knowledge that is got, as the methods employed; we must remember that at that stage all that can be done is to train the mind of the child, not to fill his mind with knowledge.</P>
    <P>If the child leaving the National School has acquired the power to seek knowledge, a very important work indeed has been done.  That is, or should be, the main work of the National School, to train the child to use the faculties he has been given to acquire knowledge himself afterwards.  But, as I say, the people who call out for this, that and the other subjects to be taught in the National School too often forget that, and on the other hand, people who sometimes say, quite without any regard for the real facts of the case, that nothing is being taught nowadays in the schools but Irish, are just as far away from the truth.  I know that that is the general impression in some quarters, and letters have appeared in the Press to that effect. Those who are in touch with the schools know that is very far from being the case, and that, apart from any question of nationality or desire to have a national language, Irish as a subject can be made just as useful for accomplishing the object which I have put forward as being the real object of education, as any other subject, and it is strange that those who object to the teaching of Irish in the schools never think of objecting if, for instance, a teacher takes it into his head to teach French or Latin.  These, of course, are not vulgar subjects like Irish.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that the Minister did not dwell more on what he should know, if he were in close touch with the realities.  He told us, I think, on one occasion that he was a bit of a realist; I am wondering how far that is <Col N="211" /> really true.  The Irish language is the main question connected with education that is agitating the mind of the public. I feel that no Deputy could support this Motion on the case that has been made for it by the Minister for Education up to the present.  I do hope that if the Motion is to be seriously put to the House, somebody on the Government Benches will make a better case for its adoption than has been made by the Minister.</P>

      <P>The request referred to by the Deputy was received by the Department of Defence, but as the gun in question could not be traced, the application has been treated as a claim for compensation and has been referred to the Committee appointed under the Indemnity Act.  It has not yet been possible, owing to the large number of such claims already filed, to have the claim investigated and considered by the Committee.</P>

      <P>asked the President whether he is aware of the large amount of irrecoverable rates on houses in towns and villages of the Saorstát, which have been allowed to fall into ruin through neglect of their landlords; if legislation will be introduced to compel such landlords to rebuild those houses with a view to giving employment to the large numbers of unemployed, and, in the event of failure to rebuild, to compel them to hand over the sites on which such ruins are situated to the urban council or other public authority for building purposes, free of charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not at present proposed to introduce legislation on the lines suggested by the Deputy. Under the Housing (Ireland) Act, 1919 (Section 23) local authorities are vested with power to require the owner of any house suitable for occupation by persons of the working classes to make and keep such house in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation.  If the owner fails to do so the local authority is empowered to enter and execute the necessary works and to recover the cost thereof in a court of summary jurisdiction. The owner may, however, before the expiration of the local authority's notice to enter, close the house for human habitation.  In the latter event, of course, the local authority can exercise, with the approval of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, compulsory powers of acquisition of the premises under the provisions of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890.</P>
