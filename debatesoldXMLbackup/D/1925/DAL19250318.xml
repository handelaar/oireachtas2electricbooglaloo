    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President if he will state when it is intended to introduce the Army Pensions Amendment Bill, and the Town Tenants Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The draft Army Pensions Amendment Bill is at present being considered with special reference to its financial aspect.  Every effort is being made to expedite its examination, but I regret I am not in a position to fix a definite date for its introduction.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to promise the introduction of legislation to deal with the position of town tenants.  The problem requires to be examined in all its bearings, and it has not yet been found possible to reach the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the President indicate the nature of the trouble regarding the delay in the introduction of the Army Pensions Amendment Bill, especially in view of the fact that the introduction of this Bill was promised before the Christmas recess?  At that time a statement was made to the effect that the Bill in draft form was actually placed in the hands of the Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept the Deputy's statement that the introduction of the Bill was promised at the Christmas adjournment.  I would like to point out that the period of service in the National Army <Col N="1128" /> varied from six months to two years, perhaps two and a half years.  The liability of the State in connection with any person discharged from the Army suffering from some disorder scarcely makes any immediate statement necessary.  This Bill had first to be examined in relation to the number of persons discharged from the Army suffering from one of many disorders, and it was intended to make pensions available for affected persons. Numbers had to be taken into account, and it was a very large undertaking.  It was obvious that a short examination, or an imperfect examination, might involve the State in an enormous expenditure. It is unreasonable to ask the State to bear the expense of a pension for a person who joined the Army with a certain disorder and who left the Army with the same disorder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many cases of widows and orphans who have become so because of the service of men in the Army.  Those people are now dependent on home help and on charitable institutions. The husbands of those widows contracted ordinary natural diseases while in the Army and they died.  Is the President prepared to indicate a definite date when such an amending Bill, as is suggested, will be introduced?  Will any assistance be given to such persons as I have indicated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That could only be given under some statute.  We cannot at the present moment state when the Bill will be introduced.  I say the Deputy is exaggerating when he says an enormous number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say &ldquo;enormous.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The number is not great.  Every possible care is being taken to expedite matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand that the President is now giving us an indication that he is not going to deal with tuberculosis cases?  That is practically what the answer amounts to.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER</NameTxt>
      <P>for <b>FINANCE (Mr. Blythe):</b> I am aware that there is discontent amongst the staff of the Ordnance Survey Department.  Some delay in preparing a scheme of reorganisation has arisen in connection with questions affecting the working of the Department, which are the subject of an inquiry by a committee.  The necessary investigations into the circumstances of the staff are, however, now proceeding, and when these are completed the future organisation of the Department will be decided upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the amalgamation of the Kilcormac and Kinnity Dispensaries in Offaly by his Department is causing hardship and inconvenience to the people of those areas; that one of the results will be that patients will have to send a distance of over fourteen miles to secure the services of a doctor; that, furthermore, the doctor in charge of these two dispensaries is also acting as locum tenens for the Clonaslee Dispensary District, which will entail a journey of twenty-four miles by patients residing in the opposite end of the Kilcormac district requiring his services; whether he is satisfied that one doctor can give proper attention to the health of the people where he has such a large area to cover, and if, in the circumstances, he will revert to the old system of dispensaries which was in existence for over sixty years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE (for Minister for Local Government and Public Health) Mr. BLYTHE (for Minister for Local Government and Public Health)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE (for Minister for Local Government and Public Health)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the occurrence of a vacancy in the medical officership of Kinnitty Dispensary <Col N="1130" /> District, portion of Kilcormac Dispensary District was transferred to Birr Dispensary District, and a portion of what was formerly Kinnitty Dispensary District was added to Kilcormac Dispensary District.  The balance of Kinnitty Dispensary District was transferred to Roscrea No. 2 Dispensary District. The furthest point of the rearranged Kilcormac Dispensary District does not appear to be more than ten miles from the Medical Officer's residence, which is in Kinnitty.</P>
      <P>The Medical Officer of Kilcormac Dispensary District has been acting temporarily in Clonaslee Dispensary District, Laoighis County, but the Laoighis County Board of Health have been instructed to appoint a Medical Officer permanently for Clonaslee Dispensary District.  This will obviate the twenty-four mile journeys referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>None of the new districts is unduly large; in fact, some of the other districts in Offaly are of greater extent. I am satisfied that one Medical Officer can give proper attention to the health of the poor in each of the revised areas, and in view of modern means of communication and transport there are substantial grounds for maintaining that arrangements made over sixty years ago may now safely be revised with a view to economy.  The most suitable time to consider such matters is on the occurrence of vacancies in districts where rearrangements will not involve any additional burdens on the rates as regards superannuation allowances.</P>

      <NameTxt>EAMON O DUBHGHAILL</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the <Col N="1131" /> Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he can state the cause of the delay in holding an inquiry into the proposed water supply for Tullow, Co. Carlow, and whether, in view of the fact that maps and specifications in connection with the works are now ready, he will undertake to expedite matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE (replying)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed water supply for Tullow involves the compulsory acquisition of lands and water rights.  Where compulsory powers are sought by a rural district council a petition is required to be presented in accordance with Section 203 of the Public Health Act, 1878.  In this instance the petition was not drawn up in proper form, and the plans did not make sufficiently clear the areas and boundaries of the scheduled lands proposed to be acquired.  The defects in the petition and plans were pointed out in a letter addressed to the Council's solicitor on the 25th ultimo.  When the documents are submitted in proper form no delay will take place in holding a local inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON (for Tadhg O Murchadha)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that the claim of Timothy Twomey, of Ballingeary, Co. Cork, for damage to his motor lorry while in possession of National Troops has been rejected on the ground that claimant assisted Irregulars; whether <Col N="1132" /> he is further aware that Twomey strongly denies the allegation and states he was forced to drive Irregulars, and further asks through his solicitor that the matter be investigated with a view to having the charges against him proved or refuted, and whether such an investigation will be arranged for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="MINISTER for DEFENCE (Mr. Hughes) Peter Hughes">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for DEFENCE (Mr. Hughes)</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Twomey's claim has been rejected for the reason stated. Prior to the seizure of his car, he had been kept under observation as a person who was suspected of assisting the Irregulars.  It was found that he was acting as an intelligence agent and despatch carrier for those forces, and was using the car in that connection.  He was therefore arrested, but was released after a short time, when it was found that internment was affecting him mentally.  His car was also necessarily taken into military custody.  It was returned to him after an interval of three months.  It is not practicable now to cause an investigation to be made into these circumstances.  They, however, preclude the possibility of granting payment of any portion of the claim.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of the Housing Bill, 1925.  The Bill, as I said on introduction, differs slightly from that of last year.  It is now proposed to withdraw the restriction with regard to the sale price, as it has been found in practice that it operated rather against the facilities provided being availed of.  It is hoped as a result of the withdrawal of the restriction that many more houses will be erected.  The amount that was earmarked under last year's Act is practically exhausted.  The whole of the £250,000 has been earmarked for new houses, with the exception possibly of about £10,000.  Only about £10,000 has been earmarked for the reconstruction of houses.  Generally speaking, the Act of last year, which, I think, did not meet with the approval of some Deputies, has been a remarkable success. More houses were built under it than had been built for a considerable number of years previously.  The cost to the State and the local authorities was as reasonable as might be expected. Generally speaking, there was a considerable amount of activity in connection with the building of new houses all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite possible that some criticism may be levelled at the fact that such a small number of houses were built in urban areas, but the number given for the rural areas is scarcely a true index, as quite a number of these were built near towns and the towns would benefit by the fact that they were built in close proximity. It was also found during the year that the sections referring to the cost of building materials had not to be availed of.  There was a considerable amount of criticism when they were included.  Quite possibly the fact that they were included may have been a deterrent in certain cases as regards unusual charges.  At any rate, we are now satisfied that it is possible to make the Bill a success this year without the <Col N="1137" /> inclusion of these particular sections. If it should be found necessary later on to reconsider that view it is open to such reconsideration.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, as far as the local authorities are concerned, that they should get the same terms as last year. I have not any expert information as to reduction in cost of building as compared with last year.  I do not think it is very material.  But that there is an impression abroad and evidence available that operations in connection with building are much more extensive than last year I think is beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>There was a considerable amount of criticism because the reconstruction proposals were not made applicable to rural areas.  Something like two thousand applications came in for reconstruction outside the areas to which the Act applied.  None of these were inquired into.  It would have been a very expensive operation administratively to have inquiries pursued in all parts of the country under the Act.  I explained that that was one of the principal reasons why the rural areas were not included.  Even in towns that particular section of last year's Bill has not been availed of to any extent, and if it were not for the reconstruction of barracks in certain places I think it would be almost inoperative. Most of the houses which people are thinking of reconstructing have lived a very long life and in their old age they will not be able to stand the reconstruction which people would like to carry out.  The number of inquiries received from areas to which the Act applies was, roughly, about 500.  Of this number only about 100 materialised.  I put it to the Dáil, that any proposals of this sort in order to be sound must be economic.  In the case of the applications received, to pay 500 visits and see only 100 results is not good business.  I think that when large establishments, such as barracks, have been reconstructed, it is unlikely that a reconstruction section will appear in any Housing Bills in the future.</P>
    <P>The State, I think, should be satisfied with the expenditure of the money last year.  The activity resulting from <Col N="1138" /> it was very considerable.  Practically 3,000 new houses have been approved. Since the introduction of the Housing of the Working Classes Acts I think the total number of houses constructed under their provisions was something about 10,000.  That 3,000 have been approved for erection in a year which, although approaching normality, could not be said to be a really normal year, is, I think, a satisfactory result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to congratulate the President on the advance in the right direction which he is making in this Bill.  I have only one comment to make and I would be glad if the President would consider the point I wish to raise.  It is in connection with the second schedule, where the grant to any local authority or public utility society for the building of a five-roomed house is fixed at £100, while the grant to a private individual building the same house is only £75.  I cannot understand why a group of persons, four or five in number, calling themselves a public utility society, can get a grant of £100 per house while a private individual only gets £75.  I have had callers within the past twelve months inquiring how to go about getting this grant.  Very often it was found, when endeavouring to get the benefit given to public utility societies, that they could get within one of the number requisite to form such a society, but that the fifth person could not agree to the various proposals.  Where citizens of Dublin have a small site for one house they are very anxious to build on it, whereas a public utility society would try and build four, five or six houses on one site.  I found it impossible to get several of the callers to agree to come together to form a public utility society, whereas individually they were prepared to build a single house on the site which they had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the President would be making a step in the right direction if he would give the same facilities to a person willing to build his own house as he would give had such a person found four others to join him in establishing a public utility society.  I think that a difference of £25 in regard to the <Col N="1139" /> grant given to a private person for building a house similar to that built by a public utility society is too much. I can assure the President that I can give him at least three cases in which persons, if the grant given to individuals was £100 for a five-roomed house, would start building within the next few weeks.  They have their plans ready, but they cannot get five people to come together and form a public utility society.  On the whole, the Bill is a splendid one, and I am satisfied as a result of it that the President will see additional houses going up rapidly. When the first Bill was introduced, I was one of those who drew attention to the point that the limitation to the selling price of a house would tell against the builder at the time, and would prevent many small builders from putting up houses.  I would appeal to the President to place the ordinary private person on the same level as the public utility society by increasing the grant in the case of a five-roomed house to £100.  If he will do so, I am satisfied that in the long run he will find that it will prove an advantage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The President, in introducing the Second Reading of this Bill, said that it differed slightly from the Bill of last year.  I think it differs essentially, and differs in a very great degree, and in such a way as, I think, while probably producing houses, will not go very far towards solving the urban housing problem.  I was one of those who doubted the efficacy of last year's Bill, and I venture to say that some of these doubts proved to be well founded, notwithstanding the President's optimism in the matter.  The figures which he has given to us prove the truth of that statement.  The houses that have been built as a result of last year's principal Act have been mainly rural houses&mdash;2,467 rural as against 515 urban houses.  The criticism which we levelled at the Bill last year was that it was not going any distance to solve the problem of housing for the weekly wage-earner.  That, I think, has been proved in the result. The later Bill, a Bill empowering local authorities to borrow, may go a little further in the direction of assisting <Col N="1140" /> wage-earners, but not, I think, to any great distance.  This Bill, so far as I can read it, is not going any distance towards solving the housing problem for those people who really are in need of houses.  Perhaps that is stating it too strongly, because many people, even of the better-off class, are really in need of houses, but the urgent, clamant need is for houses for the weekly wage-earners earning anything from 30s. to £4 a week when working.</P>
      <P>Last year's Bill gave grants, first from the State and secondly from the local authorities, on certain conditions, the conditions being that the houses were not to be sold at a price exceeding, in the case of a five-roomed house, £400, and a rental of 12/3½ per week. It was thought by that means that there would be an opportunity for the better-off wage-earners to get possession or occupation of houses, but these restrictions are removed in this Bill, as the Minister indicated, because he thinks that they have operated against the building of new houses.  As a means of stimulating the building trade I think this is quite a good Bill. It will certainly help to stimulate the building of houses, but it is not going to help to stimulate the building of houses which will be occupied by the working classes.  This is a Bill for the better housing of the middle classes, or it is a Bill to provide subsidies for speculative builders, but beyond that I cannot see how it is going to have any material effect upon solving the overcrowding problem in the towns and cities of the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposition is to pay a subsidy in the case of a five-roomed house, having a certain floor space, of £150 to £200 per house.  Then the builder may do what he likes with it.  He may let it at its competitive rent; he may sell it at its competitive price.  It may be any kind of house within defined limits of space.  It may be a shooting-box.  It may be a most elaborate house built by a rich man and, provided he does not exceed the floor space, he will get his subsidy.  It is probably going to have the result of building a large number of bungalows on the outskirts of the towns and cities and the letting, or selling, of these bungalows to the better-off <Col N="1141" /> classes.  There is foreshadowed in this proposition&mdash;the President can give his ideas on the matter&mdash;the repeal or the non-renewal of the Rent Restrictions Act when the present Act expires.  The effect of this Bill will be to create competition amongst those people who need houses in the price of houses, whether in rent or in selling price.  It will mean that the builder of a house, having got advantage of the £150 or £200 subsidy, will take the most possible out of the tenant.  One might suggest to the Minister for Finance that he should keep a careful watch on the effect of this, and possibly succeeding Bills of a like kind, upon ground rents and the increase of incomes of ground landlords due to the activities of the Government and the subsidies paid by this Bill to builders.</P>
    <P>I do not know for certain whether it is intended by sub-section (3) of Section 10 to provide for the repeal of Section 4 of last year's principal Act, whether it is intended that in respect of all or any of the houses built, or begun to be built, under last year's Act, the restrictions in regard to selling price or rent are to be removed. Perhaps we could learn whether in respect of houses built under last year's Act the restrictions will be maintained, but that in respect to this year's Act they will be abandoned.  The answer to that question will be rather interesting, because I can imagine, following last week's debate and discussion upon a cognate question, that the persons who built houses under last year's Act will be coming forward and looking for some kind of compensation, or, at least, a repayment of some kind, because they were induced to build under restrictions which their successors under this year's Act will not have applied to them.  Last week, following the pleadings of the President, the Dáil decided to make a present of certain remission of rates to those who built during the last two or three years.  Now, are we to understand that people who built under last year's Act, or even people who built a month or two months before last year's Act came into operation, are to be left in a worse position than the people who will be building <Col N="1142" /> under the new Act?  Or is last week's precedent to be applied by the Ministry, or by the President, when applications from bungalow-builders for remissions come in?</P>
    <P>I foresee that, as a result of the passing of this Bill, there will be a good deal of building trade activity.  It is apparently the Ministry's policy to stimulate the building trade within the next two years to its absolute maximum. With the stimulation promised last week in respect of the larger buildings, and with the stimulation under this Bill for bungalows and middle-class houses, we shall have the building trade pretty active.  But, except very indirectly, we are not going to do anything under this Bill to ease the situation for the over-crowded citizens of Dublin or Cork or Limerick or Waterford, or any of the larger towns.  There was a restriction last year of 12/3 per week in rent plus rates for a five-room house.  It is alleged now that that restriction was too severe and militated against speculation on the part of builders, so that houses were not built in the way it was hoped they would be built.  But if we remove that restriction, what are we to expect?  We must expect that the weekly rental of these houses will be higher than 12/3, plus rates, or if they are sold that the price will be higher than £400, plus the subsidy.  In that case, who can expect that the average wage-earner in the city or town is going to be assisted at all in getting houses under this Bill?</P>
    <P>Perhaps we might hear from the Minister whether the restriction as to the selling price, which was contained in last year's Act, has been enforced as a matter of fact, or if it is intended that it should be enforced in respect of houses built under last year's Act, because it has come to my hearing that quite a number of houses which have been built, or are in course of building, under last year's Act, and a subsidy for which has been paid, or partially paid, have been transferred at prices higher than the price indicated in the Bill.  I cannot substantiate that.  It is more or less a well-authenticated rumour, but I would like to have it made clear by the President whether <Col N="1143" /> the restrictions under which grants were paid under last year's Act are to be enforced, or whether they are to be repealed and the owners of such houses, whether under last year's Act or under this Bill, to be free to get any prices they can in the market for new houses, or to let them at any price they can get from weekly tenants.</P>
    <P>I am not going to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill, because it is going to assist the building of houses.  It will mean the building of a good many houses, to be occupied by the better-off classes and, consequently, there will be a certain easement in the towns and cities, but it will be so very slight that the workers will not get any appreciable relief.  As a matter of fact, I would hazard to guess that the amount of building will hardly meet the increased natural demand for new houses, owing to the excess of the marriage rate over the death rate and the decay of certain classes of houses.  I do not believe that this method of treating the housing problem is going to do what is required to any degree at all.  I do not think you are going to relieve the problem of Dublin City.  The amount is £300,000 per year&mdash;that is to say, £300,000 under last year's Act and £300,000 under this Bill.  Suppose that £300,000 per year goes on for ten years, is it going to be as effective, is it going to produce the same kind of organised building of houses, as a £3,000,000 loan, with a ten year programme, would produce?  I believe that if you were to proceed by way of a housing loan for a period of ten years, you would probably get much better results, because you would induce working to a programme, and people could look ahead and organise for future years.</P>
    <P>A question was raised by Deputy Byrne respecting the Public Utility Society and the preference given to that Society over the individual.  There may be a very good reason for that. But I would like to make a suggestion, which the Minister might consider before the Committee Stage&mdash;that the definition of &ldquo;Public Utility Society&rdquo; should be enlarged so as to include friendly societies and trade unions, some of which have schemes by which houses can be built for their members. <Col N="1144" /> That is a Committee point, but, perhaps the Minister would consider the suggestion between now and the Committee Stage.  A more serious point in the definitions arises from the difference between the definition in this Bill of what a house is and the definition in last year's Act.  Under last year's measure, the word &ldquo;house&rdquo; meant a &ldquo;dwelling-house.&rdquo;  This year the word &ldquo;house&rdquo; means a building suitable for occupation as a dwelling-house.&rdquo; and includes a self-contained flat.  Under that description&mdash;&ldquo;a building suitable for occupation as a dwelling-house&rdquo;&mdash;I am afraid we may have the reconstruction of stables, lofts and very poor premises indeed to serve as &ldquo;houses,&rdquo; according to what the Minister or his advisers consider suitable.  Perhaps that point is a point for Committee too, but I would not like it to be thought that we are proceeding in this Bill to pay subsidies to people who turn their rather dilapidated stables into dwellinghouses&mdash;though many of the stables, such as they are, are better than some dwelling-houses.</P>
    <P>There is an omission in the schedule to this Bill which would require some explanation.  Last year there were two separate parts in the schedule and two separate lists of amounts to be paid in respect of houses, some of which applied to houses where sewers and water mains were not available and the others to houses where sewers and water mains were available.  In the present Bill there is no such distinction made and I take it that the subsidy will be paid whether sewers and water mains are available or not.</P>
    <P>There was some question in the debate last year as to the period during which houses were to be built under that scheme.  The first proposition was twelve months.  I think that was extended to eighteen months, with the possibility of a further four months. Now it is extended to twenty-two months, with the possibility of a further four months.  We have learned, by the answer of the Minister to a question to-day that the actual number of houses completed up to date, both urban and rural, under last year's Act, is 167.  It is now eleven months since the Act was <Col N="1145" /> passed, and while a good deal can be done in the fine weather which we hope will come, and while we had a great deal of bad weather which militated against building during the past few months, it is quite clear that the longer period that was asked for last year was required.</P>
    <P>I feel, in regard to the Bill, that it is likely to be good in its effect upon the building trade.  It may mean a very considerable demand for building trade labour, skilled and unskilled.  It may, perhaps, mean a demand for new kinds of skilled labour, and, in that way, it might be a very good thing for the building trade.  It will certainly be a very good thing for the building trade employers and speculators, and I have no doubt it will get a great deal of support from them, and from other persons who are in a position to enter the market for building houses either for themselves or for speculation.  Undoubtedly, it will mean the building of another 3,000 houses&mdash;perhaps 6,000 houses in the long run.  But I wonder will the President tell us seriously that he believes that any considerable proportion of those houses are likely to be occupied by any man earning less than £4 per week.</P>
    <P>I anticipate that we shall have a demand from the outer areas of Dublin, Cork and Limerick, from shopkeepers, schoolmasters and that class generally, but I think we are going to provide but a very small number of houses, if any, under this Bill for the rehousing of the working classes, in the commonly accepted use of that term.  I think until we begin to apply our minds seriously to the problem of rehousing the overcrowded dwellers in the towns, not merely in Dublin, but in other towns, we cannot be said to be tackling the housing problem with anything like seriousness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies who have spoken on this Bill, I am glad to note that the President has dropped several of the objectionable clauses in last year's Bill to which many took exception.  I am glad to note also that the Schedule has been considerably improved from one point of view, but, like Deputy Johnson, I am afraid that improvement will have the tendency of <Col N="1146" /> providing a house that can only be occupied by what he calls a &ldquo;middle-class person,&rdquo; but what I would rather be inclined to call by another name, a &ldquo;labour aristocrat.&rdquo;  Anybody who refers to the Schedule will see that we are encouraging a larger and a betterclass house.  The Schedule provides for a payment, in respect of such houses, to local authorities and public utility societies, a sum of £100, while for the smaller houses for which the need is much greater, a subsidy of only £60 is provided.</P>
      <P>I was not able to follow the figures which the President was good enough to read out, showing the working of last year's Act, to see whether that tendency that one sees in this Bill was borne out by the working of last year's Act; that is, that the larger number of houses finished and in the course of erection under the Act are five-roomed houses, rather than four or three-roomed houses.  From an ordinary knowledge of the results of last year's Act, I am rather inclined to think that the tendency was in favour of the five-roomed house, and I am afraid that the result of this Bill will be very much the same.  That, I think, is one of the aspects of this question that ought to have the consideration of the Executive Council.  One of the matters to which we take exception in commerce and which is one of our difficulties in connection with reviving trade, is the high cost of living in this country, and one of the most important items in connection with the cost of living is the rent of the house to be occupied by the worker.  Therefore it is essential, if we are to get the cost of living reduced and thereby revive trade, that we must make a start in trying to help the worker to reduce his weekly burden, and the burden that possibly he finds the most difficult to meet is the burden of house rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge, therefore, and urge strongly, as I did when the previous Bill was under consideration, that we should try to encourage the building of a larger number of smaller houses rather than a smaller number of larger houses as this Bill, like its predecessor, seems to encourage.  Of course, I will be immediately met by the argument that a three-roomed house has many <Col N="1147" /> objections, particularly from the point of view of the man with a large family. But we must remember that in these houses there are a great many tenants with small families; also there are many poor widows with one or two in family, as well as aged persons.  I have not seen any census of the occupants of these houses, but I very much doubt if such a census were provided, that we would find that there was any great preponderance of people with large families.  So that we are really providing for a class that does not exist to the extent, possibly, that many members of this House appear to think.  In any case, I think it would be the proper policy, in view of the urgent demand for houses and in view of the&mdash; I was going to say greater&mdash;necessity of lowering the cost of living, that we should give consideration to the problem as to whether it would not be more desirable in the end, notwithstanding these difficulties, to give the greater encouragement to the small houses at a small rent.  As I said, that house is placed at a disadvantage under the previous Act and the disadvantage is repeated under this Bill.  A local authority which erects a three-roomed house gets £60 under this Bill.  A local erecting a five-roomed house a local authority gets £100.  One would be almost inclined to say, from one's experience of the problem, that it would be wise for the Government to reverse these figures and to give the larger encouragement to the smaller houses rather than to the larger houses.  There may be some difficulty on the part of the Executive Council in going as far as that, but I would like them to go as far as giving the smaller house an equal encouragement, at all events, with the larger house and in that way help, and help materially, towards meeting the difficulty of many of these small wage earners referred to by Deputy Johnson, men and women earning from 30/- per week, in trying to provide decent accommodation for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>Under any of these schemes the three-roomed house calls for a rent that is exceedingly difficult for the ordinary worker to meet at the present time. <Col N="1148" /> That being the case&mdash;and I think Deputy Johnson and those who sit with him will agree that it is&mdash;I think we ought to try and look at the problem from their point of view and try to meet it from their point of view.  In that connection possibly Deputy Johnson and those who sit with him might be very helpful in this matter of providing what he might call cheaper rents for those who are anxious to occupy modern houses.  As I said last week, and on previous occasions in this House, building, whether it is the building of the factory, the building of a bungalow, or the building of a small cottage for the worker&mdash;building of any kind&mdash;is too expensive, and I am quite satisfied that we cannot solve the problem that has been referred to by Deputy Johnson, a problem in connection with which many of us have been up against the local authorities for some considerable time&mdash;I think there is common agreement amongst all who have looked into the problem on this&mdash;until the cost of building can be reduced.  Deputy Johnson has referred to that fact in connection with this Bill.  This Bill cannot alter the circumstances as we find them, but Deputy Johnson and those who sit with him can consider those circumstances.  I think they will agree, if they come to consider them, that they are not without responsibility in this matter and that it is only by that consideration, by that particular section, that we would be able to keep down the cost of building and thereby be able to provide houses for the many who are anxious to get them to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is intended to facilitate the building of houses, but I cannot understand why a distinction must be made between local authorities and persons who wish to erect houses themselves.  Under the Act of last year, for urban districts you are giving £50 for a three-roomed house, £70 for a four-roomed house, and £90 for a five-roomed house.  Under this Bill you specify for a three-roomed house £45, a four-roomed house £60, and a five-roomed house £75, while you are giving the local authorities, £60, £80 and £100. I think that is really unfair.  If we want to get down to the root of the evil of congestion in the different towns and <Col N="1149" /> districts we must give the same facilities to the individual as are given to the local authorities.  What is the matter with the 1924 Act, that such a very small number of people have taken advantage of it?  It is simply because there was not a sufficient subsidy to allow people to carry on building, and because they excluded reconstruction in the rural districts, which I think is really unfair, when it is allowed in the urban districts.</P>
      <P>At the present time there are hundreds of people in this country living in despicable hovels.  Some of them are thatched.  They are roofed with thatch, and that is an unhealthy thing.  You exclude them from improving their holdings simply because they do not live in a place with 500 of a population, or they do not live 880 yards from a place with 500 or more of a population.  I would ask the President to include people of the type I refer to.  The same should be done for all the citizens of the Saorstát and no distinction should be made between them.  If this country is, as we maintain it to be, an absolutely free country, I think each citizen should have the same facility offered him.  In the constituency that I represent, there are no fewer than 50 or 60 people who would like to build but they cannot do so because of the subsidy allowed by the Government.  They must have the building erected and they must bear all the costs of the erection before they are entitled to even half the grant.  When they have the roof on, as certified by the engineer or the inspector, they get the remainder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government are really serious in relieving housing congestion, they will give a decent subsidy.  A subsidy of £75 is not sufficient to encourage a person to build in the rural districts. Under Section 6 it is specified that local authorities have power to give a grant equivalent to the amount given directly by the Government to persons desirous of building.  They have additional power to give loans to the extent of double the amount of the grant.  I would ask those members of the Dáil who are members of a local authority, has any local authority in the Saorstát taken advantage of the Act and given a loan to persons anxious to build? <Col N="1150" /> Have they given any grant equivalent to the amount advanced by the Government? I know the Westmeath Co. Council has given a free site; but that is all they have given.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is a district or urban council in the Saorstát that has availed of the last Act.  If the Government is genuine in its desire to be out for the welfare of the people, instead of saying that the local authorities may give a grant, they should say that the local authorities shall give a grant, and so enable the people to build.  Take any town of 200 or 2,000 of a population and you will find the entrance to it in a lamentable condition. Streets are in a bad way and houses are falling.  The whole place forms an eyesore to the people.  It is necessary that there should be well-built towns.  In Athlone, Mullingar or Longford, you will find places where nine and ten people live in one room. There is a decided state of congestion. People cannot take advantage of this Housing Bill, because the subsidy given by the Government is not sufficient.  I welcome the Bill.  The Minister for Finance said some time ago: &ldquo;Blessed is he who expects little, for he shall get less.&rdquo;  I welcome those grants.  The people of the Saorstát expect much from the Government, but, then, the more you expect, possibly the less you will get.</P>
    <P>I would like the President to make an equitable allocation of the amounts that local authorities may obtain and the amounts that will be advanced to individuals.  It is only right that where a person desires to erect a house the grant should be just as much as would be given in the case of a local authority.  If the subsidies are made equal in that respect, you will have plenty of people anxious to build in order to have a comfortable residence for themselves and their families.  I think the President should endeavour to facilitate people who are anxious to build houses.  In the rural districts the people have not been properly facilitated up to the present.  Small farmers and labourers should not be excluded from the benefits of the Bill. They should be given as much consideration as people living in towns of 500 of a population and upwards.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lyons made a case which ought to get a good deal of consideration.  There can be no reason given why a citizen who desires to improve his house in a rural area should not be assisted by the Government. The Government, apparently, is anxious to facilitate everyone else. Personally, I hold that we should not assist anyone; we should all work on our own.  But when good things come, and when good things are flying about, there is no reason why advantage should not be taken of them.  I hold there is no reason why facilities should not be offered in regard to the reconstruction of a house in rural areas. There is a good deal to be said for the case put forward by Deputies A. Byrne and Lyons in connection with the giving of a grant to individuals and the placing of that grant on the same basis as the giving of a grant to a local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the country you will not find many public utility societies.  On the other hand, from my own experience, I am aware there are many individuals anxious to build houses.  They are not connected with any public utility societies, and their main anxiety is to build their own dwellings.  If it is intimated to them that they will get a grant of £100, houses will go up very quickly.  I do not think the Bill will effect the purpose Deputy Johnson sets out.  It will not bring about the erection of houses to be let to working men in the cities.  That is a problem that <Col N="1152" /> will have to be settled by Deputy Johnson and Deputy Good, working together.</P>

      <P>Naturally, I am going to vote for the Second Reading of this Bill.  At the same time I do not want to give a silent vote.  I do not want anybody to think that I believe this Bill will have the effect of solving the housing problem in urban or rural areas so far as the working classes are concerned.  I take it the President is of the opinion that the Bill will to some extent achieve that problem.  The criticism I will level at the Bill is on all fours with the criticism I levelled when the last Housing Bill was introduced. The criticism deals largely with the want of discrimination.  What I mean by that is, that while you may be able to build a house in Dublin for £400 or £500, and rent it at an amount which will be in accordance with the standard rate of wages in Dublin, that same house in a country town could not be economically let at a rent in accordance with the rate of wages prevailing in that particular district.  I think the President ought, even now, to consider it from that point of view and give larger grants for the smaller areas where wages are not as high.  I also asked the President on the last occasion if the Government would approach the banks with a view to securing longer loans for local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is absolutely impossible for local authorities to undertake a housing scheme in view of the banks refusing to lend money for longer than fifteen years.  Securing money for fifteen <Col N="1153" /> years will not enable local authorities to let houses at a weekly rent lower than 10/-.  In most country towns you will find rents ranging from 3/- to 5/- a week.  If a workman is asked to pay 10/- to 12/- a week it will be beyond his power to do so, and the Bill will not fulfil the object the President has in mind; that is, to cater for the working classes in various areas.  The banks ought to realise that there is at least some stability in view of last week's happenings.  The country is getting a bit sane and last week the electors returned people whom they know will work in the interests of the country. In view of the position created by last week's elections, the banks ought to adopt a reasonable attitude and the Government ought to ask them to give better conditions to local authorities and grant longer loans.</P>

      <P>Take the case of any labourer or artisan who gets £300 in wages.  That is the sum given to him or to his class in connection with the building of the house.  Is it unreasonable to ask £300 from him in return for the house?  That is the case put up by Deputy Good, or by the employers. It is a reasonable case.  If you spend that much in wages, it is reasonable that that amount should be asked in return for the house.  I do not think it is generally accepted that they are in a position to do that.  Then there must be something obviously wrong.  My view is&mdash;it may be a heresy to pronounce it&mdash;that you are not going to solve the housing problem on a 44-hour week.  I think it is impossible to do so. I am saying that now without any meditative onslaught on the conditions that are prevailing.  If you had all the money required you would not settle the housing problem on a 44-hour week. Something more is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very evil circle.  Taking it as a business. proposition, I fail to see how it is going to be done.  Where an effort is required from all sections, I would like to know what is going to be done by the various sections in contributing towards the solution of this problem. The Government is putting up £100 per house and the local authorities are putting up £100.  The total cost of the house towards which this £200 is contributed will be £500.  Someone has to pay £300.  It is claimed that the banks are charging too high an interest, and will not give loans for a sufficiently long period.  They have the management of the money which is in their charge.  They claim to be simply trustees, and say that they might be called upon at any moment to pay it out; that they are not in a position to lend for long periods.  There may be a good case for that.  The question is, where are all the people concerned going to come together, and say, &ldquo;We will all have to contribute something towards <Col N="1155" /> the solving of this problem&rdquo;?  There does not appear to be any great likelihood of such a meeting in the near future, but it must come to that.  If the amount to be granted under this Bill is exhausted in nine months, and if we bring in another Bill providing another £300,000, that is not going to solve the problem.  We must get assistance from all the people concerned. The Government and the local authorities are contributing more than generously towards the solution of the housing problem&mdash;more than is contributed in any other country.</P>
      <P>Deputies have asked me why it is I would not increase the £75 to £100. The £75 grant actually means £150 towards the cost of the house, because £75 is contributed by the Government and £75 by the local authority.  That is £150 for a five-roomed house.  I wonder if Deputies have concerned themselves with the grant made in Northern Ireland?  I am informed that the subsidy there is £60, and the floor area between 500 and 900 square feet, as against 1,250 here.  The facilities provided under this Bill compare very favourably with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no guarantee that the local authorities will contribute £75.  It is only provided that they may do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right in that.  Housing, for something like 50 or 60 years, has been mainly the concern of local authorities, in urban areas under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, and in rural areas under the Labourers Acts.  The Government did not give contributions such as are proposed in this Bill during that time.  I hold that any claim for an increase of the £75 proposed is unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A larger amount is given to local authorities and public utility societies for many reasons.  Local authorities, I understand, go in for housing the largest families.  In a sense, that is an uneconomic policy.  Looking at it from the purely financial aspect, it means that the poorest families are given the houses, as they are generally the largest.  That is a splendid policy, because it means that they house the <Col N="1156" /> largest number.  Because of that the local authorities require extra assistance. We are giving them £25 more, and they can put up the other £25 themselves.  By reason of that policy the numbers to be housed are based on a higher cost than if the local authorities looked for persons who could afford to pay a higher rent.</P>
    <P>It is said that we are housing the aristocracy and the middle classes. The annual valuation of a house erected under this Bill in the case of a city like Dublin will be something like £15 or £16.  Do the middle classes occupy houses of that valuation?  I do not think so.  My idea of those constituting the middle classes is, those occupying houses valued from £25 to £70.  That may be erroneous, but that is what I have understood the middle classes to be.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not think one will generally find mahogany, walnut or marble mantelpieces, or such vulgar displays of wealth in a house of three, four or five rooms.  It may be that shooting lodges will be built under the Bill.  As to that, all I can say is that any relief of the congestion caused by shortage of houses will be an advantage.  My idea is that these houses will be occupied by artisans and tradesmen.  The Government is not rich enough, the local authorities are not rich enough, to attempt to deal with the great big housing problem. It has not been dealt with in any other country that I know of, except where industrial and manufacturing activity is on a very high scale, where good wages are earned and where rich corporations, trusts, or other institutions of that kind, enter into the matter themselves and help towards solving the problem.  We are asked: &ldquo;What are you going to do in the case of cities like Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Waterford or Wexford?&rdquo;  I say that the country is not rich enough to solve the problem at present costs, and I think anybody who makes a study of it will admit the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the number of houses built in <Col N="1157" /> urban areas during the last twelve months under the Housing Act is not considerable, there were, as Deputies know, quite a number of houses built in Dublin under another grant, and a good deal of reconstruction took place also in the city.  I am disposed to think that an annual Bill like this would be much better than raising the loan of three millions mentioned by Deputy Johnson.  If we float a loan of three million pounds, what happens?  It would have to be distributed over the various areas; the local authorities have got to come in, each one claiming a proportion of it.  A three million loan would be only equal to two years' Bills such as this one, that is this year's Bill and next year's Bill.  I expect it is the local authority the Deputy has in mind.  In the case of local authorities it is more than possible that it would damp to a very considerable extent the private or speculative builder. The speculative builder is a person who has been out of action for the last eight or ten years.  It must be made attractive for him to go in again for this class of house construction.  There has been a considerable amount of criticism of the speculative builder, but his was a useful contribution towards housing. It was not the general rule at the time the speculative builder was in business that exorbitant rents were demanded for every sort of housing accommodation. The practice to-day is that exorbitant rents are being demanded and are being paid.  Small houses, from £25 to £27 valuation, are being let out to tenants at, in some cases, very considerable rents.  Considerable amounts of money are being realised by the letting of individual rooms in this class of house.  The speculative builder will stop that, and, as it is stopped, the congestion will be relieved.</P>
    <P>I do not quite agree with Deputy Good in the case that he made for the three-roomed house.  My view is that you get nearer to the economic mean in the four-roomed house.  The case that is put to us is that there should be at least five rooms in a house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>And the result is that sub-letting is rampant.</P>

    <Col N="1158" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome sub-letting in a five-roomed house rather than see cellar dwellings. Within the last few years cellar dwellings had become rather the rule than the exception.  The sub-letting of a five-roomed house is rather better than the sub-letting of a four-roomed or a three-roomed house.  I think the economic mean is nearer the four-roomed house.  The increase that has been made in the floor space in this Bill is one that has been recommended by a number of persons whom we consulted on the matter.  It now stands at the fairly considerable figure of 1,250 as against 1,000 last year.  Even if it does mean increased business and increased profits for the speculative builders, that in its turn must produce a greater number of people engaged in that particular work, and will eventually result in a greater number of houses, and, with a greater number of houses, you will have probably a reduction in cost.</P>
      <P>The Bill does remove the restrictions on sale and on the letting of houses provided.  Under the last Act, out of 2,600 houses provided, not more than 10 were built for letting.  Although the Section dealing with the holding of inquiries into the cost of materials is repealed, the Minister has power, under the present Bill, to purchase materials and sell again.  But it is hoped that the necessity for that will not arise.  I do not think that there is any other point raised on the discussion on this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy should be aware that at the elections which took place within the last couple of months occasionally the Government was attacked for its extravagance and for the cost of its services, and for various other sins by the party on whose benches the Deputy is at present sitting in ornamental isolation. That Party made a case against us that we were extravagant.  Now, I could put in that clause to give the same facilities to rural as to urban or municipal areas.  But, as I explained, the cost would be prohibitive.  In the case <Col N="1159" /> of persons living in rural areas, who would be disposed to reconstruct their houses, it would entail that 20 to 25 per cent. of the amount of the money they would get would go in administration expenses.  That is too heavy a burden and, apparently, the people in some of those areas have agreed with us that it was not wise to incur extravagant expense on these matters.  In the rural areas, as the Deputy will observe from the figures I have read out, something like £150,000 have been spent under the Building Facilities Act.  That is a pretty considerable sum.  The advantage, as far as the building of new houses is concerned, is with the rural areas.  Anybody who knows the towns and cities knows that the reconstruction problem is one for them, and for them only.  In rural areas such a thing as an insanitary area is not known.  Insanitary houses, yes. But the insanitary area is an area of such importance that many legislative enactments have been introduced to deal with it.  An insanitary house does not occupy to any extent the same position as an insanitary area.  It was with a view to dealing with insanitary areas that we introduced a clause dealing with the reconstruction of houses. Insanitary areas in the country are unknown.</P>

      <P>Will the President say whether there is any serious objection on the part of the Housing Department to approaching the banks with a view to seeing that they get loans for a longer period than at present?  Take the case of a local authority that is seeking a loan for building a house, say at a cost of £400.  They have to borrow £300.  If the money is borrowed for a period of 15 years, the house will cost the tenant something about 16/- per week.  Now if that money could be borrowed for 30 years it would only cost 12/- a week, which would be a comparatively reasonable rent.  The President mentions that the banks are afraid that they may be <Col N="1160" /> called upon by certain people whose moneys they have on deposit to hand them over that money.  But has not that always prevailed, that it was quite open to people to call for their money? Was not that the position when the banks were giving loans for 60 years? I think if the Government tackle this matter seriously, if they approach the banks, and point out to them that the country is getting sane again, and that we have some sort of stability, and that there is the likelihood that we are going to have more stability, then the banks might be induced to give more consideration to the question of giving loans for longer periods.</P>

I want to know from the President whether it is the Government who are so far responsible for paying the cost of the administration of the Act, or whether it is the people who have benefited by it.  So far as I know, the people who make applications for grants have paid the cost of administration, inasmuch as they paid the fee to the inspector who represents the Local Government Department and who makes the inspection.  If the man who gets the grant has to pay the fee for the Local Government Inspector, how can the President at the same time argue that the cost of administration prevents him or the Ministry from extending this section of the Bill dealing with reconstruction?  Cannot he make the Bill operate as regards reconstruction so that those who seek the grant will pay the engineer's fee, as they have to do at present?  Why does he make the point that the cost of administration prevents the extension of the section dealing with reconstruction to rural areas?</P>

That money is responsible for a largely increased valuation in the various local authorities' valuation lists all over the country.  I do not think that out of the whole of that sum the Minister for Finance will get £1 per house, or anything approaching it, for income tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not of the £1,000,000.  Twenty-four local authorities had not sufficient courage to take advantage of the situation, but the other 74 authorities made up for their lack of courage.  As regards Deputy Corish's point, a fifteen-years' loan is all that the banks will agree to give. <Col N="1162" /> Looking at it from a detached standpoint, it is a reasonable offer on the part of the banks; but looking at it from the standpoint of the local authority, I say that it is not so reasonable. What are the local authorities doing themselves?  Have they endeavoured in any case to float a loan and get their own people to take it up?  It is not the banks' business to give more than a fifteen-years' loan.  It is practically unknown for banks to go beyond a period of fifteen years except in cases of sums for a considerable amount. The sum involved in this is considerable, but is it proposed that the local authorities should borrow money in order to make a grant of £100 per house?  If that is so, I say &ldquo;No, I will not go to the banks for that.&rdquo;  The local authority will have to place on the backs of the people each year that sum.  That, at all events, is my view. The other matter, the difference between the grant and the price of the house, is a different question.  I think it is time that local authorities should consider the raising of a loan and realise the difficulties of the Government and not be always looking to the Government to solve every problem of local authorities and individuals.</P>

      <P>You did, but the local authorities are still concerned about the difference between the amount of this grant and the amount necessary to build a house.  I cannot see why the Housing Department of the Government should not approach the banks with a view to asking them to afford greater facilities to local authorities. That is not a bit too much to ask them. Last week we were so liberal we remitted a sum amounting to two-thirds of the rates, but now the Government will not approach the banks to secure better facilities for the housing of the people of the country.</P>

    <P>I do not think it is necessary that I should say very much with regard to this motion.  The matter was discussed fairly fully on the Second Reading.  I pointed out then that we are providing these pensions, for which authority is given in this resolution, not out of consideration for the individuals concerned, although they have given service as good as certain of the ex-British judges to whose pensions no great objection was raised.  We are not, however, thinking of them.  We are thinking of the necessity for honouring and recognising an obligation of the first Dáil.  We ought not, in my view, to do anything that would seem to refuse to recognise the continuity of the rights and obligations from the first Dáil down to this Dáil, merely because certain individuals might not commend themselves to us.  Having said that, I think that the Dáil will recognise the principle that as successors we cannot in a summary way say that, no matter what the first Dáil agreed to, we are not going to pay any pensions to them. It is not necessary to argue this particular matter much further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister justifies this motion solely on the grounds of continuity, and the necessity for recognising obligations entered into by <Col N="1165" /> the first Dáil.  I have not the document here, but I think I showed the Minister on the last occasion that the obligation was not to pay pensions.  If there was a single obligation there were many obligations.  In the same document there were other obligations besides the one the Minister referred to.  The obligation that was entered into regarding judges of the Supreme Court was an obligation to employ them for life. No mention was made in that decree of salary, no mention was made of pensions, and the obligation, if there was one, was to appoint these judges and to maintain them in their positions for life.  The Minister answered that the court which was set up by the Dáil, and to which these judges were appointed, no longer exists and that, therefore, we are bound to pay the judges a pension. I cannot see how the &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; comes in.  There is at least as strong an obligation to offer these judges alternative employment.  There certainly is no more obligation to pay them pensions than to send them around the world.  I think that the case made for this motion, that there is an obligation upon the Saorstát Government to pay pensions to judges who were appointed for life by the first Dáil does not follow at all from the document which has been produced, but there may be an obligation to keep them in employment in one post or another. Offer them employment in the usual conditions, and if they refuse that employment then there is no further obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the abandonment of the courts to which these men were appointed, there may be an obligation to offer them alternative employment. Regarding the analogy of the judges under the British, they knew the Acts of Parliament under which they were being appointed; they knew that they were being appointed for life, and could only be removed by an Act of the Parliament that appointed them and for cause shown.  They knew their salaries, and that they were entitled to pensions.  Will the Minister tell us where the obligation to pay pensions comes in, except in the document known as a decree, which was quoted from on the last occasion? <Col N="1166" /> That decree said that these people were to be appointed judges, and were not to be removable except by a two-thirds vote of the Dáil.  Has there been such a vote?  Has that obligation been fulfilled.  And where is the obligation to pay £500 a year to two judges who may have served a few months, a year, or two years&mdash;I do not know how long? I cannot see any mention of any salary, or any requirement upon the Dáil to pay pensions, but I can see an obligation to keep these men in employment for life.  I would like to know whether alternative employment has been offered them, and whether they have refused it, and if so, where does the obligation lie that we should pay them a pension?</P>

      <P>I would like to associate myself with Deputy Johnson's remarks. These two judges were appointed in 1920, and they may have sat in court two or three times, and now we are asked to give them a superannuation allowance of £500 each.  If you pass legislation giving these men superannuation, I do not see why you should not do the same with regard to Parish Court Justices who acted since 1917.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Johnson, that it is not right to give these men the pensions proposed, and that alternative employment should be offered to them.  Several judges have been appointed recently.  Why did not the Minister appoint these two and save hundreds a year to the State? The hundreds of ex-Parish Court Justices throughout the country have given as patriotic service as those to whom you are proposing to give £500 a year for the rest of their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson asked if these men had been offered alternative employment.  They have not been offered alternative employment. The only alternative employment that <Col N="1167" /> could reasonably be offered to them would be judicial office.  We do not think that they are suitable for judicial office.  Certainly, they are not fit for judicial office at all corresponding to the type of office they held: that is, either in the High Court or the Supreme Court.  We think that it would be damaging to the public interest to appoint them to judicial office of that type: that is, either to the High Court or to the Supreme Court, and they have not been given an opportunity of refusing it.  I know that argument could be met by saying that they were entitled to be retained for life at a salary of £750 per annum. One of them would certainly make that argument, but we have really to give fair recognition to the change of circumstances that has taken place.  The courts have been abolished, and there is no work for them to do.  We do not think that the Dáil or the public should be asked to provide £750 a year, the full salary, for no service.  On the other hand, if we took no action, but allowed the matter to drift, there is the possibility that we might find ourselves in the position where there would be no alternative to paying them the £750 a year for life.  There was no obligation in the Decree on the part of the old Dáil to pay these men salary at any specific rate, but the salary was fixed when they were appointed under that Decree.  The members of the Dáil knew the salary at which they were appointed.  In the time of the First and the Second Dáil, the position of the Executive was not like the position of the Executive at the present time. There was no legislation, but the Executive acted as having general delegated powers.  Matters were reported to the Dáil, and were accepted by the Dáil afterwards.  The same sort of procedure that exists now did not exist then, but, nevertheless, the Dáil was quite aware of the whole circumstances in regard to the appointment of these men and accepted that.  I say quite frankly that, as far as the men themselves are concerned, they deserve nothing.</P>

      <P>As I say, I have no high opinion of the men themselves.  I think they met no losses that entitled them to anything.  I make absolutely no plea for the individuals.  If it were only a matter of the individuals, I certainly would be found in the Níl lobby against it.  What I am concerned with is this, that we do not tear up without ceremony what was done by the First Dáil.  I believe that if we were to proceed on the basis of tearing up things that were done by the First Dáil there might arise circumstances when awkward arguments might be created out of that fact and be used against us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see what cause we could well set down.  If we were to try to preserve a proper attitude and not to avail of technicalities, I do not see what proper excuse we could set down.  We could not now at a date, long after they have ceased to function, pass a resolution having anything to do with the question of their fitness for office or ability in discharging their duties.  I do not know, on the other hand, that there is any definite action they have taken that could properly be made the subject of a resolution.  I think that we have other judges now who can be removed by resolution of the two Houses.  It is most important, however awkward it may be from time to time for the Government of the day, that those who exercise judicial functions should now feel themselves independent and should feel that, short of a grave offence, there is no danger at all of their being removed: that they should be able to defeat the Minister for Finance in an income tax action or in a revenue action of any sort, and that they should be able to defeat any particular Minister who comes before them.  I think if you now bring in a resolution simply for the sake of saving so small a sum of money, comparatively, to remove a judge by a two-thirds majority, you will not do what is good for the system that exists at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument for continuity that the Minister has adduced rests upon the Decree of the Dáil appointing these men for life. The same Decree says that they could not be removed except for reasons stated by a two-thirds majority.  If continuity applies, it applies in respect of their removal as it does in respect to their pensions or appointment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not really a question of removal.  There are no courts.  They are left high and dry. <Col N="1170" /> We have taken the action which left them high and dry.  I do not think that that question can fairly arise at the present time.  The situation has been changed by the actual removal of the courts.  I stated previously that there are only two people who are really eligible for the pension.  There is one of them that I know will apply for it.  The other may or may not apply.  Many people say he will not. I do not know, but certainly he will have to renage some of his principles if he does apply.  In any case, the expenditure cannot be more than £1,000, but I think it is more likely to be £500.</P>

There is no obligation on the Government, generally, or on the Minister introducing a Bill, to circulate to Deputies copies of any statute or statutes which may be referred to in the course of any such Bill.  I submit, further, that there is no difference between the availability of this particular document to which Deputy Johnson refers and the availability of other public documents, whether statutes or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I think it would be an improper course to refuse to consider further this Bill and put upon the Government, or upon the Minister standing over this Bill, the onus of circulating to Deputies copies of this particular document.  As the Minister for Finance has pointed out, it was a public document.  It was on sale throughout the country.  It is something well within public knowledge&mdash;at least as much within public knowledge as other Acts which have been referred to and adverted to here from time to time.  In the circumstances, I consider that the course to take is to continue our consideration of this Bill.</P>

      <P>May I follow up the point which I made a few minutes ago? I am not asking that the Minister should circulate copies of this document to Deputies.  I am asking that the document referred to should be accessible. It may be correct to say that this document was sold in public. There may have been an establishment here and there that was prepared to run the risk of imprisonment and internment for its owners, at the hands of the British authorities, for publishing or selling the document, but it has not been available, so far as I can find, to this Dáil or to the Members of the Dáil in the archives of the Dáil.  There have been requests during the past few <Col N="1173" /> years to have made available documents, decrees and papers issued by the first and by the second Dáil.  Those documents have not yet been made available.  Here we are asked to legislate in respect to a decree which is not scheduled, which is not accessible, and the merits of which we are not in a position to discuss.  I was allowed to quote from the document referred to but I am only one Deputy.  I quoted from that document to show that there were other obligations as well as this obligation.  I want to quote from that document now, but the document is not available.  I submit that, as a matter of ordinary business procedure, we cannot discuss a Bill based upon a document which is not accessible.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the request Deputy Johnson is putting forward is perfectly reasonable and ought to be met reasonably.  I am in thorough agreement with him.  It is difficult for Deputies to consider the amendment of a Bill when a certain document, having a bearing on the Bill, is not available.  We can only take the word of the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Finance as to what that document or Decree may or may not contain.  In fairness to the House, I think Deputy Johnson's request should be met by the Minister and that he should give us an opportunity of learning what this document contains, or make it available in the Library.</P>

      <P>I will certainly undertake to have the document placed in the Library.  I do not think that there is any Deputy here who endeavoured to see that document and was not able to see it.  The position in regard to this document is nowise different from the position regarding any British statute that may be quoted.  As a rule Deputies do not feel called upon to look up British statutes which may be cited or referred to.  I suggest that Deputies did not feel called upon to look up this particular document.  There is no reason why we should not go on with the Committee Stage of the Bill.  The Dáil could just as well have refused to go on with the Second Reading.  There is really noththing in the point that has been raised. <Col N="1174" /> I agree that documents of this nature ought to be available in the Library in the same way as statutes, for the convenience of Deputies who may care to consult them, but I do not think it can be urged that we should take upon ourselves the obligation of circulating this document.  If any Deputy thinks there is anything wrong or if he is not satisfied that the section is above board, he can deal with it in that spirit.</P>

      <P>This is rather a novel proposal that has been brought forward by Deputy Johnson. I do not think that any such motion came before us at any previous time.  I must rule against the Deputy. This Bill has been a considerable time before Deputies and, if this Decree was required, Deputies had ample time to give notice that they required it.  I cannot, therefore, accept the motion. The question is&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;The expression &lsquo;Dáil Supreme Court&rsquo; means the Supreme Court which was constituted under a Decree made in the year 1920 by the Minister for Home Affairs, purporting to act under the authority of the first Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;  That decree, if my memory serves me, dealt with the establishment of a Supreme Court and other minor courts.  It gave certain authority to judges; it appointed judges under certain conditions; it dealt with their removal under certain conditions and with substitutes, temporary or otherwise; it dealt with the position of judges of the Land Courts and gave the courts very considerable authority.  The decree purported to be under the authority of the first Dáil. That authority is contained in a Resolution moved by the Minister for Home Affairs to the effect that the establishment of Courts of Justice and Equity be decreed and that the Minister be empowered under rule 50 to establish courts having criminal jurisdiction. That was, after discussion, carried.  I think if we could have some information as to the number of times this Supreme Court sat, the period of the appointments of the judges under this Supreme Court and the period from <Col N="1175" /> their appointment to the last sitting, we would be in a better position to realise the import of this Bill.</P>
      <P>While this is merely a definition clause, a great deal depends on it.  I think we ought to be told what was the function of those judges and how they discharged it; how often they served, how many months they worked, and in what areas, and whether there were any considerable risks run by them, beyond the risks run by other people, that would justify our passing the remaining sections of this Bill upon the definition.  It seems to me that we are entitled to more information of a detailed character respecting this Supreme Court and the judges who constituted it.  The question of continuity and the like may come up a little later. Perhaps by that time we may have an opportunity to read the decree again. In the meantime, may we have some information as to the Supreme Court, its constitution, the number of occasions on which it sat, and the kind of risks which were run by the judges who constituted the court.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the Deputy has asked many questions which have no real bearing on the Bill. The Deputy ought to appreciate that it is not a question of how many months those judges sat, how many sittings in all, how many risks, as he puts it, they took, the extent of those risks, and so on.  The Deputy, I feel, does realise that there is simply one question: whether or not those persons were judges appointed under contract by a person purporting to act with the authority of the Dáil Cabinet and, thereby, with the delegated authority of the Dáil.  If that is so, and if they were so appointed, then these other interesting questions are irrelevant.  The number of risks they took, how those risks compared with risks taken by other persons up and down the country&mdash; questions of that kind might be very interesting as subjects for discussion over the fireside on a winter's evening, but they do not bear, in any real sense, on the Bill under review.  If the Deputy puts up a claim here that he ran very much greater risks than all those <Col N="1176" /> judges and would be very much entitled, in consequence, to a pension, I would not dream of contradicting him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor would I contradict anyone in the country who made a similar claim.  But that is not the point.  The point is whether we, who claim to inherit both the assets and liabilities of previous Dála, are going to recognise the liability to those persons who were appointed by Mr. Austin Stack in 1920, purporting to act with the authority of the Dáil Cabinet at the time and, thereby, with the authority of the Dáil.  We have established a Winding Up Commission for those Dáil courts.  We have gone to considerable pains and expense to give permanent validity to their doings. There is at the moment before the Dáil a Bill transferring the powers and authority of that Commission to the High Court, so that at any time henceforward the decrees and decisions of those Dáil courts may be quoted and must be recognised before the established courts of the State.  I mention that to show that in other respects we have taken that court system seriously and have gone to considerable trouble and expense to show that.  Litigants can quote their decrees and decisions before the courts of the State and they must be recognised and accepted.</P>
      <P>Shifting the scene somewhat, in America we are conducting litigation for certain funds outstanding there that were the property of the previous Dáil.  I mention that to show that we are claiming the assets of those Parliaments as assets properly descending to us, their legitimate and constitutional successors.  If we are claiming the assets, are we bound to accept the liabilities?  That is the question; not how many risks these judges took, not whether they had any narrow escapes &mdash;such hair-raising escapes, for example, as Deputy Figgis had on a famous occasion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows the date of their appointment, knows that they continued to function from that up to and during the Truce, and that it was in the spring of 1922 that that system was finally disestablished, leaving those judges without a jurisdiction and without any judicial functions.  There remains simply the question of what the liability of the State is towards them, and I submit that this State, which has taken the trouble to give permanent validity to all their doings and to absorb and incorporate their decrees in the legal system of the country, and which is contesting strongly in America the proprietory right to certain funds outstanding there, must accept the contractual liability towards those persons who for a while performed judicial functions, and, accordingly, that the Dáil should pass this Bill.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister for Justice may, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, grant to any person who held office as a judge of the Dáil Supreme Court a pension for his life at such rate as the Minister for Justice shall, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, think proper but not exceeding two-thirds of the annual salary of which such person was in receipt as a judge of the Dáil Supreme Court immediately before he ceased to hold office as such judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Every pension granted under this section shall, subject to the provisions of this Act relating to the suspension of pensions and the avoidance of double pensions, be payable to the person to whom such <Col N="1178" /> pension is granted as from the date on which the annual salary of such person as a judge of the Dáil Supreme Court ceased to be paid to him.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every pension granted under this section shall be charged on and payable out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof.</P>
    <P>Question proposed&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement of the Minister is more appropriately answered on this section.  We are asked to give the Minister for Justice, subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance, power to grant to any person who held office as a judge of the Dáil Supreme Court a pension for life not exceeding two-thirds of his annual salary.  The argument is that it was a liability, a liability of the First Dáil, and consequently a liability of this Dáil.  We are not permitted, sir, by your ruling, to find out what other liabilities run concurrent with this liability.  Perhaps we shall be allowed to have reference to the documents on which this liability is based before we come to the Report Stage. But the case that is made is that the judges were appointed for life and that the courts to which they were appointed to act as judges ceased to exist.  Then where comes the case for a pension for life?  Surely it is more in consonance with practice that when an office ceases there should be some lump sum payment by way of commutation or compensation for loss of office through the abolition of that office.  So far as obligation goes, there is at least as much obligation to pay a lump sum in compensation as there is a pension for life, and no more the one than the other.  Assume that these ex-judges are now 40 years of age and they live to 70 or 75, as they may well live longer, with an easy £500 a year and nothing to do but spend it.  They can easily live 30 or 35 years drawing £500 a year, say a sum of £17,500.  I think that any arbitrator, taking into account the service rendered, the terms of the appointment and all the circumstances, would not lightly award any sum approaching £17,000 as compensation <Col N="1179" /> for the loss of an office of this kind, and from the point of view of the Minister for Finance and the taxpayer, apart from the legal obligation or the obligations in equity that the Minister has spoken about, there is no more liability for a pension for life of £500 a year than there is for a lump sum as compensation for loss of office. I suggest to the Dáil that there would be a greater probability of something less than £17,500 being granted as compensation, or much less than any average life at £500 a year would receive. I think if there has to be compensation for loss of office through the abolition of that office we should ask the Ministry to submit it to the award of an arbitrator.  If there is an obligation in the matter it is an obligation at least as much for a lump sum in compensation as for £500 a year pension, and the State would make a profit&mdash; certainly it would be more economical and a saving of taxation&mdash;if we were to have this matter dealt with by way of award by an arbitrator than that we should allow the Minister to saddle himself with the sum of £500 a year for each of these two, or three, or five pensioners, whatever the number may be.  The number, I should point out, is not stated in this section, the reason being that most of the judges have already been placed, but two of them, we are informed, have not been placed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite at one with the Ministry in desiring that the principle or the fact of continuity should be maintained, that we should accept the responsibilities and the obligations as we look for the assets, but I think that many Deputies would be able to bring forward evidence that officers, even Ministers of State, acting, or purporting to Act, under the authority of the Dáil, made promises which have not been fulfilled.  They could bring evidence that would be satisfactory, though not perhaps documentary evidence to show that promises were made by Ministers in respect of quite a number of affairs, but these promises have been renounced.  We know that within the last year, not going back at all to the Ministers of the first Dáil even high officers of State of the <Col N="1180" /> Saorstát made promises which, because they were alleged not to have had authority to make, have not been fulfilled, perhaps rightly.</P>
    <P>We cannot act on the assumption that every promise made by a Minister, which might have been a verbal promise for all we know, was made with the authority of the Dáil.  All we know in this case is that the judges were appointed, and we only know that from the fact that they were serving. Except for the Minister's word, we do not know the salaries they were paid. We do not know, and certainly there has not been any statement made here to the effect, that they were promised pensions of two-thirds of their salaries in any circumstances whatever. So far as the obligation goes, there is no more obligation to pay a pension than there is to pay a lump sum.  I submit that if there is any obligation to do anything because of loss of office, the Dáil would be wise to refuse this sanction, and to advise the Ministry to seek to get out of the obligation by payment of a lump sum.  Therefore I ask the Dáil not to pass this section of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>We generally refuse to commute pensions, and it is generally found cheaper to pay pensions in the end than to pay sums to commute the pensions.  If Deputy Johnson meant it, it is, of course, foolish to suggest that the present value of an annuity of £500 is anything like £17,000.  Even if the man, now fifty-three, were to live for ever the value would be only £10,000.  I have not the means of making an actuarial calculation at the moment, but I would say that the present value of an annuity of £500, in the case of a man fifty-three years of age, would be nearer £7,000 or £8,000, perhaps £6,000 or £7,000. There is no such sum as £17,000 in question at all.  When we were giving pensions in lieu of salaries to people who no longer were to be paid salaries, as there were no duties attaching to the offices they held, who had gone out of office, not by dismissal or removal, but by abolition of the office we had to consider what was fair to give them. The Dáil should remember that the alternative to paying some such pensions <Col N="1181" /> as these would be to continue to pay the salaries for life, although no duties were being done.  It seems to us reasonable that the ordinary pension should be given, that is a pension of two-thirds of the salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You cannot think of this matter in terms of the gratuity that would be given to an unestablished civil servant, or even to an established civil servant of short service, because these people held offices that had tenure far superior to that of any civil servant.  A civil servant holds his office at the will and pleasure of the Executive Council.  He may be removed without cause shown or reasons stated.  These people held offices from which they could not be removed without procedure that was designed to ensure that actually they <Col N="1182" /> should not be removed without grave reason.  Consequently, I think you cannot think of dealing with the matter on the basis of giving them one or two years' salary.  The alternative to giving the pension would, certainly, be simply to continue paying salaries as long as these gentlemen might live.</P>

    <P>In view of the statement by the Minister for Finance when we were discussing item No. 7 on the Orders of the Day, and especially in view of what he said with regard to the individuals who would benefit under this Bill, I do not think any useful purpose would be <Col N="1183" /> served by proposing this amendment. When I put down the amendment, I thought the onus of proving that those people were not in active sympathy with any organisation engaged in armed opposition to the Provisional Government, lay upon themselves. I think now that there is a possibility that the onus might not lie upon those individuals to prove that they were not sympathisers with any organisation in armed opposition. In view of the existing circumstances, and in view of what the Minister has said, I would ask the leave of the Dáil to withdraw the amendment.</P>

Are we to understand that the amendment in the name of Deputy Mrs. Collins O'Driscoll is withdrawn, because the persons likely to be affected by this Bill are not those who have been helpers of, or active sympathisers with, any organisation engaged in armed opposition?  I have noted that the Deputy voted for the payments of the pensions, and it is quite clear to any observer that the object of the amendment was to prevent a pension being paid to anybody.  It will be interesting to know whether the Deputy is now in favour of paying pensions to people whom she believes were active sympathisers with, or helpers of, an organisation engaged in armed opposition.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any person to whom a pension has been granted under this Act is, during the continuance of such pension, convicted of any crime or offence by a Court of competent jurisdiction in Saorstát Eireann and is sentenced by that court for that crime or offence to imprisonment with or without hard labour for any <Col N="1184" /> term exceeding three months, or to penal servitude for any term, the pension so granted to such person shall be forfeited as from the date of such conviction.</P>
    <P>If any such conviction and sentence as aforesaid is quashed or annulled, the forfeiture of a pension consequent on such conviction and sentence shall be deemed to have been quashed and annulled also, and the pension shall be thereupon revived and payable together with all arrears thereof accruing since the date of conviction.</P>
    <P>I regret I was not present to hear what the Minister had to say in regard to item No. 7 on the Order Paper.  The terms of this new section are the terms of the section that appears in the Military Service (Pensions) Bill.  I suggest it is not really the intention of the Minister to pay those pensions to persons who might at any time be guilty of a serious offence against the State. The putting in of this section in the Bill would show that we expect the same high standard of good public conduct from our pensioned judges as we do from our pensioned soldiers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two things I would like to say with reference to this.  First there is no such provision as this in the Courts of Justice Act which provides for judges' pensions.  It would be putting those Dáil judges on a different level from the judges of the existing Supreme, High, or Circuit Courts in regard to their pensions.  There exist provisions, which are fairly wide, for the forfeiture of judges' pensions.  They are in the Forfeiture Act of 1870.  Any person holding a pension, who is found guilty of treason or felony, and receives sentence exceeding twelve months' imprisonment, automatically has his pension forfeited.  I do not know whether the Deputy would regard that as wide enough, but it is a provision that will apply to these new pensions just as it applies automatically to the pensions of existing judges.  It means that if there is a serious offence against the State the pension will be forfeited.  The classes of offences that come under the heading of felony are pretty wide. There is another class of offence that <Col N="1185" /> might come under the title of treason. I think that provision might suffice.</P>

      <P>If the position is that under regulations and laws already existing the pension of a judge can be stopped if he gets twelve months' imprisonment, I certainly would be prepared to say that would meet my objection to an unqualified Bill such as this.  In view of the fact that I would not care to prejudice the position of our Dáil judges as compared with the position of those judges who were not Dáil judges, I think that the safeguard of loss of pension on conviction, bringing about punishment of twelve months' imprisonment, is adequate, and I would be prepared, with the leave of the House, to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Defence to-day brought forward a Bill dealing with an amendment of the Pensions Act.  I am not quite sure how he described the Bill, but if my memory is right, the Bill deals with the possible revocation of pensions granted to soldiers.  I think one can find a good many references in the Dáil to the fact that during the time the Supreme Courts were in operation, we were in a period of revolutionary activity, and though they were judges, they were more or less acting in the position of part of the revolutionary authority and not very far apart from active service. It is only because of these circumstances that this Bill has been passed at all.  &ldquo;Let us clear our minds of cant&rdquo; is a phrase often quoted, and let us remember that although we are talking about this Supreme Court being the legal predecessor of the Saorstát Courts, the facts are that the judges of these courts were more or less militant lawyers, acting supplementarily to the military activities.  It seems to me that at least you cannot apply different tests to the revocation of their pensions than you would apply to the revocation of pensions to soldiers.  This amendment of Deputy Mulcahy's is taken from the Military Service Pensions Act, and I do not think that we should be asked to make any very great distinction. To say that a soldier may have his pension revoked either on the decision <Col N="1186" /> of a Minister or on a conviction involving three months' imprisonment, without hard labour, and to leave it to a conviction for treason, before a judge, or ex-judge can have his pension revoked&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Or a felony.  I think whatever is applicable in the case of revocation of pensions for soldiers should be made applicable in the case of revocation of pensions of judges.  If we were dealing with judges of the court at the same time as we were dealing with pensions for soldiers, I would take the same view, whether they were judges of the Supreme Court or judges of the Saorstát Courts.  I think, as a matter of fact, if there is a misdemeanour on the part of an ex-judge very much lighter in character and quality than that of an ex-soldier the offence should be treated as much greater because of the character and the position of the judges, but the amendment of the Deputy is surely reasonable when he tells us he has taken this from the Pensions Clauses applying to soldiers. I think we should ask the Dáil to agree to this amendment, and I do not understand the Minister's objection.  I surmised it had been moved as a counter proposition to that of Deputy Mrs. Collins O'Driscoll at the inspiration of the Minister.  I thought it was quite a good counter, but if it is not so, I congratulate Deputy Mulcahy on his insight and his sense of justice.</P>

      <P>I agree that my amendment is entirely reasonable, and that the grounds upon which I put it down are very sound.  But I am satisfied, once it is established that a pensioned judge cannot get away, after offending against the State or offending against public order here.  Once I am satisfied with regard to that, I am impressed by the undesirability of placing our Dáil judges in a different position in any way from the ex-British judges that were here.  It is on these grounds that I wish to withdraw my amendment by leave of the House and I am sure that aspect of the matter appeals to Deputy Johnson too.</P>

      <P>Section 3 gives the Minister for Justice power at any time to fix Summer time for this country. If he were in the future going to be a free agent I would have very little objection, seeing that we could not carry a vote against this Bill.  But he and the present Government had their genesis in the fact that they were here to contest the position of England in this country.  Now the position is that England will be the guiding light for the Minister, and it is from the time in England he must take the time for this country.  I therefore very much disagree with this section.</P>

If the ordinary period were insisted on between Committee Stage and Report Stage, and between that and the Final Stage, the probability is that the Bill would not be through the Seanad before the Easter Recess.  In view of the fact that the time fixed for the beginning of Summer Time is the third Saturday in April, it would be highly advisable, if not absolutely necessary, to have that Bill law before the Easter Recess.</P>

I would ask the Minister to consider the undesirability, in a matter of such small moment as this, of trying to test the view of the House on such a matter, which is really of very great importance when dealing with legislation without notice.  There is surely time between now and Tuesday to get a motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders and give due notice.  Then it could be passed by general assent, and I am sure it would be, and the Seanad could pass the Bill in due time also.  As a matter of strict order, I submit that we have not had the requisite notice as set forth in the Standing Orders, and as a matter of convenience and accommodation there is no necessity for pressing the matter at this stage.</P>

What prompts me to rise at this moment is the remark made by the Minister for Justice in reference to the long adjournment which the Seanad proposes to make.  I think that is a most undesirable thing.  If the Seanad is part of the Parliamentary institutions of this country surely they will agree, if this is an urgent matter, so urgent as the Minister represents it to be, to come back and deal with this Bill or any other Bill that may be required of them and deal with it in a proper way before they adjourn for a long period.

This is a Bill making Summer Time permanent, and this is the last occasion on which we will have an opportunity of voicing the views of people in the rural districts against Summer Time.  We opposed Summer Time originally; we opposed it last year and we oppose it now.  We oppose it all the more from the fact that it is at the dictation of Gt. Britain that Summer Time will be fixed in the future.  The arguments against putting Summer Time in operation in this country have been stated so often that I will not repeat them.  This is an agricultural country, and our fundamental economic position is based upon <Col N="1192" /> agriculture.  If we are interfered with in the management of our crops by bringing in a new time, which will probably upset the harvest and inconvenience the people in the rural areas, a great injustice will be done.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That in the opinion of the Dáil it is desirable that the Executive Council should exercise its influence to ensure the continuance and development of the natural resources of the country in minerals at Wolfhill, Castlecomer and Arigna.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had made one very small point in connection with this motion when it was last before the Dáil.  I want to advert more particularly now to the terms of the motion.  We are asked to declare.</P>
      <P>That in the opinion of the Dáil it is desirable that the Executive Council should exercise its influence to ensure the continuance and development of the natural resources of the country in minerals at Wolfhill, Castlecomer and Arigna.</P>
      <P>The Deputy confined most of his remarks, if not the entire of his remarks, to Wolfhill, but Deputy Cole, who seconded it, brought in one of the other mines, and Deputy Johnson rather made a general plea for these three mines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point I have to make with regard to the motion is that none of these mines is Government property. <Col N="1193" /> Not a single one of these mines is at present entirely in the possession of the Government.  If I leave out Wolfhill, I am sure the proposition which I put will be accepted even by Deputy Davin: that neither Castlecomer nor Arigna is at the moment in the legal ownership of the Government, or any section of the Government.  With Wolfhill the position is somewhat different, but I believe the general proposition holds good even there, that the Government does not own the property in the mines at Wolfhill.  Therefore, when we are asked to vote that the Executive Council should exercise its influence to ensure the continuance and development of the mineral resources of the country in minerals in these three cases, it must be remembered how weak that motion is.  It simply is that the Government shall&mdash;the vague phrase is used&mdash;use its influence to ensure that certain resources shall be continued or shall be kept continuously in development at these three places.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of personal explanation, I take no responsibility for the wording of the resolution, but in consultation with the Ceann Comhairle I think I agreed it should read, with the permission of the Minister, &ldquo;the continued development.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a small point I was going to make, that the Deputy presumably did mean the continued development.  Taking it in that way, this is a very vague thing: that the Government should use its influence to ensure the continued development of the mineral resources of these three places.  I believe I can simply answer that by stating that the Government has no control over any of these mines and, consequently, I feel that I can readily accept this motion because it binds me, as a member of the Government, and binds the Government as a whole, to nothing, or to something which is so vague and so unsubstantial that it can be dismissed as nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin made his case about Wolfhill, and he gave us certain interesting figures with regard to the working of the mines under the present miners' committee&mdash;figures which I do not attempt to criticise here.  I <Col N="1194" /> have no wish to criticise them, but even if I had I have not sufficient details. Deputy Egan raised one point.  He wished to know if there were any charges in the sums mentioned by the Deputy towards the weekly expenses list, towards the depreciation of the plant and machinery or towards the provision of new plant.  He wanted to know whether these overhead expenses and new charges were met to any degree in the list of expenses which the Deputy gave.  I presume they were not. I presume he meant the wages paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I quoted the figures accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore if we criticise the figures, such as those given by Deputy Davin, they are not sufficiently detailed for proper criticism and for meeting the case put up, namely, that the Miners' Committee could make the mine a success over a long period in the future.  The Deputy has shown, provided we accept his figures, that the mine as at present being worked has shown something in the way of a profit, where it previously has shown a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot challenge things which the Deputy simply states.  The figures have not been subject to examination.  I do not impugn the Deputy's honesty in giving the figures.  They have been put before us; we have taken them as stated, and we say that on them there is not a sufficient case made to show that the Miners' Committee could continue to work this single mine at a profit in the future.  The Deputy alleged gross mismanagement on the part of those who had previously run the mine, and, while he was indulging in criticisms of the previous management, he asked that there should be stated here what sum of money was set aside, through the National Land Bank, for the purchase of machinery, and how far, to the best of our information, the money was expended for the purpose for which it <Col N="1195" /> was given.  I am informed by the Ministry for Finance that, approximately, £25,000 was given for the purpose of purchasing the necessary machinery and equipment.  Beyond that I cannot go.  I could not state to what that money was applied.  That was a matter for the Board of Directors.</P>

There was a period in which the mine was under the control of the Committee of Management or Board of Directors, and there was another period in which it was in charge of a receiver appointed by the National Land Bank.  There was a third period of recent date when it was in charge of a manager and receiver appointed by the courts.  In the earliest period, £25,000 was given for the purchase of machinery.</P>

      <P>I do not want too much to be taken from my words, but I can answer the Deputy in this way: In the last fortnight a manager and receiver have been appointed by the courts.  In the earliest of these three periods a sum of, approximately, £25,000 was given for the purchase of the necessary equipment, including machinery.  How far that was expended on machinery, or equipment of any sort, I do not know.  It was the business of the directors to see to that. The Board of Directors appointed a manager of their own free choice, and it was their business to see that he applied the money for the purposes for which it was got.</P>

      <P>Was that money voted since 1923, when the National Land Bank took over control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That I cannot say.  I understand it was in the earliest period, in which the mine was under the control of the board of directors.  I understand that it was not in the period <Col N="1196" /> since the National Land Bank did what the Deputy phrases as &ldquo;taking control.&rdquo; There were certain items on which the Deputy wanted information. He wanted to know how much money was put into the concern by the National Land Bank.  To go into all this would take the period back to January, 1922, when a sum of £25,000 was lent by the National Land Bank on the guarantee of the Provisional Government. Later, in July, 1923, the date on which the National Land Bank was paid off, the working of the colliery was financed by the National Land Bank, the Bank receiving debentures to the extent of £50,000 over the company's assets.  In September, 1924, the National Land Bank took over the mine under the terms of the debenture agreement.  What I have mentioned so far may be called direct payment.  In addition to that, there was certain assistance given to the mine.  For instance, the Board of Works placed contracts for coal with the Wolfhill people and put up a certain amount in advance as payment for it.  The advance at one period amounted to £12,000.  In addition to that, there was a sum of money originally paid for the construction of the colliery railway, which could be counted as money put in by some Government source, for the continuance and working of the mine at something like a cost of £150,000.  Those are three items, and exactly which of them the Deputy wants, or for what purpose he wants it, I am not clear.  There was certainly not less than £200,000 put into that mine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give the information in this way: if, as would be proper in a case of this kind, an estimate, supplementary or otherwise, was put forward to cover the money advanced and spent, what would be the extent of that sum?  I ask for detailed figures as to how the money has been spent.  I am ruling out of consideration the £50,000, which has nothing to do with my proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>To give a definite answer to that question would involve great difficulty.  The Deputy in his speech always referred to the Government as having control of this <Col N="1197" /> mine, but once or twice he corrected himself by changing the synonym from the Government to the National Land Bank, and on one occasion he referred to the Government through its agent, the National Land Bank. The sum of money which would have to be put on estimate for presentation to the Dáil would differ in so far as the National Land Bank, in its negotiations with the Company was, in fact, an agent for the Government for such purpose.  It is not enough for the Deputy's purpose to establish that the National Land Bank has certain Government money and to conclude from that that in everything it does it is acting as an agent for the Government. There would be a sum of £25,000 put on such estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  The Minister specifically stated that £25,000 was advanced for the purpose of purchasing machinery, and a guarantee was given by the Provisional Government, which is, I presume, in some Government Department, that is, the conditions under which this money, or <Col N="1198" /> other money, may have been given for this or any other purpose in connection with the working of the mine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is again adding together things and making too much of them. A loan of £25,000 was given by the National Land Bank to the mine, and it was guaranteed by the Provisional Government.  That was afterwards paid off, and to that extent that represented a gift of £25,000 by the Government to the colliery owners.  Later there was an arrangement under which the figure was £50,000, and of that £25,000 was set aside for machinery. What the exact terms were I do not know.  I have not got them here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Are not the taxpayers of this country entitled to know, and particularly the people interested in the mine, if there are any available resources, and to get any actual facts the Ministry may have?  These should be in possession of the Ministry, or in some other department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear as to what the country is entitled to know regarding this matter, for it is a very mixed sort of transaction.  The Government does not control or own the mine.  The Government has given certain moneys to it under the corresponding method that a guarantee is given as regards loans under the Trade Loans Facilities Act, where a schedule has to be prepared giving the items such as the Deputy asks, but there was no obligation regarding the publication of a schedule when the money was given to the Wolfhill people.  I do not know that I am bound to give that information, or that the Deputy has a right to ask for it.  I have no information to give at the moment.  I admit that some money was given for the purchase of machinery.  That is not much good to the Deputy, unless he wants me to go further and admit that it was spent for other purposes than the purchase of machinery.  If that is so, that was the business of the board of directors and their manager.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of money advanced through the Government for the purposes of the mine amounts to £212,000, and in addition there are sums under the agreement made just before Christmas whereby money was diverted from the unemployment relief fund, and given over for the purpose of keeping the pumps going and keeping the mine from being submerged.  These sums amounted in December to £950, January £950, February £400, and the estimate for March is £200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>It should not go abroad that money has been spent by or with the authority of the present Government in connection with the development of Wolfhill, which in reality has not been so spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I was answering a question by Deputy Egan, who asked me to state what amount of money directly or indirectly had been advanced. I put it at something near a quarter of a million pounds.  After giving the history of the operations under the Miners' Committee the Deputy came to what was the point of his motion&mdash;that is to say, he made a suggestion that the Government, through its agent, the National Land Bank, should so operate on the directors of the mine as to induce them to pass a winding-up resolution, for the purpose evidently of letting the mine be taken over later by the Miners' Committee. That, however, is only an assumption, but the Deputy made a suggestion that a winding-up resolution should be passed.  That gets us back to the very difficult circumstances surrounding this whole matter.  It is not in the Government's power to make the directors pass the resolution the Deputy requires, except by a method he would not approve, that is by cutting off all sums of money, in which case the National Land Bank will want to get rid of sustained and definite losses.  That would readily bring the directors to wind the company up, and to get this mine off their hands.  I agree with the Deputy when <Col N="1200" /> he says that the present position cannot last indefinitely.  The present position is not intended to last indefinitely. There is a very definite limit set to it by the provision of this money, for the agreement was that any moneys handed over from the Unemployment Relief Fund to keep pumps going were to cease at the end of March, so that so far as the Deputy's point is concerned he is going to be met.  Deputy Johnson said that inasmuch as this mine represented national property it should not be allowed to come to the point where flooding will take place, and where the property will be very much depreciated, and if anyone afterwards intended to work it it would entail very considerable expense in bringing it to its present state.  If the Government did own this mine, they are faced with the proposition that since January, 1922, there has been lost not merely from Government sources, but by the old directors, the National Land Bank, and the Government, at least a quarter of a million pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>To be able to do so I should have the directors' figures regarding the losses, and I have not got them, but from the three sources I have mentioned there was a loss of a quarter of a million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The totals happen to be the same, but there is a different sum.  That includes the money put into the mine.  It is not a question of the Board of Works contract of £12,000, and it is not a question of the colliery railway, but of the actual money put into the mine, and for which there was no return.  The figures the Deputy gave us are not sufficiently detailed to be criticised, but on the basis of those we are asked to take a risk. We have seen what our own losses are, and we have an estimate of what the directors' losses are, and notwithstanding that and after control by the Miners' Committee since about January, <Col N="1201" /> and seeing what they can do, we are asked whether we are inclined to let the mine run on.  It is not a very sound proposition, and it is one which the Minister for Finance would require to have a much longer opportunity to consider.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had previously asked a question, and in his remarks adverted again to the expert's report.  He demanded that the expert's report should be made public, that at least it should be laid before the House. I interjected that that could not happen, because the report was not the property of the Minister for Finance, or of any Minister, and I think the Deputy's retort on that was that that was so much the better, because it showed that the Government had taken no steps to find out what was the true position with regard to this mine. There are two very definite things here to be considered.  There was a report prepared on the mine and its potentialities.  That report was sent to the Minister for Finance for his information.  He saw what was in it, and saw the arguments.  He took into consideration the reputation of the man who wrote it, and he came to certain conclusions. He could do all that, and could conclude that that was sufficient to save him from incurring any further public expense in getting a report of his own, while at the same time he could surely insist that as it was not his report it was not for him to make that report public.  I again repeat what I said, that the report was received, was read and considered, and on the basis of that report&mdash;not completely on the basis of that report, but with the surrounding and attendant circumstances&mdash;certain decisions were taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again repeat that it is not in the power of the Minister for Finance to lay that report before the Dáil.  It is not his property, he has no control over it.  He was given it for his information, and he took what was in it and came to certain conclusions on it. I think it is quite fair to state, and one can reasonably state it, that the Minister <Col N="1202" /> for Finance had certain information before him, although he may not have had to incur Government expense to get that information.  One of the owners of the mine said that in order to clear up things in regard to its future he himself was prepared to fee an expert to look into the matter, and the expert's report was presented to the Minister for Finance for his information.</P>
    <P>The other mines referred to, Castlecomer and Arigna, are clear-cut cases. They are in the hands of individuals. Three individuals are concerned in the ownership of these two mines.  The Government has no say whatever as regards the disposition of these people's property.  Deputy Morrissey asked a question about the Tipperary mines.  The position there, as I understand it, is, that a syndicate has been formed to look into the coal resources in South Tipperary and to acquire capital for the working of the Slievardagh mines.  I understand that so far no difficulties have been met with by the syndicate in getting the information and the money they have set out to get.  Of course, enterprise of that kind is of a sort which the Government would welcome, but again I say it is not a matter in which the Government could interfere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the Government will be prepared to give any assistance they can as regards these Slievardagh mines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefer to keep to my own phrase, that enterprise of this kind is of a sort which the Government would welcome.  If one uses vague phrases in the sense of giving assistance there is an immediate reaction. It is looked upon as if it was to be monetary assistance.  Then we get into those mixed transactions that we have had in regard to the Wolfhill mines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this motion, it is quite acceptable.  I do not believe that it means very much.  It is a pious expression that the Government will exercise its influence to ensure certain things.  The Government will support that.  The Wolfhill Colliery must be looked at in the light of its past history, and that past has been a deplorable <Col N="1203" /> one.  It may have arisen from the reasons that Deputy Davin has set out, and there may be other explanations. At all events there has been a report in regard to it.  The only suggestion the Deputy made was that another report should be obtained, not from an English or a Welsh engineer, but that a continental expert should be brought in to examine the Wolfhill Colliery.  That suggestion I can put before the Minister for Finance, and see what attitude he will take upon it.  No such action, not even that action can be taken with regard to the other two mines, Castlecomer and Arigna, because they are completely out of Government control.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to follow Deputy Figgis into his expert evidence with regard to coal mines in Ireland and South Wales, culm and various other matters with which he dealt.  Deputy Johnson's remarks were directed to our national resources.  I would accept what Deputy Johnson said with regard to the national resources, but I do not think that these three mines which have been named would fit in under his heading.  If the Wolfhill Colliery properly became absolutely the property of the Government, then the remarks that Deputy Johnson made about it would apply, and under these conditions I would accept them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister ask us to assume that if it were satisfactorily proved to his mind that a mine which had been developed and was capable of turning out so many tons of coal in the year for the benefit of the country was being generally mismanaged and was likely to be destroyed through flooding, it would not be incumbent on him to save that national resource to the nation, even if it meant his interfering with the proprietors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I could accept that general proposition, but again I say the Wolfhill Colliery does not fit in under it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point of my contribution, such as it was, was to the effect that the Minister should satisfy himself that there was something valuable there that ought to be <Col N="1204" /> conserved, and that should not be allowed to go to ruin through flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that I dealt with that point when I was replying to Deputy Davin's suggestion that another report on the mine should be obtained.  I do say that all the evidence available so far, the history of the mine and the expert report, goes to prove that the Wolfhill Colliery is not a good proposition.  If some other proposition came along which put the mine in the position that Deputy Johnson suggests, a mine capable of producing so much coal and becoming a national resource, and if that was likely to be destroyed by flooding, then it would undoubtedly be the duty of the Government to take steps to prevent such a thing occuring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seemed to rule out that proposition, because this happened to be private property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there would be difficulty, but if the thing was shown to be a great national resource there would be less difficulty then in interfering with the right of the private property-holder who was letting a very valuable national asset depreciate. But when it has, so far from being a very valuable national asset, proved to be a very great national liability in so far as it came on the national funds, then there would be more scruple in interfering with the right of the private property-holder.  I do not know if I have quite segregated all the figures that Deputy Davin asked for.  I had a certain segregation of them, but I do not know if that meets the Deputy's point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this matter.  So far the Minister contended that our national resources do not lie in coal mines like Wolfhill.  If the Government of the country does not see that our national resources, and one of the life-giving streams of the nation, such as this is, are protected against outside or inside interference where will people look for protection?  One particular case the Minister has not mentioned, and that is Castlecomer.  I have connection with Castlecomer, and I know that the mines are fairly well developed there, but at present the men are only working half time.  That is a terrible state of affairs, and it should not be the position at the moment.  I saw recently that our native Government purchased coal probably from England for distribution largely in West Cork and in Connemara to keep the home fires burning in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Dean Swift said on one occasion that we were to burn everything English except coal.  I should not like to go so far as that at the moment, but I think it is the duty of the State to come to the rescue of the mines in some way.  At all events I think we should make our local institutions and all our barracks in the Saorstát purchase and burn Irish coals as part of our national resources.  These resources should be protected in every way possible, because after all, who is to come to the rescue if our native Govearnment is not going to do so?  We <Col N="1206" /> have thousands of people unemployed at the moment and we will have them in the future if our national Government is not able to provide work.  We will have nothing but the gaols and the workhouses and all these things if our native Government does not come to the rescue.  I certainly hope it will be the policy of the Ministry and the Executive to develop our resources in such a way as will render foreign invasion well nigh hopeless.  I hope the Minister will look into this matter at as early a date as possible and see that our resources are protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared, candidly, to admit, at the outset, that my object in putting down this motion on the paper has not been achieved. Last October, during a discussion in this House, of supplementary estimates on the Relief Grants Vote, Deputy Shaw, who, I regret, is not here, and who knows a good deal about the management or the mismanagement of the Wolfhill colliery, made a statement that the failure of the colliery was due, and due alone, to the action of the Labour Party and the people working the mines.  I was not very much prompted by that ridiculous statement in putting down my motion, but I thought I was quite fair in moving this motion so that the case might be either refuted or established, and that the Government should give to the House the information they undoubtedly have at their disposal as to the amount of money actually put into the mine on the authority of the Ministry of Finance since the Provisional Government first took the responsibility for the management of this concern.  I asked, in moving that motion this day week, what were the conditions originally accepted by the Government, and what were the conditions placed upon the directors then in control when the first advance was made on the guarantee of the Provisional Government.  I think there was nothing unfair in asking for information of that kind, because I am quite sure that £25,000 was not advanced by any body of business men or by any Government or by any Ministers merely on word of mouth or on a verbal conversation between individuals representing <Col N="1207" /> the Government on the one side and the directors on the other.  There must be something on record to show and particulars as to what were the conditions imposed on both parties with regard to the guarantee of that £25,000 to which the Minister referred. That, I claim, I am entitled to know, and I think that the Minister should be in a position in the week that has intervened to dig up that document and produce it to the House.</P>
      <P>I heard various figures quoted as to the amount of money lost, stolen or strayed with regard to the conduct and development of this mine.  I never heard until to-night the figure put at the exaggerated sum of £250,000.  The Minister has included in that figure the amount of money spent on the construction of the Wolfhill Railway, which was given free by the British Government and had nothing to do with any responsibility of the Provisional Government or any Government which succeeded it.  That, as we all know, applied in the same way to the Arigna mines.  Money was given by the British Government at the time for the purpose of building connecting railways to the collieries so that the shipping which was so valuable to them during the European War period would not be used unless absolutely necessary to bring coal from England to Ireland. No amount of exaggeration could credit the loss to the working of the Wolfhill Colliery&mdash;if one were to put it that way&mdash;of this figure of £150,000 for the railway.  That railway will remain there until the colliery closes down unless the Government proposes to sell the rails.  That sum of £150,000 should be subtracted from any alleged loss in connection with the working of this mine.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister clear up that?  As I understand, the total of £250,000 was exclusive of the £150,000, the cost of the colliery railway. This is very important, because I gather, taking three years and three months, there must have been 750 men employed at £2 per week for the whole period whose wages are entirely lost.</P>

      <P>I think the trouble arises from the fact that I mentioned two sums of a quarter of a million.  They are two distinct sums. In answer to Deputy Egan, who asked what money directly or indirectly coming through the Government, the National Land Bank or otherwise, had been put into the Wolfhill mine, I gave certain figures.  I took the £25,000 and the £50,000, the two sums of £950, a sum of £400 and a sum of £200, and a sum of about £12,000 advanced on foot of the work, and with the money expended on the railway I said that meant, roughly, £250,000, or more accurately £237,000.  I said, further, leaving this amount aside, there was a second figure, the amount of money that could be calculated as lost since January, 1922, and I said it was lost by three sets of people, the Government, the National Land Bank and the Directors of the mine, and that sum also I estimated at £250,000.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to accept in this House or outside of it, from anybody, in connection with a purely business transaction, figures which cannot be supported by details when they are asked for.  Any company, private or public, demands that figures should be supported and explained when necessary.  I wonder whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce included in his £250,000 this <Col N="1209" /> £160,000 nominal capital, £110,000 of which was placed on the Stock Exchange for speculators.  Is that included?</P>

      <P>I have already given three quarters from which money has come.  Two of those were sufficiently designated.  The third is a matter for the directors.  I am not going to give the figures of directors' losses. I have nothing to do with them.  I have heard a statement and an estimate of their losses.  The Deputy ought to realise that this is a mixed transaction, and I cannot be asked to account for moneys lost at a time when the Government had nothing to do with the mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I spent fifteen years in an accountant's office juggling, if you like, with figures and carrying out instructions. I have got more mixed up with the Minister's explanation in connection with this matter than I have at any time.  The fact is that the National Land Bank took responsibility as the agents of the Government in connection with the working of this mine from September, 1923, and with the consent of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce actually had the appointment of the manager of the mine. Beyond that date I know that figures are at the disposal of the Land Bank. Figures should be available to the Government in respect of every penny spent in the working and development of this mine.  All I ask is that the conditions be given as to the money advanced, as to how much of the money advanced was spent in wages and how much set aside for the purchase of machinery, and how much of the amount advanced for the purchase of machinery was spent for the purpose for which it was given.  I think that is a definite and plain question which, with a week's time to prepare, should be capable of being answered.  I think the Minister if he has the answer should give it to the House now.  When a person talks of the failure of a mine or <Col N="1210" /> a business concern, he is bound at the final meeting of the shareholders who put money into the concern to give an explanation as to what were the causes of the mismanagement, or failure if you like to say so.  That is all I am asking for in this case, because the Government, through the Minister and through one of the Deputies who supported him, made statements to the effect that the colliery has failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said there was nothing, so far as the reports in his hands were concerned, from the point of view of relieving unemployment or developing available coal resources, which would justify them in putting any more money into the mine.  That is the position, and therefore I assume that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is on his defence, and such an able person as he is should be able to answer those very simple questions which would be put to him if he were a director of the Wolfhill Collieries Company, Limited. My only concern is to secure, if it is possible, the assistance of the Government in order that the 194 men who were employed on this very useful work during a number of years would continue to receive employment by means of some reformation of the company, or through whatever influence the Government might exercise to keep the mine a going concern.  I have stated the offer the miners were prepared to make in order to prove that they had confidence in the future of the mine.  They were prepared to help to whatever extent they were able with their own limited resources.  Since last December, the period in which the miners took control, several appointments have been made with the old directors of the Wolfhill Collieries Company, Limited, but we have not met more than two of the old directors.  I ask that any influence which can be exercised through members of this House and the other House, and the local people interested, should be exercised to enable the colliery to be conducted as a going concern in the future.  Having admitted that we have failed in that respect I think it is only fair that the facts should be put before the House, and the House should say whether or not the mine should be closed <Col N="1211" /> down, and whether or not the Government should take responsibility for it, if it is unable to do anything for the 194 men employed there on useful and productive work.</P>
    <P>I brought the matter forward for another reason, because I realise that without being able to provide suitable pumping machinery which would prevent the mine being flooded in a short time, it would be useless later to enter into any negotiations or to ventilate the matter in the House.  Once the mine floods it automatically closes down.  If the miners who are conducting the mine to-day had at their disposal a sufficiently large sum of money to enable them to provide proper pumping and other machinery they would have no hesitation in carrying on under the existing arrangements, and in giving better proof to the House and the public that the mine is not that badly managed and uneconomic concern which it has been represented to be.</P>
    <P>The machinery that is there&mdash;I am speaking as a layman, but I listened to the judgment of engineers upon it&mdash; makes it dangerous for the workmen to go 200 yards beneath the surface in order to eke out a miserable existence at an occupation which few people would choose.  The mine can only be worked by the men, under the existing arrangement, up to 31st March.  After that date, it cannot be worked without the consent of the National Land Bank. The mine is not the miners' property. It is the property of the shareholders and directors of the Wolfhill Collieries, Limited, the National Land Bank having some claim upon the machinery or portion of the assets, if and when they are realised.</P>
    <P>The Minister accepted, because he was not able to criticise, the figures that I quoted.  The figures I quoted were not from the proper balance sheet of a going business concern but from the weekly revenue returns.  The figures I quoted&mdash;I did not like to go into any great detail&mdash;are available at the National Land Bank.  I know that they have been examined by the Minister's own permanent officials, who have done a good deal to help in connection with this colliery.  If the Minister had time <Col N="1212" /> to go into these figures, as I have done, he would be in a position to criticise them.  But they are in no way different from the figures at the National Land Bank, which have been seen by his own permanent officials.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to take responsibility&mdash;I am sure Deputy Egan and Deputy Bulfin, who are acquainted with the working of this concern, are not prepared to take responsibility either&mdash;for the closing down of this mine, if any proper arrangement can be arrived at, through the agency or influence of the Government, which will enable it to be carried on.  If there are available coal resources in this country, it is the duty of the Government, put in power by the people for the time being, to develop those resources and reduce the amount of coal we have to import and which we send money out of the country to pay for.  I quoted figures to show that we have actually to provide fuel for heat-producing purposes to the extent of 65 per cent.  That is very serious, and it is silly for people to be using high-sounding political phrases about the great freedom we have, or that we could get under another label, when we are economically dependent for fuel on outside countries to the extent I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I do not desire to delay the Dáil, because I am fully confident that the Minister has more information on this matter than I have myself.  I ask him to use his independent judgment, taking all the factors into consideration, and endeavour to secure that this mine will be carried on as a going concern, with the assistance of the Government, after 31st March.  I made no claim that the miners should be the controlling influence after the 31st March.  I had no authority to put such a proposition before the House.  I did say&mdash;perhaps the Minister misunderstood me&mdash;that the miners were prepared to take shares to the extent of £2 per man in whatever future company was formed, as a result of the intervention of the Government.  I hope the Minister will give to the House the figures which I demanded on this night week, when I moved this motion.  If he is unable to do so, if he requires time to secure those figures, which I know are <Col N="1213" /> available, then will he give to the House, for the purpose of record for future reference, the figures to support the statement he made here to-night?</P>
    <P>I ask, A Chinn Comhairle, that my motion be amended to read:</P>
    <P>That, in the opinion of the Dáil, it is desirable that the Executive Council should exercise its influence to ensure the continued development of the natural resources of the country in minerals at Wolfhill, Castlecomer, and Arigna.</P>
    <P>Leave given to amend the motion accordingly.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Firearms (Temporary Provisions) (Continuance) Bill, 1925.  We passed, on the 5th April, 1924, an Act entitled &ldquo;The Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1924.&rdquo;  The operation of that Act was restricted to one year, and it will expire shortly.  It is important that power should be taken to <Col N="1214" /> control the possession and use of firearms, and accordingly a permanent Bill has been drafted which will strengthen and simplify the law on this subject. The permanent Bill, which is in fact in draft, contains important modifications of the law, particularly in relation to fees payable by persons using or possessing guns.  I regret that its introduction was unavoidably delayed, and that sufficient time would not remain for the discussion of this permanent measure by the Oireachtas before 4th April next, which is the date on which the temporary Act expires. Accordingly I introduced the present temporary measure, which continues the operation of the Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Act until the 31st July next.  The 31st July is the end of the licensing year for firearm purposes. I hope it will be possible to have the permanent Bill passed through all its stages before that date.  It was not intended to bring the permanent Bill into full force until the 1st August, which is the beginning of another licensing year, so that the passing of this Bill will not in any way delay the necessary provision of the law relating to firearms.</P>
      <P>The temporary Act of 1924 has worked rather well up to the present. I do not think that any hardships have been caused by its operations, or that any serious objection can be urged to the proposal to continue it for a further period of four or five months up to 31st July.  Meanwhile, I will have before the Dáil for consideration the permanent Bill governing the possession and use of firearms.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
