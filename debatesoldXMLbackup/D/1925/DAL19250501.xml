      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. K. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to supplement the Act passed in 1923, in certain respects in which it was found inadequate. While the pictures shown within the Saorstát were required to pass the Official Censor and to be certified as fit for exhibition in public, there was nothing to prevent persons engaged in the film trade from advertising such pictures by means of posters which were themselves suggestive and improper, and which conveyed an entirely false impression as to the nature of the entertainment actually given to the public.  I was somewhat surprised, after the Censorship of Films Act, 1923, was passed, and after it was in effective operation, to receive letters from clergymen and others throughout the country protesting vehemently against the nature of the films that were being exhibited.  Inquiry in many cases showed that the opinions were being formed from the advertising posters that were being exhibited in connection with these pictures, the fact being that the scenes depicted on the posters in most cases did not occur at all in the actually exhibited films, and in some few cases were scenes that had been deleted by the Censor in the performance of his functions.  Posters of this kind found their way into practically every town and into a great many villages in the <Col N="726" /> country, and, as I am informed, did considerable harm.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to extend the Censorship to these posters and advertisements in connection with the film trade.  It might be convenient, for the information of the Deputies, to describe the manner in which the publicity for cinematograph films is prepared and distributed.  Advertisements fall mainly under two heads.  They are either actual photographs extracted from the films and used to illustrate the incidents from which they are extracted, or they are coloured posters which may or may not represent actual incidents in the film play.  In many cases these posters do not represent any such incidents but are designed to indicate the general tendency of the play which they purport to advertise.  The photographic advertisement is dealt with in Section 2 of the Bill at present under review.  Section 2 prohibits the exhibition of any such photographic reproduction of an incident in the picture unless the part so reproduced has been certified by the Official Censor for exhibition in public.  As regards the other variety of posters mentioned, I am informed that when a film is produced. the manufacturers prepare at the same time what is called an exploitation sheet containing a variety of posters, perhaps a dozen or more, which they regard as suitable for advertising it. These exploitation sheets are furnished to renters who obtain the picture, and the exhibitor who hires the picture selects from the sheet such posters as he considers will best suit the district and the clientele of his house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, as drafted, proposes that a copy of the exploitation sheet must be furnished to the Official Censor at the same time as the picture to which it refers, and the Censor may decide which posters may be exhibited and which may not.  An appeal will lie against his decision in this matter in the same way as an appeal lies against his refusal to grant a certificate in respect of a picture at present.  Where a poster is displayed which has not been passed by the Official Censor, the exhibitor will be guilty of an offence. As, however, the original decision will have been conveyed not to the exhibitor <Col N="727" /> but to the renter, it is necessary to insert a fresh clause, Section 4 of this Bill, to prevent the exhibitor being held responsible where, in fact, the offence is committed by the renter.  A situation might arise where a renter knowing that the Official Censor had forbidden the display of certain posters deliberately failed to inform an exhibitor of such prohibition.  In such a case the exhibitor will, if he can prove the facts, relieve himself from blame and throw the onus on the renter.</P>
    <P>Section 5 forbids the exhibition in relation to a picture of any certificate (other than that of the Official Censor) purporting to authorise the exhibition in public of such picture.</P>
    <P>Under the Censorship of Films Act, 1923, the Minister for Justice might make regulations for the carrying into effect of that Act, but, by an oversight, power was not taken to provide penalties for breaches of the regulations so made.  Section 6 is intended to remedy the omission.</P>
    <P>The regulations must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the Oireachtas has power to annul them by resolution.</P>

      <P>I am not rising to oppose this Bill, but, if I understand the Minister's explanation aright, it is in effect this, that the Bill has been introduced in order to bring measures to bear upon people who put forward advertisements that are a false colour of the commodities advertised. That is very striking and interesting. I think legislation on that line might be extended to matters other than films, if that is the principle that is now going to be accepted: that if advertisements are put forward in respect of commodities which make claims for these commodities that are not carried out, or are not justified by circumstances, legislation will be introduced in order to make advertising a true reflex of the commodities advertised.  I think legistion upon that line might be worthy of consideration for matters other than films.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I am right, or whether Deputy Figgis's deduction is right.  I gather <Col N="728" /> that the censorship of films is not to enforce conformity between the poster and the film, but to suppress posters which may have an undesirable influence, and which may refer to incidents which the Censor has thought undesirable, and has had removed from the film.  I do not think we are adopting such a principle as Deputy Figgis suggests.  If we were you might have legislation suppressing election speeches&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;that are not in conformity with the actual policy of the Government.  Deputies who announce that they are going to reduce the cost of living and then do nothing in that direction might find themselves in difficulties. I think that that is a very dangerous principle, indeed.  But the thing is only a logical sequence to the fact that we have already created a film censorship.  If that is to be effective it should be continued, not only as regards those who see the picture, but also to those who pass by, and to children who stand outside and gaze at the posters.  While I am inclined to look with suspicion on any legislation of this kind, I think that this is a logical sequel to what we have done before, and I do not oppose the Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask leave to introduce the Shannon Electricity Bill, 1925, the purport of which is described in the Order Paper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To authorise and provide for the production by the State of electricity, generated by means of hydraulic power, derived from the waters of the River Shannon, and for the distribution and supply by the State of the electricity so generated, and for other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may mention that as far as the present proposals go the question of distribution and supply is only referred to <Col N="729" /> in one general clause, but that general clause will later be supplemented by a complete organisation Bill.  This Bill merely deals with the generation side. It has one clause dealing with the matter of distribution and sale, to get over a certain transition period, but the general question of distribution and supply will be dealt with in a particular Bill directed to that end.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Second Stage, I am in some difficulty, and I would like to have the views of the House.  To a certain extent the House has come to a decision such as would ordinarily be arrived at on the Second Stage of a Bill of this type.  I do not want, of course, to push that too far; the House may come to another decision on this Bill.  Ordinarily with a Bill of this importance I would like to give as long as possible, but seeing that something in the nature of a decision has already been taken in connection with electricity to be derived from the Shannon, I would, on that ground, urge that the shortest possible time should be given for the Second Reading.  Whatever be the period between this and the Second Reading does not much concern me, provided that the Committee Stage would be understood to come on within the shortest possible time after Second Reading.  That is to say, that I am not to be faced with a plea for extended time, both for Second Reading and Committee Stage, that I can look ahead to the Committee Stage and see that a certain time will be allowed.  How that time is spaced out between now and the Second Stage, and between the Second Stage and the Committee Stage is really not of much concern to me. If I ask that the Second Stage be taken on this day week I am more or less giving notice to the House that if I get that I will move that the Committee Stage be taken within the shortest possible time allowed by the Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It will depend, of course, on the character of the Bill, but it will be much more satisfactory to allow the Second Reading to be taken on the first day possible after notice is given, and then to allow <Col N="730" /> longer time than the minimum for the preparation of any amendments which would be required for the Committee Stage.  It seems to me that if the Minister is prepared to take the Second Reading on Friday next, and if he then seeks to take the Committee Stage as soon as possible afterwards it would be preferable to the House if the Minister would take the Second Reading on, say, Tuesday, as I think he would be allowed under the Standing Orders, provided that notice is given now, and then have an extended time for preparation for Committee, because after all, assuming that the Bill is as comprehensive as one imagines, it will take time to read prior to the Second Reading, and after the Minister's explanations on Second Reading.  I think that any appearance of rush for the Committee Stage would not be desirable at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support very strongly Deputy Johnson's plea for some reasonable time between Second Reading and Committee. The preparation of amendments will require very careful consideration.  Of course very much will depend, from my point of view, upon what assurances the Minister sees fit to give us in continuation of what I think he promised in our last debate, namely, that in the interval the proposals would receive the fullest consideration, and that he would have the best engineering advice that he could get.  I think that considerable time is required for considering these engineering proposals after we get the Bill.  Therefore, perhaps Tuesday would be too early; Wednesday, with a suitable interval between then and the Committee Stage, might be better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">

      <P>From a practical point of view, apart from a decision that might be taken under the Standing Orders, next week, Wednesday and Thursday are barred, in the first place by the Budget Resolutions, which must be reported.  I do not think that the Minister for Finance could possibly give way to the Minister for Industry and Commerce at present.  The only two days available for Second Reading are either Tuesday or Friday <Col N="731" /> next, but if the Minister gets the Second Reading on Friday, again the arrangement made with regard to Estimates bars Tuesday and Wednesday of the following week.  The first day possible for the Committee Stage, therefore, would be next Friday week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one difficulty. We are to a certain extent prejudging the form that the Committee Stage will take.  I take it that it is on Second Reading that any motion referring the consideration of the Bill to a Committee of the Dáil instead of to the whole Dáil, or any action of that kind must be moved.  Until I see what is in the Bill, I cannot say whether it would be better to have the Bill taken by the Dáil or by a Committee.  One would like to consult with other Deputies to see whether that is the best course and whether an amendment like that should be moved.  If we are getting the Bill to-night would notice of such a motion be required on Second Reading?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Our viewpoint on this Bill is, that we are not very particular when the Second Reading is taken, but we are particular as to when the Committee Stage is reached.  This is a very comprehensive Bill, and one of far-reaching importance.  It is one of the most important measures which we have had before us, and perhaps which <Col N="732" /> most countries had before them.  We cannot have the assistance in studying the Bill that the Minister has, and he has his engineering and other staffs to assist him.  I would ask him to extend something like the privileges that common-sense would demand if he were in our position.  We have no objection as regards the Second Reading, but we do object to rushing the Committee Stage, and we have objection to the matter being taken on Friday, inasmuch as Deputies on these Benches want to get away for the week-end.  Friday is a most unsuitable day for a Committee Stage, especially if you have an extended sitting.  I insist, on behalf of the members on these Benches, that the Committee Stage be given an interval as long as possible, and I ask the Minister to look at it from our point of view as compared with his point of view. He knows this question inside out, whereas we have not yet seen the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am to accept Deputy Gorey's statement, that business of this nature will be confined hereafter to Tuesdays, I do not think that the House is going to accept that, and if Friday is to be ruled out as well as Wednesday and Thursday, I can only move that the Second Reading to be taken on Tuesday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Candidly, I do not see eye to eye with Deputy Gorey on this matter.  I think the Second Reading is very important, and if we are to go home this evening and have not an opportunity of seeing one another until Tuesday, that will not expedite the position as regards Second Reading.  I do not think that Second Reading should be taken on Tuesday, especially if we have to read the Bill and get time to study it.  Anyone who wants to put forward amendments has a day or two in which to do so, whereas we would not get the Bill until Monday or Tuesday morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is not very long.  There are only 19 Clauses. I am not sure what provision could be made to supply Deputies with copies before they leave this evening, but it may be possible to arrange that.  There are certain copies of the Bill in the <Col N="733" /> form which I have here, and it may be possible to let Deputies have them, but I do not know what arrangements could be made to have proper copies sent to Deputies.  If it will facilitate Deputies perhaps the Ceann Comhairle could make arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I was told before coming in that the Bill would probably be ready for delivery before four o'clock.  The proof is being corrected and if we get copies we could give them to certain Deputies who have to go away this evening, and it would mean circulating them to the Dublin Deputies later to-night.</P>

      <P>What we have to debate on Tuesday is: &ldquo;A Bill to authorise and provide for the production by the State of electricity generated by means of hydraulic power derived from the waters of the River Shannon, and for the distribution and supply by the State of the electricity so generated, and for other matters incidental thereto or arising in the course thereof or in connection therewith.&rdquo; There are matters incidental to that, but the general principle has already been debated twice, and I do not know what further ammunition Deputies believe they are going to get to hurl against the Shannon and against the scheme to generate electricity from its waters.  That should occupy only a few hours on Tuesday.  If there was going to be another general debate, irrespective of anything that has already been said on this question, we should not have it on Tuesday, but I should ask to have a sitting on Monday to have it properly considered.  I hope that people will realise that the arguments have been put up, that some of them have been answered and that we are not going to beat over the same ground again.</P>

      <P>In the previous discussion I said I would raise certain questions with regard to prison officers. I have since looked up the correspondence, and I have come to the conclusion that it would be better not to raise it on this Vote but to deal with it in another way.  I should like to draw attention to an answer which the Minister gave to a question I put to him respecting the provision made for girl offenders similar to a Borstal institution for boys.  The Minister informed us that no special provision had been made for girl offenders similar to Borstal institution for boys, and no provision was contemplated for girls between the ages of 16 and 21.  At present he said they receive treatment on Borstal lines, but the number of such girls was not sufficient to justify the opening of a female Borstal institution. He explained that there was special training for girls, and that girl prisoners were sent to prisons, such as Mountjoy, and not segregated.  As far as I can understand, that is largely the complaint, that a girl from 16 to 21 is sent to prison, but though she may receive separate treatment, in the sense that she receives certain training, there is still the association with older, more hardened and degraded women prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge that it is worth undertaking some trouble, and perhaps some expense, to avoid that, even though the numbers are too small to allow of a special institution to be provided for them.  Everybody, I think, agrees that special provision should be made for boys, and, though the numbers may be smaller, I think the arguments may be even stronger in their application to girls.  The training is of primary importance, but training plus association with older and more hardened prisoners <Col N="737" /> is going to take much from the value which that training would give. I think it would be very desirable indeed that some arrangement should be made so that girl prisoners could be set apart and treated separately in every way, from the older prisoners, even if within the same building or institution. I do not know whether that is possible, but I think it could surely be managed that in one or other of the prisons arrangements could be made for segregation of young girl prisoners from the older prisoners, and that separation would then be combined with the special training and the advantages the Borstal treatment would provide.  I think it is quite an important matter, and I would press on the Minister the desirability of giving very careful consideration to this proposal.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister, in supporting what Deputy Johnson has said, to carry his inquiry somewhat further than the Deputy has suggested.  I think the whole matter of the treatment of juvenile offenders is one of the very greatest possible importance.  I do not know what kind of mental attitude many of the Deputies take towards this question of a Borstal institution.  I do not know whether, to use a much-hackneyed word, they visualise exactly what it means.  I know that for many years I had a conception that a Borstal institution was quite a different thing from a jail, but I was disillusioned in the matter owing to certain experiences belonging to my lurid past.  Like the President of the Executive Council, I had occasion to visit some of these magnificent establishments called jails in which there are Borstal institutions.  It happened also, and I do not know whether the President also benefited in that luxurious fashion, that I was housed in a Borstal institution at a time of life long after the experience of those who usually go to such places.  There is virtually nothing in a Borstal institution, or in that section of a prison called the Borstal institution, in the regimen, and very little in the manner of life, to distinguish it from an ordinary jail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember at that particular time <Col N="738" /> discussing the matter with one of the warders in that particular jail, which happened to be Lincoln Jail, in which I had the distinguished company of a Deputy of this House who has not taken his seat.  On that occasion I was discussing the matter with the warder, who has a great deal of experience with such Borstal institutions, and he said that once that as many as from 90 to 95 per cent. of the boys who are put into a Borstal institution, and who go through the regimen there, return again in later life, and form part of the regular community that passed through that jail.  He put it down to the fact that the whole associations of the place were the associations of a jail.  He happened to be a person who had given some thought to the matter, and I remember him asking me to undertake a certain task, which I am now discharging. He said: &ldquo;If you ever have an opportunity, urge that young people who commit offences that have driven them into places like the Borstal institutions, should be kept outside the ordinary jail, for Borstal institutions are failures.&rdquo;  I am now discharging the promise I gave.  I ask the Minister not only in respect of girl offenders, but of boys, too, in all cases where those who are of tender age are convicted of offences that would take them into what are now called Borstal institutions, that they should be kept out of the ordinary jails altogether, because of the contaminating influences it will bring at their time of life, and the damage that it will cause in after days.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the whole matter is deserving of very careful and searching inquiry, with a view to seeing if some different method of treatment could not be adopted in this State.  Something should be done, when offenders are at that time of life when evil associations would be very dangerous, whereby they would not be brought into touch with buildings that are generally associated with crime and become, in the course of time, criminals on account of it.  As I have said, I am informed that 99 per cent of them become habitués of those places.  It was put to me in that connection by warders, that if they once come to this part of the jail, called the Borstal section, they <Col N="739" /> will come back to the jail, but it will not be to that section.  They will be regular passers-through of the . That is why I add my plea to that of Deputy Johnson, that the matter should be investigated, in order that all juvenile offenders should be treated in this State differently and kept in different buildings altogether from those which, rightly or wrongly, modern States have found necessary to accord to ordinary criminals.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I have no lurid past to refer to like that of Deputy Figgis.  If I had the experience he has had I am sure that anything I have got to say would carry more weight.  At all events I rise to support the suggestion by Deputy Johnson, that this is a matter that should be fully inquired into, especially with regard to the segregation of girls, because one knows that during very early life, when it is possible to make strong impressions upon them, the very fact of their being in association with hardened old ladies who go to jail has an extremely bad effect on them.  The training is an excellent thing, and I agree it should be continued, but I do say, with Deputy Johnson, that it is a very serious matter to allow any association whatsoever between the young offenders and the older ones. We are all very keen on keeping boys from contact with older criminals, but very little attention, up to the present, has been paid to the question of keeping young girl offenders away from the hardened criminals.  I am sure the Government are alive to the seriousness of this matter, and that the suggestion has only got to be made when they will inquire into it, and, if it is possible, keep the young girls and boys out of the ordinary jails.</P>

      <P>The commercial community have always taken a serious view of this matter.  In fact, they have gone to the extent of advocating, where possible, that lads should not be tried at the same police court as the ordinary offender.  If it were possible, we would say unanimously that children should be kept apart from ordinary criminals and separately dealt with, with <Col N="740" /> respect to any crimes they may have committed.  Deputy Figgis rather gives me information on this point.  I was always under the impression that Borstal institutions were separate institutions, and I find that they are embodied in the ordinary jail procedure.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Figgis said that there was Borstal treatment in the ordinary jails.  That, of course, raises the objection, we all admit, of training juveniles to the jail procedure and the jail methods.  One can appreciate that to young people there is nothing so deteriorating as confinement. The greatest amount of exercise and outdoor occupation that can be given is good physically and mentally for them.  Confining them in jail is not the best way to treat them, if it can be avoided.  I know I can say for the commercial community that anything the Minister would do in that direction would certainly be approved by them.</P>

      <P>The older one grows the more one becomes conscious of one's ignorance in many matters.  I had an entirely different conception of what the Borstal system was before I heard Deputy Figgis.  I had the idea that it was a sort of glorified industrial school, that the occupants were kept apart, that there was no contact with older prisoners&mdash;in fact, that it was an entirely different institution.  I have been entirely disillusioned.  I think it is a dreadful thing to have young people, who may have been convicted for some offences, brought into proximity with old and hardened offenders, who may be pointed out to them as great heroes.  I am glad that the case of women has been brought forward, because it is well known that when women commit crimes which are committed by men, they generally do so in accentuated form.  I am amazed that such a thing should have gone on for so long.  There is general ignorance throughout the country about this Borstal system.  I had no idea that it was of this nature.  There is nothing more important than that the moral surroundings <Col N="741" /> of the youth of the country should be looked after by the guardians of the nation.  It is for us to say that young people should not be brought in contact with criminals of either sex, because, perhaps, they might listen to tales from them of their wonderful feats, and possibly imitate them.  I hope the Minister will regard sympathetically what has been said by Deputies Johnson and Figgis and that he will consider this matter, which is one of the most important which could be debated here.</P>

      <P>Last evening Deputy Johnson suggested that an inaccurate or misleading reply had been given to a question asked by him some days ago.  I would remind him that the question was addressed to the Minister for Finance.  The answer must be read in the light of that fact.  No applications of the kind mentioned in the question had reached the Minister for Finance.  I accept full responsibility for the fact that such applications did not reach him.  The applications were based on an assumption with which I could not for a moment agree&mdash; that the conditions of the prison staffs here must remain at all times, and in all circumstances, identical with the conditions of the prison staffs in England. That was the basis of the applications and, as I completely rejected such basis, the applications were not forwarded, with any recommendations, pro or con, to the Minister for Finance. The Deputy has preferred not to go in detail into the matters which he rather foreshadowed he would raise to-day, and I will follow his example in that. But I want to make it perfectly clear, on this occasion and in connection with these Estimates, that we will not be bound by the conditions of the prison staffs in England, either with regard to their conditions of pay, their conditions of service, or with regard to the proportions of the staff and the kind of officers which we will have in the staffs of the Irish prisons.  I speak with special reference to the positions of stewards in the prison service and the posts of principal warders.  The position of steward will be maintained in such places and for such duration as <Col N="742" /> the Board think it necessary to maintain it.  The principal wardership is a post which, in our opinion, is needed only in the larger prisons.  We reject, and will continue to reject, the contention that such post must be maintained in every prison and that there should be one principal warder to every five ordinary warders.  Generally, the personnel of the prison service had better recognise, once and for all, that there is definite severance with the English prison service, that we must stand here on our own legs, that we will decide the proportions of a staff in accordance with our conception of the requirements of the prisons that have to be served by such staff, and that we are not going to be pinned or bound to unwieldy, expensive establishments in excess of what we believe the requirements to be.</P>
      <P>As to the Borstal question, Deputy Figgis, who takes such a keen interest in the question of Borstal institutions and Borstal treatment, generally, for offending youth, ought to be aware that the Borstal institute for boys is situate at Clonmel and has no connection whatever with any prison.  Consequently, there seems to be a great deal of beating the air and pushing of open doors and general futility of that kind about the remarks he made in that connection.  On the question of girl offenders, I adhere to what I said to Deputy Johnson, that the numbers are so small, that the expense of a separate establishment would not be justified.  Magistrates, as a rule, do not commit girls between the ages of 16 and 21 years, unless the offence be of a particularly serious nature.  There is segregation&mdash;segregation, at any rate, to this extent, that the girls are kept apart in a separate wing of the prison, that they have special officers dealing with them and on duty with them, and that they are not brought into contact with convicted adult females.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that they may be brought into contact with unconvicted adult females?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it does.  I think the theory that people are assumed to be innocent until they are <Col N="743" /> found guilty may, perhaps, be over-strained in that connection.  I would undertake to see what could be done to make the segregation even more complete than it is at present.  Possibly, it will be difficult to avoid some contact with remand female prisoners. There is certainly no contact with convicted female prisoners, and if the amount of contact with women offenders on remand can be lessened, or entirely removed, that will be done Generally, we recognise the desirability <Col N="744" /> of not bringing young persons into contact with hardened offenders.</P>

      <P>The net total estimate for the Gárda Síochána&mdash;that is, for the amalgamated force&mdash;for the current financial year is £1,463,976.  In the last financial year the total of the estimates for the D.M.P. and the Gárda Síochána was £1,511,882.  That figure, however, included sums amounting to £138,625 in respect of items which this year have been transferred to other Votes.  The salaries of the staff in the Metropolitan District Court have been transferred to the District Court Vote, and D.M.P. pensions are transferred to the Superannuation Vote.  The comparable figure, therefore, in 1924-5 was £1,373,257, and this year's estimate shows an increase on that of £90,719. The increase is more than accounted for by the increases in sub-heads A and B in the Estimates&mdash;pay and allowances. That increase is due to the fact that last year provision was not required to be made for full strength, as distribution was incomplete, and we did not reach anything approaching the maximum figure.  The scheme of distribution for the Gárda Síochána provides for the establishment of 850 stations outside Dublin&mdash;that is, outside the area of the Dublin Metro- politan Division&mdash;and in addition to that 850 stations, 20 stations for the units of the detective branch.  On the 1st April, 1924, only 738 stations had been occupied; 84 additional stations have since been occupied, making a total of 822, and it is hoped that distribution will be completed before next winter.</P>
      <P>We made provision last year for a total of 950 sergeants outside Dublin. This year 200 additional sergeants are included.  This is due to the increased number of stations and the necessity for allocating a number of sergeants for clerical duty in the offices of the chief superintendents and superintendents. Two hundred and twenty additional Guards outside Dublin are being provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision is being made for 30 inspectors outside Dublin, who will be allocated as follows:&mdash;One to each divisional headquarters, accounting for <Col N="745" /> twenty; three to Cork; one to each of Limerick, Waterford, Dundalk, Galway, and two to the Depôt.  The necessity for this superintending rank has become very acute, as no provision existed heretofore for substitutes for chief superintendents or superintendents absent on ordinary or sick leave from their divisions or districts, or on duty dealing with cases before the Circuit or High Courts.</P>
    <P>For the Dublin Metropolitan area only 1,024 Guards are being provided, as against 1,095 last year.  This need not be taken to mean that any reduction in police strength is being made in Dublin.  The explanation is that last year a large number of men were about to retire in consequence of the change of Government, and it was necessary to make provision for a considerable number of recruits who would be trained and ready to replace the retiring members when the latter were being released.  In fact, the provision made this year for the Metropolitan division will enable a strength to be kept up in excess of the strength at any period during the past ten years.  The growth of motor traffic, Deputies will realise, has necessitated the allocation of a gradually increasing number of police for traffic duty.  The provision made last year in the Dublin Metropolitan Police force for an assistant Commissioner disappears now, and the former Commissioner of the D.M.P. appears as Deputy Commissioner of the amalgamated force.</P>
    <P>The following shows the strength of the various ranks estimated for as compared with the maximum strength authorised by the Police Forces (Amalgamation) Act:&mdash;Chief superintendents, 25 provided for in the current year's Estimate; maximum authorised strength, 29; superintendents, 133 provided for; maximum authorised, 157; inspectors, 55 provided for; maximum authorised, 60; station sergeants, 44 provided for; the maximum authorised has been reached; sergeants, 1,298 provided for; maximum authorised, 1,350; guards, 5,644 provided for; maximum authorised, 6,000.  The total of the actual number provided for is 7,199, and the authorised maximum 7,640.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="746" /> Now I come to the sub-heads of the Vote.  Sub-head C accounts for £6,075. There is a reduction here of £14,000 on the Estimate for last year.  The formation of additional stations has gradually reduced the necessity for absence from stations of more than eight hours, and the estimate for 1924-5 was somewhat greater than turned out to be necessary in fact.</P>
    <P>Travelling expenses are dealt with under sub-head D.&mdash;£12,418.  This sub-head shows a decrease of £8,000 on last year's figure.  Transfers will not necessarily be so frequent this year, and as the bulk of the stations have already been formed, drafts from the Depôt will not be so numerous in future.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E&mdash;Clothing and Equipment, comes to £22,537.  The decrease here of over £9,000 is due to the fact that the issue of clothing and equipment will not be as heavy this year as last year.  Of the sum estimated for, about £13,000 is required for the issue of materials for frocks and trousers for the sergeants and guards outside Dublin, and 15/- per suit for having the garments made up.  About £4,000 will be required for great coats, waterproof coats, breeches, etc.  A little over £5,000 will be required for issue in the metropolitan division.</P>
    <P>Certain modifications in the existing uniforms have been decided upon as a result of amalgamation.  A great coat of slightly altered make will replace in future issues the great coat heretofore worn by police in the Metropolitan area, and the material used for summer tunics in that area will be replaced by the material used for the Guards' tunics.  The winter tunics will not be changed, and no existing articles of uniform or equipment will be discarded as a result of the amalgamation, except the D.M.P. cap badges, buttons, and belt buckles, which will be replaced by articles of the same pattern as that worn by the remainder of the force.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F&mdash;Barrack bedding, £3,195.  There is an increase in this item of £2,195.  Last year the sum of £1,000 sufficed owing to large stocks being in hand.  It is now necessary to make provision for supplies of beds <Col N="747" /> and bedding for new stations and for replacements.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G&mdash;Barrack maintenance, £3,500, a decrease of £500.</P>
    <P>Sub-head H deals with transport, £10,276.  There is a decrease of £2,495 in that sub-head.  Provision is made for the purchase of transport for the detective branch.  Each unit of the detective branch stationed at divisional headquarters will require to be provided with one Ford car, and a few tenders will also probably be required. The sum of £2,000 is included to enable advances to be made to divisional and district officers for the purchase of motor cars.  These advances are repayable by monthly instalments over a period of twelve months.</P>
    <P>Sub-head I&mdash;fuel, light and water, £17,500.  There is an increase of £2,500 here due to the larger number of stations.  Payments under the heading of fuel and light are based on fixed scales that have been sanctioned by the Minister for Finance.  Payments for water are by meter in certain cases, and by domestic water rate where such is not payable by the landlord in the terms of the letting.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M&mdash;telegrams and telephones, £8,817, shows a decrease of £3,417.  The estimate for last year was somewhat in excess of requirements, as the installation of telephones by the Post Office was not made as rapidly as we anticipated.  The Post Office has been requested to instal telephones at all Gárda Síochána stations as far as possible, but exchange facilities are not yet available in many rural areas. Telephones have been already provided in about 243 stations.  It was hoped that it will be possible to increase the number considerably during the year. The other sub-heads seem self-explanatory and scarcely call for special mention.</P>
    <P>With regard to the detective branch, when the Police Forces Amalgamation Bill was under discussion last December, I indicated that it was the intention to create a unified detective branch for the entire area of jurisdiction of the State&mdash;a plain-clothes detective branch, which would be armed, and which would deal, primarily at any <Col N="748" /> rate, with major crime.  That intention has been carried into effect.  The strength of that branch is as follows:&mdash; 1 Chief Superintendent, 3 Superintendents, 6 inspectors, 39 Sergeants, and 192 Guards.  The branch is made up of the former detective branch of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, 100 members specially selected from the Gárda Síochána, and in addition about 50 specially selected ex-members of the National Army, most of them being ex-officers. In forecasting the formation of this branch I gave an undertaking that a particularly close scrutiny would be made of the character of the men recruited for it, and I wish to mention that that undertaking has been very fully carried out.</P>

      <P>I would like to preface my remarks by saying that there is general appreciation of the good character and the good conduct of the Guards in the country.  It is the general opinion that they are doing their best to carry out their duties in a manner that is not disagreeable to the people with whom they come into contact. At the same time I want to offer one or two criticisms from my own point of view.  I think the Guards devote too much attention to petty detail, and that in some cases crimes of considerable importance have been overlooked, or, at least the culprits escaped detection.  On reading a local paper I noticed that one Guard when giving evidence concerning a licensing prosecution, stated that he measured the distance from the house of a man who claimed that he was a bona-fide traveller to the publichouse where he was found drinking, and found it 100 yards short of three miles.  I think the R.I.C. formerly measured the distance and found it somewhat over the three miles. If that is the kind of work Guards are engaged in, and if they have time to waste on it, there are too many of them there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a publichouse. We know that the number of Guards do not equal the numbers <Col N="749" /> reached by the R.I.C., but I think it was generally acknowledged that the numbers of the R.I.C. were altogether excessive.  The hope was expressed that we would be able to carry on with a much smaller force, but I see that we have now a very large force of Guards and that the total, including the D.M.P., is 7,199.  In my opinion, we should be able to carry on the work of maintaining the peace of the country with a much smaller force.  It is rather a pity that the Guards have been permanently established and that the men are entitled to retain their positions. I suppose that arose owing to the disturbed state of the country when the Guards were established.  I hope that the country will be much less disturbed and that, with the inculcation of better ideas of conduct, we will be able to do with a much smaller force of police.  In small villages throughout the country there are four, five, and, I believe, sometimes six Civic Guards, while in the towns the numbers are larger.</P>
      <P>I have had some experience of another country&mdash;Canada&mdash;and I know that in the villages and also in some of the smaller towns there would be one local policeman, not in uniform, doing practically part-time work.  He engages in some other occupation until something arises which requires his services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any serious crime took place&mdash;I am referring now to Canada&mdash;a wire would be sent to the nearest station of the North-West Mounted Police, and policemen would be sent along.  By that means a very large area of country is policed at comparatively small expense. I think there is no more law-abiding country in the world than Canada.  I am sorry to say that we, in this country, have not reached that stage yet.  I do not say that the fault is the fault of the police but rather, I am sorry to say, of the people.  With the establishment of our own Government it is up to every man in the country to see that peace is maintained.  I think that we ought to be able to carry on with a much smaller police force than we have.  In that connection, I would like to ask the Minister what obligations the State stands under with <Col N="750" /> regard to recruited police.  Has it, for instance, the power to dispense with the services of policemen if it be found that the force has become a redundant one?  Supposing it is found necessary to dispense with the services of some of these men, can they be got rid of without paying them pensions or excessive amounts as compensation?  I hope the time will soon come when we will be able to carry on with a much smaller police force than we have now.  When that time arrived it would be a pity if we found ourselves in the position of being obliged to retain an establishment of the present strength on account of obligations which we had incurred in regard to their maintenance.</P>

      <P>I have very little to add to the statement made by Deputy Heffernan.  I do not think that I should be expected to answer here for an isolated member of the Gárda making a measurement in connection with the prosecution of an isolated publican in Tipperary.  The generalisations from that incident were based somewhat weakly in my opinion. I am dealing, you see, with actualities, and not with the Ireland of Deputy Heffernan's dreams, when the policeman, like the snake, will be banished from our shores.  But in the actual existing conditions, the strength of the force is no more than adequate, if adequate. We have had to refuse applications from a great many villages through the country where there are no Gárda stations, applications in which the inhabitants, supported by clergy and others, endeavoured to make a very strong case for the establishment of a station.  We have had to take a rather stern view on matters of that kind, and to discount a great dea of the argument in the cases put for ward.  We are endeavouring, by a fairly wide system of patrols, to see that the areas are covered, and to get along with what we believe to be the minimum number of stations.  I do no think there is anything else that call for comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Heffernan' point, that we may find ourselves in the ideal future saddled with a wholl unnecessary police force, I am incline <Col N="751" /> to share the view that we are in no imminent danger of that situation arising. If it does come about, then you can simply cease to fill up the vacancies that arise through wastage, and wastage in a police force is very, very high, particularly in a young force. Men are constantly dropping out for one reason or another, some because a better opening presents itself or that the life is not the ideal thing which they thought it was going to be&mdash;standing in the sunshine patting a dog on the head.  The duties prove to be too numerous or too heavy, and they get out, or they may find themselves unsuitable. There is a constant wastage that way.  Men are dismissed for various offences and dismissals are high, rather too high, but not in the sense that I believe the discipline is too strict.  It is a wastage and a disappointment having trained a man in the depot, and so on, to find that you have to dismiss him subsequently for serious lapses of one kind or another.  However, I understand that, in comparison with other forces, the wastage owing to dismissals and reductions, and so on, is not unduly high.  Wastage of that <Col N="752" /> kind is very high in other police forces. If the ideal situation foreshadowed by Deputy Heffernan comes about, it will be easy to meet it, simply by omitting to fill up the vacancies that occur in the natural course through wastage of that kind.</P>

      <P>In regard to searches and raids carried out by the Gárda, at night time, I desire to know from the Minister if instructions have been issued that these men, when not in uniform, are to carry with them some form of identification.  We have had complaints that when raids were made by them that no form of identification was produced.  Of course, these stories may not be correct.  I would like to know if definite orders have been issued to the effect that, when members of the force go out at night in plain clothes to make raids or searches, it is incumbent on them to be provided with some kind of identification in the shape of a badge or a document?</P>

    <P>The expenditure provided for under this Estimate was formerly divided between the Dublin Metropolitan Police Vote and the District Justices Vote.  The coming into operation of the Courts of Justice Act last year, as a result of which the Dublin Metropolitan Police Courts were abolished and one District Court set up for the whole Saorstát, made it advisable to consolidate in one Vote all the charges arising out of the payment of the salaries and expenses of the justices of the new court.  In addition, the salaries and expenses of the officers of the former Dublin Metropolitan Police Courts are now transferred to this Vote.  The net increase of this Vote, as compared with last year, is £4,694.</P>
    <P>Sub-head (A) (salaries, wages and allowances), is responsible for an increase of £1,169.  The item chiefly responsible for this increase is the provision for deputy justices, which is estimated at £5,334.  Previously, no provision was made for the payment <Col N="753" /> of deputies who were appointed to replace justices who, through sickness or otherwise, became casualties, but the experience of the past year has shown the necessity for making provision for such contingencies.  This amount of £5,334 also provides, of course, for the payment of deputies during the annual leave of the permanent justices.  Where absence, whether on sick leave or annual leave, is of short duration, the gap is usually filled by a neighbouring permanent justice, but this arrangement can only hold for very limited periods, as most of the justices cannot afford to take on additional duties outside their own areas or spare the time necessary for the holding of courts in places very often remote from their fixed headquarters. Deputy justices are paid the same scales of salary and allowances as the permanent justices.  The former Dublin Metropolitan Police Magistrates were paid, one at the rate of £1,200 per annum, and two at £1,000 per annum, plus a bonus in each case, and that made a total annual charge of, approximately, £4,030.  The justices of the District Court for the Dublin Metropolitan area are paid salaries, one of £1,200 and two of £1,100, inclusive. This shows an annual saving of over £600.</P>
    <P>The increase of £3,625 under sub-head B is accounted for by the decision to pay justices subsistence allowance in respect of absence from their headquarters.  Hitherto all justices outside of Dublin and Cork were in receipt of a commuted travelling and subsistence allowance of £200 per annum.  Experience has shown, however, that under this arrangement, while a few justices were amply recompensed, the majority were at a considerable loss.  No two areas are quite the same, either in point of view of area or travelling facilities, and in order that all the justices may be on a par as regards their expenses, it has been decided to pay them their actual travelling expenses and subsistence allowance in accordance with certain fixed conditions, the details of which have not yet been finally determined. Payment of subsistence allowance is made to judges of the Circuit Court, <Col N="754" /> and this, in itself, constitutes a strong argument for the extension of the concession to the justices of the District Court.  This arrangement also involves an increase in the provision for the expenses of deputy justices.</P>
    <P>With regard to sub-head C&mdash;Transfer Expenses, £400&mdash;this sum is intended to cover the expenses which may be incurred by justices who have to remove their households from one part of the country to another as the result of a transfer.  Sub-head D&mdash; Incidental Expenses, £200&mdash;this is intended to meet the cost of telegrams, newspaper advertising, and unforeseen contingencies.</P>
    <P>The sum of £400, provided under sub-head A, for &ldquo;Probation Officer&rdquo; may possibly attract some attention.  The duties of probation officers are set forth in the rules made under Section 7 of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1907. The duties are also laid down in Section 4 of the Act as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to visit or receive reports from the person under supervision at such reasonable intervals as may be specified in the Probation Order, or subject thereto, as the Probation Officer may think fit;</P>
    <P>(b)  to see that he observes the conditions of his recognizance;</P>
    <P>(c)  to report to the Court as to his behaviour;</P>
    <P>(d)  to advise, assist, and befriend him, and, when necessary, to endeavour to find him suitable employment.</P>
    <P>I think there is nothing further that I want to add.</P>

      <P>I think there are very few Deputies indeed who have reason to complain against the Minister for Justice.  He discharges his duties with great punctuality generally, but under this Vote, there is one matter connected with his Department to which I desire to call attention.  We were promised that the Rules for the Courts, especially in view of the higher jurisdiction given to the District Courts, would be in operation last October, but so far they have not been issued.  Solicitors and others connected with the Courts have come to me and complained that owing to the <Col N="755" /> failure to have these Rules issued, things are in a state of chaos up and down the country.  I want to know from the Minister what has happened as regards these Rules which, we were told, would be put into operation last October.  The position, as regards the administration of people's affairs, is very serious owing to the failure to have these Rules issued.  People's legal advisers do not know where they stand or on what forms they are to act.  If they act on the old Rules they are not certain whether their legal rights will be safeguarded in cases where appeals may be taken.  The failure to issue those Rules has caused an amount of confusion and chaos.  I want to know from the Minister what is the cause of the delay in issuing the Rules and when we may expect to have them put into operation.</P>
      <P>What, I wonder, will be the position with regard to legal acts that may have been done under the old Rules? Will these be invalidated later on because they were not carried out according to the new Rules applicable under the new Judiciary Act, especially in relation to the increased jurisdiction given to the District Courts? Numerous representations have been made to me on this matter.  I am not a lawyer myself, but I certainly sympathise with all who are concerned in this matter if the facts which they relate are true, and if the state of affairs that exists is as bad as they represent it to be.  If what I have been told is true, then the complaints made constitute a very serious indictment against the Minister for leaving things in such a state of confusion for such a long period of time.</P>

      <P>When the Board of Works Estimate was under consideration a few days ago, I raised a question then as to the necessity for having a commercial court and also a children's court apart from the police courts.  The answer I received from the Parliamentary Secretary on that occasion was that while he was responsible for the structural arrangements of these buildings, the question I raised did not come within his jurisdiction.  I hope <Col N="756" /> I will not get a similar answer to-day from the Minister for Justice&mdash;namely, that while he is responsible for the staffing of these courts, that he is not responsible for the actual structures themselves.  The difficulty I refer to is this:&mdash;Under our new regime a considerable number of commercial cases are now tried in the police courts.  It is true that a separate portion of the day, if not the whole day, is set apart for the hearing of these cases, but then while these cases are being tried, the other courts there are also functioning, and we have all the objectionable features which surround the police courts in existence.  The objection made by commercial people is as to the undesirability of bringing clerks, lady typists and others concerned in these commercial cases into association with these police court surroundings.  This is a matter that we have raised on a number of occasions, and there seems to be a difficulty in getting the Minister to meet our point of view.  Only a short time ago I heard of a case in which people engaged in commercial pursuits on the other side were brought over here to give evidence.  When they found that they had to go into the surroundings of the police courts to prove their claims, they protested very strongly indeed.  That is not the place for commercial cases.  It should not need any argument.  It is a matter that should have been considered and dealt with before this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also urge a similar plea on behalf of the Children's Court.  This point must not be confounded with what we call the Street Trading Court.  In a number of cases children are dealt with in the police court, and must be dealt with in the police court.  It is unnecessary to refer to the details of those cases.  There are often cases for school attendance, and matters of that sort, that have to be dealt with in the ordinary police court under our regime.  It is obviously unwise for young children, accompanied in many cases by their mothers and other members of the family&mdash;because there would be nobody left at home to mind the other members of the family&mdash;to be near those courts.  The unfortunate mother, in bringing one child, has to take the <Col N="757" /> others with her.  The whole family are thus brought into the regrettable surroundings of a police court.  It should not be necessary to stress that point with the Minister.  The whole thing is exceedingly undesirable.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us on a previous occasion, when I raised this question, that a certain day or a certain portion of the day had been set aside in the courts for those particular cases.  The Minister, I am sure, realises the circumstances that exist in these police courts. You have two courts functioning, one beside the other; they are almost approached by the same staircase.  People who frequent the court gather in the common courtyard in front of the two buildings.  To say that by closing that particular court for a portion of the day, or even for the whole day, you will be separating the children from the people who go there, and detach them from the customary surroundings of a police court, is to say something that does not really represent the facts.  I would impress on the Minister that those two matters are urgent matters, and they ought to be dealt with.  I hope that when this Estimate comes up again for consideration, we will not have the same complaints to make as on this and previous occasions.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGoldrick dealt with the question of the Rules of Court not being yet available for the Dáil.  That is because the three Committees working on these Rules have not yet submitted any draft to me.  The Committees are composed of members of the legal professions, men who may be supposed fully to appreciate such inconvenience as arises from the fact that the new Rules are not yet in existence and operative.  Replying to some other Deputy, I pointed out that there is this much justification for the delay: the work of the Rule-making Committees is very detailed and technical.  The Rule-making Committee of the High Court and the Circuit Court is composed of judges who have their week's work to do and who can only sit for a couple of hours each Saturday.  The delay is understandable in the circumstances.  I think there will not be much further delay before these Rules are available. <Col N="758" /> I understand that I am likely to have them inside the next week or two.</P>
      <P>When speaking here we should use words that have some relation to their meaning and we should use words with some real relation to the facts we really profess to be talking about. Deputy McGoldrick says that the administration of law is in a state of chaos; that court staffs are in a state of chaos and they do not know where they stand.  As far as the staff of the High Court is concerned, I would be glad to believe that anything so lively as a state of chaos exists; but it does not.  The fact is, and Deputy McGoldrick himself knows it, that the administration of law in the country is proceeding more smoothly and more efficiently than at any time for many and many a long year.  Any honest solicitor in the country could assure him of that.  There is no state of chaos at all.  The courts are at present carrying on under the old rules, and they will so carry on until such time as the new rules have been considered, approved, and put into operation. There is a certain inconvenience, but it is not an inconvenience that justifies any Deputy in getting up and talking glibly about a state of chaos in the administration of the law, and a state of chaos amongst court staffs.  There is nothing so lively as a state of chaos existing amongst the staff of the High Court.</P>

They are proceeding on the old form, according to my information, and they are trying to accommodate themselves to the new situation.  In this way they have a certain amount of chaos, if you can call it chaos.  They alleged to me, in any case, that this is a matter they cannot tolerate and they cannot get on with.</P>

Possibly we would be able to give them a little more information on the matter than the Deputy seems to have.  Deputy Good talked of accommodation for courts here in the city.  The present system is not, of course, ideal, but I would put it to him that everything that seems reasonably practicable has been done.  We have asked the Board of Works to provide a separate Civil Court for the District Court, when the Four Courts are being rebuilt.  Any suggestion calculated in any way to improve or mitigate the existing situation will be considered very carefully. Personally, I do not see what more can be done to meet the position than has been done up to the present.</P>

      <P>Would it not be possible to get a separate building away from the police courts, which would discharge the double purpose of a commercial and a children's court?  I know it is not necessary to stress that on the Minister; he is quite aware of all the facts just as well as we are.  But these things are constantly coming before us, and I think we are all agreed, including the Minister, that it is highly desirable at the earliest possible moment to do something in this direction.  It <Col N="760" /> occurs to me a building might be allocated for the two purposes, a building separate and distinct from the police courts.</P>

Most things do finish that way.  There would not be any other factor than that of expense.  As far as the District Justice is concerned, it would be equally convenient to him.  It would all come down to a question of cost and whether the cost would be justified.  I will look into the position and consider the representations that the Deputy has made to-day.

      <P>I was speaking for about five minutes on Wednesday evening when the debate had to be adjourned.  I was endeavouring to impress upon the Minister and the Government generally the very grave need which has arisen owing to loss amongst livestock and to make some suitable provision for dealing with the crisis occasioned.  I was about to say that it would be wrong, highly improper, perhaps suicidal, to minimise the distress which exists.  To-day, I feel, in addition, bound to say that it would be criminal perhaps to exaggerate the position or to distort the facts in any way, or to endeavour to do anything in that way, for the sake of propaganda, to make the position appear worse than what it is.  Our credit is so intimately connected with the health of our livestock and our income is so largely derived from our sales abroad, that I ask the House, the Press and the public to have a rational appreciation of the facts.  In am informed that at the present time the publicity which this thing has received has occasioned a sort of distrust amongst persons who import stores into England from Ireland, and that people are not inclined to buy Irish cattle at the same rate as heretofore.  That point of view was put before me recently.  Of course, I was at all times conscious that it is quite an improper thing to exaggerate conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had given some statistics on Wednesday evening.  I had stated that several people whom I had named had <Col N="762" /> suffered losses, taking them at random. One man named Pat Tubridy, of Kilkee, County Clare, lost fifteen yearlings, five two-year-olds and a bull.  I can pick out others who sustained very serious losses.  These figures have been with me for some time and I am certain they are accurate as to the date on which they were compiled and as regards the localities they deal with. I do not pretend that with all this mass of figures I am putting anything exhaustive before the House or that it represents or draws a complete or full picture of the situation.  I have heard of two districts in West Clare, Lisheen and Rahona, where a number of persons lost a total of 229 yearlings, 28 two-year-olds, and 18 cows.  The position is then, without exaggeration, very serious in these areas.  The Minister and the Government can, perhaps, claim that none of the speakers so far have put forward suggestions for amelioration&mdash;nothing concrete, nothing definite, nothing crystallised, except perhaps the suggestion made by Deputy Johnson, which I propose to deal with in a moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson's suggestion was, I think, to regulate the export of milch cows and, perhaps, to restrict in a varying degree the export of store cattle. To that suggestion I, for one, could not for a moment agree.  The losses amongst milch cows have been heavy in certain districts.  Let us think in local terms, and let us segregate the fact that national terms are distinct.  The losses have been serious in certain areas, perhaps ruinous to the persons involved, but it does not mean to say that the losses amongst cows throughout the country have been appalling. You might have about one and a quarter million milch cows in Ireland.  Even if we had 20, 30, 40 or 50 thousand of a loss, that percentage does not call for such extreme or radical measures as Deputy Johnson proposes.  What would the effects be in the first instance, of adopting this policy?  You would, perhaps, bring down the price of cows if you absolutely bar export or if you put a strict prohibition on it. You would certainly bring it down, but where is the gain to the nation at large?  In addition, it cannot be demonstrated <Col N="763" /> that the gain would be material to the persons interested, who, having sustained losses, would be obliged to go into the market to purchase stock.  With this total of about 1,200,000 cows in the country at present, there is no need for such panicky measures.  It would lower, I repeat, our national income, inasmuch as no money would come in when we are not exporting any milch cows.  In addition, our ordinary internal trade would be very seriously affected; prices would go down as between man and man, and remember, there is no such thing as famine prices prevailing at present for milch cows; they are sold at comparatively reasonable prices. Deputy Johnson's suggestion is altogether impracticable, and would, in my opinion, be absolutely ruinous to our livestock trade, would confer no benefit on the persons whom he seeks to benefit, or would give very little benefit.  It is a penny wise pound foolish system.  I want his suggestion to be disregarded.  It could have no effect and can have no toleration or support, at least from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>The question of this loss has another implication which I have not touched on, and that is in connection with our national and public services.  How can you get from people who have lost their all and who, unfortunately, live in the poor counties where the land is unfertile, congested areas where a large number of mouths have to be fed, money to maintain local services?  The man who has lost two-thirds, three-fourths, or all of his cattle is potentially or actually a bankrupt unless he obtains relief; you cannot wring money from such a man. Yet, what is the position to-day in large areas?  This question of agricultural credit is so much connected, so inter-related, with all phases of our national life that I cannot refrain from touching upon this question of local administration.  The position, as I see it, is this.  The loss of stock is only one part of the distress from which we are suffering.  In years gone by serious losses were sustained, but that did not affect the capacity to <Col N="764" /> some extent of the farmers to pay, because they had some reserves.  They drew on these reserves; they restocked their land, or they spent this money in keeping up their homes.  Perhaps they lowered their standard of comfort, but, in any case, they did not face the country, crying, as it were, for bread. What has happened in the last four or five years?  It is well to face the facts; it is as well to be honest with ourselves and with the situation.  Four or five years ago, the gentleman who is at present senior Deputy for Clare, giving way to an impulse, which I may perhaps term the call of the blood, made a celebrated speech.  At that time, under the auspices of Sinn Fein, the new councils were &ldquo;elected,&rdquo; if I may use such a word with propriety, which is questionable. At all events they were permitted by the indifference or the criminal folly of the people to assume the reins of office.  That was not confined to one county, it happened in each county, and the result has been manifested in each county.  You have had inflated public expenditure, expenditure far in excess of local needs, far in excess ordinarily of the capacity of the people to pay, even in the best times.  You have had wanton, reckless waste, and this at a time when, owing to the slump in livestock subsequent to the Great War, the value of agricultual produce and the capacity of the farmers to pay had declined by fifty per cent.  In the year 1921. at the time when the Second Dáil, that most unfortunate of institutions, came into being&mdash;I say unfortunate, for they, too, contributed to it by their factious conduct; they gave us a civil war, and that contributed potently to agricultural distress&mdash;a slump occurred in a few weeks.  The nation lost half of its capital capacity in livestock and produce; prices fell fifty per cent.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever about that; it is a matter of common knowledge, and it is as well known to the Ministry as it is to me.  In other words, if half the livestock of the country had died at the time, and if the prices existing up to then had been maintained, we would have been in no worse position; we might to an appreciable extent have <Col N="765" /> been in a better one, because had the prices continued high, we could, over a certain number of years, have retrieved our position.  All economical principles were more or less flung to the wind and disregarded during the time that has since elapsed.  We have had then contributing to this agricultural distress high expenditure.  It is well to remember that the land over that period was not sterile; that productivity remained fairly high; that while the price of his produce remained low the cost of living for the agriculturist was high; the fact remains, and will, I suppose, continue to remain, that the lowest charge on the land is the maintenance of the workers thereon.  Taking that view-point then, we find that the farmer had to sell his produce at a relatively small price; that he had to pay out still on the inflated scale; that local and national services had still to be maintained; that every form of parasite in the country had a call prior to the farmer on what the farmer produced; that even the tout and the thief got a share of the wealth that he produced, and that practically no share was left to him.  That is the position.  Payments are demanded, which the agriculturist cannot give, for those services which he does not need, but which he is compelled to pay for to satisfy the demands of visionaries and men of that ilk, and it is because of this that he has been reduced to the horrible position in which we find him at present.  When I raised the question of distress in Co. Clare some months ago, the Minister for Agriculture sought to emphasise the fact that expensive county councils were permitted by us to function.  But we have had no option in the matter. We did not support a policy that approximated to revolutionary activities. In many cases I believe that these men were prepared to seize power, by force if necessary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is one of the grievances, I <Col N="766" /> will not say the fundamental one, that must be logically remedied if we are to continue, and that in the very near future, inasmuch as the public services require such a large portion of the farmers' income, that to-day a term of common reproach could be extended, both to the rackrenting landlord and the Sinn Fein county councils.  It is time, I submit, that we faced the situation honestly and bravely.  The condition of things with which we have to deal is very serious.

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will submit to your ruling.  But coming down to the position at the moment, what is it?  It is that the need for a loan, it must be admitted on all hands, is urgent and imperative on the administration.  Of course, I know there are great practical difficulties when dealing with this question.  To whom shall the loan be given?  In what areas?  Under what conditions shall it be given?  I put forward as a tentative suggestion to the Dáil that, of course, a certain limit must be placed on the money advanced to any one individual man, and the rate of interest and the period for which the loan is to continue must, of necessity, be determined, more or less, by areas; but it would be difficult to lay down hard and fast principles for dealing with the matter.  Where holdings are very small, and where the losses have been exceedingly severe, it will be necessary, I think, to advance loans for perhaps a ten years' period, and during the first three years, while this loan continues, no interest should be collected, but it should accumulate until collected at the end of the third year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in discussing it.  This will impose a most serious burden on the Exchequer, but it has got to be faced.  Every sense of humanity, every sense of justice cries out against the continuance of a policy of acute economic distress along the Atlantic belt.  You may think that, perhaps, in <Col N="767" /> many cases, in these small holdings, a loan of £50 for a ten-year period might save the situation.  I do not suppose that, in any case, more than £120 to £150 would be required as a loan, and I think £150 would be exceptional. Then you may have to give loans as low as £10 or £15.  The smaller the loan, I should imagine, taking it as a general principle, the more needy are the circumstances of the applicant.  The interest, too, must be determined, and whether you wish to charge the current market rates to them.  I submit that in the cases of the smaller people, the poorer men, a reduction in the interest should be given, and where the Government has to borrow money itself at 5 or 5½ per cent. they should give to to these people at 3 or 3½ per cent., and let the Exchequer bear the difference.  I do not know that the number of cases and that the amount of money involved will be extraordinarily high.  It is the one thing I can see that is going to restore the economic stability and bring about something like an approach to fair agricultural conditions in the West.  I say restore, for the economic position has gone already.  That, and that alone, can and must be the determining factor to guide the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>We, on these benches, ask the support of the Deputies, in every quarter of the House, to insist that a proper scheme is formulated.  I am prepared to give any experience I have had in the good work involved in such a scheme.  I want the Government to deal sympathetically with these people. Perhaps they owe them, for the follies of the past four or five years, some justice, something in the nature of restitution.  I ask them to deal very sympathetically with this matter and to enter carefully into the spirit with which we, on the Farmers' Benches, are making this appeal for justice and for aid for our afflicted constituents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this motion standing in the name of Deputy Baxter.  I am glad to say that there is not any distress, of any great consequence, in my constituency, on the ground of loss of cattle <Col N="768" /> and sheep from disease.  But, I understand there has been, and I know, to my own knowledge, that there is very acute distress existing in other parts of the country on account of these losses.  I do know that in a bordering constituency considerable losses have occurred.  I would say to the Minister that this is not an ordinary appeal. It is not the type of appeal that is likely to occur from year to year.  I think it is, in the words of Deputy Johnson, more in the nature of an unusual catastrophe, comparable to something of a type of earthquake, or something of that kind.  We had the wettest summer, followed probably by the wettest winter, in thirty years, and cattle and sheep standing on the land perished from wet and cold, and the severe strain which they had to bear through standing out in the rain in the fields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My information is that by no means all the losses which happened this winter amongst cattle and sheep are due to fluke.  A great many of the losses have been due to the fluke, but I also know that a great many cattle have died owing to the wet winter and the lack of proper sustenance, due in many cases to the extremely bad hay which was saved during last summer. I know, in my constituency, that, though there have been no severe losses, there has been a great number of isolated losses owing to the cattle being in poor condition, and I would say that though no outstandingly severe losses have occurred, considerable losses have occurred in isolated cases.  I would say that the mortality rate amongst cattle and sheep is considerably higher than it has been in past years.  The losses that have taken place in places like Clare have affected store cattle in my county.  There is a scarcity of store cattle, with the result that the prices of store cattle have gone up considerably, and those in my county who are engaged in grazing and feeding the more advanced cattle find it difficult to make ends meet, or to make a profit on the margin left them after they had bought those cattle at their present prices.  Connected with this matter of aid to those who have suffered these great losses is the question <Col N="769" /> of drainage.  I think that a permanent amelioration of the position cannot be effected unless we have some comprehensive system of drainage, dealing with the water-logged lands all over the country.  I think it is undoubtedly a fact that in recent years, possibly owing to the operation of the Land Acts, drainage conditions in many parts of the country are considerably deteriorated.</P>
    <P>The main water-courses are clogged; the beds of the river are silted, and the water remains on the land when there is no outlet, with the result that acres of land are water-logged.  This, as the Minister knows, is a proper bed for the mite or insect which propagates this disease.  Without wet and water-logged land, I understand that it is almost impossible for the microbe which propagates the disease to exist.  Part of the cycle of its existence is, I understand, spent in a snail which only exists in water-logged soil.  I would say to the Minister then that it is very important that drainage schemes of a more comprehensive nature should be taken up by the Government.  I am not suggesting that the Government should undertake the drainage of the whole country, but some considerable help from the Government and some form of organisation will be necessary so that farmers may be brought together and, I may almost say, forced to undertake drainage operations.  It is true that as the law stands, two or three recalcitrant farmers who do not wish to be progressive or to help their neighbours can hold up a drainage scheme, even though all the other farmers in the district are anxious to bring it into force.  I say that this is an exceptional catastrophe, and it has to be met by exceptional measures, and by something which will deal with it quickly and which will remedy the distress existing.  There are few people harder hit by the distress than the small farmers.  They have no unemployment insurance scheme to fall back on, so it is more than probable that there are many small farmers who having lost almost everything are living on the verge of starvation on the little crops which they manage to propagate in their gardens.  I have always been an advocate <Col N="770" /> of establishing some system of credits to meet the necessities of small farmers.  I do not say that that would meet the distress now, as it would require more urgent and direct methods to remedy it, but, generally, for the purpose of relieving distress among small farmers, I think that something should be done by the Ministry to bring into force the recommendations contained in the report of the Agricultural Commission with regard to a credit system.  The poorer a man is and the greater the necessity for credit, the more difficult it is for him to get credit. When a man has lost his stock and goes to a bank he will not get a loan, whereas if a man is prospering and has a good many cattle and sheep and wants a loan to advance his business, he will find that the banks will consider his case favourably and will probably grant him a loan.  Where, however, a man is down and out, and where the prospects of early repayment of a loan are poor, he cannot obtain it.  The banks, perhaps rightly so, maintain that it is not their business or in the interest of depositors to make loans, the payment of which would be uncertain, certainly as regards time, with the result that those in distress find it almost impossible to obtain loans.  The Minister may say, and perhaps rightly so, that it is the duty of farmers to provide this credit. I agree to a certain extent that the farmers ought to organise and form credit societies, but I think it is not possible for farmers alone to support those in distress, and I think they would have to get some backing, some support or guarantees from the Government.</P>
    <P>In France there are co-operative credit societies which are financed in their initial stage at the instigation of the Government by the Bank of France.  I am not going to suggest to the Minister what form of credit he should establish, but I say that the need is urgent for the establishment of some form of credit to meet the needs of small farmers for their current expenditure. At present they can obtain loans from the Board of Works for buildings or drainage, but there is no system by which they can obtain money <Col N="771" /> for current expenditure for the promotion of their ordinary business on their farms.  That is a matter that ought to be taken up by the Government, and if it is, I would say that it is a matter to which the farmers' organisations would give their heartiest support.  There is another matter connected with this distress which has been mentioned already, and that is the difficulty which the Government will find in obtaining their Land Commission annuities, and also that local authorities will find great difficulty in getting their rates.  I will not elaborate on the excessive rates which at present are being asked for in many parts of the country, but taking into account the condition of distress which exists, I think it is very unlikely that the local bodies or the Land Commission will be able to collect the amounts due to them in these districts. I hope, and I feel sure, that the Minister has some constructive suggestion to make.  The necessity is urgent and exceptional. We do not ask for doles or gifts of money for these people, but we ask that they be given sufficient time for the repayment of loans, or some system of that kind, which will give them a chance of raising themselves out of the unfortunate position in which they are placed, and which will relieve them from the sad, distressful frame of mind, from which they must suffer owing to the extraordinary losses which they met this winter.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Baxter stated his case very clearly. I do not want to minimise the problem. I have been receiving reports from officials of my Department for the last four months in connection with this matter, and I and those officials themselves find it extraordinarily difficult to get an exact measure of the problem.  At the beginning, the point of view of the farmers' executives was that there were no losses.  The farmers were hiding their losses.  Later on, however, they were admitted in one form or another.  One official would be told by a farmer that he lost so much, while another official would be told that he lost so much more.  That is quite natural, but that makes it difficult to <Col N="772" /> measure this problem.  I have reports from all the officers who are dealing with this matter, and in addition, I have my own personal observation and my own outside sources of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to give the House what I consider to be the measure of this problem. The following are the counties affected:&mdash;Counties Cavan, Clare, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Leitrim, Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Tirconaill, and Wexford.  Outside these counties I do not think that the disease existed to any great extent.  I should say that Leitrim is probably in all the circumstances in the worst plight and, of the other counties, probably Galway. Taking all the reports and getting the best opinions I can get, I am satisfied that, taking these counties as a whole, not more than five per cent. of the cattle died from fluke or any other cause.  I know that in special districts in these counties, more than five per cent. were affected and died.  In some districts the number was 25 per cent., and in others perhaps fifty per cent., and in individual cases, perhaps, seventy-five per cent.  I am quite ready to accept the figures given by Deputy Crowley yesterday.  Taking those counties, and omitting the other counties, not more than five per cent. of the cattle died.  There are about four million cattle&mdash;one million cows, one million calves, and two million cattle over one year.  These are rough figures.  There are about 160,000 cattle in an average county&mdash;say, about 150,000.  Five per cent. of that would be between 75,000 and 100,000 cattle. I say that is the maximum figure for cows, calves, yearlings, and cattle of all ages.  If you divide that between cows, calves, and other cattle, you will get for each county about 1,000 cows, and about 3,000 or 4,000 calves, and 3,000 or 4,000 other cattle.  Having regard to all the information I can get from all sources, I can quite appreciate the difficulty of individual Deputies, like Deputy Baxter, who have to depend on their own experience, and who have not the advantages or the experience of the officials of the Department who are at work in each county, and who get a proper picture.  I am satisfied from reports I have received that the figure <Col N="773" /> I have given is the outside figure, and that there has not been more than a five per cent. loss in the twelve counties in question.  In order to under stand what that means exactly, Deputies will have to realise that in an ordinary year there is a loss of two per cent. on cattle, and added to that normal loss there is another two per cent. in addition.  Five per cent. may appear small to people who remember experiences around their own neighbourhoods. I have come from Galway, where probably half the sheep in Ireland are.  There are 3,000,000 sheep in the country, and there would be well over 1,000,000 in County Galway. I know the district affected between Athenry and Tuam, and I know what occurred there.</P>
    <P>I put it to Deputies who come from Galway, and who are impressed with the losses in sheep in that county, that the loss in sheep was not 100,000, or anything like it, in Galway.  Probably there are about 1,100,000 sheep in the county, the total for Ireland being about 3,000,000, and in the twelve counties I have named there would be about 2,000,000.  Five per cent. of the total sheep in Ireland would be 150,000.  I think it is perfectly clear that that number of sheep did not die, and the losses in Galway did not amount to 50,000.  You would want to go well over that before you could say that anything like five per cent. of the sheep of the country died.  I cannot give accurate figures as regards sheep, but I think I am exaggerating with regard to cattle.  The fact is that both with regard to sheep and cattle you had about two per cent. added to the normal two per cent. of losses.  That is the exact position, and that is the national aspect of the question.</P>
    <P>I put the position from that point of view, having regard to Deputy Johnson's suggestion, that the export of cows, calves, or sheep should be stopped, and I also put that point of view because of the statements that have been made by various Deputies that something like an earthquake, in fact a national disaster, was represented by these losses.  It is a gross exaggeration of language to describe it as a national disaster.  There is no doubt whatever <Col N="774" /> that the normal yearly losses through contagious abortion are much greater than the abnormal losses we suffered this year from fluke.  Deputy Baxter shakes his head.  Am I right in saying that practically every dairy herd in the south within a period of five years, suffers for one or two years from contagious abortion, which runs through half the herd?  I think that no farmer from a creamery district will deny that. That occurs every ten years at least, and each herd suffers from it one or two years, that is they lose half the calves, and each calf would represent a loss of £3 or £4.  The cow is a stripper, and is worth £5 or £6 less.  There is consequential loss to a man whose cows calve in spring, and who has lost his spring calver, and on the other hand a man who has made arrangements for autumn calvers has his policy disorganised. I am satisfied that the normal losses from contagious abortion in this country are considerably more than the abnormal losses caused by fluke this year.  Remember, I do not want to minimise this question.  I have admitted that there is a problem, and it is a poor consolation to a man who has lost 30 or 35 per cent. of his cattle, to say that is not a national disaster.  But it is a disaster to the individual, or to numbers of individuals, or to a particular district.</P>
    <P>That is quite reasonable, but whether you agree or do not agree that the loss this year is less than the normal loss caused by contagious abortion, there is at least no doubt that the abnormal loss this year is of no account, from the point of view of the country as a whole, as compared with the loss that occurs year after year by underfeeding.  I would like Farmer Deputies to examine the figures.  Assuming we sell most of our cattle between two and three years old and assume that we sell between 800,000 and 1,000,000 cattle of that age each year, I say, looking at that two or three years old beast from the time he was a calf to the time he was a yearling and up to two years old, there is at least a loss of £5 a head incurred through bad feeding and wrong treatment. I do not think there is a farmer who has considered the question but will agree with that.  That loss is <Col N="775" /> not caused because farmers have not the money.  While we all admit that the farmer is going through a time of very great hardship, it should be clear that the loss is caused, not by any of the considerations which Deputy Hogan mentioned, not even by the Second Dáil, not by any poverty amongst the farmers, and not by anything which they could not avoid.  It is caused by direct ill-treatment.  Fifty per cent. of it is caused by want of proper shelter and houses.  Housing of the simplest kind will do.  That loss of £5 per animal accrues not to one farmer, but to the combination of farmers who handled the animal from the time he was calved until the time he reaches the English buyer at two or three years old.  That loss amounts to £5,000,000 per year.  We are impressed tremendously by the loss this year, because it is a personal loss, a concrete loss which you could see and experience.  But those other tremendous losses occur every year and we make no demur. They do not impress us in the least. I mention that to give the Dáil the real measure of the problem.  This is not a national disaster.  The loss, measured in pounds, shillings and pence, is nothing to the losses occurring yearly.  It is an extremely serious matter for districts and individual farmers in them.  In County Leitrim, where you have a number of small farmers, it is serious.  There you have small farmers living on poorish land and certainly not normally well off. I said about five per cent. of the cattle died from all causes.  I will not give figures, although I was tempted to give them, to show how many of them had fluke parasites in their livers.  Probably well over fifty or sixty per cent. had.  I say definitely that fifty per cent. of the cattle that died and fifty per cent. of the sheep that died were lost, not because of fluke, but because of bad treatment.</P>

      <P>I do not suggest that the Department has a record of examination of every sheep that died.  You can only examine samples and draw your deductions from your experience. All I am stating is that of the cattle and sheep that died 50 per cent. died not from fluke, but from underfeeding. That applies, of course, to cattle that died with actual fluke parasites in their liver.  Cattle, normally treated, will eject the parasite.  The position is that in a normal winter, as a matter of course, cattle and livestock generally are grossly underfed.  I tried to give the measure of that loss a moment ago. That is the position; they are grossly underfed and badly treated.  This year was a wet one.  You had plenty of hay, but it was of poor quality.  Add to that the circumstance, that in a normal year cattle are badly fed, and you have some idea of the condition of cattle this year.  I do not say the farmers are responsible for the wet weather or bad hay.  I do not think Deputies on the Farmers' benches should assume that everything said about farmers, either directly or indirectly, goes either for or against them.  We all represent the farmers here.  While it is admitted that the hay this year was bad, that the season was bad, that the keep was bad, and that farmers were poor, still there is no denying that in normal times livestock are badly treated in this country and big losses ensue owing to that. Added to that, you had the particular conditions of this year, and &ldquo;hence those tears.&rdquo;  It is wrong to say that dealers will not buy cattle at the fairs now.  That is untrue; fairs for the past three months have been particularly good.  Cattle are 30/- a head better than they were last year.</P>

      <P>I said the district between Athenry and Tuam, roughly speaking.  In big fairs, like those of Sligo, Ballinasloe, and Loughrea, where stores are bought, cattle are actually 30/- a head dearer this year than last year.  Sheep are about the same price.  It is not correct to say that land cannot be let this year. Land is being let this year at a slightly reduced price.  There are a good many causes for this reduction in price, but the reduction is mainly due to the shortage of cattle and the high prices of them.  Dealers were not operating for the last three weeks, because cattle were too dear.  The Scotch were not buying for the last three weeks, and there was consequently a slight drop in cattle.  I think the slight fall in price of grass is due to the fact that cattle are so dear, and that people are <Col N="778" /> not buying them.  That is the position generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit there is a problem which should be dealt with, if it can be dealt with.  Most Deputies have very fairly admitted that making a loan <i>simpliciter</i> is not the way to deal with the problem. There are more ways of dealing with it than by loan.  I am satisfied that it would be impossible to deal with this problem by way of a loan <i>simpliciter</i> or a loan administered centrally. The experience I have had in endeavouring to get accurate information makes it clear that it would be almost impossible to administer a loan centrally. Deputies can envisage the position themselves.  Suppose you had £20,000 available for one county.  That would buy 700 or 800 sheep and a few hundred cattle.  There are 150,000 cattle in a county in the normal way and from 100,000 to 1,000,000 sheep. In some counties there would be more sheep than cattle.  For cattle you would have £400,000 for 20 counties. £20,000 for one county would only buy 700 or 800 cattle and 400 or 500 sheep. Imagine the difficulty of any Government department trying to discriminate between thousands of applicants for a loan.  It would be absolutely impossible. There would be five times as many applicants as you could make loans to.  You would have to examine each case and rule out the man who lost stock, and who, because his circumstances were good, could replace them himself.  Again, you would have to make certain that the applicant did lose the stock he mentioned.  Then, after making the loan, you would have to see that it was used for the purpose for which it was given.  To do all this, you would require a department as big as the Department of Agriculture.  The same difficulties would arise if you tried to administer it in each county centrally; if the County Committee of Agriculture administered it.  If any relief is to be administered in these counties, it should be administered by people with an intimate knowledge of the particular district.  After we had decided that something should be done, these considerations drove us to the conclusion that we cannot deal with the situation by loan, which it would be impossible <Col N="779" /> to administer.  Our proposal is that the Department of Agriculture organise immediately credit societies on the same lines as societies which exist in the country.  They will organise them in those counties, and the Treasury will make a deposit of £1 for every £1 put in by the local people.</P>

      <P>I need not tell Deputy Gorey that I anticipated that remark. I will come to that point if he permits me.  I want to develop the matter slightly.  The Treasury will deposit £1 for every £1 deposited locally.  These loans will be for restocking, and the rate of interest to be charged by the Treasury will be low.  There need be no delay. We can organise these societies immediately. There are certain details that will have to be settled, but they can best be settled after hearing the experience of the organisers who will organise these societies.  These organisers can start immediately.  The proposal to lodge a considerable sum of money, at a low rate of interest, is to give these societies a momentum at the start, which will keep them running, so that in five or six years hence, when this fluke plague has abated and has been forgotten, these societies will be able to do really useful work in their districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gorey said: &ldquo;What about the people who have no money?&rdquo;  We are not in a position to examine everybody's bank balance, but we have some evidence which would justify us in thinking that there is not quite so much in that point as Deputy Gorey would suggest.  I have a list before me of societies of this kind which are already in existence.  I would like to give Deputies some particulars in regard to them.  They are in the very poorest districts.  Yet, in the poorest parts of the congested districts, these loan societies at the present moment are in a very healthy condition.  Considerable deposits and considerable loans are made and I want to ask Deputies if, after three bad years and after all the <Col N="780" /> disastrous ravages caused by the Second Dáil, these societies are in a fairly flourishing condition in the poorest districts of the areas known as the congested districts, is it not some evidence that the farmers can co operate with us in the way we suggest? It was said by Deputies on the Farmers' Benches that they realised that doles from the Government were not just the right way to deal with this matter.  It was said, in anticipation of my saying the farmers should help themselves, they were prepared to help themselves but they wanted some Government co-operation. We offer that co-operation. We say we will organise these societies, inspect them and audit them, and do it immediately.  The Treasury will lodge £1 for every £1 lodged by local depositors and that money will be given at a low rate of interest.  You will have, then, certain men in each district administering this fund and administering their own funds <i>pari passu</i> with Government funds.  That is the best guarantee that the money will be well spent.  You are not doing a good turn to the farmer who has lost stock by giving him a loan, even at a reasonable rate of interest, if he is not the right type of man.  By doing that, you are not doing a good turn to the State or to the farmer.  I do not say that this is the ideal way to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>But it is a situation that is difficult to deal with.  This will ensure that the farmers who are administering, not only their own money but the Government money, will see that the money is expended in the most productive way, and that it is given in the amounts which suit the particular circumstances and the best interests of the particular borrower.</P>

That is an extremely poor district.  Carrickmacross, capital, £560; loans outstanding, £621.  Westport, County Mayo, capital, £544; loans outstanding, £487.

The Castlecomer Agricultural Credit Society has a capital of £1,970; loans outstanding, £2,043.  In County Mayo there is a society with a capital of £323, and loans outstanding £301.  That is an extremely poor district.  In County Donegal, a society with a capital of £139; loans outstanding, £188.  The Crossmolina Society, County Mayo, has a capital of £175; loans outstanding, £242.  A small society like that is the ideal society for <Col N="782" /> a very poor district, with small loans and small capital.  The Mohill, County Leitrim, Society has a capital of £886; and total loans outstanding, £597.  I have a further list of societies.  I find that in the poorest districts of the area known as the congested districts these societies are in a fairly flourishing condition. If that is so in the poorest districts of Mayo, Leitrim, Donegal, etc., I do not see why they could not organise credit societies with a deposit from the Government at a low rate of interest of £1 for every £1 put up by the depositors.</P>

      <P>That can be settled.  I do not like to endeavour to rush the Department of Finance on that point. It will be at a low rate of interest.  I realise, as well as Deputy Connor Hogan and others, the condition the farmers must be in as a result of the last three years.  There is no use in simply putting up the fact that farmers are not as prosperous as they would be if we had good times as an objection to every attempt to better their lot.  It will not do.  We must keep to the net point.  This is the proposal of the Government.  It is no use saying it cannot be done, because it can be done. It is done in the poorest districts of the area known as the congested districts. That is a complete answer and there should be no sarcasm.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister say when these societies were established? It might have been possible to establish such societies heretofore, but they cannot be established in a moment. These societies are of long standing. The Minister, if he wished, could enumerate even a greater number of societies than he has read out which have failed in past years.  In my own county at one time there were several <Col N="783" /> of these societies in a flourishing condition which were capitalised by the Government and also by deposits. They are all a dead-letter now and there is not one in existence.  It will be very hard to get capital from outside as suggested by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>There are about four times as many gone out of existence.  There are a great many co-operative and other institutions gone out of existence for a great many reasons, but about 60 in the poorest districts have not.  We will not go into the reasons.  My suspicion is that the existing societies were run efficiently.  They were organised a long time ago; the deposits are there and not withdrawn.  The fact that they were organised a great many years ago does not alter the fact that the deposits are there and not withdrawn.  While admitting that money is scarce, I say that that fact is at least some evidence that the farmers could co-operate with us in organising these credit societies, when they get the very special help that the Government will lodge £1 at a very low rate of interest for every £1 which the depositors lodge, and will see to the audit and inspection of the societies. That suggestion should be considered carefully before it is condemned. Deputies have practically admitted that this cannot be dealt with by way of loan.  You could not do it. This will not deal with the big farmer, only with the very poor farmer, even if successful.  If the problem cannot be dealt with by loan, then this is my solution of the difficulty.  For the reasons I have given, I think it is sound, not only from the point of view of the particular problem which we have this year but I think the results of organising substantial, healthy, efficiently run credit societies in these districts will constitute a lasting benefit to these districts when the fluke problem is forgotten.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>On Wednesday last Deputy Johnson expressed on behalf of those who sit with him, general support of the motion put down by Deputy Baxter.  In his absence, it is only fair to refer to the suggestion <Col N="784" /> which was made by Deputy Connor Hogan this afternoon.  He referred to Deputy Johnson's statement as impracticable and ruinous to the livestock trade, and said that it was a panic proposal. We should remember the circumstances in which Deputy Johnson's suggestion was thrown out.  It was purely a conditional suggestion made after listening to the speech of Deputy Crowley, giving certain facts with regard to the losses sustained in his particular area, and which he asserted was characteristic of the greater part of many counties in Ireland.  That assertion was allowed to go without contradiction by those who would be expected to know the conditions.  Deputy Johnson did suggest that if the facts were as stated, drastic measures would have to be taken, and that one of the measures might possibly be the restriction of the export of milch cows.  That does not seem to me to be such a particularly panic suggestion, if the conditions were such as we were led to believe at the time.  If loans were given and a vast number of people went into the market to restock holdings with cattle, it is obvious that the prices would run up very high.  In such a case, and if the circumstances were such as suggested, we must all admit that the first thing that would have to be looked to, would be the restocking of the farms depleted by disease.  We have had official figures from the Minister, and looking at the matter from that point of view, it would seem that the position is not at all as bad as we were led to believe.  There is, therefore, no necessity for any such suggestion as was then made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking on the Minister's suggestion. I agree that the difficulty which would be met in dealing with this by loans coming from the central authority would be enormous, and could not, in my opinion, operate successfully. Speaking for myself, representing a large number of farmers, possibly as large as is represented by Deputies in the Farmers' Party, I think the suggestion of the Government is about as good a one as could be made in the circumstances. In view of the depression that exists in agriculture and the special circumstances of the losses farmers <Col N="785" /> have met with in these counties, I think the Government should give a higher proportion than 50 per cent. by way of loans.  Instead of giving £1 for £1, they should give £2 or 30/- for each £1 put down locally.  At the beginning it will be very difficult to find the necessary money, but an arrangement which could be readjusted later might be made, so that the greater share would now come from the Government. I think some adjustment might be made to meet the depression that now exists.  I commend the idea very strongly of using what has otherwise been in the nature of a national calamity to set up a scheme that would be of great national benefit.</P>
    <P>I look upon credit societies, when properly worked, as being of the greatest advantage to the small farming community.  I know that in many cases they have been very successful. Where they have failed, I believe that it was owing to want of attention on the part of particular farmers and want of business efficiency.  It is not because there were special circumstances in the cases where they have been successful, but because of the efficiency and the earnestness of those working them. There is no reason why they should not be equally successful in every other part of the country.  I feel satisfied that if the scheme is taken up earnestly, as I hope it will be, and efficiently worked, it will be an advantage not only for the present, but also for the future.  Owing to the present situation I think the Government ought to increase the proportion of the grant to be made to credit societies, and that an adjustment could be made in future years when, as we all hope, the agricultural community will be in a better position to meet their obligations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. JOHN CONLAN Mr. JOHN CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHN CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be agreed that Deputy Baxter's motion has been very opportune, inasmuch as it brought the Government to recognise the gravity of this question and to see that it is their duty to come to the rescue of the many thousands of farmers, especially the small farmers, who have been affected by two disastrous harvests in succession, and in the present season, by the spread of fluke <Col N="786" /> disease.  In my own county, I do not believe that any considerable proportion of cattle were lost from disease, but it is undoubtedly a fact that sheep have been badly affected, especially sheep brought from the Minister's part of the country.  As Deputy Wilson can testify, Wicklow sheep have hardly been affected at all.</P>
      <P>As regards the plan outlined by the Minister, I think he is over sanguine in expecting that £1 for £1 will be put up by the people in the local loan societies.  In some areas of the country those societies do not exist at all.  I do not know if one exists in County Kildare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to mention one or two that may deserve attention.  You would hardly think it possible that in a wealthy country like the United States it was necessary to come to the assistance of farmers, but the fact is so.  I have an extract from an American paper which states that Congress has established intermediate credit banks, with practically unlimited funds, to be used in re-discounting, at the present rate of 4½ per cent., any note, draft, bill of exchange, or other such obligation, the proceeds of which have been advanced or used in the first instance for any agricultural purposes or for the raising, breeding, fattening, or marketing of live stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision that the original note must have been discounted at a <Col N="787" /> rate not more than 6 per cent., so that it is practically giving a bonus of 1½ per cent. to the bank on the transaction. A friend of mine in County Kildare&mdash;Mr. Laurence Heffernan&mdash;to whom credit must be given, was, I believe, the first man to put any proposal of this nature before the Farmers' Party.  He advocates that weanling bullocks, heifers, and new lambs should be purchased by the Government officials and hired out for six months or longer to farmers who have lost their stock through disease, or forced to part with them through poverty, the purchase money to be repaid on the sale of the animal, after due notice to the Department, with 5 per cent. interest.  I believe there is a precedent bearing on this proposal, as under a former Government, when reinstating evicted tenants, advances were made for the purchase of stock on the advice of Departmental officials.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the situation is an extremely grave one, and that farmers are heavily in debt, that shopkeepers complain that they cannot collect their accounts, or a large percentage of them, and that the banks have practically shut down credit.  During the boom that followed the great war, if anything, the banks were too liberal in advancing money.</P>

I believe that is not the case, but that they demand extraordinary security for even moderate advances.  That is greatly hampering the farmers, inasmuch as it is not giving them the means to tide over the present disastrous seasons and establish their industry upon a proper basis.</P>

      <P>The Minister's scheme may be an admirable scheme if, as one of the Deputies said, it could be carried out&mdash;I mean on the deposit side.  In normal times, when money was flush in the country, it would certainly be carried out, but at the present time of depression I am afraid it would be very hard to finance that side of it. I think the Minister should try to put up a little more than the amount stated or a little more than he asks the depositors to put up.  I also want to know from the Minister if the rate of interest will be alike for the money given by the Government and that put down by the depositors.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that if a low rate of interest is offered to the depositors you will get very little money.  Many people will not risk their money in such a society unless there is some inducement offered over and above the ordinary rate of interest.  The Minister alluded to the great number of cattle that died from underfeeding.  That may apply to cattle generally, but in some districts, and especially in Wexford, where sheep died, I do not think the mortality was due to underfeeding. They were well cared for and better cared for owing to the severe weather than in former years.  Still, in numerous districts the herds were completely wiped out.  In a case I know of, forty or fifty sheep in a flock, nearly every one died, or had to be sold at unremunerative prices.  But that is only the loss at the moment.  In this district a great fat-lamb trade was carried on from this period.  There are no lambs or sheep this year, and that will be a very great hardship on the people who relied on that trade to make ends meet between this and the harvest.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has admitted great mortality <Col N="789" /> amongst cattle in Leitrim, I do not propose to make a case on these lines, except to say that I also agree with Deputy O'Connell that the proposed amount to be allocated by the Government is scarcely sufficient.  At least it is not sufficient for bad districts or bad counties, and I would make a plea for special consideration for a county like Leitrim, where, undoubtedly, there is at present great poverty, and there will be very severe distress if there is not considerable assistance given.  We have gone to great trouble and taken great pains, and it has been done very conscientiously, to make an estimate of the loss in twelve parishes.  The inquiry is proceeding in other parishes, but I have here before me the actual census of the losses that occurred in twelve parishes in Leitrim.  For the twelve parishes there was a total of 4,817 cattle&mdash;that includes cows, bullocks, yearlings, down to calves.</P>

      <P>Five per cent. of the cattle of Leitrim would be 8,000 cattle, so our figures are not far apart.  You have 4,000 for that district and I should say it is half the fluke district.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I could give figures of individuals but, perhaps, that would be misleading.  I know one man who lost forty head, another who lost thirteen, and another who lost seventeen.  The man who lost seventeen had altogether only eighteen head of cattle, so that he <Col N="790" /> had only one cow left.  That is a very serious state of affairs.</P>

      <P>Of course I am not trying to minimise for a moment what a loss of five per cent. is.  It is a big loss, but I think it is an accurate figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied from the Minister's statement that he is prepared to meet the situation in the best way possible, but I would urge there has been a case made for more generous treatment.  There has been a case made for the Government to step in and give greater assistance in counties like Leitrim where, I believe, the percentage of loss would be much higher than in other places, so I would ask for special attention to the conditions that obtain there.  Of course, it is a well known fact and the Minister has mentioned it, that Leitrim is wholly scheduled as congested. They are all small holders and small farmers and there is not much tillage. They have been dependent for a livelihood on the sale of young stock and the loss of the old stock means bankruptcy for many of these people.  That is a very serious state of affairs, so I hope special consideration will be given to the condition of that county.</P>

      <P>In order to bring the discussion to an end, I put it to the Minister that if he is prepared to accept fifty-fifty in cases where it is deserved, in special cases as mentioned, he should take the opportunity of giving two pounds for one, where special needs exist, as suggested, because there are cases where that would be absolutely necessary.  If you tie yourself up to fifty-fifty you will find yourself in the position of not being able to assist at all.  You must have an elastic scale to come to people's assistance where it is necessary that you should.  If the Minister would put up that proposition it would be accepted.</P>

      <P>When the Minister talks about 5 per cent. loss I do not accept his figures as a correct representation of the loss.  While we might <Col N="791" /> accept it, taking the country or the areas mentioned as a whole&mdash;the loss for a county or a number of counties might be 5 per cent.&mdash;that is no consolation to the man who lost 95 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>What we have to remember is that a great many individuals lost 95 per cent., some lost 5 per cent., and some 2 per cent., but the people we are most concerned about is the people who lost from 50 to 90 per cent. of their cattle.  The people who lost 5 per cent. and higher may have lost 5 per cent in other years.  That is not the problem.  If the losses were not from 50 to 90 per cent.  I do not think this plea would be put forward at all. The situation could be faced and met by some other means.  With regard to the proposition put up by the Minister, I recognise how difficult it is to apply a solution and how difficult it is to get anything like a correct return of the losses in any district by an individual. I recognise that at times the Government themselves have not established a very good principle in dealing with some similar problems of that kind. They got people from some parts of the country&mdash;and we may have something to say about it later on&mdash;under the impression that they have only got to make a plea about certain conditions and the Government will come to their aid and give them something for nothing.  That is one of the things I do not stand for.  We do not want the situation met by such means as that. That is not the spirit to inculcate in the country.  We have to tackle it some other way.  With regard to making loans to individuals, I see very great difficulty in getting correct returns and knowing exactly how individuals stand; what their wealth is, what their financial standing is, and all the rest of it, and the inquiries that will have to be made preparatory to giving assistance like that would be very great and would cause very great delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the proposition put up by the Minister, I look at it like this:&mdash;Go into a district where the <Col N="792" /> mortality amongst cattle is high, such as Leitrim, where you lost in a parish 400 cattle.  The value perhaps on an average is, say, £10 a head.  That meant £4,000 of a loss to the people of that district, without putting a very high price on the cattle.  A small parish of four or five hundred inhabitants sustained a loss of £4,000.  I put it to the Minister, would he expect an organiser, if he went to a meeting there, and said to the farmers, &ldquo;We will aid you pound for pound,&rdquo; to get much capital put down?  Take a man who has not lost anything.  Say he has an account in a joint stock bank, and it is suggested to him to withdraw that to get a higher rate of interest in an agricultural bank backed up by a Government proposition of pound for pound. He says, &ldquo;Oh, yes, that is going to buy cattle for someone else; I leave my money where it is.&rdquo;  The Minister for Agriculture knows that is the truth, and that that is the situation that the organiser will be confronted with.  I am afraid that will not meet the situation, and that if the situation is to be met by the Government, they will have to do a great deal more, and that they will have to offer £2 for one or £5 for one in many districts, and even then in the depressed conditions and the political conditions that prevail, they will find it difficult to succeed, and these things must be taken in account. Fortune did not decide what political point of view a man held when losing his cattle.  That occurred amongst Government supporters, amongst our supporters and supporters of other people.  What will the position be when we bring such people together to put their money into one society and to lend it out?  Who is to be on the Committee?  Who is to decide who is to get the money, and how much they are to get?  All these factors have to be taken into account, and they do not make the problem more easy to solve, but they are part of the problem that the country is confronted with.  I say in principle what the Minister has suggested is sound.  If these societies existed, we might not have had to come here with this proposition.  I believe the Minister's proposition will not solve the problem.  I am not prepared <Col N="793" /> to accept it as a solution of the problem. If the Minister is serious, he will have to go much further and endeavour to impress upon the Minister for Finance that the problem cannot be met by the proposition he has put forward.  I urge the Minister, while I do not want to press this motion to a division, go into consultation again with the Minister for Finance, and try to do more to meet the cost of this scheme or else it will not succeed.  I will ask leave to withdraw the motion.</P>

      <P>The proposition put forward is the best we can do.  Of course we have been listening to the Deputy, and the Minister for Finance has been listening to him, and I daresay the Minister for Finance keeps an open mind upon the matter, not only in regard to this proposition, but in <Col N="794" /> regard to every other, and no more in regard to this proposition than to any circumstances.  Circumstances alter cases, and if it is found necessary to do a thing differently under different conditions the Minister for Finance would be prepared to consider it. That would apply both to this and to any other proposition.  This is the proposition I make, and it is the only proposition I am in a position to make now.</P>
