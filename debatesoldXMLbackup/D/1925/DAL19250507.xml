      <P>An Inspector of the Land Commission has been engaged in County Wexford for some time past in making enquiries into applications under the Evicted Tenants' Provisions of the Land Purchase Acts, and has furnished to the Commission reports on a considerable number of these cases.  His investigations have not yet been completed, and accordingly the Commissioners are not at present in a position to say what action will be taken as regards these applications. To date, the Inspector has furnished over 200 reports, about half of which are in respect of cases in which no previous application had been made to the Land Commission.  These reports are at present under consideration, and will, together with such additional cases as the Inspector may report upon, be ruled on by the Commissioners as soon as practicable.  Such applications as may be approved will be considered on the sale of the estates on which the former holdings of the applicants are situate, or in the distribution of such untenanted land as the Land Commission may acquire and have available for the purpose.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he will cause further enquiry to be made into the case of Michael Whelan, of Kilkea, Castledermot, Co. Kildare, an evicted tenant from the Verschoyle Estate, Cloney, Athy, who has been refused reinstatement on the ground that he is 80 years of age, and that he has no near relatives, whereas it is stated that his real age is 72, and that he has a daughter living with him and three grandchildren.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference as to facts, as between the Land Commission and the applicant, seems to be a question whether he is 72 or 80 years of age, and whether he has a daughter living or not.  I am satisfied that these facts will not alter the Commissioners' decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the Minister aware that it was on these grounds that this man was refused reinstatement? That was plainly stated the last time I asked a question&mdash;first, on the ground that he was 80 years of age, and secondly, that he had no near relatives. I have his positive assurance that he has a daughter and three grandchildren living with him in a tenement house, and that he is only 72 years of age.</P>

The Land Commission cannot hope to deal with all evicted tenants and must pick and choose.  They have decided, and I agree, that this is a case which they must unfortunately rule out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether his attention has been drawn to a statement in the weekly Dublin Press to the effect that the decision to accept the offer of M. Lippens for the creation of a sugar beet industry involved the rejection of another offer from a Continental firm of the highest reputation and competence which offered to accept a much smaller subsidy; whether the alleged rejected offer would effect a saving to the State, on the Minister's own estimate of the sugar production for ten years, of about £490,000; whether in fact the price of the sugar beet crop to the farmers provided in the alleged rejected offer was not based upon but higher than the price given in England <Col N="1075" /> to the farmers; whether the alleged rejected offer was based upon a condition that the State should subscribe £150,000 (half the capital required), and whether this was done because it had been so stated officially by the Inter-Departmental Committee, and if the Minister considers it would not be more profitable for the State to accept such an offer and provide half the capital and secure a suitable price for the farmers if in the result a saving of at least £400,000 in the ten years' period could be effected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The acceptance of the offer of M. Lippens for the inauguration of a sugar beet industry involved the rejection of other offers, including an offer from a firm which would have received for sugar production, apart from other assistance, a smaller subsidy than that asked for by M. Lippens. The rate of State assistance required by the firm in question was to be equivalent to the Customs duty on sugar so long as that duty was at the rate of 17/1 per cwt., or more.  When the offer was made, the Customs duty on sugar was 25/8 per cwt.  If State assistance to the beet sugar industry here were given at the rate of 17/1 per cwt., instead of at the rates mentioned in my Budget statement, there would be a saving to the State of approximately £490,000 over the ten years' period, provided that the estimated amounts were actually produced. The price proposed to be given to the farmers in the rejected offer might in some cases have been higher than the minimum price of 44/- per ton insisted upon in Great Britain as a condition for the granting of a subsidy; but fell considerably short of the price which beet sugar manufacturers have found it necessary to offer to secure the growing of a sufficient quantity of beets for their factories. Moreover, the preposterous condition was attached that the price to be paid for beets was to be reduced or increased by 1/- per ton for every shilling per hundredweight by which the average wholesale price of granulated sugar was below or above 45/- per cwt.  The reduction in the Customs <Col N="1076" /> duty on sugar this year, resulting in a corresponding reduction in wholesale price, would have meant a fall in the price to be paid for beet of approximately 16/- per ton.  No farmers would grow beet on such terms. The rejected offer was based upon a condition that the State should subscribe three-fifths of the capital required for the proposed factory and be entitled to two-fifths of the profits; while the shares were to be allotted in such a way that the Government representatives would be outvoted in any matter concerning the management of the industry.  The Inter-Departmental Committee intimated to the representative of the firm in question that they were authorised to consider and report on offers contemplating the provision of part of the capital from Government sources.  On no occasion was it stated officially or otherwise by the Committee that the Government was prepared to subscribe one-half of the capital required.  If the rejected offer had been accepted the saving to the Exchequer, as compared with the estimated cost of the subsidy to M. Lippens would, I imagine, far exceed the £490,000 mentioned by the Deputy, as I do not believe that a single ton of beet would have been delivered at the factory in the ten-year period on the terms I have outlined.  The State would, however, have lost the capital sum of £150,000, and the establishment of a sugar industry would have been as far away as ever.  The Government is completely satisfied that it has accepted the offer which affords the best chance for a successful issue to the experiment of the manufacture of sugar from home-grown beet without casting an undue burden on the taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Minister's own estimate that the offer that was rejected amounted to a subsidy of 17/1 instead of 23/- per ton, if, say, half a crown a ton were added to that would that not bring the price over the price given to English farmers and at the same time make it a workable proposition?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the delay in the delivery of cross-Channel parcels coming via Dublin to members of the Sligo Merchant Drapers' Association, that these goods are of a dutiable nature, and that although the demands from the Customs authorities are attended to promptly the consignments are delayed several days before being finally released; and whether, in view of the nature of the goods in question, he will see that these parcels come through with all speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that any special delay arises in the delivery of parcels arriving at Dublin consigned to members of the Sligo Merchant Drapers' Association.  The reference to the demands of the Customs authorities appears to have been made under a misapprehension.  No demands are made by the Customs authorities, unless the Customs entry form for imported goods is not received within a reasonable time.  The obligation of presenting the Customs entry form <Col N="1078" /> with the duty, where duty is payable, devolves, by law, on the importer or his agent, at the place of importation, and the demand for documents relating to imported goods, and for the duty, where payable, which, presumably, is the demand referred to, would emanate, therefore, from the person who clears the goods on behalf of the members of the Sligo Merchant Drapers' Association; for example, the Carrying Company.</P>
      <P>No delay will ordinarily be experienced so far as the Customs authorities are concerned, if importers will present the completed Customs entry form promptly on the arrival of any goods, and produce the goods to the Customs officer for examination, or comply with their agents' requirements in order to enable the latter to enter and produce the goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>A claim to unemployment benefit lodged by ex-Sergeant William Doolan on the 16th April last was disallowed under sub-section (4) of Section 8 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920.  Although 70 contributions were paid for Mr. Doolan between the 8th November, 1920, and the end of June, 1922, he is disqualified for receiving benefit because no contribution has been paid for him in the intervening insurance years, and this disqualification cannot be removed until he has had at least 12 weeks work in an insurable occupation in respect of which not less than 12 contributions shall have been paid.  Section 4 of the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1924, under which a limited number of contributions are payable for soldiers in respect of military service, does not apply to Mr. Doolan, because his discharge from the Army took place subsequent to the 29th June, 1924.

Stamps put on during the period of a soldier's term in the Army do not bring him within this provision, and this provision is a complete bar to this ex-sergeant getting benefit.</P>

Meath, on the 1st January last, and was paid benefit as well as increased benefit on that claim up to and including 28th January. He next appeared at the Wexford Exchange on the 2nd February, where he renewed his claim for personal benefit and dependants benefit.  It subsequently transpired that while the applicant was in receipt of benefit at Trim in respect of himself and his dependants, he was living away from his family and was not, in fact, contributing anything to their support.  Further enquiry revealed that his wife had been in receipt of home help in Wexford on and off from the 27th September, 1924, to the 24th January, 1925, and was not supported by her husband.  Further enquiry became necessary with the view to determining the position of the applicant under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and it is hoped that it will be possible to come to a decision on the outstanding questions at an early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In opposing this resolution, I will deal at the same time with amendments which I have down to Resolutions Nos. 7 and 8.  I do not intend to debate the other amendments which I have down, because the principle involved is the same in regard to the three.  Neither do I intend to go fully into the question of protection <i>versus</i> no protection or free trade.  That subject has been fully discussed, and I do not intend to go anything like fully into it.  But my Party fear it would not be right to let this resolution pass without stating our attitude in regard to it, and in regard to the other protective tariffs imposed under the Budget.  We take exception to this resolution because we object to the imposition of tariffs.  We do not believe that the time is ripe for the imposition of protective duties in this country.  We are convinced that the effect of tariffs on certain articles will be that gradually the Government will find themselves forced to extend the system of protection and that we will not have protection on a limited number of articles but will have practically a general tariff in the course of time.  I believe that in the interests of the predominant industry of agriculture it is not wise to embark on a system of tariffs at present.</P>
      <P>It is acknowledged by the Government and by the industries that are being protected that the effect of the tariffs will be to increase the cost of the articles upon which they are placed.  The inevitable result of such an increase will be to increase the cost of living.  The increase in the cost of living will eventually come down to the industries engaged in the production of articles for export, and those engaged in these industries will find that the cost of living and production has increased, while at the same time they cannot derive any benefit from the tariffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is acknowledged that agrigulture cannot be protected&mdash;at least the <Col N="1085" /> amount of protection which it might get will be so small as not to be worth considering.  But the result of the imposition of these tariffs will be that the cost of production in the agricultural industry will be increased.  We maintain that the cost of production is already too high and that those engaged in the industry are finding it almost impossible to make both ends meet.</P>
    <P>In regard to this particular protective duty which is involved in this resolution, it is perhaps rather unfortunate that these particular articles have been chosen, because the collection of the duty upon them is going to involve a considerable amount of inconvenience and expense to the State in regard to the staffing of the Customs, as well as a considerable amount of inconvenience and annoyance to ordinary people.  To a certain extent the disadvantage of the imposition of this tariff has been cloaked, I might say, by the remission of the duties on tea and sugar.  It would be well that Deputies and people outside should keep the two things separate, because there is no real connection between them.  There is no reason why the duties on tea and sugar could not have been reduced to a considerable extent, if not to the extent to which they have been reduced, without tariffs being imposed.  There is one advantage at least in regard to the collection of taxes from tea and sugar: they are easily collected, the people are accustomed to paying them, and they hardly recognise the fact that they are paying them.  Therefore, they involve very little expense and very little trouble to the Customs authorities.</P>
    <P>In regard to the duties placed on different articles of wearing apparel, it is apparent from the discussions here that they are very involved and intricate, and are going to cause great trouble and annoyance, so that even with the greatest possible desire on the part of the Customs authorities to facilitate travellers coming to the country, they will, to a certain extent, interfere with and annoy such people.</P>
    <P>Certain estimates have been made by the Minister for Finance in regard to the revenue to be produced from those <Col N="1086" /> tariffs, and it is liable to be assumed that the estimated revenue of £520,000 is to be the cost to the people of the country.  That is not so.  In my opinion the cost to the people of the country, in revenue and the extra price which they will have to pay for the articles produced in this country, will come very near to £800,000.  If we take the imports of textiles as given in the trade and shipping statistics issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce we find that, excluding boots and shoes, the total value of the imports for the past year is something like £5,245,000.  My contention is, that on account of the duty which has to be paid on the textiles coming in and the extra price which will have to be paid for the textiles produced in this country, the cost of the tariffs to the people of the country will not be much less than £800,000.  That is taking it for granted that the price of articles of wearing apparel produced in this country will increase.</P>
    <P>I think the experience of all countries that have protective tariffs is that the price of protected articles do increase.  The probability, in my opinion, is that the price will increase very closely to the actual amount of the protective tariff.  That is, that the cost of the articles produced in Ireland will be the same as the cost of the articles produced elsewhere, plus very close on 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>We have been told that prices have not increased to any appreciable extent in boots.  I say that the experience in regard to boots has been too short and that we have not had an adequate opportunity of forming judgment on that question.  It is almost impossible, I maintain, to find out what has been the exact increase to the consumer. I do not know where the Department of Industry and Commerce got its figures, but the information I got casually from retailers of boots and shoes is that the cost of home-made and foreign boots has increased up to the amount of the tariff.  They told me in fact that in many cases the price of the protected article has increased beyond the 15 per cent. duty. That means that the Irish retailer who imports boots increases the price he <Col N="1087" /> pays to the manufacturer by the 15 per cent. duty as his purchasing price, and he adds to that his profit, so that the actual price charged the ordinary consumer is more than a 15 per cent. increase.</P>
    <P>Another matter in connection with these duties is that at present they must remain, to a great extent, revenue-producing duties.  The State has to depend on these duties for revenue, and if it does not get revenue from them it will have to get it otherwise. As a result, as these duties cease to become revenue-producing and become more protective duties, revenue will decrease and will have to be got from another source.  The Minister thinks that the productive capacity of the country will increase to such an extent that the revenue produced from ordinary sources will increase and that it will not be necessary to go in for other sources of revenue, or fall back on the taxes that were formerly in force.  That may or may not be the case.  If it is not the case, and if it is found that the ordinary receipts from taxation do not increase, despite the protective duties in force, the Minister will have to go back again to tea and sugar or some other articles to make his revenue and meet expenditure.</P>
    <P>I maintain that it is inadvisable to embark on the imposition of tariffs, and that it would be well if we devoted our attention, until the country has got into a stronger position, towards improving our agricultural industry.  We should try to produce more revenue from agriculture by getting that industry into such a position that it will give more employment.  When we have succeeded in doing that, the question of tariffs might be brought forward, and we might be prepared to consider them seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>To consider their imposition seriously.  Those engaged in the agricultural industry are constantly being told to watch and to model themselves on Denmark.  If we are to model ourselves on Denmark we will not become a protective country. <Col N="1088" /> I would ask the Minister to explain how he expects farmers to compete with Denmark with the additional cost of production that the tariffs impose saddled on them.  Tariffs are a hamper and an obstruction to agriculture, and I maintain that agriculture and the few other exporting industries cannot afford them.  Agriculturists want additional power given them in order to push their industry, but these tariffs are no help.  Tariffs have the opposite effect, and while they may produce extra employment in some industries, they will have the effect of producing unemployment in agriculture.</P>
      <P>The whole tendency of farming in recent times is to go out of tillage and into grass.  That has not happened because farmers desire to go into grass but is due to economic reasons.  Farmers have not been able to make tillage and its subsidiary industries pay.  They have to keep down expenses and cut down labour to the minimum.  Although the profit on grazing cattle is not very large, allowing for the lesser expenses, they find it pays best.  The imposition of tariffs instead of stimulating the agricultural industry, in my opinion, will have the opposite effect. This country's prosperity, I maintain, depends upon the success of agriculture, and we cannot afford tariffs at present.  I ask the Dáil to agree with me in that view.</P>

      <P>In this motion dealing with tariffs on imported wearing apparel the Deputy has dealt with the general question, because he has other motions of a similar kind in respect to other proposals.  I gather from him that he is opposed to tariffs on imports. I did not gather from him that he is opposed to assisting industries by bounties or by subsidies.  I take that to be admitted, that the issue is not the assistance or the protection of industry, agriculture, or other, but the particular form of assistance or protection.  That is to say, it is agreed that industries, agriculture, or other, should be assisted by bounties or subsidies, but must not be assisted by a protective tariff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand that the Deputy who spoke on behalf of the Farmers' Party is against bounties and subsidies, because they are protective in their effect, just as he is against tariffs?  I take it that is the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible, in view of the Deputy's speech, that the Farmers' Party may be in favour of a bounty or subsidy, but that it is implacably opposed to protective tariffs. The case the Deputy made is that the imposition of the tariffs proposed in these resolutions is going to increase the cost of production.  The emphasis was on the &ldquo;cost of production.&rdquo; Occasionally he spoke of the increase in the cost of living, but the main case he made was that this was going to increase the cost of production for agriculture and, therefore, was militating against the prosperity of agriculture. I cannot understand how the Deputy arrives at that conclusion in respect of any of those proposed duties, inasmuch as they are not directed to articles which enter into agricultural production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made, in the course of one of his sentences, the statement, that the tariffs would result in an increase in the cost of living, and that, thereby, there would be an increase in the cost of production. From that, I take it the inference is that it would increase the cost of living, that as a consequence wages would be raised, and that the charge upon agriculture would be increased. Is that the position?  That is assented to.  I find that on agricultural holdings, over one acre and under thirty acres, which for the whole of Ireland number 293,000, only 20,000 wage labourers were employed.  It will be admitted, I think, that far and away the great majority of the agricultural holdings <Col N="1090" /> in the Free State do not employ wage labour.  The cost of production to agriculture, so far as it is affected by the cost of living to the wage labourer, is not affected at all in the case of the great majority of the holdings.  The total cost of the articles consumed on farms, and purchased over a series of farms for a given year (1914)&mdash;the articles comprising implements, manures, miscellaneous stores and sundries, all covering the productive side of agriculture&mdash;amounted to an average of 16s. per acre, and for 1922 the average was 28s. per acre.  If there were a proposal to introduce a tariff, say of 20 per cent. on all those things which enter into the cost of production in agriculture, then you might have an increased cost of, say, 5/7 per acre per year.  That might conceivably mean the development of urban industries of very great strength.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy explain how he gets the 5s. 7d.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The officials of the Department of Agriculture produced to the Commission on Agriculture in great detail costings accounts of eighteen farms of different sizes in different parts of the country.  There were abstracted from these accounts all the items which enter into the cost of production in agriculture, apart from the domestic consumption which any man or woman or family, whether in agriculture or urban industry, would require.  All the items which go to make up the purchases for the farm for those two years were abstracted and compared, and the figures I have given are the result&mdash;that is to say, 16s. on the average in 1914, and 28s. on the average in 1922.  Had there been a twenty per cent tariff upon all that class of material, there would have grown up within this country a large manufacturing industry, and, consequently, a very much greater market for Irish agricultural produce.  That would be the kind of market which the small farmer, particularly the farmer within a reasonable radius of the town, would look to for his customers.  By such a means, one can imagine readily and not at all extravagantly, that the small farmer would have a possible increase of, say, 5s. 6d. per acre upon <Col N="1091" /> his output by the operation of a tariff of twenty per cent., but he would have a much greater market for his produce, a much easier means of communication, and consequently would be greatly advantaged.</P>
      <P>The proposition in these resolutions is not to increase the cost of production on the agriculturist.  Nothing in those resolutions, so far as I have examined them, is going to add one farthing per acre to the cost of production of the farmer unless he employs wage labour.  I hope Deputy Heffernan is right in his assumption that, if there is to be an increase in the cost of living as a result of those duties, he, at any rate, will support the proposition that there must be a concurrent rise in wages to meet the increase in the cost of living.  I hope Deputy Heffernan is not simply repeating the theory that if there is a rise in the absolute minimum cost of subsistence, there must be a rise in the wages, but that he will give positive support to the proposal that there shall be a general rise in wages if there is, as a result of any of those impositions, an increase in the cost of living.  I maintain there is no proposal in those resolutions which will increase the cost of production to the farmer. There may conceivably be an increase in the consumer's cost of certain articles which enter into general consumption, covering even the agriculturist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking generally of the agricultural population, I think it is perfectly certain that the reductions in the duties on tea and sugar, the breakfast table commodities, will more than balance the possible increase in the cost of wearing apparel.  There may be a doubt in that matter in respect of the town population, but in respect of the country population I would say there is no doubt whatever.  If the cost of production of agricultural produce is not being increased, then the Deputy's case seems to fall back upon the possible increase in the cost of commodities. The question then is whether the reduction in the cost of consumables for agriculture is going to more than counterbalance any possible increase <Col N="1092" /> in the cost of wearing apparel and the like.</P>
    <P>There have been proposals for bounties and for subsidies in respect of agriculture, and we on these Benches have not raised any objection. So far as they have been brought to our notice, we have given some kind of support to certain suggestions regarding State assistance for the development of agriculture.  Are we to be told in return that there must be no State assistance in respect of any other industry, that it is only agriculture that is to get the benefit of a bounty or subsidy, that all other industries must be ready to meet the severest possible competition from any country, no matter what the conditions under which the articles entering into competition may be produced, no matter what the rate of wages, no matter what the rate of exchange, no matter what other conditions apply; that every industry must be prepared to face the blast of competition to the utmost, because the farmer will be, by that means, able to buy in the cheapest market; that the farmer must be allowed to claim, and that we must be prepared to concede the claim, that bounties are required for this, and subsidies are required for that, but there must be no subsidy of any kind for any other industry because it may increase the cost of agricultural production or it may increase the price of consumables to the agricultural population?</P>
    <P>I am astonished that any Deputy, opening his speech by saying he is speaking on behalf of the Farmers' Party, should take up that position.  I have listened carefully to the statements made from the Farmers' Benches in respect of those tariffs and the general question, and I have noted considerable divergence&mdash;a healthy divergence&mdash;of opinion, which I do not decry in the least.  I think it is very desirable that there should be differences of opinion even within Parties on such a matter as this.  But now we have an <i>ex cathedra</i> utterance by a spokesman on behalf of the Farmers' Party implying that they are going to oppose any assistance in the form of tariffs for every other industry or any other industry except agriculture.  They <Col N="1093" /> may consider at some future time tariffs on agricultural produce, but in the meantime they are going to oppose any tariffs.  They have rather assented to my suggestion and, by their acts, have given positive approval to the proposal that agriculture should be assisted by bounties and by subsidies. I say that if the farmers' spokesmen, after carefully considering the position, are going to take that stand, then they are simply courting the utmost opposition to any proposal to assist agriculture by State action in any way whatever.  I ask them to face that proposition and that possibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson, in making his case for the protection of industries, pointed out that if the farmers were agreeable to allow the cost of their purchasable necessities to be increased by 20 per cent., which would amount to 5/7 per acre, they would have in the home market an outlet for their products.  I take it that that was the argument he put forward.  He forgot, however, that there is no guarantee that the home market, which is to be inflated by all these workmen the Deputy speaks of, will not be open to the competition of the world.  If he had said that, in addition to what he said in the beginning, there might have been some force in his argument.  But to say that we will have a market at our doors, while that market is an open market for American bacon, Danish and New Zealand butter, and Canadian hogs, does not represent the case properly.</P>
      <P>The Deputy talked about State aid. We are not opposed to State aid for industry.  Are we not giving 280,000 industrial workers 6½d. per week? Does the Deputy deny that?

      <P>It is a subsidy to industrial workers by the general population. That is what it amounts to.  I take up the position that if we had gone on as we had been going and if we could get the people of the world to agree to universal free trade, that would possibly be the better way to do it.  But, in face of expert opinion, in face of the report of the Fiscal Committee, consisting of economic experts the Government have set up a series of tariffs.  Those economic experts had reason on their side, as anybody can see by reading their report.  But in spite of that report, the Government have put tariffs on goods of the value of £7,150,000 per year.  I say that creates a new situation, and that we on our side would do well to reconsider our position and ask for tariffs on the £3,611,000 worth of produce brought into the country.  I am in a minority on that point, but we will have it at another time.  The cost of living will undoubtedly rise as a result of these tariffs.  That is unquestionable; Deputy Johnson admitted that.  It will undoubtedly rise, and Deputy Johnson conceives a farmer on a small holding who, because he employs no labour, will be unaffected by tariffs.  Does he think that such a man will go back to the blanket of the Kaffir, or that he will go about naked?</P>

      <P>If the Deputy had listened to my statement he would have seen that I was pretty careful to emphasise the difference, following Deputy Heffernan, between the cost of production in agriculture and the cost of consumable commodities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of production will be affected by the cost of living undoubtedly.  If a man employs labourers he must give them a higher wage, and his family will cost him more.  If he does not employ them the cost of commodities for himself, his wife and his family will go up.  We have got £1,500,000 taken off sugar and <Col N="1095" /> tea; we cannot deny that, and after all, there is a good deal to be said for this Budget.  While I do agree that we would have been better by having nothing whatever to do with these tariffs, still a new situation has appeared, and I agree to accept the consequences.</P>

      <P>I believe that Deputy Wilson is the only real protectionist in the Dáil, just as Deputy Hewat is the only real free trader. They are two unique specimens, and we should congratulate ourselves on their possession, because even when Deputy Wilson is opposing a protective duty he opposes it as a true and honest protectionist.  But I think there is a little more to be said on the lines on which he went in regard to Deputy Johnson's speech.  Deputy Johnson made the point, not so crudely as I should make it, that apparently the Farmers' Party think that everything should be sacrificed to agriculture.  Is he prepared to adopt the contrary proposition, that agriculture should be sacrificed to every other industry?&mdash; because we see this argument used again and again, used subtly by Deputy Johnson, used more roughly and brusquely by other people, that in the course of time great industries will spring up and the farmers will find a market at their doors.  How are they to live until that market arises?  It is a case of &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass.&rdquo;  There is no prospect within the next ten years of very considerable manufacturing industries springing up in this country, I mean industries that will employ from 500,000 to 1,000,000 people.  In the meantime, the farmer will be put to a disadvantage in the open free market to which he now sends most of his products.  He will be put to the disadvantage of competing with Denmark, New Zealand, and Australia, with all these countries that are pouring their products in here.</P>

      <P>What is the cost of production?  The cost of production is the cost of the maintenance of the farmer's sons and daughters who work on his holding without wages but who have to be fed and clothed.  That is the real cost of production in agriculture in the Saorstát; Deputy Johnson knows it, and every Deputy knows it. The bulk of the small agricultural holdings are worked by the farmer's own family, and wages are a very small item.</P>

      <P>I am going to follow Deputy Johnson's bad example with one hypothesis, and I am going to imagine a meeting, about which there has been correspondence, between the Minister for Finance and his opposite, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer. After they had transacted their business the British Chancellor of the Exchequer would almost certainly say to the Minister for Finance, &ldquo;You are very lucky in your Labour Party; ours are most unreasonable people.  The minute I begin to tax clothes, even though I only tax silk stockings, they become angry.&rdquo;  He would go on to say, &ldquo;You know what the late Chancellor <Col N="1097" /> of the Exchequer said to me, that my name would go down to fame as the Chancellor who had taxed the girls' silk stockings.&rdquo;  And I think the Minister for Finance would thank Heaven that he had not Mr. Snowden in the Dáil, because if he attacked the Chancellor over one small article of apparel, he would certainly attack our Minister for Finance for having taxed everything else that the girl wears, every stitch that her brother and sister wears, and every stitch that the little children wear.  Then there would be a slight reciprocity, and the British Chancellor of the Exchequer would say: &ldquo;At any rate, I shall be able to get my own back, because if silk stockings are taxed the people need not wear them.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance cannot say that.  He cannot say that the people can dispense with all the articles of clothing that are included in this resolution unless he has confidence in his prophecy that we are going to have a fine summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard various arguments with regard to the effects of these tariffs on the cost of living.  Deputy Esmonde&mdash; I am sorry he is not here&mdash;reminded me that that could be avoided, that the cost of living need not necessarily go up if people bought Irish-manufactured goods.  To what extent are the Saorstát industries able to supply the needs of the country?  There are at the present time in the Saorstát firms manufacturing wearing apparel who employ 3,233 persons.  That does not include dressmaking and millinery.  We may say that it only includes firms that clothe men, and leave the women's side out of it altogether.  Suppose that this industry expands and increases, as we may hope, as I think we all, even the Farmers' Party, hope, does any Deputy consider it possible that it can more than treble the number of employees in the present year; that at the end of the year there would be more than 10,000 people employed in it, and that at the end of two years there will be more than 20,000?  Set against that the million and a half inhabitants of the Saorstát who will be affected by this tax, are you not fostering a small thing to the injury of the big thing? Are you not carrying the tax-gatherer <Col N="1098" /> into the ordinary home life of the people?</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson said that it was possibly a doubtful proposition whether the remission in the cost of living would not be equalled by the increased cost in the case of town dwellers.  Take another instance.  Take the remission, not as between town and country&mdash;because I represent both town and country&mdash;but as between the father of a family, who has to buy four or five suits of clothes for his children in the year, and the bachelor.  The amount of tea consumed by children is comparatively small if the parents are wise.  It is not every child who has the powerful physique and mental ability of the Minister for Education, and who can drink tea five times a day.  That remission is not of great value as far as the children are concerned, while the duty is heavy on clothing, suits, and everything the child wears.  Children are very destructive things, and as Deputy Redmond said yesterday, we are discouraging marriage and the family.</P>

      <P>I hope we may find a job for the daughter.  That is one factor, as I said last night, in discussing the duty on handkerchiefs.  I would be prepared not to oppose a duty which promises to find employment.  We are, at the outset, promising to find jobs for 5,000 daughters, and we are taxing something like 50,000.  I think there is a lack of proportion in that&mdash;5,000 daughters only in this year.  I do not think anybody will say that the industry will expand more than that; it cannot do it.  It stands to reason that it cannot do it; there is not enough machinery, plant and skilled men, cutters-out, and people of that kind.  What will happen will be that we may, as Deputy Johnson said, find a job for the daughter, but find a job for the daughter in a sweated workshop, stitching together readymade garments that have been cut out in England, because that is what will happen.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry if anything that I have said has irritated Deputies on the Government Benches. It is not my intention ever to be provocative, but I do feel that what I said about this tax is going to have that effect except in the case that Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll spoke of, and that is because there is not the necessary skill and ability by which people could make up their clothes at home. That will only apply to a few cases. In other homes this duty on readymades will inflict great hardship, at any rate for the next two or three years.  It will take a great deal of time to adjust ourselves to new conditions, and I am afraid that before we have adjusted ourselves to the new conditions we shall have a General Election and the Government may feel the result of a good deal of this irritation. Honestly I would regret that.  I would regret if the Government were thrown out, because I do not think the Farmers' Party will be returned to take its place.  That is really my basic objection to these duties.  I think they are an error and that the Minister would do better to leave them out.  If Deputy Heffernan goes to a division on this amendment, I will support him.</P>

      <P>I only just want to remark that I am satisfied that Deputy Heffernan was <Col N="1100" /> absolutely wrong in his statement about the price of boots having been raised since the imposition of the duty on imported boots.  I do not think that anybody in the Dáil is keener about getting value for his money than I am, and I ought to be in a position to know if the price of boots has been raised since.  Even before the imposition of these taxes I had made a point to buy Irish-made boots, not for any sentimental motive, but because they were just as good as the foreign boots.  I buy on an average a couple of dozen pairs of boots in the year, and am quite satisfied that there has been no increase in the price since the tax was imposed a year ago.  On the contrary, I know that there has been, if anything, a decrease in the price of these boots.  I cannot at all agree with Deputy Bryan Cooper in what he said or insinuated, that the women of Ireland or that the majority of the women of Ireland would suffer by these taxes. They will not suffer by these taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the ordinary family through the country, and in every case you will find that what they will gain in the remission of the duties on tea and sugar will more than counter-balance what they will have to pay in the way of duties on ready-made clothing.  Even if they did have to pay a little more I am sure that they would all be prepared to make a little sacrifice for the unemployed women of Ireland.  There can be nothing more heartbreaking for the fathers and mothers of families than to find after they have brough up their families, and when the children reach fourteen or fifteen years of age&mdash;when they are about leaving school&mdash;that there is absolutely no chance of their getting any employment in their own country.  I know hundreds of girls who can make up this clothing and who have sufficient technical skill to cut them out as well. It is not at all beyond the bounds of possibility to get a sufficiency of skilled cutters in this country for cutting out these garments, and there would be no difficulty at all in finding plenty of girls to make them up.  I cannot agree with Deputy Cooper that the community will suffer by these taxes.  I see in these duties immense <Col N="1101" /> possibilities of opening up new avenues of employment in this country for our girls and women, and, as I said on the Budget, I think we all owe the Minister for Finance a great debt of gratitude for putting on these protective tariffs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this at all, but three remarks that have been made render it necessary that I should.  Deputy Heffernan makes a contrast between the methods employed by the Department of Industry and Commerce to collect facts for fixing the cost of living index number &ldquo;in whatever way they were arrived at&rdquo;&mdash;that was his phrase&mdash;&ldquo;and casual inquiries that I have made.&rdquo;  If that is really the foundation of the Deputy's speech&mdash;casual inquiries about whatever method the Department used to investigate a certain question&mdash;I do not think his details can be considered to have been founded on a good basis.  Deputy Cooper talks of the impossibility of the Irish trade in apparel meeting the demand, and he has introduced two other questions&mdash; the question of sweated wages and the question of a sufficiency of skilled labour.  He makes the deduction that there is not a sufficiency of skilled labour because Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll has asserted that there are advertisements now appearing in the Press for dressmakers.  Well, that is the most easy-going deduction that has been ever made in this House since I entered it.  Because, he tells us, the fact that advertisements appear in the Dublin newspapers for dressmakers proves that skilled dressmakers cannot be found in the country&mdash;because those advertisements appear for skilled dressmakers, therefore that is a proof that skilled dressmakers cannot be found in the country.</P>

      <P>I can leave that point with this remark, that there were about 1,200 machines&mdash;I am taking one thing only, ready-made clothing&mdash;employed for about a quarter of the time. We have therefore still to absorb all these skilled hands who are available, and to keep these machines going full time.  We have certainly that amount of skilled labour to go on with, and my information from the trade, backed by every conceivable manufacturer, is that there is no scarcity of skilled labour in the ready-made clothing industry.</P>

      <P>I am taking that as the biggest example.  It is the biggest item of the Budget tariffs.  I do not say that what I say on that will rule with regard to the other things. I said here last night that on the matter of umbrellas it did not rule.  That is a very small matter, but I urged that on the basis that it was going to give a certain relief here and was not going appreciably to raise the cost of living. Now let me get back to the ready-made clothing.  There is a sufficiency of skilled labour as far as ready-made clothing is concerned.  As regards wages and sweated conditions, there are Trade Boards operating with regard to the ready-made industry, and the wages paid are above the minimum Trade Board rates.  The Trade Boards were specially and specifically set up so as to preclude sweating.  Therefore, so far as sweating is concerned I think that point has been met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that would be the most acceptable definition to the farmers.  I do not pretend that it is a definition, because I do not believe all that the farmers say about sweated conditions in their own industry. As to whether we can or cannot cope with the demand I have some figures here to which I wish to call attention.  There are about sixteen ready-made clothing factories in the Free State, and there are installed about 1,200 machines.  There is provision <Col N="1104" /> already made for the installation of at least 2,000 machines.  You have to get down to unit figures here, and for that purpose we take as the unit one suit equalling two overcoats from the point of view of production.  That is the way the matter is looked upon in the trade.  The understanding is that each machine can turn out either two suits per day or four overcoats per day.  If you take the total number of machines operating in the Saorstát before the Budget was introduced as 1,200, this number can be increased without any difficulty to 2,000.  Take the figure as 1,300&mdash;that is only an increase of 100, where there could be an increase of 800, and it is obviously a minimum&mdash;these factories could turn out in one year either 780,000 suits or 1,560,000 overcoats.</P>
      <P>Last year we imported boys' and men's garments to the value of £800,000 and overcoats to the value of a quarter of a million.  That gives you a total of £1,050,000.  It is estimated that the actual production in the Free State in 1924, as well as these imports, was either 100,000 suits or 200,000 overcoats.  Taking these on an average as costing £1 per suit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>They were working on half-time and on quarter-time. If you take the figures I have given&mdash; taking the unit as one suit being equal to two overcoats and at the cost of £1 &mdash;you get 1,050,000 suits, and adding to that the estimated home production of 100,000 suits you get a total consumption of 1,150,000.  The existing factories can instal up to 2,000 machines and these machines producing at the rate of two suits per day gives a production of 1,200,000 suits.  Last year the consumption was 1,150,000.  On these figures I do not see why anyone should be pessimistic as to the ability of the <Col N="1105" /> ready-made clothing trade to meet with the demand.</P>

      <P>I have not the figures worked out with the same detail or on the same lines for hosiery.  I should say, however, that the installation of machinery for the manufacture of hosiery is somewhat more expensive than the installation of machinery for the manufacture of ready-made clothing. But I can say this, that there is not the slightest doubt as to the total consumption being met within a year in this country.  I do not mean that we will have to wait until the end of twelve months before we are in a position to deal with the demand at home by home production.  I do believe, if what is put to me be correct, that there is a possibility of increasing the export trade that there used to be.  There used to be quite a considerable export trade in hosiery which fell away during the war, but it is taking up again, and I say that can be increased enormously. I do not pretend that the figures I have for the wholesale clothing trade can rule there, but it is undoubtedly the biggest item in the whole tariff.  I give these figures for what they are worth, and I say that the three points which Deputy Cooper made are met by those figures and that we certainly can cope with the demand, that the wages are not on any sweated basis, and that there is no lack whatever of skilled labour.  If these points be met, and these are only specific points in the case which Deputy Heffernan might have made but did not make and on which it could have rested, then I hold that his case disappears.</P>

      <P>But it is the value of the imports that is the important point.  I hold that my calculation is still right that the ready-made imports were about £1,050,000, as the Minister said, while the imports of other clothes, not including hosiery, were £2,750,000, and the tariff charged is charged on the value.</P>

      <P>That, of course, gets us into the question of ladies' clothing.  I dealt with one aspect of that last night, on the question of hats, and what was said on hats last night will, in general, rule with regard to costings for ladies' clothing.  It is not so much a question of having to fight against mass production, because mass production cuts at the root of what is required in ladies' clothing.  It sets out the pattern which is a copy and copyable, and also what is not required as far as this country is concerned with regard to the import of clothing for women; what actually is required is taste and design.  I am not sure that that can be supplied right away.  Deputy Good did make the point that we could make allowances for models in the way of costumes coming in and for skilled labour being trained in the Technical Schools.  Provision of that kind may have to be made, but as to a much more difficult question, as far as the people who are mainly concerned, the people about whom those on the Farmers' benches are concerned&mdash;the farmer's sons and daughters&mdash;I say they are going to be met by the wholesale clothing trade. They are definitely going to be met by that, and can be met by that.</P>

      <P>There was one point in Deputy Heffernan's argument that I do not remember was met in the debate that followed, and is a matter of some importance to the farmers of this country, and through the farmers to the country generally and the whole community.  It was his suggestion&mdash;and I want to be very careful not to misinterpret anything he said&mdash; if I understood him correctly, that the effect of protective duties would be to put land out of tillage and increasingly into pasture.  I think that was the tenour of his argument, and that <Col N="1107" /> was the impression conveyed to my mind.  What are the actual facts as they exist in history in regard to this very matter?  Is it not a fact that land going out of tillage and into pasture was directly, in this country and Great Britain, the effect of free trade and the passing from protection to free trade?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument is not weakened by the interjection that Deputy Heffernan has made. It is strengthened by it.  We are entering upon an adventure, and the Minister for Finance frankly admitted it to be an adventure into the future.  It can be quite reasonably contended against what I am now arguing that the production of things that have occurred in the past may not prove an effective guide in the future.  But in any case let us be perfectly clear as to what was the effect in the past, and what are the actual facts, as we have them before us.  It is a fact not only in Ireland, but in Great Britain also, that the passing of land out of tillage into pasture was the effect of free trade, and, consequently, the land remains in pasture and there is no very great tillage.  It is also a fact that those countries that have turned from what is known as a free trade policy to a protective policy, have been countries that have gone back from pasture to tillage which that changed. That is a fact.  There is Germany and the United States, but we need not go outside our own country.  Go back for the last two centuries, and it will always be found when there was a measure of fiscal policy of a free trade character prevailing in this country that was the period when you had land in pasture, and when the contrary prevailed, as under Grattan's Parliament, that was the time you had a very greatly increased amount of tillage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have stated, and as the Minister for Finance stated, in introducing these duties, they are put forward in the nature of an experiment, and if that experiment proves not to have <Col N="1108" /> been accurate it will be possible to change them, and, as I have already said, an argument produced from the past may not be an argument that will be justified by the future.  But in any case let us look at this thing as it occurs, and let us see what is the effect, and if the introduction of a free trade policy has meant the introduction of a system of land going into pasture on a large scale, and if in every country, without exception, that I know or can call to memory at this moment that has passed from free trade policy to protection policy, land has gone increasingly out of pasture into tillage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The fact, nevertheless, remains.  Take a modern example&mdash;I am asked by Deputy Sir James Craig what exactly the point is. The immediate point is to offset the argument put forward by Deputy Heffernan that the introduction of those duties would mean that land would go more and more out of cultivation and into pasture.  That may or may not prove to be the case.  We cannot tell. But if it does prove to be the case, it will be contrary to the experience of other countries in the same matter.  If the experience of other countries is to be any kind of a criterion for this country, the effect of these duties will be that land will pass out of pasture into tillage, contrary to the argument put forward by Deputy Heffernan.</P>

Very few of us ever believe anything Deputy Figgis says in this House.  If the cause of land going out of cultivation was what he said, if he said that we are now part and parcel of the English fiscal system and that by what we now propose to do we would reverse that and revert to protection against the British Isles, it would be perfectly sound.  But he forgot to mention that our market is in <Col N="1109" /> England.  It is absolutely dishonest to be making these arguments.</P>

      <P>Only a small proportion pay wages to people other than their own families.  The greater part of the agriculture of the country is carried on by farmers, assisted by their own families.  They pay no wages to their families.  Only a small amount of pocket-money in the week is given, and sometimes there is no pocket-money at all.  A very modest outfit is given to farmers' children in the way of clothing, and it costs very little in most parts of Ireland, for the simple reason that the farmers cannot afford it.</P>

He suggests that even the little comforts they have at the moment, and the little pocket-money that is given to families instead of wages, should be affected.  That is his argument.  He has been trying to make capital as against the Deputies on the Farmers' benches and that is the actual argument that he has been using. Apart from the personal aspect, and <Col N="1112" /> taking the big broad view that some Deputies have asked us to take, anybody listening to the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, when he was taking item for item of our agricultural produce, cannot but agree that he was proving to the House that not one item of that can be protected.</P>

      <P>Listening to the Minister making the Government case, based possibly on the information of his staffs and on the expert information at his disposal&mdash;not, of course, with the assistance Deputy Wilson could give him&mdash;one was given food for thought and must come to the conclusion that this is a country that cannot protect its agriculture.  It is my own opinion.  Almost altogether our market is outside our jurisdiction.  We cannot touch it; we cannot interfere with the system.  I have heard that statement made; it was my own opinion, but I am now convinced all the more.  I ask Deputies is it any wonder that the farmers here, and the farmers in the country, are very much concerned about impositions that we all know they will ultimately have to pay? The question has been asked: &ldquo;Are the farmers going to pay any more in wages?&rdquo;  That would be direct payment out of the farmers' pockets.  I say, and every farmer must admit, that in addition to direct payments, all the indirect payments must come out of the main industry.  There are very few exports irrespective of the agricultural produce that is exported, and therefore in the long run, everything can be traced back to the main industry, agriculture. The wages of the labourer in this city, the profits of the businessman in this city, and of business-men all over the provinces, all come back ultimately to agriculture, and the cost has to be borne by that industry.  I <Col N="1113" /> do not think in the circumstances anyone can wonder at our view-point on this question.</P>
      <P>I do not like the argument that I have also heard here that prices will not be, and have not been, increased.  That is misleading.  I was going to say it is dishonest, but I prefer to say it is misleading, because Deputies have objected to the word dishonest.  No rise in price is reasonable. If prices here kept pace with the sweeping reductions outside the Saorstát, there would be no rise.  If, within the last 12 months, prices here kept pace, even in proportion, with the reductions outside the Saorstát, the outlook would be very much different. I assert that the prices here are almost 50 per cent. higher for boots and clothing than the prices in England, even without this impost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the tariff is in addition to that.  It is not due to the tariff.  It is due to the conditions here that, perhaps, Deputy Johnson could have helped to remedy.  I have often told him that across those Benches. Will the Department concerned with this, the Ministry of Finance, see that some proportion is maintained between the prices here and outside the Saorstát, and that there will be no increase in prices?  Will the Minister see that there will be a proportion between the prices here and the prices obtaining outside the Saorstát?  It is very easy to find out the brand of what is sold here, and it is easy to compare the price with what is charged elsewhere. It is easy to know the price of ready-made clothing here and the price outside the Saorstát.  Ready-made clothes nearly all bear the brand in regard to quality and grade, and the names of the firms manufacturing them.  Will the Minister see they are sold here with only a 15 per cent. difference compared with the English price, or even anything approaching a 15 per cent. difference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are some of the matters we want a declaration on from the Government Benches.  We want to know that there will be no increase in <Col N="1114" /> price.  Does anybody want to establish the fact that the present prices should be maintained for all time in the Saorstát, regardless of prices outside? I want the Dáil to take cognisance of outside prices, and these prices and the prices here ought to bear some relation to each other.  I know there have been sweeping reductions last year and the year before in prices, but we saw very little of them in this country. We are opposed to this tariff because we believe that, with one exception, the Minister's statement was reasonably right&mdash;that this country is not in a position to protect, except to a very limited degree, the many articles produced in the agricultural industry, and it is only in a very limited degree we are able to protect a few.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has tried to convince the House that the farmers are going to be driven once again into bankruptcy if this resolution is passed.  As far as my experience goes, I think this imposition will press more lightly on the farming community than on any other section, for the reason that the majority of farmers and of farmers' sons do not wear ready-made clothes.  They buy Irish tweed and get their clothes made to measure in their own country.</P>

      <P>I am not going to say anything about the Strand suit, that Deputy Davin referred to last night.  What I have said is a fact, and if it is a fact, as Deputy Gorey admits, how does he say that this resolution is going to hit the farmer more than anybody else?  As far as I see it is the other sections of the community who should be bombarding the Minister for putting extra cost on their clothes, not only to help industry, but to give a very handsome bounty or subsidy to the farmer, because that is what it amounts to.  As far as I see, <Col N="1116" /> no other section benefits as the farmers do.  The thing is not genuine.  The farmers are opposing this resolution because they think they must do it on principle, not because they think it is not going to be a benefit to themselves or to the industry of the country&mdash;either that or they are afraid that as a result of the help given by this Bill to industries the time will come when they will not be able to come in here with the usual claim that they are representing the dominant industry in the country.</P>

      <P>I will be told by Deputy Gorey, of course, that the reason agricultural produce in this country cannot compete with the agricultural produce of other countries is because of high wages, from £1 to 25/- per week.  High wages!  I think, as I said in the beginning, that the farmers are not sincere and earnest in their opposition to this resolution. They are simply opposing it because they feel it is their duty to do so.  I think instead of this being an added burden on the farmers that they are going to come out more on the right side as a result of the Budget than any other section of the community.</P>

      <P>I came in just in time to say to Deputy Morrissey that if things go on as they have been going on we will not be found in this country when the next Budget comes up.  I have just met by accident a deputation in the hall of this House.  I met a man there whom I met in another part of the world a few years ago, and I met him here for the first time to-day.  He is up here with a deputation from the Midlands to the Government.  They are being pressed by the Government to pay their rents, although all their cattle and sheep are dead.  I heard that story in the hall just now.  He said they had come up, but they have nothing to get. I said I was amazed to hear a story like that coming from the Midlands, but he said that it was quite true. When Deputy Morrissey and some others in this House talk about present conditions they are talking about something they do not understand.  I am very often inclined to think, when I hear this question of tariffs boosted, that Dublin is the main concern.  You <Col N="1118" /> sometimes think there are many people inclined to shout, or if not to shout to take action which means, &ldquo;Up Dublin, let the country go to the dickens.&rdquo; There is no doubt, and we are not going to deny it, that these tariffs will have the effect in Dublin of giving employment to a certain limited number of people.  We admit that.  There are, I think, 46,000 unemployed in the country to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>There are more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey says that there are more.  I am going to suggest that if the policy that is being pursued is continued there will be more than 46,000 unemployed this time next year.  I say, on the other hand, that a corresponding effort on the part of the Ministry to organise or stimulate production in the agricultural industry will do far more to absorb the unemployed than the methods that they have adopted.  No one will claim that the 46,000 unemployed, whom we have, and the others whom we are going to have, are technically trained and capable of going into technical trades, and taking their part there.  Nobody can make that claim on their behalf.  Most of our workers are unskilled labourers, and there is more scope for them in agriculture than in the sort of industries you are trying to establish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If productivity in agriculture can be stimulated, it can absorb many more. There is any amount of room for development and expansion, and you will not have to adopt the methods of protection which you afford to these industries you are trying to bring into existence. You can get them by other means, and, at the same time, you will bring into existence these other industries, because any increase in productivity in agriculture, any betterment of the conditions of the farmers of the Saorstát, will give employment, will mean the spending of money, and will give a stimulus to industry in the towns and a few cities.  If you want to bring these industries into existence, and make it possible for them to live, there is one way, and, so far as I see, one way only of doing it, and that is to <Col N="1119" /> make it possible for the farmers to do something more than merely eke out a bare existence, to make it possible for them to live, and then they will bring other industries into being.</P>
    <P>Until you do that you will have to breathe artificial respiration into the lungs of these industries, and to continue that policy.  What will be the effect?  The effect will be, as I stated the other day, that you will bring them into existence and put us out of existence. Beyond doubt, the serious condition of agriculture to-day can hardly be realised.  There will be no trouble whatever in tempting people from the land.  I know that there is a difference of opinion on this very big question, and it is right, perhaps, that there should be an honest difference of opinion.  Deputy Johnson is as honest in his opinion, I am sure, as I am in mine, but I fear, and I am convinced, that you are not going the right way about bringing new industries into existence.</P>
    <P>There is really only one industry, and there is any amount of room there for development by organisation and by better methods of education, rather than by a system of protection that will not protect.  If you improve our condition, the condition of others will improve correspondingly.  There are too many difficulties in the way of trying to make these industries live here, and it is very problematical whether your efforts will be successful, as, no matter what anybody says, the prices of commodities here are, and will be, regulated by world prices.  Whether it be ready-made clothing or anything else, the price of such commodity must, at all times, be affected and regulated by the price in the world's market of such commodity.  We know how easy it is to change the price of an article in this country.</P>
    <P>We know how the financial markets of the world affect our prices and markets here.  We know what a slight alteration in the rate of exchange may mean to our prices, and as regards what we can sell at an economic price as producers.  Our rate of exchange may be unfavourable to another country which is trying to produce the same <Col N="1120" /> articles as we are producing.  We have a certain tariff on manufactures to enable them to compete on equal terms with foreigners, and, if the exchange is in our favour, in a sense our money will be more valuable than theirs.  The proposed tariff will not be sufficient when that change comes about to protect our industries.  What is the position then?  When an industry is brought into existence on the supposition that tariffs are to be imposed to help its existence, the Minister has to go along and raise the tariff wall still higher.</P>
    <P>There is no tariff wall to protect us. We have to buy in a protected market, and sell in an open market against the foreigner, who is buying in an open market.  I do not think it can be argued from any point of view that tariffs are a sound practical way of bringing industries into existence, and enabling them to live.  I believe, on the other hand, that they sap the energy of many of the people who are interested in these industries, who have a share in them, and perhaps the same applies to the workers.  Industries are to-day crying out for protection, and on their behalf people are coming and, I dare say, plaguing the Minister to extend shelter to them, but these people, both workers and managers, would be better employed using their brains in trying to find a solution of the problem which is confronting them.</P>
    <P>By all means, where the State can aid or assist these men by placing technical advice at their disposal, and assist them in a better organisation of their industry&mdash;and there is room for that&mdash;let the State do it.  No one will stand against that, but I feel that when you come along and give help of another kind to people, who are standing aside and who are waiting to see what protection the Ministry is going to afford them, you are destroying the initiative of such people. If the country is to exist it must recognise that it must stand on its own legs, and try to get an air of independence. People in industry must recognise that they must cut their cloth according to their measure.  If people worked harder and turned out better work, things would improve.  We have to <Col N="1121" /> make sacrifices to meet the situation. I cannot see that any other way is the right and proper way for this State. You may at the moment give a temporary stimulus to some branches of the agricultural industry.  That will not be lasting, and it is not sound if it is not lasting.</P>
    <P>That is not the proper way to go about it.  You will, I concede, aid these industries to some extent at the expense of other people.  A certain number will be employed through the operations of these tariffs, but it will mean that they will be employed at the expense of others putting their hands into one pocket and taking out as much as will actually pay these people, that they might work in that industry.  That is what it means, as I see it.  Deputy Figgis talked about the history of other countries in the past.  The Deputy knows that the conditions now and then do not bear any comparison.  In those days there was protection for agriculture, and that is what you cannot have by the tariffs in your Budget to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good to make the point a little clearer.  There is no use trying to make a comparison between this country and America or Germany, countries that are almost continents in themselves, and with natural resources available for their existence, so that they may disregard other countries.  That is not our position. We know our limitations, and we know there are things that it is impossible for us to produce here.  On the other hand, there are certain other things we can produce more favourably than most other countries.  I think it is an accepted economic law that you should concentrate on the production of those things which you are most favourably placed to produce. If, through the operations of the tariffs, industries come into existence, and get a certain amount of life and energy breathed into them, and if, as the Minister for Finance says, the revenue accruing from these sources is to dry <Col N="1122" /> up after a little while, and I believe it will dry up, then it will be only when the masters of industry here have concentrated to such an extent on mass production that they will be able to compete with other countries who have also concentrated on mass production.</P>
      <P>I think we can all see to where that leads.  Mass production here will certainly give us crowded towns and cities.  A policy like that will inevitably develop along lines that will bring about such results.  I do not know whether or not that is the sort of State we should bring into existence.  If you are to compete against the other fellow you must have mass production, and that means thousands and thousands of workers crowded together under conditions that are not, even under the best methods, by any means satisfactory.  There is always the temptation in the rural districts to go into the towns and cities.  The industries will be built up at the expense of the rural population and of rural industry. You will be going along a line of development that I do not think would be accepted as the right one.  It would be far better, I believe, to concentrate on the industry that is the mainstay of the State, and try to develop industries subsidiary to it in the rural areas.</P>
      <P>If everything was accomplished that could be accomplished with that industry, and when it was made absolutely secure, and would not be made to suffer more than it could bear through measures of protection, then would come the time for the State as a whole to consider this policy.  That time has not come.  I think the Minister's resolution is too soon and inopportune, and it is making us pay in a way that is not acceptable and that will be hurtful.  It will actually raise our cost of production, and defeat our efforts to try and meet the foreigner. If that operates long enough, the only effect would be to depress the agricultural industry more than it is to-day. When that comes about it will be very regrettable indeed.</P>

      <P>Listening to the speeches that have been made from the Farmers' benches to-day, and comparing <Col N="1123" /> them with the statements from the same quarter when the Budget was introduced, one can only come to the conclusion that the farmers have met to consider the question since, and that now they are waking up.  On the last occasion I, amongst others, asked them why it was they did not put before the Minister for Agriculture some scheme of protection, which according to some of them was necessary for the farming interests.  They were divided then, but they have one mind to-day, at least openly, in support of this amendment. The amendment has been the key-note for a very scattered discussion, and it has also given an opening to Deputy Gorey to make some of his usual delicate references to other Deputies, but luckily Deputy Figgis did not notice them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Baxter referred to the question of mass production and its necessity in Ireland.  Why is there any occasion for mass production to supply the needs of our own people?  I did not understand that it was in the mind of the Minister for Finance in preparing his Budget that Ireland was going to compete with other countries on the same scale as Germany, England and America.  The idea in most of our minds has been that this country ought, to a certain extent, be in the position to meet its own needs in food, clothing, and otherwise. The facts given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce ought to put those who hold those notions as regards protection, thinking.  We heard from Deputy Gorey that the farmers' sons got all their clothes made at home, that they did not buy ready-made clothing, and that they always support Irish industries, provided that they get good quality and good value.  I was delighted to hear Deputy Gorey's statement, but if the farmers' sons are getting their clothes made at home in their native places, how then is the extra cost following the protection on clothing going to affect the farmers?</P>

      <P>If I misquoted the <Col N="1124" /> Deputy I am sorry.  I understood the Deputy to say the majority of the farmers' sons got their clothes made at home, and that is very pleasing and satisfactory.  If we all bought clothes produced by the workers at home, we would not have to be paying the dole to such an extent.  People are idle because there is not work for them, and it is a question of supporting them, or else those in foreign countries, thus assisting emigration.  It has been said by the Farmers' Party that protection of any sort is of no value to the farmers.  When the Budget was introduced I gave facts and figures.  They have been forgotten, though the record of them is there. Perhaps some Deputies take care to forget statements that are made, simply because they do not wish to agree with them.  There are none so blind as those who will not see.  The majority of those engaged in business and trades in Ireland are the sons of small farmers.  Deputy Baxter said when he was referring to the deputation that was coming to see the Minister that the farmers in their district will soon have to leave if protection comes in any form.</P>
      <P>If we are going to have a series of bad harvests, if cattle are going to die, it would be a blessing for the small farmer to have some outlet for his sons and daughters, rather than keep them at home at an occupation that is only sufficient to support his wife and himself and one child.  As a matter of economics, you cannot get beyond the fact that that man must find some outlet for his children.  Is it not better for him to try and find an outlet for them in industry in his own country after spending money on their education and clothing, rather than ship them to earn their living in America?  I know that small farmers look at the matter in that light.  Small farmers are absolutely keen on the protection of industries in the interests of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Baxter stated a while ago that Deputy Johnson suggested that protection would only mean the giving of wages to people for work done.  Any work done in a country cannot be a loss.  One would nearly want to get a sledge-hammer to drive that into the <Col N="1125" /> minds of some people.  Work always has its natural results.  The natural corollary of work is wealth.  You must work to produce wealth.  I am absolutely in agreement with Deputy Gorey in one thing, that we want more work and more output here.  We will not get that by always decrying things.  We are not likely to advance by saying that there are no possibilities outside agriculture. I heard the statement made thirty years ago that there was no hope in doing anything further for the Irish farmer.  The Irish farmer has done a lot since then.  To my mind the only form of protection the Irish farmer wants is protection against himself, and he wants that badly.  This Dáil has been largely engaged in passing Bills in the interest of the Irish farmer. Some of these Bills were found necessary many years ago, long before this Dáil or the Sinn Fein movement was thought of.  I remember bringing home from Denmark photographs of a farm where nine cows were kept, each of which was giving 400 gallons of milk yearly.  Three of these cows were kept, six were sold and four were purchased and these seven cows were giving 1,200 gallons of milk each.  In this country we have cows still only giving three hundred or four hundred gallons per year which is a hopeless return for a farmer to have from his cattle.</P>

      <P>When bringing Deputy Morrissey to task, sir, you said you had already given a certain amount of latitude.  Ready-made clothing is very important.  If we consider the advantage that its manufacture here would be to the country we would not be against protection.  Deputy Baxter has said that he did not believe in spoon-feeding and that it killed initiative. Many industries in this country were intentionally destroyed in the past.  These industries were native to the country.  There is no use in farmers saying that there is nothing in this country except our cattle, sheep horses, and butter.  That is not a fact. There were other industries which the country lent itself naturally to.  Certain <Col N="1126" /> things can be produced here because we have the raw material.  We had the weaving and spinning industry owing to the delicacy of touch of our Irish women.</P>
      <P>I remember one of these Irish industries for which I was the means of getting a small subsidy at the start. That industry was done away with, but the work done by the girls engaged in it was so much better than that done by English girls that the Irish girls were taken over to England and given good positions in the factories there.  The same thing occurred in other industries.  That would apply to the hosiery, glove-making, and kindred industries.  If you have in Ireland people engaged in industry who prove themselves so capable and qualified that they have been induced to go to another country because the people of that country could not turn out as good work, that shows the possibilities before the people of Ireland if they only get a chance to get going.  If the farmers would only recognise that the help given to them in connection with the improvement of their stock, bueter, etc., should be extended to other industries, they would be helping themselves in the best possible way. They would be building up the home market which Deputy Wilson referred to.  A home market is a very useful thing to have.  It will not interfere with the outside market.  I oppose this amendment, and I hope that it will be withdrawn.  I hope the Farmers' Party will have the common sense to withdraw it in their own interests and in the interests of the country of which the farmers form such a very large and important part.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that it is possible to disassociate the particular resolution under discussion from the Budget as a whole.  We have drawn up a scheme and we cannot take something out of it and let the remainder of the scheme stand.  I have no hesitation in saying that if there had been no new impositions of taxes there would have been no increase in the Agricultural Grant.  We would have given remission of taxation in the income tax and tea and sugar duties, <Col N="1127" /> and the Agricultural Grant would have been allowed to stand.  I believe that the farmers are really coming better out of this Budget than any other class in the community.  I do not believe that they will suffer any serious handicap as a result of the new taxes proposed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooper said that the particular tax imposed by this resolution would be very heavy during the first couple of years.  I think he was taking a wrong view entirely of the matter. Those taxes are not a burden on the community until they cease to yield revenue.  So long as they are yielding revenue they enable us to remit other taxation.  If there is going to be an actual dead-weight burden on the community it can only arise after they cease to yield revenue and when the taxes that we have remitted must be reimposed or some other new taxes substituted for them.  The real question as to whether this particular duty will impose a dead-weight burden on the country or not depends on this: As the yield from these taxes decreases will increased revenue come in as a result of the employment given?</P>
      <P>If we employ several thousands of people, who are not now employed, as a result of this tariff, will their consumption of sugar and other dutiable commodities give us revenue somewhere near the amount of revenue we lose through the development of industries and through the reduction of imports? As a matter of fact there is even another aspect of it&mdash;that is, assuming that the goods produced here are almost fifteen per cent. higher than the goods produced abroad.  If they were almost that, and if the additional employment gave us additional revenue in other duties corresponding to the revenue that we will get at the first from this particular tariff, then there would be no net dead-weight-burden on the country or practically none.</P>
      <P>I believe this is a type of industry that may well sell its goods at the outside rate, by the time the imports have been brought down to the lowest point that they can be brought as a result of the tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> As I said, the degree of skill required in the making of many parts in wearing apparel is not very great, and the equipment required is not very expensive. Many firms can be set up, real competition can exist, and many branches of the industry have been carrying on in a limited way in competition with all outside.</P>
    <P>There are not many shirt-making firms in the Saorstát, but some have carried on in the face of competition, both in the finer and coarser types of shirt, with outside makers.  There is no reason at all why people who will start or who will expand their business, as the result of this tariff, should not continue to sell at competing rates.  The position is such that without a tariff and without some encouragement people are not willing to put money into industry. Our Irish boot factories have always carried on, not perhaps in a very flourishing way, in competition with outside makers.  The prospects were not so good that anyone was going to put money into the industry, but one of the results of the tariff is that already a new factory is working. People have put money into it. Another new factory will be ready to work in a very short time.  Farmers and all sorts of people have put £300, £400, and £500 into that industry.</P>
    <P>As a result of the tariff you get a stimulus, and as long as you put tariffs only on industries suitable to the country, that have a fair chance, and industries in which there can be considerable competition, there is no reason why there should be any appreciable difference, even with the tariff, between the price here and the outside price. If you put your tariffs on industries, such as heavy engineering industries, for which this country is unsuitable, you are going, if the tariff is an effective one, to have a dead-weight charge on the community.  I do not believe these industries will, when the tariffs have had time to take effect, impose any appreciable charge on the community. I believe we will be able to continue the remission of taxation that we were able to give because of these tariffs.  I believe that our other taxes will yield better because of the greater employment in the country.  There <Col N="1129" /> may be some slight difference, but in any case it will not fall entirely on the community, because I believe&mdash;when the tariff has time to have effect&mdash;that there is going to be nothing like a 15 per cent. difference between the cost here and the cost outside.  In many of the articles there will certainly be no difference at all.  Some branches of the industry, which have been carried on here in competition, will be extended and carried on in competition in future at rates equivalent to the rates outside. Other industries which have not been successfully carried on here will, I believe, because of the skill and direction to be brought in from outside, be carried on on a competitive basis in future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooper talked about the harshness with which this tax will bear on the father of a family.  I think he was answered by Deputy Johnson. There is, I think, nothing more heartbreaking in this country than to be continually approached by people to get employment for boys and girls of 17, 18 and 19 years of age, who have left school, and for whom no work can be got.  I think, even if there were to be some little extra cost, the most hard-pressed father of a family would bear it if he felt that there was a prospect of employment for children for whom there are very small prospects now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gorey asked would we maintain, or see that a proportion was maintained, between the prices charged here and the prices charged for articles made outside the country.  I do not believe the Government can do that. There was a difference before these tariff proposals.  I believe that any difference that existed before the tariff will not be increased as a result of the tariff.  There are many reasons for the difference, and I have no hesitation in saying that one reason is that there is no industrial spirit here.  There are too many people going into distribution, and if you can turn money and energy from distribution to manufacturing, it will tend of itself to bring down prices.  Apart from that, I believe the only way to bring down prices is by consumers creating organisations that will do so.  I think it is a great misfortune in this country that <Col N="1130" /> we have not a well-organised consumers' co-operative movement, such as they have in England, as it is a check, at any rate, on other traders.</P>

      <P>I would not agree with the idea of attempting to control prices, appointing hordes of officials to make investigations, and making necessary the establishment of actual rings in the distributive trade which, perhaps, we would not get rid of when we got rid of attempted control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Baxter can hardly have been serious when he stated that protection saps the energy of the people.  There have been many examples of great industries being built up under the shadow of protection, and established definitely by the help of protection. The people who have now taken money out of deposit accounts in the banks and put it into boot factories, when they saw the chance, are taking risks that they did not take before. They have not had their energy sapped by the protective tariff.  I believe if you give opportunities and perhaps, in a sense, special rewards in a country where there is no spirit for industrial enterprises, you are not sapping the energy of the people.  I believe they would have quite the opposite effect. But if there are well-established, strong industries, and that you give them protection against any breath of competition that comes along, if you do not allow them to meet their own difficulties, and buffet with the waves that come along, then you might sap <Col N="1131" /> the energy.  You cannot compare a country like this, not really industrially developed, with a highly-industrialised country or with a country successful in industry.  There you may have risks of taking people off the strain, as it were.  There it is merely a question of inducing people to enter on the creation of industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the reasons why the Government did say that for a period we would have no further protective tariffs.  We want the people who are not likely to get it to bear in mind that they must go back to their industries and make the best they can of the job.  I believe that to hold out the prospect of protection to any industry that raised sufficient clamour would have a very bad effect, and that you would have energy taken from real work and devoted to political agitation of a certain type.  I, for one, do not agree with the conception of national life that Deputy Baxter seemed to put forward, when he said that the tendency was to concentrate on the things that can most easily be produced.  That might be so, if you had regard only to economics and if you did not consider individuals.  If you thought nothing of the people and confined all your attention to figures on paper, you might say that the only thing this country should produce was beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But we do not look at the matter in that way.  We have regard to the community and to the nation, and we want to create a sort of life here that will be a richer, a more varied, and more satisfactory life than the life you would get by directing your national <Col N="1132" /> policy solely along the lines of finance and of abstract economics.  We cannot say that it does not matter at all about the people who are brought up here, and who have to go out of the country; that we are concerned only with the people who are brought up here, destined by their parents to inherit farms.  We cannot take up the attitude that those others can go to other countries or go wherever they choose, that we must conduct our national policy along the lines of pure and abstract economics.  I think it would be worth while for the people of this country to take a somewhat wider view &mdash;to develop industries, to develop variety in life here, and to give opportunity to the talent that may be brought out here, rather than concentrate on some one thing and sacrifice all else.</P>
    <P>The Farmer-Deputies&mdash;not meaning it, perhaps&mdash;in their speeches, seem to advocate sacrificing all else to agriculture. I think that is not a thing we should do.  Even looking at it from the economic point of view, I do not think it is sound.  The country may have half-a-dozen bad seasons, but it will be better able to endure the shock and recovery will come sooner if it has some other string to its bow.  If we had not even had the industries which exist in this country, and if we had been dependent on agriculture solely, I think the situation would be worse than it is at present, after the two or three bad summers which we have had. I think, from every possible point of view, there should be such development of industry as can be effected.  I have no hesitation in saying that it would be unwise and short-sighted for the Dáil, even if it were so inclined, to adopt Deputy Heffernan's amendment.</P>

      <P>The point in regard to my amendment is this.  I do not think that it was intended to have included the various items I move to have excluded under this amendment.  Within a few hundred yards of this building an exhibition of paintings was arranged for this current week.  Certain Irish artists sent over pictures from England, and all those would have been charged duty except that they were refused.  I do not think it was intended that that should be the case, and that there should be any discrimination between paintings on canvas and on a panel. Moreover, finally, I think the adoption of the amendment would not only be just and in conformity with the intention of the original resolution, but it would be making for the simplification in the administration.</P>

      <P>In paragraph 2 (b), line 11, after the word &ldquo;household&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or had been bequeathed to the importer by will.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an attempt to fill up what is, I think, an accidental omission in the Bill.  It is within the knowledge of the Dáil and the Minister that a large number of people have left Ireland during the last three or four years.  They have gone to live in England and have taken with them their furniture.  It is possible that when some of those people, who are old people, die, that their heirs, whether sons or nephews, will wish to come back here.  They will bring the furniture back and, strictly speaking, they will not be exempted by the words of the Minister, &ldquo;in use by the importer or his household.&rdquo;  At the same time, we should make it easy for those people to come back and make it easy for those people to bring back their furniture.  The principle embodied in the amendment is, I think, acceptable although the wording may not be.  It is possible to ascertain whether a thing has been left by will or not.  You can produce a copy of the probate of the will.  That makes a small loophole for evasion.  It is true that an astute dealer could go around to old people getting them to make wills leaving furniture that was not in their possession and getting it imported here.  That kind of fraud can be easily detected.  If the same people imported furniture two or three times in the year it would be easy for the Minister's staff to get on to them.  I do not think this clause, which affects people who in a will leave furniture to children here who bring it in for their household, is a sound one.  It will cost very little to the Exchequer and I hope the Minister <Col N="1136" /> will see his way to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal is one that would not involve any great administrative difficulty.  The only objection I see to it at the present moment is that it may be made a reason for pressure to extend the principle. We could not agree that in the case of a cellar of wine which a man bequeathed, the wine could be imported free of duty.  The same applies to a motor car.  There is just this to be said.  You might make up just as good an argument for a motor car as for furniture.  I would like to consider the matter further.</P>
      <P>It might be possible so to draft it that we would deal really with furniture that had been taken out of the country.  I do not see why furniture that was never in the country and had been bequeathed by will to somebody here, should be admitted free.  I would guarantee to look into the whole matter.</P>

      <P>After paragraph (2) (c), to insert a new sub-paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The furniture is of the kind accurately designated as antique furniture, and is being imported for the use in Saorstát Eireann of the importer or his family or household.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Since putting down my amendment my attention was drawn to the fact that there was a phrase in it which lent itself to the possible interpretation that I was having a shot at the President.  That is not so.  It was quite innocently framed, and not intended that it should bear that construction.

      <P>&ldquo;That whenever the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that any article of furniture has been made more than one hundred years ago, they may, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, permit such article to be imported without payment of the duty mentioned in this Resolution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The wording of this amendment is borrowed from a provision in the tariff of the United States.  In the United States they exempt from the tariff on furniture any article that can be proved to be 100 years old.  The reason for that is, that the great craftsmen in the making of furniture for the most part lived more than 100 years ago; these are masters that we should copy if we intend to have that richer and more varied life that the Minister for Finance talked about a few minutes ago.  If we aim at that richer and more varied life we are not going to shut out by tariffs the works of Chippendale, Sheraton, and the great French artist, Buhl.  If we did that we would deprive our own artists of models.  We want to have artistic furniture made in the Saorstát.</P>
      <P>There is at present good furniture being made in the Saorstát.  We do not want to check anything that would encourage people to bring in the very best.  At present, as the resolution stands, even if the National Museum were to bring in an article of furniture a duty of 33? per cent. would have to be paid on it.  Of course, I know that even under the resolution the Minister could exercise a dispensing power, which is a very bad and unconstitutional principle, and for which Ministers have in times past been executed.</P>

I do not know that any antiques that were imported are more than one or two years old.  Having been treated in the proper method they pass as antiques. As far as I understand, the business of antique furniture is mostly in fakes.  I understand that there is at least one man in Dublin who can do that as well as they do it anywhere else.</P>

I think if we get a report from our representative in Washington or New York as to the procedure in the United States in this matter, the Minister will see what is done there, and I think he will find it advisable to adopt the same procedure here.  I would ask him to bear it in mind until next year, and in the meantime to inquire into the American precedent.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That whenever the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that any article of furniture is imported for use, exclusively in a stage play or other dramatic or musical representation <Col N="1139" /> or performance, they may, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, permit such article to be imported without payment of the duty mentioned in this Resolution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an attempt to fill up an omission of the Minister.  The Minister has exempted from duty costumes used in staged plays, but he forgot that in addition to costumes used in plays there is also scenery and furniture, and in some instances the furniture is a very important part indeed.  As scenery is mounted on wooden frames it might be held by the revenue authorities to be furniture.</P>
    <P>In our pursuit of the rich and varied life we should wish that the citizens of the Saorstát would see the plays mounted under the best conditions possible.  We do not want touring companies that come here, as they will for some time, to leave their furniture at Holyhead to be shipped to Belfast, and to use three or four of the chairs that are in the property rooms of the Gaiety or Theatre Royal.  I have taken the Minister's own words in regard to clothing and adapted them to this.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

But the State cannot help those who are not prepared to help themselves; it can only hold them up for a time, like a drunken man.

Most Deputies have found fault with us for our opposition to State help.  So long as we consider that a proper response has not been given, a proper gesture has not been made, in response to that of the Government, we will continue in our opposition, and I think that our doing so will be one of the best assets that the Government can have to insure that a proper response is made to the gesture that they have made.  We have had appeals to our better nature; we have had lectures here and abuse outside, abuse from publications claiming to be newspapers, or, I believe it has been suggested, Government organs.  I have heard them described as some of the Gutter Press.  I do not know the people who own these papers, but from what I have been told I believe the name of one of them is Fatty Arbuckle.  But we do not intend to indulge in any of this clapping on the back business; we intend to be critical of all these impositions and to oppose them in order to insure that a proper response will be made.  I do not think a proper response will be made, and although we may come in for some hard knocks, we intend to achieve the thing that we are all out for, that is, a proper response.  Having said so much, I ask leave, on behalf of Deputy Heffernan, to withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <P>There are just two points I would like to make in amplification of what I said on the last resolution, and that is with regard to the question of possible expansion in this industry.  I do not want to say anything that would vex Deputy Mrs. <Col N="1141" /> Collins-O'Driscoll, because I have a great respect not only for her and for her point of view, but for the manner in which she expressed it; but this also is a trade that requires skilled labour, and I am told that the skilled labour required for the higher class of goods is at present very rare and hard to obtain.</P>
      <P>I have inquired into it among some of the largest manufacturers.  There are plenty of people who make the ordinary cottage chair, but people who can make the better class furniture are very rare, and in spite of the fact that the rate of wages in the Saorstát is four pence an hour more than in England or Scotland they do not seem to come back to us from England and Scotland.  I know that there is an apprehension on the part of one firm that they will not be able to meet the heavy demands that will be created by this duty.  It is a heavy duty, a duty that I do not think we are justified in imposing unless we are satisfied that the industry will expand sufficiently to meet the demands.  I would like to refer to one other point, made by Deputy Figgis yesterday, as to the possibility of the Minister issuing a list of articles that are scheduled.  I am told that some domestic chaos has been caused in my own household by the fact that an ironing board is said to be considered an article of furniture. Is a mangle an article of furniture? Is a wash tub?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will consider the advisability of making some concession to County Donegal, because I gather that County Donegal at present sends all its linen to be washed in Derry.  Here is a case of a protective duty on one industry interfering with the establishment of another industry, and if the Minister considers that mangles and wash tubs are articles of furniture, I hope that he will consider at any rate allowing them in where they act as raw material for an industry. But my main point is that he should tell us what should be taxed and what should not be taxed.  At Calais you get a list of articles and you are asked if you have any of the articles on that list to declare.  They put up a <Col N="1142" /> similar list on the mail boats.  We do nothing of the kind; we leave it to the discretion of the Customs officer and the intelligence of the traveller.  My only fear is that such a list might be too long and too heavy for a man to carry, but I think that the Minister should have a list of articles that are taxed for the convenience of incoming travellers.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate the sentiments expressed by Deputy Cooper in relation to the industry in Donegal, I do not quite agree with him that we need any sympathy in that county.  I think that I might rather express my sympathy with the four towns that are adjacent to Donegal and that are not yet within the jurisdiction of Saorstát Eireann who will lose some business through this tax.  I think that Donegal will not suffer hardship to any extent owing to these impositions on clothing and wearing apparel, and while I must thank Deputy Cooper for his consideration, I do not think that sympathy is so much needed in relation to County Donegal as it is in relation to the four towns to which I refer and for which I have sympathy under the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reply very briefly to the point that has been raised by Deputy Cooper with regard to skilled labour and the possibility of expansion.  There are between 2,000 and 3,000 skilled hands in the making of furniture unemployed at present. The wholesale furniture establishments have plant that in the past year has only been worked on an average at fifty per cent. of its total capacity.  So that as far as skilled hands and increased output by way of additional working of plant are concerned, there is no fear that there will not be immediate expansion.  I do not say that merely on this head it will be enough to meet the demand, but there is the further fact that there are a tremendous number of idle factories, big warehouses and old flour mills, at present vacant, and that a considerable amount of machinery suitable for the making of furniture has been thrown on the market since the war, <Col N="1143" /> machinery that had been employed in munition making.  So there are machinery and premises to be had very cheaply.  I do not hold that we can immediately meet the normal demand, but that can be achieved quite soon.</P>

      <P>I have received three new amendments to this resolution.  They appear on the White Paper, and perhaps by taking them now it may be found that it will not be necessary to consider some of the other amendments which already appear on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I want to raise a question as to whether these amendments were handed in outside the ordinary time limit for handing in amendments.  I inquired at the Office of the Clerk as to the last hour for handing in amendments, and I was told it was 11 o'clock on Monday morning.  I handed in my amendments at an earlier hour than that. The amendments that were handed in then were circulated on Wednesday morning, but it was only on yesterday afternoon, and at a fairly late hour, that these amendments appeared.  I infer, therefore, that they were not handed in before eleven o'clock on Monday morning.  The Standing Orders make no discrimination between Ministers and ordinary Deputies, and the reason I am raising this matter now is to find out whether any privilege is being claimed on behalf of Ministers. <Col N="1144" /> Of course, I am aware that under Standing Order 81 you can accept any amendment without notice. I think it is hardly fair to private Deputies that Minister or Parliamentary Secretaries should habitually disregard these Standing Orders, which are set up for the convenience of the whole Dáil, and not merely for the convenience of the Government.  Consequently, I think that Ministers should not, when they hand in amendments late, use the amendments of private Deputies and anticipate them.</P>
      <P>I handed in an amendment dealing with soda-water syphons.  The Parliamentary Secretary hands in an amendment dealing with glass syphons. These are practically my words, because the duty is only to be levied on glass syphons.  It is not to be levied on earthenware syphons or on cast-iron or brown paper syphons or any other kind of syphons.  It is only on the glass syphons that it is to be levied. I do not suggest that this is a very important matter, and I do not want to stress it, but it is making a bad precedent. I suggest that when there are amendments from Deputies on the Order Paper dealing with matters which Ministers wish to raise, that they would be wiser, and be acting more fairly, if, instead of putting down Government amendments, they would accept those portions of private members' amendments that deal with the points that they wish to adopt.  I ask your ruling, A Leas-Chinn Comhairle, as to whether these amendments were handed in in time, and whether, if they were not handed in in time, you rule that they are of urgency.</P>

      <P>I think we have been particular in accepting our position here in just the same way as we expect ordinary Deputies to accept theirs.  But, it is, I think, within the bounds of possibility that for the convenience of the House and for the better expedition of business, occasions may arise on which it may not be possible to take such precautions as would enable us to have particular amendments in in time.  In this case, some delay was occasioned through causes which it is not necessary to enter into, and I think that instead of there being an objection that we have, I think, generously met the spirit of the amendments put down by Deputies, and, perhaps, in language which meets the case from the point of view of drafting. If it has occurred that we have presented a particular set of amendments, dealing with the subject matter of the Resolution generally, in a better form than the acceptance of individual amendments would secure, I think there is some justification for that, even at the last moment, and perhaps at a later moment than other Deputies could put down such composite amendments as are on the Order Paper at the present moment.  It is not intended, and was never intended, that we should abuse our position as Ministers to get in amendments or to do business here in a way which would interfere with private Deputies' privileges.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2)  That on every glass bottle or glass jar imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 9th day of May, 1925, and containing at the time of importation any dutiable commodity, there shall be charged, levied, and paid the following Customs duty, that is to say:</P>
      <P>(a)  if the capacity of the bottle or jar does not exceed five fluid ounces, a duty at the rate of three-pence for every dozen or part of a dozen such bottles or jars,</P>
      <P>(b)  if the capacity of the bottle or jar exceeds five fluid ounces, a duty at the rate of sixpence for every dozen or part of a dozen such bottles or jars.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I need not say that we are not actuated by the desire to forestall Deputy Cooper or to prevent him making any remarks that might suggest themselves to him on this matter.  We have given this a good deal of consideration during the past week or ten days, in view of the various protests and complaints that were aroused.  We felt that there was undoubtedly a case for charging a duty on certain bottles imported as containers. <Col N="1147" /> For instance, without some such provision you might have lemonade bottles being charged, if they were imported empty, a duty, say, of 1/2d. per bottle.  Then you might have similar bottles brought in free, if they contained lemonade.  The importer of the full bottles having that advantage, you might have people escaping the duty on empty bottles by actually bringing in full bottles, say, of lemonade, and using the bottles afterwards in the same way as if they were imported here.</P>
    <P>We, on the other hand, felt it would be going too far to charge a duty on all bottles whether full or empty, because that would very much widen the area of dutiable commodities, and you would sweep many commodities now non-dutiable into the dutiable net that would have to submit to Customs examination and all the formalities with regard to duty would have to be observed. Generally there is a certain lack of space at our ports, for one thing, and it would mean a great congestion and delay.  There is a tendency at the present time if you bring in a great number of commodities to have them piled and put up in transit sheds.  Once there is any considerable amount of congestion it is difficult to find goods, and it is more difficult to get them out, and great delays occur.  We think it would not be wise bringing into the dutiable list by a charge upon the containers all sorts of things not dutiable at all, and which could be got out rapidly.</P>
    <P>On the other hand we feel the case for charging a duty on containers can be fairly met by the charge on different containers of dutiable commodities. Now this extension proposed will bring in bottles containing lemonade because mineral waters are dutiable.  Of course bottles containing all classes of wine and whiskey and spirits of all sorts, table water, cider, and so forth, various sauces and condiments which might contain sugar, bottled fruit and jams, jellies, as well as sweets and various toilet preparations, that contain either sugar or spirits, and even certain furniture and boot polish that contain sugar &mdash;all these at present have to be <Col N="1148" /> examined by the Customs.  Probably in most cases samples will have to be taken and an analysis made and there will be no additional delay caused by charging a duty on glass containers. The whole thing of charging the duty will be, as it were, one operation and no fresh or additional congestion or delay will be caused.  It is not practicable even if we desired to do so to charge an <i>ad valorem</i> duty on containers.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with empty bottles and invoices will come to be checked in various ways to show the value of the imports, but when dealing with containers it would be more difficult to ascertain the value.  We are satisfied that containers must be charged specific duty as distinct from <i>ad valorem</i> duty and we propose on all those a specific duty of three pence per dozen where the capacity is not in excess of five fluid ounces.</P>
    <P>There are a few very small mineral water bottles that will not contain that, but generally mineral water bottles will be in excess of that and will contain more than five fluid ounces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down an amendment to delete the word &ldquo;empty,&rdquo; the effects of which would mean that all glass bottles will be subject to this duty.  I rather did that with a view to draw from the Minister some views as to the exemptions that would require to be made and I anticipated there would need to be some exemptions.  The Minister's proposal meets in a very large degree every case I had in my mind except one.  I have not consulted anybody in this matter since last year when the same question arose, when we thought that mineral water bottles would be included in the tariff.  When mineral water bottles were excluded then the proposal I had put down a year ago to delete the word &ldquo;empty&rdquo; fell.  But now that mineral water bottles are included, the question arises as to whether the amount of duty would not make it profitable on the part of bottle exporters to fill these bottles with water not dutiable because the cost of filling and stoppering would be considerably less per bottle than the amount of the <Col N="1149" /> duty, and inasmuch as this proposal is only to place a tariff upon dutiable articles which would cover mineral waters, water which was not mineral could be filled.  It would cost nothing more in freight.  The same space would be occupied because there are no collapsible glass bottles, and therefore I can see a possibility that has not yet been considered and that should be considered, namely, the possibility that it would pay the bottle exporter to export these bottles full of water and empty them when they arrive here.</P>
      <P>I put that forward for consideration. I do not know whether it has any solid basis or not.  I do not know how the cost would compare with the rate of duty or what the cost of filling and stoppering would mean.  Apart from that I think the Minister's proposition meets all the instances I had in my mind.  When I desired that the duty should have been put upon glass bottles, I had mainly in my mind whiskey bottles and mineral water bottles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment moved by the Minister, and I think it more or less covers the cases that I had put down.  There are, however, two, I think, that are not met, and I mention them now because it may have been the Minister's intention to have dealt with these two cases.  The first case arises in connection with certain manufacturers who have spoken to me about the needs of their business. In one case certain medicines are manufactured here or preparations that are made into those to be styled as medicines, and another case was that of toilet requisites of various kinds.  In one firm 88 different sizes and shapes are used, in another firm over fifty. The argument put forward by these people is that they buy their bottles; they manufacture their commodities here, and they fill these commodities into bottles on this side, and that they are in competition with British firms who sell exactly the same article in Ireland.  That argument is this: if they are charged a duty on their bottles, and the British manufacturer of the same article can put it on sale less the duty on the bottle, because his is a filled bottle, that, in effect, will mean that this duty will be a protection, <Col N="1150" /> not to the Irish manufacturer of the filling, but to the British manufacturer of the filling.  The difference will constitute a very great portion of the profit that is now made which, because of the very keen competition, is a slender sum.  That was not the intention of the duty, and I have been puzzled to discover how far, exactly, the amendments moved in the Minister's name will meet the case.</P>
      <P>It is perfectly true that in some cases the filling in the container would be dutiable.  In that case the amendments would meet all requirements.  But it is also true that some of the filling of the containers is not dutiable.  One case that was mentioned was that of cod liver oil.  A certain manufacturer in Ireland puts up cod liver oil in bottles which, under this proposal, he would have to pay duty on.  He has to meet in competition English firms that put cod liver oil into bottles and who can get their bottles, because they are filled, across the border without any duty at all.  Obviously the Irish manufacturer&mdash;he could hardly be called a manufacturer, because he is little more than a filler&mdash;is put at a serious disadvantage against the British competitor. I suggest that in that case&mdash;it was one of the two cases I mentioned&mdash;care should be taken to see that the British manufacturers are not put in that position of advantage and that Irish manufacturers are not put in that position of disadvantage.  That is one case. The other refers to people who have represented their case to the Minister, and the statement has been made that Irish manufacturers will be able to supply all the bottles required, in the case of medicine bottles, for example, in a very short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be very reluctant, indeed, to say anything that would suggest a question of that statement; but it has been said to me that that promise would be very hard to keep, simply by reason of the financial difficulties of some of the manufacturing firms, because the procuring of the moulds and machinery required for the manufacture of the special types of bottle of the exact size required is not an inexpensive matter.  What then happens in the case of the Minister's amendments, <Col N="1151" /> which are themselves grounded in the assurances that have been given to manufacturers of bottles in the Saorstát?  If those assurances cannot be made good, or made good early enough to be of real use in the present financial year, what happens?  I should like the Minister to direct his reply to those two points in order to meet the difficulties that have been raised by those who, having worked the matter out, think they would not only seriously be affected by the duty, but would be affected in the very opposite way to the intentions which inspired the original resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>We are at a double disadvantage in dealing with this matter owing to the procedure adopted by the Government.  In the first place, the Deputies who have been approached by various firms interested in this matter have had no opportunity of consulting with them since this amendment appeared on the Paper late yesterday afternoon.  At least I, personally, have not had.  We do not know whether firms have raised objections to the admission of bottles filled in England and we do not know if they would be satisfied with the duty that the Minister proposes.  I think the Minister is quite right to propose a flat rate.  I think the <i>ad valorem</i> rate is absolutely unworkable.  Whether the flat rate is high enough is a doubtful question.  Here we are placed at another disadvantage and in another difficulty.  Once this resolution is passed&mdash;and it must be passed to-night &mdash;that is the highest rate that can possibly be imposed.  We cannot move, on the Finance Bill, any increase in duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could move to reduce, but this is absolutely the maximum, and if we find firms that feel they will be prejudicially affected by the original duty saying that they may have to go out of business if they are exposed to English competition of the kind Deputy Figgis has described, we have no remedy. If we find this duty is inadequate to help them, we have no possible opportunity of moving for its increase. I think the President will see now that I was not merely acting on <Col N="1152" /> punctilio in raising the question on a point of order.  We are still very much in the dark.  The Minister tells us that mineral waters are taxed.  Are all mineral waters taxed, or is it merely sweetened water that is taxed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>That meets one or two points.  It does not meet all the points that Deputy Figgis mentioned, and it does not meet the point regarding the manufacture of ink that I have in mind.  There is one manufacturer of ink in the Saorstát.  That work is not carried on in my constituency, but it is in Deputy Wilson's.  They have been unable to obtain in Dublin the bottles they require.  They have to import them from Great Britain, and if they have to pay the duty, which is a heavy duty on such imported bottles, they will be paying more than their British competitors, who can send bottles filled with ink in free.  The result will be that the Irish manufacturer will be, as Deputy Figgis has said, at a material disadvantage compared with competitors across the water.  The ink I have referred to is good ink; I believe you have some of it on your table, A Leas-Chinn Comhairle.  I do not think it should be placed at any disadvantage. We ought to promote that industry; we certainly ought not to hamper or harass it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, I am dealing with this matter under great handicaps.  I have not been able to consult the firm; but they expressed a view to me that nothing less than a flat rate of 9d. per dozen, such as was originally suggested, would be of any use.  It should not be anything short of that.  The Englishman can undersell them if they would be obliged to pay a 33? per. cent duty.  That is a very heavy duty, and I do not think it should in this instance be imposed.  Perhaps we could extend the protection in paragraph (c) not merely to dutiable goods, but to any other goods that we manufacture in the Saorstát.  How we are to do it, <Col N="1153" /> working as we are under such limitations of time, I do not know.  I can only regret the ill-considered procedure that has been adopted in bringing in a duty on glass bottles without considering how it would affect firms manufacturing articles here.  I see no way out.  It is admitted the Irish firms do not manufacture all these bottles now, and that machinery cannot be installed for manufacturing them for a month or two.  But that period alone might mean that those comparatively small and struggling firms would be beaten out of the market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">

      <P>The factory I desire to refer to is the ink factory mentioned by Deputy Cooper.  The complaint is these bottles are not procurable in the Free State, and therefore we are handicapped to the extent of 33? per cent. as against the English manufacturer. What would be the price of these bottles?  The duty on an ink bottle would not, I am sure, be very much.</P>

I was wondering whether the Minister would agree to delete the word &ldquo;dutiable?&rdquo;  The argument which affects the ink bottle is net met by the Minister's amendments, and I would like to hear him on how the particular manufacturer in question is to meet the competition in which the Englishman has the advantage of 33? per cent. on the price of bottles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to emphasise the point made by Deputies Cooper, Figgis and Wilson with regard to these bottles.  They are used by what we call the manufacturing chemist or the packing chemist in Dublin. A packing chemist, as the term is generally understood, is a man who puts any of the drugs he will have to import &mdash;some of the ingredients which he uses are also manufactured in Dublin &mdash;into bottles.  He will have to import his bottles.  The materials bottled mainly consist of brilliantines, hair washes, cod-liver oil, cosmetic drugs and cosmetic preparations.  The merchant at the other side of the water who sends these preparations into this <Col N="1154" /> country, sends them in bottles which are free of duty.  The bottles cannot be found in Ireland, and the manufacturing packing chemist will have to import them from England.  The result is that he is under a great handicap. It means that he has to pay a very high percentage, 33? per cent. of the value of the bottle, and the trade cannot afford it.</P>
      <P>These bottles are not made in Dublin, and I do not believe, having looked into the matter, that it would be a commercial proposition for any bottle manufacturer in Dublin to manufacture these bottles.  They are very varied in size, and not only are they varied in size, but they are also freakish in size.  The moulds that would be required would be very expensive to make, and the quantity the Dublin packing chemists require would be too small to make it a paying proposition for any bottle-maker in Dublin to go to the expense of making moulds. Even at present there is no doubt there is no bottle manufacturer who can supply this want, and the result will be that if the Dublin manufacturing or packing chemist has to give up his trade&mdash;they say themselves they will have to abandon it until such time as the Dublin bottle-makers can make these bottles&mdash;he will lose it and lose it for all time.  I think if some provision were made either by exemption or by taxing bottles in such a way that it would put the Dublin chemist on a level with his English competitor, it will be a great advantage to him. Otherwise it will mean that these chemists will have to go out of the trade and that a lot of their employees will lose their jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with Mr. Wilson's ink manufacturing firm first.  Ink, as we all know, is generally put in tiny little bottles, that will cost 3d. per dozen when they are bought wholesale.  These are the ink bottles that are bought when full at 2d. each.  If a duty of 3d. per dozen is to be charged on these bottles, I do not see why this firm is going to be at any disadvantage at all.  I say the duties that are to be imposed on glass containers are an absolute necessity. <Col N="1155" /> To anybody coming from the part of the country from which I come, it is quite apparent that if this duty were not imposed, every trader from Dundalk to Londonderry who is engaged in any business along the Border, would be very seriously handicapped. That is leaving out the question of what comes in by sea or from England. This is a very fair duty, and I do hope that the Minister will not yield to any inducements that have been held out to him to remove this duty in any way.  I can say that the trade of all mineral water manufacturers who are bottlers on this side of the Border would be absolutely ruined if full bottles were allowed to come in across the Border.  It would be very easy for any trader to get in full bottles and to make at least 33? per cent. or more, perhaps, on these bottles, and have them for his own use afterwards. I think the duty is a very fair one, and that the Minister should insist on its being enforced.</P>

      <P>I would like to make it clear that Deputy Hughes has entirely misunderstood the suggestion I have made, and entirely misinterpreted the suggestion that I understood other Deputies had made. It is not to remove the duty; it is to extend it, which is quite another matter.  Again I would suggest to the Minister&mdash;I have got it down quite hurriedly, but I think it would meet the case&mdash;that after the words in the amendment &ldquo;at the time of importation any dutiable commodity&rdquo; the words be inserted &ldquo;or any commodity which is filled into bottles in the Saorstát.&rdquo;  That, I think, would meet the case, or if it would not meet the case, that is the intention, the point being that if a commodity is filled into bottles in Ireland the person who does that packing or filling should not be placed at any disadvantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise a further point before the Minister replies.  The Minister gave us a list&mdash;I am sure it could be extended to a very large extent&mdash;of small bottles that are brought in containing a small <Col N="1156" /> amount of dutiable material which, with this duty, become liable to 3d. per dozen, that is ¼d. per bottle.  I do not think that any of us could foresee as the result of that that there would be an increase in the price to the consumer of a farthing per bottle.  We know it would be heavier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps so. Take the case of any material made in Great Britain and sold here at a certain price.  When sold in bottle there is an increase in that price because of the bottle duty.  We all know that there would be an increase in the price to the purchaser because of that increase in the duty.  We all know, we expect it certainly, that it would not be a mere farthing but at least ½d.  That is to say, that the distributor would make out of this duty the difference between 6d. per dozen and 3d. per dozen, and that the consumer would pay the higher rate rather than the lower rate. I do not see why the revenue should not make that profit instead of the distributor.  I do not think there is any advantage to be gained in reducing the duties by a farthing per bottle. It simply means that the duty should not be of a less amount than that which may conveniently be added on to the price and turned on to the consumer.</P>

      <P>In regard to the point raised by Deputy Johnson we considered that last year, but when we had reached a certain stage it did not become necessary to consider it further. Therefore, as far as we have gone, we are satisfied that there would be hardly any circumstances in which it would pay to fill bottles with water, cork them, and bring over the extra weight.  We were also satisfied that if they contained water and not some commercial commodity, that most probably the Revenue Commissioners would be supported by the courts if they charged a duty in the same way as if they were corked full of air.  However, if it is a matter that it is thought we should consider more fully, we can go into it again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be looked into by the Revenue Commissioners.  In the case of bottles which are brought in in that way to escape the duty, we can remedy it.  A great number of medicines and toilet requisites are dutiable, and a great number of these contain either spirits to some extent, or sugar to some extent, and the people who bottle here will be in a very large measure protected by this tax on glass containers.  Cod liver oil is not dutiable, and there are a number of other things that are filled here which are not dutiable commodities.  The only way that can be met is by arranging that bottle manufacturers here will turn their first attention to producing bottles used in that class of trade.  We are satisfied that the glass factories will now be able to do work which they have not been able to do before.  The great handicap under which factories laboured in the past has been lack of capital.  They have been struggling along on the verge and have not been able to do the best that could be done owing to lack of capital.  They will now be able to get capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prospects which this particular tax opens up will enable them to get capital, and they will be able to take on the supply of the types of bottles needed.  We can only get them to give their first attention to the sort of bottles required for, say, ink or cod-liver oil, or other preparations. Deputy Dr. Hennessy referred to the need for medicine bottles, and he believes that it will be impossible for them to be supplied in any reasonable time here.  As a matter of fact, one firm which has been out of business and which, I think, will re-start, has moulds for 400 different sorts of medicine bottles.  As soon as the furnaces can be re-started it will be possible for them to supply a very great range of medicine bottles.  It may be that in certain classes of trade the druggists could not bear any tax, even in the meantime, but so far as bottles sold to persons getting prescriptions made up are concerned there is no doubt that the druggist makes a great profit.  The <Col N="1158" /> ordinary bottles, from two to eight ounces, are bought at prices ranging from 8/- to 14/- a gross, and they are sold at twopence a bottle.  They will certainly, so far as the filling of prescriptions is concerned, be able to bear the tax in the meantime, and I think it will be a very short time, indeed, until sufficient bottles can be made here to meet the requirements in that trade and to meet the requirements to which Deputy Figgis referred, and which are really concerned with the same trade.</P>
    <P>I did not say that the firms concerned would say that the rates we propose are high enough.  I do not think that we could propose rates that they would regard as being high enough.  We think that the rates we propose will suffice.  We do not want to make them higher than is absolutely necessary.  In cases where we are dealing with dearer classes of bottles, such as mineral-water bottles, you have to remember that the home-made bottle used by firms at home will be refilled a number of times.  In certain cases bottles belonging to a firm that has its own brand will not be used more than once, because we will not admit bottles of that sort empty free of duty on reimportation. The clauses regarding reimportation will not apply to them.  I do not know whether there are any classes of preparations where the effect which Deputy Thrift fears will take place. We know that in all these medicinal preparations the rates of profit charged are very high, and far beyond those charged in any other classes of business. I cannot imagine that threepence a dozen in their case would give any justification for an increase, or would go any way to make it necessary for traders to charge an increase of prices. If any difficulty were found to arise at any time before the Finance Bill enters on its final stages it is possible to introduce a supplementary resolution. Such supplementary resolutions were introduced last year, and if anything appears as a result of experience and practice to make it necessary, supplementary resolutions can and will be brought before the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he will take into consideration between now and the final <Col N="1159" /> Stage the matter of stamp duties on patent medicines.  I raised the matter some time ago and the Minister, I think, thought that the revenue derivable would not justify the imposition of a stamp duty, as has been the practice in England for a long time. Now we come to the imposition of a duty on bottles containing dutiable articles, and I think, in view of the immense consumption of patent medicines, the intrinsic value of which is very small and the cost to the consumer very high indeed, there is a source of considerable revenue which will be added to now by a duty on bottles.  That might help to meet some of the cases of the drug merchants and fillers of medicine in preparations of their own concoction.  It might assist to maintain their business.  I think the Minister would find a very considerable revenue would be derivable from a stamp duty on patent medicines and the additional revenue from the duties on bottles in which these medicines are imported.</P>

      <P>May I mention this point as we are taking all these amendments together?  Take one example.  As I understand the case put before me, the one firm I mentioned used 88 different sizes of bottles.  Some of these are not used in large quantities. Some of these are not even obtainable in England owing to their size and pattern, and they have to be got from Germany and Belgium.  Some of them are quite small.  The fact is it would not pay Irish manufacturers to make these bottles and to keep the furnaces or moulds going for these particular sizes and patterns.</P>
      <P>Surely, in a case of that kind, where the Saorstát manufacturer of bottles would be unable to supply a particular pattern, for it would not pay him to do it, the Irish manufacturer is, by the curious irony to which I have already referred, finding the British manufacturer protected against him, which is the opposite intention of the resolution.</P>

He mentioned certain articles such as boot polishes and sauces which are sold at certain prices in retail houses, and which leave a certain margin of profit. I am perfectly certain, and I think the Minister will agree, that the retailer will not be satisfied with one farthing less profit on the bottle than before this duty.  What he will do is to raise the price by one halfpenny.  I think the revenue might as well have the extra profit.</P>

He spoke of the different shapes of bottles.  There are other factors besides the shapes.  There is the material.  Some medicine bottles, particularly those that contain poison, are made of blue and amber glass.  That is a considerable protection to the public.

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that.  The other question is the accuracy of the size.  That is a matter of enormous importance to the doctor and to the patient.  The doctor prescribes some very potent drug, and he must know the exact amount of liquid in which it is going to be dissolved.  If the bottle is too small and the liquid in it too little, the amount of drug he prescribes might be very harmful to the patient rather than beneficial.  If the firm the Minister referred to is the same firm I heard of, I believe the bulk of their trade in the past was in bottles in which accuracy of size was not of great importance, such as bottles for cod liver oil.  It is a matter of very great importance to the physician, the chemist, and the patient, that there should be perfect accuracy in these matters.  I hope no impression will get about in the trade that anything will do in this matter, that you have only to make the medicine bottle, and that its size does not so much matter.  The Irish glass trade is the most optimistic, and the most fortunate in the world.  Every demand is going to be fulfilled in six or seven weeks.</P>

On the question of accuracy, I cannot speak for the factories.  That is not a question I am familiar with at the moment.

    <P>This deals with a special type of jar that is used for bottling fruit and vegetables, and is fairly widely sold throughout the Saorstát to housewives who want to preserve their fruit and vegetables.  It is made under patent. At present Irish glass manufacturers have no control over that patent.  They may possibly, under the Bill that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has had on the Order Paper for some time, acquire that power in due time. But will the Minister, if he is still infected with optimism, give me a pledge that that Bill will have become an Act, and the machinery contemplated by it set up, before this year's fruit is ripe&mdash;in other words, within six weeks? If not, it means that this cost is going to be passed on to the consumer and is going&mdash;I am almost weary of using the words&mdash;to increase the cost of living. It has been a real economy to people who have gardens to be able to bottle their own fruit in this sort of self-sealing jars.  They are specially made by an English firm under various patents, and there is no prospect of our being able to make them this year. Apart altogether from the legal question, it would need special machinery to make the jars.  I would urge the Minister to consider this amendment, if the words themselves are not too general, because last year he was urging us, and everybody was urging us, to revive the bottling of fruit. When we were taxing confectionery we were told: &ldquo;We may make some concessions for tinned fruit, but we want to revive the Irish bottling of fruit.&rdquo;  Now we are going to put 33? per cent. on the machinery necessary for bottling fruit, and it scarcely seems consistent.</P>

In any case, they will be able to bottle their fruit much more cheaply on account of the remission of the sugar duty.  The same applies to confectionery. There is a sugar confectionery duty of 3¾d.&mdash;an effective duty of 3d. on bottled fruit coming in.  That gives a considerable advantage to the firms bottling fruit here.  The decrease in the sugar duty increases the protection that they actually have, and they certainly will be able to afford to pay a little extra for the bottles that they may use.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil agree with the Committee in Resolution No. 10.&rdquo;  I do not know whether I explained in Committee that this resolution is necessary by reason of the fact that there is a gap in the sugar confectionery section of the Finance Bill of last year.  In that section it was provided that goods containing sweetening, other than saccharine, should be liable to the sugar confectionery duty, the idea being to charge goods sweetened with saccharine the saccharine duty, which was higher.  But the fact that goods are not liable to the saccharine duty unless they contain more than one per cent. of saccharine was forgotten.  The result was that manufacturers have been preparing a special brand of confectionery which contained some saccharine, but less than one per cent., and they have not been liable to the saccharine duty. This will make them liable to the saccharine duty where necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some matters that I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to in respect to changing the law and I am doing it now as I am hopeful that, before the preparation of the Finance Bill, the Minister will give consideration and probably effect to the suggestions that I wish to make.  One is a matter that I think ought to be dealt with at once. We are now engaged in the experimental period of tariffs and I think it is quite reasonable that there should be a body, not an official body, not primarily a Departmental body, but one representative of others outside the officials of the Department which would have access to all the information requisite to make enquiries as to the effects of the tariffs on the various articles, the effects on the prices here, the effects on the development of industry, the comparative conditions under which products are manufactured and prepared in this country and in rival countries, and generally to set up some kind of committee or commission to keep a watch upon the effects of tariffs for the next one or two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that it should be a body known to the public, known as a body of enquirers or examiners of the effects, and differentiating in that way from a purely departmental committee.  I would assume in any case that there <Col N="1168" /> would be departmental enquiries, but I think we should understand that there is to be formally established a committee or body of that kind who would have the responsibility of finding out and publishing some time after enquiries have been made, and perhaps periodically, the effects of the tariffs on the industries themselves, on the consumers, and on the persons engaged in the industries.  I would urge that upon the Minister, and I think it is one of these questions that can be well considered, say within the next month or two, and that we should have a carefully considered decision, perhaps before the Finance Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>There are three other matters that have been the subject of question and discussion during the last year which I hope will be dealt with in the Finance Bill.  One is the provision in the law. relating to the collection from employees by employers of arrears of income tax.  I think it was generally agreed outside the Revenue Commissioners, certainly generally agreed by employers and employees, that the provision in the Finance Acts which compelled an employer to deduct from the employees' wages or salaries arrears of debt due to the Commissioners, was one which could hardly be defended and certainly was only attempted to be defended because of the extraordinary circumstances.  I would hope that the Minister would insert of his own volition a section in the coming Finance Bill to repeal clauses of the last Bill in respect of this power over employers and employees.  It is quite unreasonable to throw the odium on the employer of having to collect taxes from workmen, and it is quite unjust to collect from workmen in that particular way, arrears of income tax. After all, it is a debt, and there is no more justification for making an employer a debt collector for the Government than there is for making an employer a debt collector for any judgment. I press that upon the Minister, and I hope he will insert a provision repealing Section 6 of the Finance Act of 1923.</P>
    <P>Another provision which I would ask the Minister to take note of is a small matter in its results, but particularly <Col N="1169" /> affects State employees.  There is a practice in Government Departments of charging twopence for stamp duty on receipts for the wages paid to State employees.  Nominally that duty is supposed to be paid by every employee receiving wages and giving a receipt, but, as a matter of practice, employees do not give receipts for wages and are not obliged therefore to pay the stamp duty.  In the case of State servants it appears they are obliged to give a receipt because they are paid weekly, fortnightly or monthly, and consequently there is a deduction of twopence.  It is a small item per week, but it is appreciable at the end of the year.  It does not seem to me to be reasonable that a duty of that kind should be imposed, when as a matter of practice, it is the employer who is getting the advantage.  He is getting credit, of one, two, three, four or six days sometimes, from the employee for wages due at the end of each day.  The employee gives credit to the employer, and, if wages were paid daily, no stamp duty would be required.  I understand also that this stamp duty is deducted in cases of pensions paid to soldiers and sailors and to others where the amounts are £2 and upwards.  As I say, it is a small matter and cannot affect the revenue very much.  It is one of the little unnecessary irritations, inasmuch as it can be imposed upon all wage-earners and should not be imposed on the few. There was an exemption given last year in the British Budget on this point, and I hope it will be inserted in the coming Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a matter, perhaps, of a little more controversy on which I think it is worth expressing an opinion at this stage.  The Minister made some references in his Budget speech to a proposal to regularise default in respect of entertainment tax by the G.A.A. As far as I can gather, it was his suggestion that entertainments promoted by that body only were to be exempted. I would like, at this stage, to put in a demurrer in respect to that.  I would say in parenthesis that the entertainment tax should be, and presumably was intended to fall, on the person paying admission.  Apparently in <Col N="1170" /> practice, in respect of sports at any rate, if not in respect of theatres, the associations responsible for the organisation of those entertainments assume that it is they who are paying the tax or the duties.  Whatever applies in the case of one association promoting a particular class of sport, applies to another association.  If it is being admitted by the Minister, that it is the Association that is paying the tax in the case of the G.A.A., it is equally true in respect of other associations. I would strongly press upon the Minister that if there are to be different exemptions in respect of the entertainment tax in future, they should not be confined to any particular association.  I do not think there is any principle of nationality involved in this.  I think, on the contrary, that it would be very derogatory to every other form of sport to except the particular type of game promoted by one association.  I am making this statement now because I think it might be sprung upon us in the course of the debate on the Bill.  We may not have the same opportunity to express our views as we have now, seeing that we have three and a half hours still to spare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I hardly think it is necessary to support Deputy Johnson, but it may be no harm for somebody who has been connected with athletics in his earlier life and who still has a great interest in them, to urge the Minister to weigh very carefully Deputy Johnson's plea on behalf of athletics.  We are all interested in athletics, and know that in Ireland at the present time they are rather in want of a fillip.  While we feel that and would welcome the remission of this tax from athletic bodies&mdash;they have felt it very severely for some time &mdash;I think we have a deeper feeling, and that is if the Minister had in his mind a proposition to relieve the Gaelic athletic body of this tax he would be doing a very damaging thing for himself, the Government and the rest of the country in legislating in favour of that particular branch against all other bodies.  I do not think he has that in his mind.  I do not think that the <Col N="1171" /> words in his Budget speech convey that.  Else I would have raised the point earlier.  I hope when he brings forward legislation he will make a remission which applies to all forms of sport, because sport is universal and not confined to any one country.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Johnson made a valuable suggestion about a committee. A committee of that kind would be very valuable to educate people as to the effect of these fiscal tariffs.  It may be said that such a committee should constitute itself and do that work itself, but if it had the sanction of the Dáil, its conclusions would carry more weight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been connected only with one form of sport since I was a youngster, and that is Gaelic sport. Until recently I had never seen Rugby, and I have not seen Soccer yet.  All my life I have been engaged in hurling, football, and what is known as Gaelic athletic sports.  We must admit there is nothing that goes so far to preserve the physique and health of the race and clean living and sobriety of our young people as athletic sports. Nothing will do more to keep away from the streets and use up the surplus energy of the young than sports. I think we would be confessing ourselves one of the smallest peoples in the world if we took the view only that one class of sport should have favourable treatment.  I am talking altogether about amateur sport.  What is known as professionalism is in a different category altogether.  We come down to something like a theatre there where people are making a living.  It is a profession, but amateur sport is on a different plane.  Anything the nation can do to facilitate amateur sport should be done in the interests of the nation, and State funds should be expended to keep our young people on playing fields of every description.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That will make for the health and for the physique of the race.  It will make for clean living and sobriety.  Everybody who knows anything about sport knows that, in its highest form, it has made for sobriety.  Amongst the ranks of the people engaged actively in sport, <Col N="1172" /> you will find more strict T.T.'s than amongst any other class of the community. The reason for that is that no man can excel in sport if he does not maintain a strict standard of living. That is the universal experience.  As one who has been engaged in one class of sport all his life, I appeal to the Minister to put all classes of amateur sport on the same plane.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say at once that I feel to the full the force of the case made by Deputy Johnson, Deputy Thrift and Deputy Gorey.  I do not see myself how there could be discrimination. The case of the G.A.A. obliged us to take this move.  If they had been paying the tax, I do not say that we should have made this remission.  But I feel that there is a good deal to be said for the remission; that athletics and the promotion of athletics are things that are of value to the nation in themselves.  The cost of this remission, if we apply it to Rugby, Soccer and any other games at which gate money is collected, will be about £10,000.  That will absorb practically the whole of the net surplus which was budgeted for.</P>
      <P>I think the suggestion, that a Committee should examine the effects of the tariffs during the years they have been in operation, is one for which there is a good deal to be said.  I undertake to examine the matter and go into it with my colleagues.  The two other matters that Deputy Johnson referred to are matters which I have had under consideration and about which I am not yet sure that I could agree to give way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one point mentioned by Deputy Gorey which I forgot to deal with&mdash;the question of professionalism and amateurism in sport.  I see the force of that difference, but whether it would be possible to make the distinction in administration of the tax is another matter.  An Excise Officer can walk into a place and see whether the tickets are being stamped or not.  He can see what class of sports or entertainment is being held, but whether he could say it was carried on on an amateur or professional basis is another matter.  Then, supposed amateur sport is sometimes really professional. <Col N="1173" /> In principle, I agree with Deputy Gorey's distinction, but whether the discrimination can be made in practice or not I cannot yet say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for making the suggestion is that where professional sport is started it is started purely as a living.  It is altogether different from amateur sport, and the two should not be put on the same plane.  Money is not made out of amateur sport by any individuals. Those who engage in it give their time and energy to it for the sake of the sport, without any gain to themselves. On the other hand, people engage in professional sport because there is money in it, and there is a living to be got out of it.  A distinct discrimination should be made between the two.</P>
