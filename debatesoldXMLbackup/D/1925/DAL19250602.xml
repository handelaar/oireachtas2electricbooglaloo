      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>William Behan, of Moorefield Road, Droichead Nua, lodged a claim to special benefit under Section 3 of the Unemployment Insurance <Col N="4" /> (No. 2) Act, 1924, at Droichead Nua, on the 17th December, 1924, on which he was paid special benefit to the amount of £2 7s. 6d.  Subsequent inquiry disclosed that the claimant resided with his brothers and sisters at Droichead Nua, that they kept three cows, the milk of which was sold, and that the claimant assisted on occasion in delivering the milk.  One of his brothers carried on business as a blacksmith, and prior to the claimant's period of Army service he had served as an apprentice smith with his brother for 3½ years.  His claim was disallowed and he appealed against the disallowance to the Court of Referees, before whom he appeared and admitted that he was now in exactly the same position as he was before joining the Army.  The Court of Referees held that if the claimant was remaining unemployed it was for the purpose of getting benefit and they recommended that the claim be disallowed on the statutory ground that claimant was not unable to obtain suitable employment.  This recommendation was accepted by the insurance officer and the claim is, therefore, disallowed.  The effect of this decision is that the claimant is liable to repay the benefit which he has already received on the claim.  The claimant is not charged with receiving unemployment benefit whilst working for his brother and the latter part of the question does not, therefore, arise.</P>

      <P>Thomas Ryan, Redgap, Rathcoole, unemployment insurance book No. Dublin/30439, claimed unemployment insurance benefit at the Dublin Employment Exchange on the 5th January, 1925.  The insurance officer, after full consideration of Mr. Ryan's circumstances, disallowed the claim on the statutory grounds that the claimant was not unemployed and not unable to obtain suitable employment. The insurance officer's decision was contested by Mr. Ryan, and referred to the Court of Referees, and finally to the umpire, both of whom agreed with the insurance officer's decision.  In the circumstances it is regretted that benefit cannot be paid on this claim.</P>

      <P>A complaint was received by the Insurance Commissioners from this man that sickness benefit, which had been paid to him by St. Finbarr's Diocesan Health Insurance Society for about ten weeks, was discontinued as from the 28th March, 1925.  Inquiries were made from which it appeared that the society were not satisfied that the claimant was incapable of work after that date, and they accordingly decided to discontinue payment of benefit. This information was conveyed to the insured person by an inspector of the Insurance Commissioners who, at the same time, explained that if he was not satisfied with the society's decision it was open to him to apply to the society to have the case submitted to arbitration, and if dissatisfied with the arbitrator's award, he could then appeal to the Insurance Commissioners for a final decision.  As it subsequently transpired that he had not availed of this right, but had engaged a solicitor to take up his case, a second visit was paid to him by the inspector, who made it clear to him that the proper method of settling the dispute between him and his society as to his right to further benefit was by arbitration and appeal as provided by the society's rules. Apparently, however, he has not made any application to his society for arbitration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to <Col N="8" /> move the Second Reading of this Bill. In doing so, I would speak for the moment merely of the legal position, which, I understand, is at present somewhat as follows.  The Commissioners of Public Works, on behalf, of course, of the State, have certain rights.  They have, for instance, the rights of management, and these rights, I understand, are very much the same rights that a private individual would have over a park of which he was the proprietor. As I said, I am speaking simply of the strict legal position and purely of the rights of management. They would have the right, therefore, to exclude undesirable people from the park; they would have the right of suing persons for trespass or actual damage done.  They might call upon the police, or their representatives might call upon the police, to prosecute for actual breaches of the law. Now, that is so far as management is concerned.  It is a different thing when you come to the question of the present existing rights, the rights, for instance, in regard to leasing or letting any particular portion of the park for any particular purpose.  That power, of course, is affected by the Constitution and the Acts which follow.  They have no power, naturally, of alienation or alienating any particular portion of the park.  It may be that they have power to cut off certain roads from public use for a certain period of time. That is the strict limit of the legal rights of the Commissioners of Public Works.  Of course the moral power to exercise any of these rights is an entirely different matter.  In many cases a government, no matter what the government is, must often be slow to exercise even the strict legal rights that it possesses.  It must be guided by a sense of what is proper, and also public opinion is bound to exercise a great influence over its decision.  That was seen in the last century, and even in portion of the present century, in the case of the Board of Works.  It was not even the strictly so-called Irish portion of the Government; it was directly under the Treasury, and yet in most cases it did act on the idea that the Phoenix Park was a public park in the sense that it was intended for the <Col N="9" /> enjoyment, the recreation of the people of Ireland, and especially of the people of Dublin.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the present Bill is to more effectively secure the enjoyment of the Park for the public.  That is the significance of it.  You have here something new, as it was not law in connection with the Park before.  Now Section 3, sub-section (1) definitely lays it down that the Commissioners shall maintain the Park as a public park for the general purpose of the recreation and enjoyment of the public, and may maintain a particular portion of the Park for any special purpose for which the same or other portion of the Park has been hitherto used for such like purpose as the Minister shall sanction. That is not a mere pious expression of opinion.  It means that when an application is made to the Commissioners of Public Works, their guiding rule must be in the acceptance of that principle. For instance, if an application is made that a certain portion of the Park be set aside for a certain purpose, they must be guided in their decision on that matter by the general principle, namely, the keeping of the Park as a place of public amusement and recreation.</P>
      <P>The enjoyment of the Park by the public must, therefore, be the first consideration. You have a similar provision regulating Stephen's Green, in the Stephen's Green Act.  That, for instance, would decide the Commissioners if a proposal were made that various erections might be put up&mdash;statuary, monuments, and so on&mdash;in Stephen's Green.  If that would unduly interfere with the enjoyment of Stephen's Green by the public, undoubtedly the Commissioners would be bound to reject a proposition of that kind.  The Bill, in its efforts better to secure the continued enjoyment of the Park by the public, falls into two parts, so to speak, in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned a few moments ago Stephen's Green Park.  There is, of course, this difference, even so far as the public is concerned, between the Phoenix Park and Stephen's Green Park: in the case of the Stephen's Green Park, a number of the things allowed in the Phoenix Park must be <Col N="10" /> excluded.  The Park in Stephen's Green is a place where people may go to enjoy the air, the music, the flowers, and so on; but games obviously cannot be played there.  That is not so in the case of the Phoenix Park.  It has been the custom, in connection with the Phoenix Park, that certain games can be allowed there.  Horses can be trained; football, hurling, cricket, and polo can be played, and in winter time there is sometimes skating.  There are certain portions of the Park set apart for this particular purpose.  It only requires a moment's consideration to see that if certain portions of the Park are set apart for football, there must be, to a certain extent, an exclusion of the general public from these particular portions.  The idea is that the Park shall be used, not merely as a recreation ground in the more general sense where people may enjoy the air or take walks, but that it shall also be used as a recreation ground in the sense of providing playing-grounds for the great bulk of the people of Dublin.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of local exclusion is in that sense necessary.  It would not be right to allow horses to be exercised over the football grounds when a football match is actually being played, say, on the public football grounds there.  When a football match is in progress on the public grounds I am speaking of now: during that time the public must be excluded from those particular football grounds.  Hence it has been the custom to make leases and lettings in the Park.  These leases and lettings are of two kinds, one of which gives the exclusive use of a certain portion of the Park to certain clubs.  Anybody who has been in the Park will have seen instances of that.  The other is of the more general type, such as the public football grounds that I mention.  Generally speaking, the exclusive use of a particular ground is given to a club for a period of the year. So far as that power is concerned, it has been used with considerable discretion in the past.  It is probable the Commissioners have come in for more criticism over their failure to make use of their powers in this connection rather than their too great readiness to set apart portion of the Park for various <Col N="11" /> purposes.  In this Bill power is given to the Commissioners, acting under the authority of the Oireachtas, and incidentally more immediately under the authority of the Minister, to make lettings for this purpose.  For instance, a demand was put up quite recently for a public athletic training ground.  If I recollect aright, it was referred to in the House on the occasion of last year's estimates.  It may be taken for granted that in the future, even more than in the past, power of this kind will only be used with the greatest hesitation; that is, any encroachment on the use of the Park by the general public will, at all times, be granted only in very exceptional cases.</P>
    <P>The other purpose of the Bill is to give permission or authority to the Commissioners to make bye-laws for the preservation of order in the Park and to see that the ordinary public can enjoy the Park without unduly having their rights interfered with, or their amenities disturbed, by the thoughtless and the unruly.  Those bye-laws will be submitted, as the Bill lays it down, to the Oireachtas.  It is definitely laid down in Section 10 that every bye-law shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  It enables also penalties for the breach of these bye-laws to be determined.  There is a need of having some such power.  You have it practically in every other Park.  You have it in the case of Stephen's Green, and all the public parks in England and in Scotland.  The need for this has been recognised for the past 50 years in the case of the Phoenix Park.  Actually the Irish Executive never found time to put a Bill through the English Parliament to secure that power.</P>
    <P>Very often the existence of these bye-laws is in itself quite sufficient.  Only very rarely, for instance, in the case of the Stephen's Green Park, is it necessary to propose that the penalty shall be enforced.  Generally it is sufficient for one of the guardians of the Park to bring an alleged offender to the place where the bye-law is displayed and point out to him that he is guilty of a breach of the bye-law.  Generally <Col N="12" /> speaking, the matter ends there.  The existence very often of these bye-laws, with appropriate penalties, is sufficient to secure the purpose.  In that connection it will be seen that we claim, under this Bill, as little as possible.  Any interference with the individual; any interference there is, is, of course, in the interests of the general public.</P>
    <P>There is one matter that may possibly give rise to a certain amount of doubt, and it might be no harm to have an expression of opinion on this particular point, namely, the power claimed by the Commissioners on certain occasions to close the Park altogether and to charge a fee for admission.  Take a concrete case, to make it clear.  When the Motor Union was anxious to get the permission of the international body which controls motor racing to have one of the races held here in Dublin, the only enclosed space in which they could reasonably be expected to hold it was in the Phoenix Park.  They then made a suggestion that they should be allowed to hold the races in the Phoenix Park, but they pointed out that in order to make the races a success and in order to fall in with the conditions laid down by the body having control of international motor racing, that they would have to put up prizes of a considerable amount.  They would also have to undertake rather elaborate arrangements in the way of fencing off certain roads.  They calculated that in doing that they would have to incur considerable expense, and they held if they could not be given the power, if the Board of Public Works had not the authority to give it to them, or having the authority, would not give it to them, they could not make up the necessary sum.  The only way they could raise all that sum would be from gate money.  I am not speaking personally on the subject of whether or not if the Commissioners of Public Works had the power they should exclude the public even for a purpose of that kind.  There would be no private gain, but I think the policy would be open to question as to whether they could exclude the public and charge for admission even if they had the power.  The Bill now suggests that it should be left to the good sense of the <Col N="13" /> Government to give this power in the occasional cases which may be necessary. I think I have dealt with the general scheme of the Bill and I move that it be read a second time.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to the Bill in its general purposes, but there are a couple of points which I think would require clarification.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be agreeable to have defined in the Bill certain limitations.  It is proposed that the Commissioners shall have power to issue licences in respect of the exclusive occupation of any portion of the Park for particular purposes, or to exclude the public from the portion of the Park to which such licence relates.  It authorises persons to fence off portions of the Park.  In so far as that applies to the fencing off, the allocation of certain places for particular purposes which are not likely to exclude the public from the free use of the Park, but are merely intended to allow particular clubs or associations to have primary use of the Park in these areas&mdash; the portion referred to in the licences&mdash; I have no objection, but under these provisions I can see that we will be granting the Commissioners power to erect barriers and to levy a toll in any portion of the Park for particular games or any other purpose, in fact, so long as it is subject to section 3&mdash;recreation and enjoyment.  I think that we should ask the Parliamentary Secretary to agree to the inclusion of some limiting phrase, sub-section, or proviso, which will mean that the licences shall not exclude the public, or shall not make provision for charging a fee in any portion of the Park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings us on to the question the Parliamentary Secretary has touched upon regarding the power to charge a fee to admit into the Park itself.  I can imagine circumstances arising which would make it legitimate and not unreasonable that some kind of power of that sort should be retained, but even there I think there should be some limit. It should either be subject to the sanction of the Oireachtas, or there should be some limit of time, a very narrow limit, too.  I do not know whether the Minister has thought of the possibility <Col N="14" /> that under these sections, the Commissioners, while maintaining the Park for the general purpose of recreation and enjoyment, might still lease over the exclusive use of portions of the Park to societies or clubs, and only allow the public admission into these games or entertainments on payment of a fee. Apart from that view I have no objection to the Bill in general, but I think that it would be well if we could hear from the Parliamentary Secretary whether he would be prepared to accept any limitations to the powers of the Commissioners in respect of these matters I have touched upon.</P>

      <P>A Bill for the regulation of the Phoenix Park is, of course, necessary.  Of course, all parks should be under regulations, so that there can be no doubt as to any particular matter in regard to their management.  I think that it would be well to consider the matter carefully before we put any power into the hands of the Commissioners to charge a fee for admission to a public park.  It seems to me to be contrary altogether to one's idea of what a public park should be.  I never heard of a fee being charged for admission into any other public park.  Of course there may be circumstances that we do not know of in regard to the Phoenix Park, but I think it seems rather treading on the liberty of the people of Dublin to make them liable to pay a fee to go into a park which they are already paying to keep up. There is also another aspect.  I think that the Phoenix Park is the biggest park in the world, practically.  To charge a fee to get into the Park would not bring in any money.  It would be very difficult to enforce any fee for admission considering the size of the Park, and there would be more money spent in enforcing the order than would be got in carrying it out.  Apart from that, I think that we should consider the matter carefully before we make any rule in regard to charging a fee. It seems too much like treading on the liberty of the subject.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what exactly he meant when he used the <Col N="15" /> words &ldquo;to give power to enter into agreements and to make leases&rdquo;?  What was in his mind when he was talking about making leases to any person in connection with a public park?  Is it proposed for any period of time to lease to anybody or to any company any portion of the Phoenix Park?  I have a reason for asking that question, because I remember some two years ago somebody mooted the idea that portion of the park might be rented, with some of its lodges, to certain horse-trainers.  I think it would be a deplorable thing that any portion of the Phoenix Park would be leased for any length of time to any private individual, even for a horse-training establishment.  I heard it mentioned, and when I heard the word &ldquo;lease&rdquo; mentioned just now I thought the point should be cleared up.  What power is there missing from the old Act governing the Phoenix Park which the Government now want?  It is not right to give any authority to anybody to charge the public for going into a park for whose upkeep they are paying by way of taxation.  As to the question of horse-training, I heard it mentioned in this House two years ago that certain people thought some lodges there, with ground attached, would be very suitable for a horse-training establishment.  I would not like to see any portion of the Park railed off for any such purpose.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Wolfe that the public rights to the Phoenix Park should be jealously guarded.  We are all very proud of the Park.  But I think the Minister is quite right in securing to the Commissioners of Public Works the right to let the Park for a day or a week for a great national or international purpose. Deputy Wolfe said we should not close the Park to the Dublin people.  Supposing the Tailteann Games were held here again on a far larger scale, might it not be necessary to have a park like the Phoenix Park in which to hold them?  Who would be more anxious to see the Park used for such a purpose than the people of Dublin?  It would be unfortunate if <Col N="16" /> the by-laws governing the Park did not enable the Commissioners to let the Park and charge for it on a great occasion like that.  I would be strongly in favour of having such a power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephODoherty" hpid="Mr. O'DOHERTY Mr. O'DOHERTY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DOHERTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with the criticism of Deputy Johnson and other Deputies, but while guarding the rights of the public to the Park it would be no great hardship on occasions, such as mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary, say, for international races, to allow the Park to be used for a strictly limited period.  In Section 5 the Commissioners take power to let the grazing of any portion of the Park for less than a year.  That is of some importance, because at present the grazing by cattle is interfering with the amenities of the Park.  In connection with the proposed regulations, the Parliamentary Secretary should take note of that.  For instance, if instead of being grazed with cattle it were grazed with sheep, it would not interfere, say, with the Nine Acres, where the people most congregate to play in the summer time with their children.  At present the amenities of that portion, which is probably the prettiest part, are destroyed for the people who make use of it.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which frequently occurred to me in regard to the Park, particularly when allotments were being cultivated.  Between Park-gate Street and Chapelizod, along the Magazine Road, which is one of the most beautiful portions of the Park, there is a considerable stretch of land between the Magazine Road and the wall, which on account of the slope there would be ideal for allotments for flowers.  In Nottingham they have such a piece of land laid out, and it is one of the prettiest sights I have ever seen to go up to Bluebell Hill, which is very similar in its position to the Park, and see acre after acre of flowers grown there by the townspeople.  In drawing up the regulations, I think the Parliamentary Secretary should consider whether it would not tend to the improvement of the Park to make use of it for that very excellent purpose.</P>

      <P>The question as to whether grazing by cattle <Col N="17" /> or sheep would be the best is not a matter I can pronounce upon.  Some people think that on the whole sheep might be more objectionable.  On account of the disease which makes its appearance from time to time amongst sheep it might not be advisable always to let the grazing purely for sheep. As to charging for admission to the Park, that is a power that the Commissioners ought to have.  I agree, however, with Deputies that it is a power that ought to be very rarely exercised.  Personally, I am not very keen on exercising it on any occasion. It is a doubtful question whether, even in the particular case I mentioned of motor races, the public should be excluded. It was put up to us, however, that unless there is that power of charging, and unless the gate money can be got, those races cannot be held.  So far as the Commissioners are concerned, it will be a question of deciding which way the public would get the best value out of it on that particular day or days &mdash;two at the outside.  Undoubtedly there is a case for it, as a spectacle will be provided which will afford enjoyment to large numbers.  On the other hand, there will be the objectionable practice of charging for entrance even in that particular case.  If we had the power, a very good case would have to be put up, even in that instance, to have the Park gates closed and an entrance fee charged.  It would be different in the case of motor cycles. There is no such proposal in that case. The public will simply go in and enjoy the racing.  That would, undoubtedly, be an attraction of an unusual kind on the one occasion on which it might be held.  There is no proposition in that case to exclude the public or charge them for witnessing the event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other is entirely different, and a strong case might be put up for it.  In any event, when there is a proposal to charge a fee a very strong case will have to be put up before permission could be given.  So far as the question of charging fees is concerned it is done in the case of the Zoological Gardens. Fees are charged and are allowed to be charged, and no doubt that privilege will continue, as no one would seriously <Col N="18" /> suggest that it should be done away with.  In the case of any further leases giving permission to people to charge fees, I think such a proviso should be laid on the Tables of the Oireachtas.  As to the question of leases in general that Deputy Byrne raised, it was raised on more than one occasion on the Estimates. Why should these two or three places, such as the Chief Secretary's and the Under-Secretary's Lodges be kept idle at a cost to the State to maintain them?  Would it not be better to lease them?  As regards athletic grounds, leases and lettings are necessary; otherwise it will be impossible to utilise the Park for that particular purpose. When the Deputy asks: &ldquo;Why not use the powers the Commissioners had,&rdquo; he means the powers they had before the passing of the Constitution. I doubt if they have any such powers at present.  Therefore, they had no power in that particular connection.</P>
    <P>So far as the limits that Deputy Johnson suggests are concerned, I think, as to the closing of the Park, it should be only for a very short time. The only concrete instance that I had before my mind was the particular matter that Deputy Sears, and that I also, referred to.  In connection with the Tailteann Games the possibility of closing the Park for International motor races that it was intended to promote in connection with the Games came up.  That was the only occasion when permission might be given for one or two days, and it would be exceptional, as the events would not take place every year.  I would consider the other point about the exclusion of the public from viewing games.  At present it is not contemplated that the public should be excluded from viewing any games on account of the nature of the barriers put up.  What we had in view was that the power that was previously in existence should be, practically speaking, continued.  The second purpose the authorities had in view was that they should be in a position to make bye-laws that could be enforced. At present possibly they can make bye-laws, but they certainly cannot fix any penalties or enforce them.</P>

      <P>I have not heard any reasons given why these words should be inserted. There is nothing in the Land Act that would indicate the necessity for them. As far as I can read, no good reason has been put forward here or elsewhere why this provision should be inserted. Obviously, it is one of the conditions which the British authorities have laid down before they would agree to give this guarantee.  Unless some reason is shown why there should be a limit of eighty years imposed, I think we ought not to agree to the insertion of these words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I do not think these particular words will operate in any particular way. The position is more or less as Deputy Johnson stated, that the British guarantee will be given if, amongst other things, we provide for the establishment and regulation of a sinking fund for the purpose of redemption at par of the securities to be guaranteed within a period of eighty years.  I think all the securities will actually, under the <Col N="20" /> arrangement existing, be redeemed before eighty years.  That does not appear distinctly on the face of the Bill. The period of the bonds is arrived at by making certain calculations, and these are complicated in certain respects when dealing with untenanted land and taking into account the period of the issue of the bonds.  In order to secure the guarantee the bonds must be issued within a period of eighty years.  If land purchase were not completed within eighty years, any bonds which might be issued might be bonds which could not obtain the British guarantee, and would be bonds which would be lesser in market value than those previously issued.  It seems to me that we might possibly be able to convince the British Treasury when we were asking them to proceed to give their guarantee that the provisions of the Land Act as it stands mean that the bonds will be redeemed within eighty years.  We want to put the matter beyond doubt, and we are specifically providing that the arrangement shall be that they shall be redeemed within eighty years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what Deputy Wilson's arguments would have been, but as far as I can see the principle proposed in the Bill is this, that thirty years must elapse after the issue of the bonds before the State has legal power to redeem them.  Of course they may purchase them quietly in the market, but it will not be possible for them summarily to redeem the bonds before the expiration of thirty years, that is if the holders are inclined to hold them. Of course money may not always be quite so dear as it is at present; the time may come when money may be had for 3½ or 3¾ per cent.  In fact, <Col N="21" /> from the present tendency of the British Government it may be taken that within the next few years you will have conversion loans at a modified rate of interest.  The five per cent. War Loans will automatically become due after 1927, I think, and the British Government, if it so wishes, can redeem them after 1925.  But after 1927 they can offer to redeem them, and the holders must surrender them at the redemption value.  I think, in view of this, that the Government would be well advised not to make this a thirty years' period, that it is rather too long in view of the approaching cheapness of money, and that it would be best not to lay down a specified time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that I have anything to add to what has already been said in reference to this proposal of Deputy Wilson.  A certain misunderstanding, I think, did occur in the previous discussion.  I do not hold that we are in any way bound in honour as a State to take steps to secure the British guarantee for these bonds; I think that it is purely a matter of expediency and interest. But we are, in arrangements that concern ourselves, in things that are wholly within our own power, I hold, bound to endeavour, so far as we can, to see that our bonds are kept up as near to their face value as possible.  I do not think that it is at all admissible for any Parliament or any Government to desire and to try to arrange for the depreciation of its own bonds.  That would be exactly the same thing as arranging for the depreciation of your currency.  These bonds are issued at a rate of interest that is certainly not unduly high.  If we do not provide for their redemption at par, there is, of course, the first obvious point which arises in connection with the matter that we are now considering, that the British guarantee will not be available. There is also the further point that the reason why we were asked by Deputy Wilson to eliminate the provision for redemption at par was that he wished the bonds to fall in the market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>You can redeem at par by drawings.  If the price goes above par, of course drawings are not a factor.  But the whole argument that Deputy Wilson put forward was that we should not do certain things, because if we did we would raise the price of our bonds above some depreciated price at which they otherwise would be.  That is, he argued that we ought to take a certain line with the idea of letting our bonds sink below their face value.  It seems to me that a State simply cannot carry on on that basis; a State cannot afford to do the shabby tricks to which some disreputable money-lender might resort.  Any failure, in my view, to do things that we are competent to do, as far as our internal arrangements are concerned, with the object of having our bonds to sink below their face value, is entirely wrong.  I might point out in this connection that the provision already exists in Section 1, I think, of the Land Act of 1923, for the redemption of bonds at par.  It is now proposed in this amendment that we should strike out the provision.  We have actually gone a certain length in the issue of bonds.  So far they have not been allocated and issued to the individuals, but they have actually been created in the books of the Bank, with the provision that they shall be redeemable at par.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wilson asks us to strike out the provision for redemption at par with the idea that by doing that, amongst other things, we should cause our bonds to depreciate.  That sort of thing would certainly be in the nature of sharp and shabby practice.  I have no belief that this House, or any other House likely to be elected, would agree to that proposal.  Certainly if a <Col N="23" /> Government is to use its powers for the purpose of escaping obligations that it has itself created and undertaken, you would have an atmosphere that would do very great injury.  I do not know whether Deputy Wilson could put up any other kind of argument in favour of this or not if he were here, but he has spoken at length on this Bill on two or three occasions, and I have heard nothing else suggested by him.  It is undoubtedly a fact that, as I say, apart altogether from the question of our inability to get a British guarantee if no provision is made for redemption at par, making a provision in the way that Deputy Wilson would desire would have the most prejudicial effect on the bonds, because the only thing then that would be certain about them would be that they were to bear interest at 4½ per cent., but from every other aspect they would be very undesirable as an investment, and they would go down even to a more serious extent than has been indicated in discussions here.  We talked about the manner in which they would go down if there was no British guarantee, but if you add to the absence of a British guarantee such a provision as this regarding redemption, there is no doubt that the bonds would go down in the most serious way.  I think that the whole attitude of Deputy Wilson in this matter is so grotesque that it hardly merits a serious answer or serious consideration.</P>

If you take out that and consider the rest of the amendment I think, perhaps, it would be acceptable. In conjunction with the other part the amendment is certainly objectionable. Without the other part it is not so objectionable, and, as a matter of fact, I think it would be very commendable.  I can understand the price of those bonds when issued not reaching par, or anything near it.  When they come on the market, provided the Government has money accruing from the <Col N="24" /> Sinking Fund, would it not be good business for the Government to keep them as near par as possible, and would it not pay them to buy them in?

      <P>The British Government Bonds issued in connection with land stock fell to 47 in some cases, and they ranged about the price of 50 to 52 for a long time.  Would anyone say in the ordinary course of affairs that the British Government would be doing wrong or be guilty of sharp practice if they went into the market and bought up these cheap bonds?  It is quite possible that they did it.  How does anyone know who bought them up?  I think the same liberty should be taken by you.  I think it would be good business from the State point of view to buy up bonds when they come on the market in order to keep up the price of bonds.  I do not think such an action would be sharp practice or discreditable either to the State or the individual.</P>

      <P>The Deputy overlooks the fact that the whole point of Deputy Wilson's amendment goes if you make arrangements for redemption. The Land Act provides that every penny of the Sinking Fund which becomes available will be used for redemption purposes.  If the bonds were to sink below par in spite of any precautions we could take it certainly would be better for the Government to use any funds it has to buy them up on the market.  That is a thing the Government will and can do.  For instance, money that comes into the Savings Bank can be invested.  We can invest that money.  There are also other monies like teachers' pension funds and various departmental funds, all of which can be invested in any securities the Minister for Finance thinks are desirable.  These funds will be invested, and will be used for the purpose, amongst other things, of supporting Government securities like those which temporarily are sinking below par.</P>

      <P>I do not consider it my bounden duty to take up the cudgels for Deputy Wilson, but I think he has been done a great injustice by the comments made on his speech in this matter here, and particularly in the public Press.  So far as I can understand Deputy Wilson's argument, it is that the practice which the Minister now confesses has been carried on for some time might be continued in respect of this particular stock as well as any other stock.  I think it is unjust to charge him with having said he desired deliberately to set about a scheme for depreciating the value of those bonds.  I think I am correct in saying that he did no such thing.  Are we to understand, apart from this question of redemption at par out of the land bonds fund, that the State is not going to buy any?  We might have understood that twenty minutes ago, but we know now that other funds under the control of the Government may be used to purchase land bonds to have the same effect that Deputy Wilson argued would arise from the adoption of the argument he used.  But indignation was expressed the other day when it was suggested&mdash;that most horrible thought&mdash;that the benefit of the market for land bonds if there were a depreciation should be availed of for the interests of the farmer purchaser. That is bad presumably, but it is all right when the State for other purposes comes and purchases at a low price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I maintain, in the absence of Deputy Wilson, so far as I have understood Deputy Wilson, that he made no suggestion of any kind that would warrant the statement that he desired that State ingenuity should be used to depreciate land bonds so that they could be bought <Col N="26" /> in cheaply.  He did suggest that in the absence of artificial means of sustenance such as is provided for in this Bill, they might be purchased at the market price.  The Minister proposes to sustain those bonds by artificial means and make it difficult to purchase them even through those subsidiary State funds.  As I said in the beginning, I think Deputy Wilson's case has been misstated.  He has been charged with having advocated that the State should scheme for the purpose of reducing the value of the bonds in the market and buy them in cheaply.  I think that is unjust to Deputy Wilson.</P>

      <P>This provides for a very considerable simplification of the Bill as originally drafted.  It is followed by one or two other amendments.  It means that where there is a charge against an estate a certain amount of bonds shall be allocated to meet that claim, and that interest shall cease to be payable against that claim from the date of vesting, and that the person shall be entitled ultimately when he gets his bonds to get the interest that accrued on them from the date of vesting. As a matter of fact, the original Act was rather obscure on that point, but what we now provide is in accordance with the decision that has been given by the judicial commissioner, but we want to put the matter entirely beyond doubt for the future as well as for the present by making this particular provision in Section 4.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That to remove doubts it is hereby declared and resolved that so much of Section 69 of the Local Government Act, 1925 (No. 5 of 1925), as enacts that for the purposes of the assessment and levying of certain rates the valuation of certain buildings under the Valuation Acts shall be deemed to have been reduced by two-thirds does not and shall not apply to or operate to reduce the annual value with reference to which the tax in respect of such buildings under Schedules A and B of the Income Tax Act, 1918, is to be ascertained, and it is hereby further declared and resolved that, notwithstanding the said Section 69 but <Col N="33" /> without prejudice to the proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 187 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, the annual value of such buildings  for the purposes of the  of the said tax be taken  the full amount of the valuation thereof for the time being in force under the Valuation Acts.</P>
    <P>The necessity for this motion arises out of Section 69 of the Local Government Act which was recently passed. That section provides that for the purpose of local rates the valuation of certain buildings during a period of years should be taken to be one-third of the actual valuation.  However, in the drafting of that provision sufficient advertence was not given to the wording of the Income Tax Acts, and, in consequence, doubt has been raised whether it actually does not mean that the reduction is also for the purpose of income tax as well as for local rates, as was specifically intended.  The position is that that would cause a loss of income tax which had not been anticipated or budgeted for if the courts were to hold that view.  It would mean also that the Exchequer was losing revenue without any corresponding gain, whereas if the local authorities lost two-thirds of the rates they would have got something on new buildings, whereas, from the income tax point of view, if money which was paying full income tax was removed from investment and was put into buildings, it would pay income tax at only one-third of the Schedule A rate.  In order to remove the possibility of the courts interpreting this particular section of the Local Government Act in a way that was not intended, it has been felt advisable to have a declaratory resolution moved here and to put a corresponding section into the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>(a)  if the articles are prescribed in the official import lists to be entered on importation by weight, a duty at the rate of one penny on the pound,</P>
      <P>(b)  if the articles are prescribed in the official import lists to be entered on importation by measure, a duty at the rate of tenpence on the gallon.</P>
      <P>(2)  That the duty mentioned in this resolution shall be in addition to any duty chargeable in respect of any spirits or saccharin contained in or used in the manufacture or preparation of the article but in lieu of any duty which might otherwise be chargeable on any other ingredient contained in or used in the manufacture or preparation of the article.</P>
      <P>(3)  That the provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall not apply to the duty mentioned in this resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dealt with this particular matter to some extent on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill.  There are a large number of articles which are subject to Customs duties because of the sugar they contain.  They include all sorts of miscellaneous articles, from pills coated with sugar to blacking containing a certain amount of sugar for the purpose of producing the shine on shoes. In the past we actually had the formula examined and an analysis made, and we charged on the actual sugar content. For the purpose of convenience a particular thing was taken, say, such-and-such a firm's blacking, or such-and-such <Col N="35" /> a firm's pills, and we fixed a rate for them, and when these goods came in they were charged with these conventional fixed rates.  Occasionally samples were taken of the sugar contents of the particular articles to get a rate fixed, and the manufacturers had to supply the formula to us, and guarantee not to alter it, but if they did alter it they had to give notice to that effect.  That system was very costly, and gave a great deal of trouble.  The average pre-Budget charge on these commodities was 11s. 2d. per cwt.  It is proposed now by this resolution and the corresponding section in the Finance Bill to have a flat charge of 9s. 4d.  The preparations will only get a slight benefit of something like 1s. 10d. per cwt. from the sugar reduction.  On the other hand, the importers will escape a great deal of the trouble they experienced in the past.  There will be no question of samples or supplying the formula and abiding by it.  The goods will be admitted on a charge of one penny per lb., and in many cases that will ease the importers as much as if they got the full concession that the reduction of sugar duties would give them.  It will also relieve the Customs people of a great deal of trouble and expense.  If we charge on the sugar content at the rate of one penny a lb., it is estimated that the money collected will be £6,000 a year, and the cost of administration would nearly eat up that £6,000.  The estimated duties on this proposed change would be £14,000 a year, and there will be a very substantial saving in the cost of administration. Less staff will be employed and less time will be taken up in calculating this 1s. 2d. duty, and also the staff in the State Chemist's office will be relieved of a good deal of work.  I think this is a change that will meet with a fair amount of satisfaction on the part of importers as well as from an official aspect.</P>

    <P>Rates of Firearm Certificate Duty.</P>
    <P>1.  For a firearm certificate for a rifle or a pistol or revolver, with or without ammunition therefor, 5s.</P>
    <P>2.  For a firearm certificate for a shot-gun, with or without ammunition therefor, limited to use for killing animals or birds other than game on land occupied by the person to whom the certificate is granted, 5s.</P>
    <P>3.  For any other firearm certificate&mdash;For one such certificate, £2.</P>
    <P>Where two or more such certificates are granted to the same person (not necessarily at the same time) and expire on the same date, for the first such certificate, £2.</P>
    <P>For the second and every subsequent such certificate, 5s.</P>
    <P>A new scale of licence charges is set up in connection with firearms.  Heretofore a person who had firearms for the purpose of use on his own lands was not liable to pay any duties.  There was then a 10/- licence duty, and there was, in addition to that, £3 for a game licence duty for the full year, and £2 for certain parts of the year.  The duty was £3 if the licence was taken out after the 31st July and to expire before the 1st November of the following year. Then there was a fixed licence of £1 for a continuous period of 14 days. There was a scale which exempted altogether guns used in one's own house or curtailage, which imposed 10/- on guns used outside that, but not for the purpose of killing game; and £3 per annum if used for the purpose of <Col N="37" /> destroying game.  Now we are substituting the new scale which is set down in the resolution.  There will be for a firearms certificate for a rifle, pistol or revolver, with or without ammunition, a fee of 5/-.  The idea of that is that there should be a register of all the firearms in the country, and that people should not have a right to have firearms without being registered and having a certificate.  I think that is a provision that will appeal to all the Deputies in view of the experience we have had in recent times, and since the trouble ceased.  It is fairly obvious that it is desirable that the police should have as complete a knowledge as possible of the firearms in the country.  It is proposed for a shot gun, with or without ammunition therefor, limited to use for killing animals or birds other than game on land occupied by the person to whom the certificate is granted, that the duty shall be 5/-.  The same remarks apply to that: it is desirable that these guns should have certificates issued in respect of them, and that full particulars should be known to the police.</P>

      <P>There are provisions, I think, in the Firearms Act that will cover that.  This particular Resolution is really supplementary, or complementary, to the Firearms Act.  These licences will be issued by the Civic Guard, and the fees will be collected by and accounted for by them to the authorities.  For firearms other than a rifle, pistol, or revolver, or other than a shot gun used on the farmer's own land for the purpose of killing vermin, there will be a certificate charge of £2.  That really corresponds to the game licence, and represents a reduction of £1.  It is felt that people who desire to kill game might be reasonably expected to pay a fee of that amount, and that the reduction which has been given is as substantial as is warranted by the circumstances. It is not desirable that people should <Col N="38" /> be able to get licences for a merely nominal sum to kill game.  The matter of taking reasonable precautions for the preservation of game is difficult enough, and if there were not some substantial fee required for licences the difficulties would be very much increased. Then where a person has a second firearm, say a second shot gun, there is simply a fee of 5s.  A man may have, say, two guns for the purpose of killing game, and the charge for these would be £2 5s.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete in the schedule the rates of &ldquo;£2&rdquo; and substitute in each case &ldquo;£1.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has spoken of the person who gets a licence for a firearm to kill game, and he thinks that the £2 is not excessive for that.  He has also referred to the issue of a certificate for a shot gun, limited to use for killing animals or birds, other than game, on land occupied by the person who receives the certificate.  He has not made any suggestion as to the fee that should be charged to a person who wants to kill animals or birds, other than game, on land not occupied by himself.  The only provision that is made in such a case is for the £2, which will allow him to kill game.  There are people who do not want to kill game, but who want to shoot rabbits or wild fowl, and who are prepared to pay a fee, but the fee of £2 is considered excessive. A case was brought to my notice last week of a man living in the country who had spent £5 on a gun, for which he had been granted a licence.  &ldquo;Now I am asked,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;to pay £2 per annum for the use of that gun.  I have no land, but I am able to shoot here and there, and to get an odd rabbit or bird which I am allowed to shoot.&rdquo;  The case, I think, the Minister has made leaves a lapse. There is too much of a gap between the 5s. for a man who is going to shoot on his own lands birds other than game, and the man who wants to shoot birds and animals other than game and has no land at all.  My proposal is to reduce the fee from £2 to £1, leaving for later consideration the cost of a firearms certificate for the person who <Col N="39" /> wants to shoot game as well.  I understand that hitherto the charge has only been 10s., and, consequently, we are allowing, under this amendment, an increase of 100 per cent. in that particular direction, and that seems to be a reasonable increase.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I will have to defend the rates for the licences contained in the resolution, inasmuch as I have helped to suggest them.  In the past, the magistrate's licence was given free to the owner of the lands to destroy vermin on his own lands.  If he wanted to take the gun outside his own lands he was supposed, at least, to take out an excise licence, which cost him 10/-.  A good many of these excise licences were availed of, but the trouble was that the holders did not end with killing vermin.  That 10/- licence became, in fact, a game licence, for which £3 was supposed to be paid.  The result was that we had no game in the country. In fact, the game died an unnatural death&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Even with game licences, I suppose they would, but it was apparent to anybody who took any interest in the matter that if we were going to preserve the game in this country, and if the game in this country were to mean anything to the national revenue of the country, drastic steps should be taken to preserve it. The manner in which game is preserved strikes one when travelling outside this country, say, on the Continent.  If you take the French Republic, or any of those democratic countries, you will be surprised to see the amount of game they have.  Another country that is not a republic&mdash;I speak of England&mdash;surprises a traveller at the amount of game that is to be met with in the fields, and the small quantity of vermin. There is no doubt whatever of the great national asset game is to a country if it is well looked after, and there is no doubt about the amount of damage that vermin do to the country. In the past those people who took out this 10/- licence paid no attention to vermin.  Their whole attention was directed <Col N="40" /> towards game.  The holders of the 10/- licences were really killers of game.  It was thought that a £3 licence was too much to ask the ordinary individual in the country to pay for a game licence, and in order to meet him it was brought down to £2.  In order to do away with the deplorable practice that was responsible for the destruction of game in the country, the Committee recommended that the 10/- licence be abolished.  I hope that this scale, and some other recommendations that were put up to the Minister for Justice, will be carried into effect. These matters do not come under this motion, of course, but I would, all the same, like to mention that the Committee recommended that the sale of game be prohibited in this country, and that the exports of game from the country be also prohibited.  Anybody who is really out for sport can then go out and shoot game without any reference to the market value of game, and with no aim except sport.  We recommended that remedy for three years, and I hope it will be carried into effect.  I stand for the Resolution, except for that part of item No. 3 which deals with the second and every subsequent certificate. I think it is rather too high for the licence for the second gun.  I agree with Nos. 1 and 2, but where a man takes out a £2 licence, it is, I think, rather too much to expect that he should also pay a licence for the second gun.  I think he has done very well if he paid the £2 licence for one gun. Very few people who care about shootting are confined to one gun.  I will stand for the rest of the Resolution.  I want to hear more from Deputy Johnson before I agree to what he proposes.  We either want game in this country, or we do not.  A cheap licence to carry a gun will mean the extermination of game in the country, because the people who take out such a licence will go out and kill game.  We want to preserve the game in the country. Up to last year and the year before, there was a good stock of game in the country.  But last year game was practically wiped out in most counties, though at the beginning of the year there was a good stock of game in many districts.</P>

      <P>There are, as Deputy Gorey knows, large areas in this country where no game is to be found, but where extensive wild-fowl shooting is to be had, and districts along the sea-coast, for instance, and in marshy areas of the West especially, where a good deal of wild fowl shooting is to be had, and where there are people who indulge in that form of sport.  In other areas, where there are rabbits, a man might travel for the greater part of a week and not see any trace of a game bird.  There are undoubtedly such areas in the country, and I think that fact ought to be taken into account. Ten shillings was a fair amount for a man engaged in the shooting of vermin or wild fowl to pay.  Now the proposal is to put this fee up to £2 before a man can use a gun outside his own land at all.  I think Deputy Johnson's suggestion is a reasonable one in the circumstances.  I think some intermediate figure should be taken to meet the cases of those who engage in wild-fowl shooting and the shooting of rabbits outside their own lands.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the attention of the Minister to the cases of people who are precisely sportsmen.  I refer to fishermen on the north-west coast.  According to the schedule, as I read it, these men would have to take out a licence for £2 for using a rifle.  If that is so, I think it is rather a hardship.  I am not quite sure whether No. 1 or No. 3 deals with these people.  No. 1 is, I think, a licence to hold a gun.  No. 3 is a licence to carry a gun.  Those men who fish along the north-west coast have to carry rifles for the destruction of seals, who are doing so much harm to the nets.  In the north-west, seals have become such a nuisance that they not <Col N="42" /> only destroy the nets of the fishermen but the lobster pots.  To cope with that, the fishermen carried rifles. During the time of the Great War the rifles were taken from them.  Since then the seals have multiplied and have become so daring that they are destroying the fishing.  I would like to know how this resolution will affect them, or will they be obliged to pay this fee for carrying a rifle for the destruction of seals.</P>

If he is crossing from his farmhouse to the opposite side of the road with his gun and if an excise officer comes on the scene, the man is liable to prosecution for carrying a gun on the public road.  Is not that so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the old law, the magistrates took that into consideration. The same rule could apply now. Some instructions could be sent out to that effect.  If some of the suggestions which have been made were carried out, there would be great difficulty in enforcing the law.  If you made exceptions in certain localities, or if you made provision for exceptional cases, it might prevent the law being enforced altogether.  Certain facilities might be given.  But they should not be provided in the Act.  They should be the subject of arrangement between those in authority and individuals.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell's speech brought to my mind the necessity for State aid, or encouragement in some form, to get the public to destroy vermin.  In England, certain weeks have been set aside for dealing with certain classes of vermin. Clubs and members of the public generally go out during these weeks and shoot vermin.  That, I think, is the only effective way of dealing with the matter. For instance, if everybody went out during the same period, pigeons could be kept on the wing and could be destroyed wholesale.  That is the method adopted in England.  You see very few magpies or hawks in England and you see very few rabbits except where they are kept specially for sale. The State could also deal in that way with cormorants.  Anybody who wanted a bit of fun could go out with his gun during the period set apart for their destruction.  The cormorants would be bound to land some place and could then be dealt with.  A well-thought out scheme, following the example set by other countries, would effect what Deputies have in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much to add to what Deputy Gorey has said in defence of the scale laid down here. <Col N="44" /> The view of the Department of Justice is that the 10/- licence in the past was really disastrous and that it was the holders of this class of licence who did the damage to game.  The holders of these licences shot game wherever they came across it and they took the best steps they possibly could to come across it.  The 10/- licence was in operation when the value of money was greater than it is at the present time. I think the £1 licence at present would only be the equivalent of the 10/- licence in the old days, and the figure is hardly high enough.  It is because of that, and with a view to restricting the number of people who carry guns, other than those who desire to kill vermin on their own land, that this scale was devised.  It is felt that if you make it easy for people who are not really interested in game, people who have not in any degree the sporting outlook, you will have game destroyed whether it is in the close season or not.  That, it is thought, was done to a large extent by the holders of the 10/- licences in the past.  I believe myself &mdash; and it is certainly the view of the Department of Justice&mdash;that to reduce this £2 licence would destroy the results which are looked for from the operation of this new scale.  The point raised by Deputy Crowley is, I think, met sufficiently by the wording of the resolution, which states: &ldquo;For a firearm certificate for a shot gun... limited to use for killing animals or birds other than game, on land occupied by the person to whom the certificate is granted...&rdquo;  If he went on to the public road, I do not think it would be held by a court that he was using the gun improperly.</P>

I would have thought the wording of this resolution was satisfactory enough.  I will have that point looked into.  I do not think it was contemplated in the Firearms Bill that people holding firearm certificates should be entitled to pass firearms around to those in their employment, and, from the point of view of controlling and regulating the carrying and use of firearms, it would be undesirable that that should be done.  If the employee of a farmer is to have a gun for any purpose it would be desirable that that person should hold a certificate, and that his name should be registered in the local police office.</P>

      <P>It is absolutely necessary to give effect to what Deputy Wolfe said, because it very often happens that the owner of the land could not handle a gun at all.  It is generally his son or one of his employees who handles the gun.  The Minister did not reply to my point regarding a man taking out a £2 licence being obliged to pay 5s. in respect of a second gun.  I would ask him to look at that matter in a broad way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Five shillings is not a serious impost, and it is desirable to get a complete register of firearms in each district.  There is a certain amount of labour involved in connection with that.  If a person has one gun and then comes along and buys a second gun, he has to get some sort of certificate for it, and it is felt that, merely from the point of view of recouping the cost of dealing with the matter, there should be a charge for each gun. Each gun will have to be registered. There will have to be a certificate in respect of the second gun as well, and some charge should be made for that. It would not, I think, be desirable to go below the charge of 5s.  You might have the case of a man with a half a dozen or a dozen guns, and it would not be desirable that that man should <Col N="46" /> hold all these guns for a single payment of £2.  The only point that seems to me to arise is the one that was raised by Deputy Gorey as to whether 5s. was excessive.  As regards that, I think some charge ought to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is excessive, especially when you remember that the individual concerned has taken out a £2 licence.  I do not see the necessity for this charge of 5s., unless it be that the Government want to get a list of the guns in the country.  That, of course, is a different matter, but for revenue-making purposes I do not think this is a fair charge at all.  It would be a great hardship on a man who had taken out a £2 licence to compel him to pay a special fee of 5s. for every gun he kept.  That is not fair at all.  There are some men who go in a lot for game shooting, and, as we all know, they keep three or four guns.  If they had to pay this extra duty it would, in my opinion, be most unjust. I hope the Minister will consider these points.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gorey stated that the holders of the 10s. licence were the people who killed all the game in the country.  I would like to know from the Deputy, or the Minister for Justice, how they propose to confine the man who now gets a 5s. licence to his own land, or from shooting game that he comes across outside of it.  That seems to be the objection to giving the 10s. or £1 licence proposed by Deputy Johnson.  If what Deputy Gorey says be true, we will have under this what we have now: no one will take out more than a 5s. licence, and will simply trust to luck to get all he can on his own land, and, when the opportunity offers, all that he can get outside of it.  It seems to me that this scale of fees is not going to improve matters, so far as the preservation of game is concerned.  I think this question of fees is one that ought to be reconsidered.  I would not suggest, without further consideration, that the 5s. fee should be raised as a remedy.  I leave Deputy Gorey to consider that.  I really think that the £1 licence without the permission to shoot <Col N="47" /> game, or with permission in the case of the man on his own land, would meet the situation better than this proposal. I do not think that the object which the Minister and, indeed, all of us have in mind, namely, the preservation of game, is sufficiently met by this arrangement.</P>

This is primarily not a finance matter, but a matter for the Department of Justice, and I certainly would not like, without consulting the Minister for Justice, to agree to any substantial alteration in this scale which has been laid down.  The difference between the 5/- licence holder proposed to be created under this, and the holder of the 10/- licence in the past, is that the holder of the 10/- licence was fully entitled to go outside his own land for the purpose of shooting.  The 5/- licence holder will not be entitled to use his own gun outside his own land, and consequently there will be a much greater possibility of detecting him and of preventing him from destroying game.  I do not think we need anticipate that the holder of the 5/- licence we are considering here, will do very serious damage in his own district, where at any rate a watch can be kept upon him by the Civic Guards.  With regard to the 5/- fee for the person who keeps three or four guns, that is a matter that can be considered.  I only suggest that some fee should be <Col N="48" /> charged.  The amount to be charged is of lesser importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know at what stage we are in with regard to this particular vote.  I want to draw attention to a certain phase of the Supplementary Estimate, Property Losses Compensation, 1916, Rebuilding Grants.  It has been represented to me as an anomalous state of things that in <Col N="51" /> this compensation in regard to 1916 there was a complete refusal to make any payment of compensation to the proprietors of Liberty Hall.  As a matter of fact their claim for compensation for the damage done to Liberty Hall was refused consideration, because it was outside the terms of reference. I gather that the explanation in respect to the damage to Liberty Hall was that the terms of reference confined any claim to the property of persons who were not implicated in the rising.  Now the proprietors of Liberty Hall were the Transport Workers' Union, and they were just as much implicated in the rising, and just as little implicated in the rising, as many another firm or person who received compensation under the scheme.  I am told for what it is worth that the only application for compensation refused on these grounds was the Transport Workers' Union.  It is rather strange that of all the people who obtained compensation under this scheme the only persons who were refused compensation on the ground that they, or some of them were, were implicated in the rising seemed to be this case, where prejudice had entered into the consideration of the claim.  Whatever may have been the composition of the Committee that considered this matter in the beginning, there is a reasonable case for the present authorities to consider that claim.  The fact, I suppose, that influenced the tribunal was that Liberty Hall rather stood dramatically before the public in respect of the occurrences round about the rising.  But I do not think that that should be sufficient to prevent their claim being considered.  I would ask the Minister to state what is the position in regard to claims under this Vote, and whether a claim which was refused on the ground that the people concerned were implicated in the rising and outside the terms of reference cannot now be reconsidered.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that is a matter to which my attention has not been directed heretofore, and I can only promise the Deputy that I will look into it.  So far as the provisions of the Supplementary <Col N="52" /> Estimate is concerned, it means simply that there are certain liabilities which the British Government acknowledged and which will fall due to be paid some time.  We have undertaken that we will make the payment. The outstanding amounts are about £45,000.  So far as £30,000 are concerned we will make the payments, and the British Government will recoup us directly.  So far as £15,000 more is concerned, the British Government set off against our undertakings to do that, certain matters due by us, to them, some time, in connection with compensation, and the matter is simply now one of adjustment as to the payment, but no new liabilities have been undertaken. The whole matter, of course, was dealt with long before the Saorstát came into being and did not come under my notice in any way.  I was not even aware of the fact as stated by Deputy Johnson, but I will have it examined and I will either write to the Deputy or, if he prefers to raise it on some other occasion, I will be prepared to deal with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>On this matter, I ask the Minister if he would try and arrange to have these claims for the destruction of property settled as expeditiously as possible.  There are delays which, to my mind, need not occur. I will give a case in point.  In the year 1920 some property belonging to the Nenagh branch of the Transport Workers' Union was destroyed by British forces.  A claim was lodged for £24.  About a fortnight ago the local secretary was informed that there had been an award of £12 for the destruction of their property, and a receipt form was sent to him to sign, and he was told when he signed that receipt form and sent it on the money would be sent to him.  But instead of the money he got a letter dated 27th May acknowledging receipt of his letter relative to the compensation claim and requesting him to be so good as to return the form with the statement in the margin showing (a) the date and nature of the loss or damage, the amount of compensation claimed, and the name of the person who lodged the claim for compensation on behalf of the <Col N="53" /> branch of the Union.  I cannot understand why a letter like that should be sent out at this stage.  All this information was sent to the Department two or three years ago.  They had already decided on the amount of the compensation they would allow; they had even sent out the receipt to be signed by the secretary, stating that when it was sent back the money would be forwarded, but instead of getting a paying order the secretary gets this letter asking him to send particulars of the date of the losses and so on.  This is not an isolated case.  It is typical of a number &mdash; I admit it is a small number &mdash; that have come under my notice.  It is very vexatious to be waiting for close upon five years for compensation for furniture and books destroyed and to have this thing happening.  I hope the Minister will look into the matter and see that it will not occur again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to mention that my attention has been drawn to several cases of delay in the payment of grants that have actually been awarded.  I have actually received one by post now.  Possibly it will serve as a typical example. I need not mention details of the case. In connection with it, there is one letter dated 12th August, 1924, and it was sent to the solicitor notifying the award of the grant, and enclosing certain forms that had to be signed. The solicitor wrote on the 2nd October, 1924, and again on the 5th November, 1924.  One or two claims that I have in mind have been settled.  With regard to this particular claim, a letter was written on the 25th November, 1924.  That was acknowledged.  He pointed out that a receipt was actually signed for the amount, and actually forwarded in October, 1924.  That was acknowledged by card.  He wrote again on the 29th November, 1924, and got no reply.  He wrote again on the 6th January, 1925, expressing great surprise at not having some acknowledgment. He got no reply to that, and has had no reply up to the present. That is according to the statement I have got.  That is one case. The delay in that case is greater than <Col N="54" /> in any other case I have come across. I must say there is a great deal of delay, though I can quite understand there must be some delay, as there are so many cases that have to be dealt with.  There are, however, some instances that have come under my notice where one cannot really see any excuse for such unreasonable delay in paying awards already granted.</P>

      <P>Deputies can readily understand that I could not, without notice, explain the details of any particular case.  I have no idea of what underlies the procedure Deputy Morrissey has indicated; I am not able to hazard any guess in regard to it.  I would like to say that in general there is very little delay in the Department of Finance &mdash; very little unnecessary delay.  It may occasionally happen that, through some particular point being raised, a claim gets set aside, as it were, and there may be some delay that, perhaps, could not be fully justified. Generally, however, awards are dealt with fairly expeditiously when they come from the Courts or the Compensation (Ireland) Commission.  In the case that Deputy Morrissey has referred to, the claim was lodged three or four years ago, but apparently it has only been dealt with by the Compensation (Ireland) Commission. That may have been because it came within the new terms of reference, and not the old terms of reference.  Consequently it could not have been dealt with until a few months ago.  Even there is very great delay in having cases heard either before the Compensation (Ireland) Commission or the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not raising any objection to the delay in having the cases heard.  My objections arise because the awards were made, the receipt was actually sent out, and then we get this letter asking for particulars which were supplied three years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, there has been great delay in having cases heard either before the Commission <Col N="55" /> or the courts.  The courts were absolutely congested with these compensation claims and very great delays often occurred before cases could be heard.  Even when cases were heard, and even when the judge gave his decision, the proper steps were not taken, in some instances, by the solicitor for the applicant in order to have the decree prepared and the judge's signature secured.  There were even many months of delay between the hearing and the determination of a case, and the date of the receipt of an award by the Deparment of Finance.  Once the award is received by the Department of Finance, certain enquiries have to be made and an interval of time has to be allowed to elapse to ascertain whether any people have acquired a legal claim against the award.  That interval of time is allowed in order to enable them to write to the Department and to prevent the amount of the award being paid to some applicant who has already received some money on account of the award from some other person, who may, perhaps, have advanced money against the award.  All that takes time. Then in every case enquiries have to be made in regard to income tax and other matters, and there is a delay of a few weeks between the receiving of the award and the time that payment is actually made.  In some cases there may be features of a peculiar character that would take them out of the ordinary routine for the purpose of securing a decision.  In cases of that character there might be some delay.  In general, however, there is very little delay and the sum that would represent awards actually in hands and not discharged would be quite a small sum indeed at the present time.</P>

We find that out of 14 members of the Labour Party 3 are present, <Col N="56" /> out of the 15 members of the Farmers' Party 3 are present, out of the 19 members of the Independent Party &mdash; the people who are supposed to look after the financial interests of the community &mdash;one is present to look after this Vote of £3,675,300, and of the Party who are supposed to support the Ministry, 5 members are present out of 60.

    <P>The amount of this Vote has decreased by a very large sum.  In fact, it practically represents the last that will be seen in the Dáil of any applications for monies for personal injuries. Certain small recurrent payments will have to be made for some years, but they will be of very minor importance.  There is a decrease of £585,000 in the amount asked for in sub-head (a).  That is the sub-head under which the different cases between the date of the setting up of the first Dáil and the date of the Truce are dealt with.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4 of the working arrangement, arrived at immediately after the Treaty, provided that the British Government and the Saorstát should each pay the amount of compensation for personal injuries due in respect of their own supporters.  That is, that there should be what is called a &ldquo;back-to-back&rdquo; arrangement.  It is provided further that in the case of people who could not be shown to be supporters of either side &mdash; neutral cases &mdash; there should be a sharing of responsibility. There is a large number of cases in which enquiries have hardly yet been completed and in which the responsibility has hardly been arrived at, but the matter is really on the point of decision.  Roughly one-half will be accepted as British, and the other half as Saorstát supporters.</P>
    <P>Sub-head (b) deals with post-Truce cases.  Under this sub-head the decrease is £272,000.  The Saorstát Government is responsible for payment of the full amounts awarded by the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee in respect of deaths from injuries sustained between 12th July, 1921, and 12th May, 1923.  This sub-head includes provision for about £4,000 for <Col N="59" /> the payment of periodical allowances recommended by the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee.  Although this will be a recurring charge, it will, I think, decrease fairly rapidly. In general the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee recommended the payment of lump sums, and there were only a comparatively small number of cases in which periodical payments were recommended.</P>
    <P>There is a small item of ex-gratia payments made by the British Government to non-combatants who sustained injuries in Easter Week, 1916.  That was part of the arrangements in regard to compensation which were arrived at by the British Government.</P>
    <P>This Vote, as I said, is practically a disappearing one.  There will probably be a very small amount, indeed, for next year.  The Committee which was set up by the Executive Council to investigate personal injuries cases had a very heavy and thankless task.  It is much more difficult to find a basis for making awards in dealing with personal injuries than in dealing with property cases, and it is much harder to satisfy the applicants.  A great deal of criticism and a great many complaints have been made because large sums were not awarded in cases of death where people dying did not leave dependents. We frequently find the brothers and sisters of a man who was killed entering very strong protests at only being awarded a sum which was really meant to cover funeral expenses. A great number of these cases were brought to my notice personally with a view to having them referred back to the Committee for reconsideration.  In dealing with these cases more than any others, I felt the difficult and thankless nature of the task that was undertaken by the Committee.  If one looks at it without consideration, it does seem strange that a person should be awarded £500 for the destruction of a house and perhaps £50 for the loss of a son.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Or perhaps £10.  I feel the line that was taken by the Committee, and which was imposed on them by their terms of reference, was <Col N="60" /> the only possible one.  We certainly cannot undertake to pay people for sentimental or emotional losses.  You cannot pay people for what they may have suffered in feelings.  You cannot replace a son or a daughter, and if the son or daughter were not making substantial contributions to some other people, who were in part at least dependent on them, there is no basis on which you can assess compensation. You cannot say to some person: &ldquo;We know you have lost your son; your son is irreplaceable; but we are going to give you £500 by way of solace.&rdquo;  We definitely set our faces against solace of that sort, and I think that that is the only possible line that could be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criticisms that have been levelled at the Committee who undertook this very troublesome, thankless and difficult task, were criticisms that were not really justified.  They were criticisms that arose through people not giving proper consideration to the cases they were sometimes championing. I believe that the Committee performed their task in a most conscientious and admirable way, and that genuine cases of hardship through the death of a breadwinner, where there was a widow or family of young children, were dealt with on as adequate a scale as they could well be dealt with. On the other hand, the interests of the State and the general public were safeguarded, and payments were not made for trivial injuries, or in cases where no damages that could be measured in money were sustained.  Certain people were kicked, beaten or given a few cuffs by the Black-and-Tans, and they claimed very substantial damages. These people suffered no loss of earning capacity; they suffered no permanent injury.  It is simply again a question of indignity in a great number of cases.  They were, however, loud in their complaints because they were not awarded substantial sums.  This Government could not afford, and could not have the taxpayers paying substantial sums for such things as that.  Cases were submitted to me frequently for reference back to the Committee, and I did ask the Committee to reconsider certain cases, but the net result of the <Col N="61" /> most careful examination I could give to the cases was to confirm me in my idea of the fairness of the Committee and of the competent way in which they discharged their task.</P>

The total sum involved for superannuation charges in respect of these services amounts to £2,069,797.</P>
    <P>Under sub-heads (a), (b), (c), (d) of this Vote provision is made for the payment of pensions, allowances, and gratuities payable to Civil Servants who have retired from the various Departments, except the Post Office, on or after the 1st April, 1922.  Sub-heads (a) and (b) show the provision made for pensions, additional allowances and gratuities payable to civil servants who shall have retired for the end of the present financial year, in the normal course under the existing Superannuation Acts.  Sub-heads (c) and (d) show the provision made to cover expenditure likely to arise in connection with the compensation payable to persons who retire from the Service&mdash;except the Post Office&mdash;under Article X. of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>The figures up to the 27th of last month show that 795 persons have retired from the service of the State in consequence of the change of government. Of course that includes discharged cases as well as people who retired and took the Treaty terms. There were 325 retirement cases.  The discharged cases amounted to 470 altogether, and were made up as follows:&mdash; Resident magistrates, 36; petty sessions clerks, 305; crown solicitors, 23; Marlborough Street Training College <Col N="63" /> (which was closed), 53; various Local Government officials, including commissioners, inspectors, auditors, pharmacists, 12; a permanent member of the Congested Districts Board and a solicitor, 2; one under-secretary, who was performing no functions after the setting-up of the Saorstát; one metropolitan magistrate; some fourteen messengers and cleaners in the Supreme Court, and some twenty-three other miscellaneous officers.</P>
    <P>From time to time there has been a great deal of discussion in regard to these discharges, and it has been suggested that a policy of wholesale discharges was being pursued merely with the object of providing places for other people.</P>
    <P>I think Deputies will realise that at the time we set up the district courts, when we had simply the Army in some parts of the country, when we had no police forces, but were beginning to send out the Civic Guard, it would have been impossible to pursue any other course in regard to the resident magistrates and the petty sessions clerks. If we had endeavoured to carry on with the resident magistrates it would certainly have been impossible for the district courts to function.  If we had carried on even with the petty sessions clerks, the possibility of the Civic Guards being able to do their duty under the courts and for the courts to carry on their work would be greatly lessened.  Of the 470 people whom we discharged, 341 were resident magistrates and petty sessions clerks.  The Crown solicitors were also involved, as it was simply a question of getting confidence in the new courts, and getting them established and to work.  It was just as necessary that a new body of State solicitors should be set up as that a new body of district justices should be appointed.  Altogether some 364 of the 470 discharges were discharged in connection with the courts. There were others that I have referred to who were redundant, the messengers and cleaners, and one metropolitan magistrate.  The discharges in connection with the courts amounted to about 100 people, and 53 discharges arose through the closing of Marlborough <Col N="64" /> Street Training College, which became unnecessary under the new circumstances.  I think these figures amply demonstrate that there was no such thing as a process of dismissals for the purpose of providing positions into which favoured people might be put.  This is a matter that has been dealt with on other occasions, but like all false rumours and charges, when once started it is very difficult to overtake and kill.  It is probably no harm to refer to it again.</P>
    <P>The figure in connection with the Post Office corresponding to the total of 795 is 658.  I think that there were practically no discharges in the Post Office.  The big majority, if not all, were people who retired to take advantage of the Treaty.  I think they were all men.  Under sub-head (j), provision is made for the continuance of pensions that have already been granted to 455 resigned and dismissed R.I.C., and for the grant of pensions to a certain number of other cases which are still under consideration.  The cases still under consideration include, roughly, eighty-five resigned and dismissed members of the R.I.C. who are at present in full-time employment in the Gárda Síochána.  Naturally their pensions, except to a small extent, will not become payable during their period of employment in the Gárda Síochána. A certain proportion of the pensions will be paid to bring them up to the amounts that they would have had if they had had their R.I.C. service added to their Gárda Síochána service, and had reached the point on the scale to which that combined service would have brought them.  However, that is only a small part of the pension that would have been payable in a great many cases.  There are certain other cases of resigned and dismissed R.I.C. still under consideration.  Under sub-head (k) a sum of £100 has been inserted. That is really a token figure. The only charge at present borne is one annual allowance granted under Section 4 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923.  As I have already indicated, on the amalgamation of the D.M.P. and the Gárda Síochána, opportunity was taken to amalgamate the pension charges for both these forces under sub-heads (I) and (II) of the <Col N="65" /> Estimate.  A pensions order was framed in the past year, providing for the superannuation of members of the Gárda Síochána, but naturally the bulk of the provision taken under these two sub-heads (I) and (II) is in respect of members of the former D.M.P. force. The latest figures we have show that up to the present 568 members of the late D.M.P. force have received awards of pensions under Article X of the Treaty. They include one Chief Commissioner and one Assistant Commissioner who were discharged.  The remainder were inspectors, station sergeants, sergeants and constables, who retired in consequence of the change of Government. The retirements were eleven inspectors, twenty-six station sergeants, ninety-five sergeants, and 434 constables.  Sub-head (m) represents the payment under the liability that was undertaken in the Treaty.  It has been arranged that the Saorstát liability in respect of the ordinary and disbandment pensions of the R.I.C., excluding persons recruited in Great Britain during the two years preceding the Treaty, that is the Black-and-Tans for whom we have no responsibility, is on the assumption that seventy-five per cent. relate to Saorstát Eireann and the remaining twenty-five per cent. to the other part of Ireland.  The present amount of these pensions and disbandment allowances is approximately £1,690,000.  Seventy-five per cent. of that is £1,267,500, but that, of course, is liable to reduction by the re-employment and deaths of disbanded members, and it is estimated that one million and a quarter will suffice to cover the amount required for the current financial year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want a brief explanation from the Minister as to when he proposes to deal with the outstanding cases for which a provision of £70,000 is made in this year's Estimate.  I have had seven or eight cases from my own constituency in hands for the last three years.  In three cases decisions have been given by the Minister; in the other four decisions have been held over, and I submit that in all fairness three years is long enough to give either the Minister or the officials <Col N="66" /> of his Department to deal with a few cases of that kind.  If the cases were looked up it would only take about ten minutes for the Minister to give some ruling and to make a decision one way or the other.  The Minister did give an assurance some time ago that all those outstanding cases would, as far as he was concerned, be settled one way or the other by the 30th April.  Now he states that there are eighty-five cases confined to the Gárda Síochána.  I dare say that there are not any great grounds for complaint in these cases, but he says that there are still a number of other cases under consideration, and I would like to know how long it will take him to come to a final decision, seeing that he has been three years considering these few applications still outstanding.  There is, I suggest, something radically wrong, or somebody behind the scenes holding up the Minister from giving proper consideration to these cases.  I have been wondering whether or not they were being held up so that in the end a sufficient amount of political influence would be brought to bear on the Minister to give either a favourable or unfavourable decision in the cases still outstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one type of case which I think constitutes a grievance.  It only concerns a few people who have served the State very well when the State was in a difficulty, and they have not been very fairly dealt with.  I will quote one case as an example.  A man held a position as inspector in the Intelligence Department in Oriel House. He held a good position, but he thought he would serve the country better by joining the Army voluntarily. He joined the Army, and was eventually disbanded, like all the other good people who were disbanded in the general demobilisation of March, 1924, although they were the men who had done most for the country, and eventually the Minister decided that he should receive a pension under Section 5 of the Superannuation Act.  The Minister, in his discretion, I think very unwisely used, when paying the arrears of the pension, deducted from this man the difference between the pay he received in the Army and the <Col N="67" /> pension he was entitled to during his service in the Army.  That was most unfair, as the man was not aware that it would be done, and no regulation was issued at the time he joined the Army to show that he would be dealt with in that way.</P>
    <P>That is only one of the cases of men who volunteered to serve the State, and who served it well when the State was fighting for its very existence.  I put that case to the Minister in order to bring under his notice a matter which I believe has already been brought under his personal notice, to show the injustice of the treatment meted out to individuals, and to express the hope that he will reconsider the matter in the light of the circumstances that this man had to face.  The man, while acting as an inspector in Oriel House, was, by a lucky accident, saved from being killed.  Certain individuals, who were termed Irregulars or Republicans, actually went into Oriel House one night and fired at him while he was at his desk.  He escaped by accident and by good luck, and he has received that treatment from the Minister after he served in the Army. I draw the attention of the Minister and of the House to this case, which, I believe, is one of glaring injustice and is certainly not a case that a man with a good record in pre-Truce days would look upon in an unfavourable light. I put this to the Minister as one example of a few cases that have been dealt with in that way that should be reconsidered, and also to learn from him definitely as to when these few remaining cases that have been under consideration for three years will eventually be decided, one way or the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had time to deal with any cases for some weeks back.  Up to that I spent, every week, a considerable amount of time in examining those cases.  I can assure the Deputy that this is a sort of Act that requires more time from a Minister than most Acts.  There are a great number of individual cases that present peculiar features and the file must be read by the Minister.  It has thrown more work on me personally than Acts which would involve very much greater <Col N="68" /> expenditure.  There are peculiar difficulties in very many cases.  For instance there are the medical gratuity cases where people persuaded the British authorities that they were medically unfit to serve, where they were discharged as medically unfit, and received gratuities of two or three hundred pounds.  I was not inclined to take too rigid a view and say that they have resigned on ground of ill health that patriotic motives therefore had nothing to do with it and that no pensions would be granted.  I was aware that there were cases where men who for patriotic reasons wanted to be out of the R.I.C. who did not want to draw attention to themselves on the part of the Black-and-Tans or others. It is a moot point whether those people were discharged or dismissed or whether they come under the Act at all even apart from any consideration that might be given to them.  That is a matter that still is under consideration and certainly I feel that, once there was an actual doctor's certificate accepted by the British, and perhaps two or three hundred pounds paid on the strength of it, because the person was unfit for further service, we must have something to counter that, some very definite evidence of patriotic motives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Deputy O'Connor who was Chairman of the Committee that inquired into these cases said that every case was carefully considered and that a fair decision was arrived at?  Is he repudiating that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but unfortunately some of those who gave past service to the country, to whom Deputy Davin referred, and who are demobilised, were appointed on that committee, and never attended.  The committee had not assistance from the Army side that it might have, or that it ought to have had.  Even apart from that, times are quieter and a good deal of information can be got now that could not be easily got at that time.  There are cases in which it is possible without casting any reflection on the competence of the Committee to feel satisfied that their judgment ought to be reversed. <Col N="69" /> Then there is this matter really of a legal character, and perhaps we might decide against the people right off if we wanted to rely on technical grounds.  That is the question of whether people who succeeded in retiring on gratuities on grounds of ill-health come within the Act at all.  These things do require a good deal of examination.  There are very few cases outstanding, except those Gárda Síochána ones, which I think the Deputy himself acknowledges are not urgent cases.  The men are in full-time employment.  Their pension will be fixed.  They will be paid from the beginning.  They will get all their money, and there is not any particular hurry about them.  Of the remaining cases, except the medical gratuity cases, very few remain, and I would say that the medical gratuity people should regard themselves as lucky, indeed, if they are granted pensions, because certainly, on the first view, the case would go against them.  If competent doctors have certified that people were unfit to serve, it is difficult, in spite of any evidence that may be submitted, to go behind that certificate and to say we are satisfied it was not ill-health, but patriotic motives.</P>

      <P>That is a case I looked into myself, and of which I did not examine the details.  I do not think there was any unfairness there. He was treated as other people, entitled to a pension and pay from the State, were.  The pay he was actually receiving in the Army was taken into account.  Other people in the Army were treated in the same way, and his case was not an isolated case.  He might afterwards feel, he should never have gone into the Army, but the amount of loss to him was not great, and in any case it was parallel to the treatment other people received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know at the moment.  Even with all the care we took, I know that men have got through who should not have got through.  An incident happened in my office seven or eight months ago which proved that amply.  A certain high military officer came in to talk about R.I.C. cases and mentioned about a particular man who got a pension.  He gave us information that showed absolutely without doubt that that particular person should not have got a pension.  The Attorney-General advised us that the pension could not be withdrawn unless the Pensions Act was amended, but we do not intend to amend it for one or two cases.  That claim was examined by the Committee in the light of the actual evidence in my Department, but the evidence that would enable us to turn the claim down afterwards came in quite accidentally. There is no doubt that a great number of these cases are extremely doubtful. A large number of men got out, like the man to whom I have just referred, simply through terror.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No, by giving them pensions.  We have allowed pensions to one or two persons who resigned during the conscription period, although their service was only three years or three years and a half.  In all other cases, no pension was given to a man with less than four years' <Col N="72" /> service.  As regards the particular case to which Deputy Morrissey referred, I know nothing about it at the moment. If a man did not resign during the conscription period, and resigned only when the national appeal was being made, we would view that case with considerable suspicion, and we would require more proof than we would require in the case of someone who resigned during the conscription period or about the time of the Listowel incident. My opinion is that of the people who got pensions a substantial number are frauds, but we could not be so strict as to eliminate the possibility of fraud without doing injustice to people who really resigned out of patriotic motives.  The whole case is extremely difficult.  You have men who come and give all sorts of reasons for resigning. People who succeeded in getting R.I.C. doctors' certificates that they were unfit to serve at the time, now state that they were perfectly fit and that the reason they put up these certificates was that they thought it as well to get a few hundred pounds out of the British Government.  My feeling is that these people would put up any sort of case to us and would not stop merely because they would have to assert a falsehood or make a false affidavit.  People who resigned clearly through patriotic motives, but who did not try any of these dodges and who associated themselves actively with the I.R.A. or with the Sinn Féin movement afterwards, have been dealt with fairly; but it is very hard to deal with cases where there is conflicting testimony given at different periods by the applicants themselves.  I think about fifty or sixty cases was the number recommended by the Committee in which we have not so far agreed with the Committee's award or definitely refused pensions.</P>

      <P>Speaking on the general vote, this is a very large vote for superannuation, and while I recognise that it is due to the special retirements &mdash;and, incidentally, I might say that I personally recognise that the Government could not have done otherwise than to retire various bodies under the changed circumstances&mdash;still the amount we have to pay for pensions is a very serious matter when taken in connection with the whole of the revenue we are able to raise under taxation.  On previous occasions, when this question of pensions came up, I think the Minister for Justice indicated that Civil Service pensions were all on a contributory basis.  I would like the Minister to make that point clear.  In these accounts there is nothing shown in the way of any contribution towards the pensionable rights of civil servants, or under these various heads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>That means that on previous occasions the Minister for Justice was wrong, or misinformed, <Col N="74" /> for, according to my recollection, certainly on one or two occasions, he mentioned a sum of 2½ per cent. of salaries as being the provision in connection with pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a question at one time in connection with the Civic Guard, and before the Civic Guard pay had been reduced, of making a deduction in their case of 2½ <i>per cent.</i>, but the value of the pensions of the civil servants is much beyond that.  It is reckoned ordinarily as being equivalent to 12½ <i>per cent.</i> of the salary.  For instance, in a certain case the Tailteann Games Committee wished to have the services of a certain civil servant for a period of a couple of months to do work in connection with the games.  Not only had the Committee to pay the civil servant his salary but they had actually to pay into the Exchequer an amount equivalent to 12½ per cent. of that salary as a contribution towards his pension. When we borrowed civil servants from the British Government the value of their pensions was reckoned on the same basis, as being equivalent to 12½ per cent. of the salary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>That, of course, raises a big issue which possibly it may not be in order to deal with to-day.  It puts a different aspect on the matter as put by the Minister for Justice regarding the merits or otherwise of pensions to be granted in connection with the whole administration.  I think I will leave it at that until some other opportunity may arise to take it up again, as to whether the value of the pension is in any way taken into consideration in regard to the scale of salaries in the various Departments, and as to whether some provision should not be made from year to year regarding these pensions. They come terribly heavy at present owing to the enormous numbers of retirements that have taken place. They constitute a very serious charge on the finances of the State.  Of course it is not very much use saying that, because we cannot get out of it, but I would like the Government to recognise that it has a very important bearing on the general policy of these matters, that a big charge like this <Col N="75" /> should come on without any provision having been made towards meeting it.</P>

    <P>This is an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment which has been made, I think, since 1875 to the local authorities in lieu of rates on Government property, Government property not being liable to assessment for rates.  The amount varies with the amount of rates.  The reduction this year is partly due to the reduction in rates, and partly due to the fact that last year this Vote contained a sum of £9,000 which was really due in respect of the year before, but which was not claimed in time.  Appropriation-in-aid is paid by the British Government in respect of certain premises occupied by them, such as those places where they have coastal defence arrangements; Pensions Department; the Training Branch of the Ministry of Labour, and the Sailors' and Soldiers' Department.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> As the Deputies will notice, this amount has been decreased by £15,000 as compared with last year's estimate. We hope that next year the same account will be substantially less, perhaps not by so much as £15,000, but by a substantial sum.  By that time we will be able to come down to what might be the normal provision for certain matters for the public safety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not at the moment.  I think it was substantially under £35,000.  I should say about £25,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amount is still too great.  If any sum is required at all, I think that we ought not to vote £20,000 for this purpose.  I want to raise the question of the administration of this money, and also the question of the responsibility for the disbursement of secret service moneys.  As far as I can gather, from the information that has been published, the money is disbursed on the certificate of a Minister subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  I understand that that sanction is automatic.  I want to put the case which is, perhaps, a little bit unlikely, but quite possible.  That is where the Minister for Finance would be the person to decide to disburse secret service funds.  There is no examination, there is no check.  There is his certificate.  That is the position, as I understand it, with regard to the disbursement of these moneys.  Nominally, it may be said that the Executive Council is responsible, but I think that there ought to be a regulation or understanding, that no moneys shall be disbursed out of this fund unless it has been formally sanctioned by the Executive Council.  The whole question of secret service moneys is a difficult one, and I suppose, unless one has had something to do with the disbursements, it is almost impossible for one to speak intelligently about the question.  But the fact that we are asked to vote £20,000 to be disbursed on the personal certificate of the Minister, without any record of how it is spent, why it is <Col N="78" /> spent, or for whom it is spent, suggests that the system requires a little correction. I do not think that we should agree to vote a sum of £20,000 to be spent on the certificate of a Minister, and I, at any rate, would like an assurance, that no Minister gives a certificate in respect of the spending of secret service moneys unless there has been a formal understanding with the members of the Executive Council, and that the purpose for which the money is voted has been formally sanctioned by the Executive Council.  The Minister for Finance is the responsible Minister, and if the practice were allowed to grow up&mdash;that only he is to check the certificate and give final sanction&mdash;the Minister for Finance might be the disburser of moneys which we vote and for which no account is given.  That, I think, is a fault in the administration of this fund, and I would like to have some information from the Minister as to the practice, apart from the amount voted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice is&mdash;I think it is a necessary practice&mdash;that there should be no disbursement by the Minister for Finance&mdash;that the Minister for Finance should be the sanctioning and, as it were, the supervising Minister and that he should take the place, to some extent, of the Comptroller and Auditor-General in respect of this matter.  But the practice is that he should not either certify for or control the actual disbursement of moneys.  That practice ensures that there are two Ministers involved, one of which is the Minister for Finance. It is not a fact that the sanction of the Minister for Finance is automatic. It has been the practice to have the Minister who requires the money submit to the Minister for Finance a statement of the purposes for which it is required, and it would be possible for the Minister for Finance to demand any proofs that he thought reasonable in the matter.  It may not be possible nor desirable to get the names of individuals. Sometimes, I should say, it would be impossible to have the public business done, if individuals knew that their names were going to be circulated to any unnecessary extent. <Col N="79" /> But the position is, at any rate, that you have an officer of State who is not connected with the handling of the money, but simply issues it to another Minister or to some person nominated by another Minister to receive it direct.  I think there have been many cases where the matter was directly before the Executive Council and dealt with by them, but there were cases where that was not thought to be necessary.  For instance, there are, at fairly frequent intervals, demands from the Department of Justice for comparatively small sums&mdash;sums of from fifty to one hundred and fifty pounds.  They are  matters of a routine character, and it is not necessary to bring them before the Executive Council.  So far, the great bulk of the money has been spent through the Army, and I have had long sessions with the Chief of Staff and the Director of Intelligence&mdash;the Minister for Defence being present&mdash;in order that we should satisfy ourselves as to the use of the money and the type of Intelligence Service that was being maintained with the money.</P>
      <P>I quite see Deputy Johnson's position which is one that I certainly recognise. Immediately that I became Minister for Finance, I decided that the Minister for Finance must have nothing whatever to do with money and must never draw money himself.  Subject to that, I think it is an obvious precaution to bring two Ministers into every transaction. Beyond that, I think you cannot go substantially in matters of secret service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the practice up to date, is there anything in the form of the requirements that would prevent the Minister for Finance from drawing money and disbursing it? I am now looking forward and not thinking of the position at the moment, but I can see the possibility that, in the present form and arrangement of this, unless there is some other kind of check, there is the possibility of a Minister for Finance calling for the issue of so much money out of the Secret Service Vote and disbursing <Col N="80" /> that.  I want to know if there is anything to prevent that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say whether there is, in law, anything to prevent it or not, but it certainly has not been done.  I agree with the Deputy as fully as it is possible to agree that it should not be done.  That is a matter which, if felt desirable, we could arrange for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly think it would be worth while devising some way whereby there would be a prohibition upon the Minister for Finance receiving moneys which are not to be accounted for, at least as a check.  The fact that two Ministers, at any rate, would be cognisant of the purposes for which the secret service money was spent would be a check, and I think it would be desirable if some way could be devised whereby there would be no possibility of the Minister for Finance being the spending authority in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I had some conversation with the Minister for Finance previously about this matter of secret service.  I should like to say that, during his absence last year, it may have happened that, as Minister for Defence, I made application to the Minister for Finance for some moneys under this particular Vote.  I should say that, in that case, it would form the exception to the rule mentioned by the Minister&mdash;that these matters are not quite automatic.  I think there was something automatic about that, but it was inevitable in that case, and it is unlikely that such a situation as that will arise again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is really the sort of thing that Deputy Johnson's suggestion would guard against if we made a certain definite arrangement. It would mean that another Minister, although not immediately concerned in the matter, would have to be called into consultation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move a reduction of £10,000 in the Estimate asked for by the Minister.  It is quite clear, from the Minister's statement, that most of the money that has been spent on secret service has been spent either in connection with the Army service or with the service that is supervised by the Department of Justice.  In this year's Estimates, provision is made for a sum of £4,527,000 for these two Departments&mdash;the Army and the Gárda Síochána.  That figure would represent, so far as the population of the Saorstát is concerned, roughly a figure of 30/- per head for the supervision of the citizens of this State, and for the purpose of seeing that they obey the laws passed in this Dáil.  In view of that very high estimate, and of the Minister's admission that most of the money now asked for in this Vote will eventually find its way out through the Minister for Defence, or the Minister for Justice, I think that this Vote is altogether uncalled for.  I feel convinced myself, perhaps no other Deputy may feel in the same way, that this secret service department does not serve any useful purpose.  I have heard it stated, and I believe there is some justification for the statement, that the money which goes out through a Vote of this kind is actually spent in paying secret service agents to spy on the political opponents of the Government.  If that is so, and I believe there is some justification for the statement, then, in my opinion, the money is not usefully spent.  If the money is set aside for purely secret service work, and if we are to take some of the things that have happened in this country as an indication of the usefulness of that service, I think one would have to agree that we are not getting a return for the money that is being spent.  If we take the Cobh murder as an example, I think the Minister for Finance must admit that the return for the money spent on the secret service work done in connection with that murder has been nil.  There are other examples that could also be quoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A statement was made in this House on one occasion by a Deputy who is not now present, but who is still a <Col N="82" /> Member, that secret service agents were to be found in the lobbies outside and in the precincts of the House with their ears cocked to hear the conversations going on amongst Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No such secret service agents, if there are any such, were ever paid out of this Vote or were ever countenanced as such by any Government Department or any Minister. This money has not been spent for the purpose of spying on the political opponents of the Government.</P>

      <P>I make a statement which I know to be true, so far as I am concerned myself, and if I gave the name of a responsible Government supporter who told me, to the President he would believe it.  I asked a question, perhaps a very nasty one so far as the Government are concerned, with regard to a certain thing that was alleged to have happened in the Army. I was afterwards reliably informed that I must have been in close touch with some high officer in the Army so as to be able to put that question in the form in which I did put it on the Order Paper.  I was advised then, not only in my own interests but in the interests of the person who was alleged to be in communication with me, that it would be better for me to keep clear of that individual for some time.  Of <Col N="83" /> course, there was the insinuation there, at least so I gathered from the statement that was made to me, that if this Army officer was ever seen speaking to me that whoever he was he would get the order of the boot.  I know, as a matter of fact, that afterwards an Army officer was accused of giving me information, and the strange thing about it was that it was the wrong Army officer that was so accused, and I believe he suffered to some extent.</P>

      <P>I certainly cannot break confidence on that point.  I make the statement merely to show that members of the Dáil who ask questions here in the ordinary way of discharging their duty, when supplied with information, apparently have secret service agents put to watch over and guard them, and to watch those with whom they are in communication.  I make the statement simply to show that if that is where the money is expended, there is no justification for the Department bringing on a Vote to be spent in that way.  The President did not let me develop the point in regard to the agents of the Government in and around this House listening to members of the Dáil discussing this, that and the other, and in the dining-room as well.  I only make the suggestion to the President and the Minister for Finance that no money should be authorised by him for payment for secret service to those who find their way into this House to spy upon members of the House.  If secret service agents have to interview Ministers or members of the House concerning the duties they have to perform, I suggest that they should go to Government Buildings and see the Ministers there during their ordinary office hours and not be allowed into this House at all.</P>

      <P>May I say, for the information of the Dáil, no information for which money is voted here is supplied directly to Ministers.  It is <Col N="84" /> supplied to officers of the Department concerned.  There never was any intention of spending any money for getting any political information.  One thing alone concerns us in regard to this particular service, and that is the stability of the State and the efforts of certain people to subvert it.  If Deputy Davin, or Deputy Gorey, or Deputy Thrift were here in our position they would have to follow the same course and would have to meet with the same trouble.</P>

If the nation has to find £4,427,000 for an Army of 15,000 men, and 8,000 roughly of a police force, the Army and the police forces ought to be able to do the useful work necessary to protect the State under the present Constitution. <Col N="85" /> I believe the fact that we are prepared to vote a sum for secret service representing £20,000, being a reduction of £15,000 on last year's estimate, is calculated to cause a feeling of distrust amongst the people.  God knows we are suspicious enough of one another without going any further in that direction.  I move a reduction, feeling and believing that this vote is not a good thing for the nation.  The nation is not in any danger to-day.</P>

I suggest, seriously, that statements of that kind should not be denied in the House while we have speeches like that of the President and other Ministers to rely on during election periods.  I, therefore, move the reduction of the Vote. If the Minister can put up any case to show that in the past sums paid out of these funds have served any useful purpose I will accept that.</P>

      <P>It is put up by me.  I know, or can know, if any sufficient cause requires this expenditure.  The Department of Justice may spend some of it; the Department of Defence may spend some; conceivably the Department of External Affairs may spend some.  It has not done so, so far, but it might.  Other countries, at times, require to get information.  The money so spent cannot be accounted for. It cannot be allowed to come through the hands of civil servants, and you cannot have it submitted to a dozen officials in the Comptroller and Auditor-General's office.  You cannot have full publicity as long as the State requires this secret service, and as long as it requires its information you must have something in the nature of a secret service.  Anything spent through the ordinary Civil Service channels must come under the purview of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. There can be no privacy and secrecy, and that is necessary here as much as in other countries.  It is all very well to say that the State is in no danger.  No, because the adequate precautions have been taken.  One cannot do everything through the ordinary police channels.  Even when done through the ordinary police channels money may be required that cannot be provided through the ordinary police channels.</P>

      <P>I quite appreciate the difficulty of running a modern State without some fund of this kind. I wish I could think that we could do it.  I wish I could bring myself to the view that such a fund could be dispensed with entirely.</P>
      <P>I am very strongly of opinion that it ought be brought down to the very smallest possible sum.  For three years back we have voted sums, and in each year there has been a very big over-estimate. The sums which have been voted have not been spent.  I think the position of the country, so far as it has been disclosed, would warrant us in saying that just as there has been an over-estimate in the past three years, if we voted £20,000 this year it would likewise be an over-estimate.</P>

      <P>The Minister says he hopes so.  I would suggest to the Minister that we should not now vote £20,000 unless there is a very clear expectation that some such sum will be required for the normal purposes of the secret service.  The Minister thinks that there may be a reduction next year and that possibly we could arrive at some figure which might be considered normal.  The responsibility, of course, lies with the Minister as to what amount will be required; but I would press the view that £20,000 is an over-estimate.  If there is no expectation at this date that such a sum would be needed, then we ought not to vote more than would be required.  If necessary the Minister might come back for a supplementary estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the answer to Deputy Johnson is that suggested by the President.  The secret service seems to me to be one of the services where you cannot very well come for a supplementary estimate.  Such a course would certainly do very considerable damage.  It would do damage if, in the middle of the year, the Government has to come along and say: &ldquo;We want a supplementary estimate.&rdquo;  That would stimulate a type of mischief that one would not like to have stimulated.  It certainly would create a very unsatisfactory position.  If this were a vote for some ordinary service, it would be a very different matter.  On the information I have I would make it a few thousand pounds less.  I expect there will be some saving on the £20,000.  I am not estimating for, or anticipating, the expenditure of the full amount, but you must remember that anything might arise.  If, last year, when we had an estimate of £35,000, we had been cut down to the narrowest margin, owing to the state of feeling that then existed, and that existed for some time after that, I would have felt very uneasy if I had not available a sum that could have been used in any way that would have been thought proper for the secret service and that would have enabled the Department of Defence and the police to meet any development that might have arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy should remember that only very recently we came out of chaotic conditions, and that we still have people amongst us who have actual experience of how easy it is to create enormous trouble in the country, people who were only lately out in arms.  We are not in the condition in which a country would be where nobody had any actual experience or recent experience of revolt, and where there would be a hesitation on the part of anybody, no matter how much they might be inclined to do it, to attack <Col N="89" /> the State and come out into the open. Here things might come much more rapidly to a head than in a country which had come through a peaceful period.  The Deputy will understand all that, and how easy it would be for a comparatively small number of determined people to give a good deal of disturbance. It could be done in various ways, and we know that there are always people advocating it.  There is no doubt that the possibility of their doing anything or getting anything is very much less and the possibility of a large number of people being led by them is also getting less.</P>
    <P>The situation is certainly improving very steadily.  The possibilities of any sudden or considerable action in the nature of a revolt are getting less day by day.  At the same time, one never knows what sort of temporarily unfavourable turn events might take, and we ought to be provided with the means for dealing with any such likelihood in any way that may be deemed necessary in order to secure the safety of the State.  I do hope that next year we can ask for a very much lower sum; but I do not really want now to take the minimum, thus providing for no unfavourable contingency.  One might have to come back to the Dáil so as to be able to provide the Minister concerned with the funds necessary to enable him to deal with any situation that would arise, and that would be required in the interests of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I took exception to this amount, but I must now say that I accept the Minister's explanation.  I think his explanation has done good. As Deputy Davin has said, the explanation in itself will have done some good. Last year, as Deputy Davin has said, there was considerable talk about Secret Service men going into the Lobbies and listening to what was being said.  I do not think that that was denied by the principal party concerned; as a matter of fact, he admitted it.  We are glad to know that this Vote has nothing to do with that class of thing.  I recognise there is still a necessity for this service, and I am satisfied if the Minister thinks he is getting value for the money.  I thought <Col N="90" /> that this service would come more closely in contact with the Department of Justice or the Department of Defence, and that those Departments could more accurately judge whether they were getting value for the money. The Minister, however, says the Department is under him.  I do not want to get into any Cabinet secrets, but I do think it seems an enormous sum when taken in conjunction with the Gárda Síochána Vote and the Army Vote.  Ordinary Deputies would imagine that this amount should be attached to either Vote, or to both.  It is well we have had an explanation, and, in the circumstances, perhaps Deputy Davin would reconsider his proposal.</P>

Is it not a fact that you have in an Army of 15,000 men a considerable number of intelligence officers, who move around fairly freely in wide areas?  They hold different ranks and they are paid for getting the information which we are asked to believe the Secret Service men are getting in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>You have the members of the Gárda Síochána who are also detectives and who are quite capable of doing all the work, to see that this State is safeguarded from attack from individuals, or organised bodies.  I was told&mdash;and I ask the Minister to contradict it if it is not so&mdash;that men can come up from the country and go to Portobello or Collins Barracks, give information about some neighbour in the country having so many guns and that they will get three, four, five, ten, or twenty pounds and go home pretty comfortable.  I want to know if the Minister's supervising authority merely means that he authorises payment as being a legal payment, where there is a certain amount of money in charge of an officer to be paid out immediately some individual comes along with that information?  Are we to understand definitely and finally that no payment is to be made by another Minister or himself until he is satisfied that the <Col N="92" /> information received is valuable or some kind of assistance to the State under the circumstances, and that the money does not go out until he authorises it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>You could not understand that.  I have to know for what sort of thing it is paid.  In the case of the Army I authorise certain sums to be paid to the Director of Intelligence for certain purposes.  Any further examination of that will be carried out by the Minister for Defence or by the Chief of Staff.  It depends on the amount of secrecy that would have to be involved.  I do not in that particular case go into individual matters.  In the case of the Army, which is a bigger thing, there is a considerable amount of work done and there is a considerable service there, if I may put it that way.  In the case of justice matters it is rather different.  They are dealing more with individual cases.  What Deputy Davin says in another respect is perfectly true.  The police forces are getting out into the country, getting to know the people, and probably opening up veins and channels of information that will tend very rapidly to make the more or less elaborate Army system superfluous.  This is a thing that will of course tend to a reduction of this Vote very rapidly, but of course it is only comparatively recently that the police have got to that stage.  They are only beginning to get a hold on things.  There is also, of course, the fact that matters are calming down.</P>

    <P>This provision is, perhaps, not the final provision that will be necessary this year.  Whether any further sums will be required will depend, in part <Col N="93" /> at any rate, on conditions in the country and also on the rate of progress of the works which it is intended to cover by this particular sum.  This sum is practically for the completion of work that has either been done in the year or authorised last year and not carried out.  It includes, for instance, provision for work in Dingle Harbour, on Kilrush Waterworks, waterworks at Clones, work at Tralee and Fenit pier, various works that were sanctioned under different Ministries prior to the end of the year. Some of them were sanctioned, or promise was given early last year.  For various reasons the machinery of getting the work into operation prevented the money being paid out.</P>
    <P>In most of this class of work there are very considerable engineering and other delays, and the work cannot be started.  On the other hand, when sums were granted last year, schemes were taken up and promises of assistance were given out of the rates.  Although the Vote proposed at this time last year was intended entirely for the year, still it was felt that in the case of schemes that had only been taken up late in the year it would not be fair simply to say, &ldquo;You have had all your trouble and all your work for nothing and as you did not get your work started or completed within the financial year, nothing at all can be done for you.&rdquo;  There is also included in the Vote a provision of some £20,000 to allow the Land Commission to complete certain works which it had in progress at the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move that this Vote be referred back for re-consideration with a view to an increase. The sum asked for is £115,000, as against £500,000 voted last year.  I am sorry to say that I do not think there is any justification for saying the position to-day is better than it was when we voted £500,000 last year.  In some respects it is worse.  It is worse in so far as respects the unemployed men who have no insurance to fall back upon.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has told us in effect that, so far as unemployment insurance is concerned, he has no proposals <Col N="94" /> to make; he does not intend to bring in any legislation with the view of making it possible to pay unemployment benefit to persons who are not at present in benefit, or who have not stamps to their credit.  If we are not to have any unemployment insurance, then something else has to be done.  So far as I can see, there is no other way, under these Estimates, at any rate, of dealing with the matter except on this Vote.</P>
      <P>We have had two or three discussions as to the extent of unemployment and the intensification of unemployment, and we have been told, with a rather curious disregard of the facts and the prospects, that the summer season ought to reduce considerably the number of unemployed and to make the need for provision very much smaller or entirely unnecessary.  That a number of schemes are in course of preparation&mdash;housing, roadwork, some of these schemes that the Minister has spoken of now&mdash;and that taking one with another we may look for an absorption into the realms of employment of those at present unemployed. There has been no evidence adduced to make us think that there was any basis for that optimism.  On the 27th March we had a considerable discussion on this matter, and I gave certain figures based upon the Government's estimates of the numbers likely to be absorbed, supposing the best that was anticipated could be realised during the summer.  For instance, supposing 3,000 persons were set to employment on the Shannon scheme, that the bulk of the unemployed in the building trade were absorbed, giving the fullest possible weight to the expectations, and supposing they were all wholly realised, even then we would have a very large number of men still unemployed and wanting food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing has yet been said to justify the optimism of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and we are left with this position: that the fifty odd thousand persons unemployed two months ago may or may not have been reduced by one or two thousand, may or may not have been increased by one or two thousand&mdash;we do not know.  Certainly there has been no considerable reduction <Col N="95" /> in the number of unemployed and there has been a considerable increase in the number of unemployed men and women who are no longer in benefit and are therefore entirely without support of a monetary kind, except such support as they may be able to beg, borrow or steal.  There are those three possibilities: they may beg, borrow, or steal.  That is an unfortunate predicament to place men in; men who have served long periods of apprenticeship, who have served as citizens of this community loyally and well and attempted to bring up their families as good citizens, have been, by virtue of factors over which they have no control, forced into the market for employment and been unable to find a buyer for many months, in some cases years, and are now utterly deprived of support either from insurance or any other source, except, as I said, the three possibilities, that they may beg, borrow, or steal.  That is a most unfortunate predicament to place men in.  It is a position that I maintain we have got to face and accept responsibility for.</P>
    <P>I know the position is a very difficult one indeed, but I will stake everything upon this proposition: that as a community, and as the spokesmen for a community, if we are going to carry through our responsibilities, we must provide the means of life for those men who are willing to give their labour in return, and we must do that on a scale worthy of decent citizenship in a modern State.  It is said that we cannot afford it, that nothing can be done, that these men must be allowed to go hungry.  That is a counsel of despair. It is an indication that you will want many more twenty thousand pounds for your secret service.  I plead with the Minister to take this proposition back and to consider new propositions which would add hundreds of thousands if necessary to this sum, or to bring forward some counter proposition.  The Government have refused what I believe to be far and away a better proposition in the present circumstances, until they can find employment to extend the insurance benefit.  The Government have refused to do that, refused to continue this insurance <Col N="96" /> basis.  Then they have got to find some other way as a responsible Government of meeting the claims of citizens who are willing to work and cannot get work, who have contributed during their working days to insurance schemes, who have been led to believe it was community policy to provide insurance in the absence of employment, and especially to provide employment where insurance was the alternative. There is no one who speaks on behalf of unemployed workmen with any sense of responsibility but will say that it is a hundred times and a thousand times better to provide employment at useful occupations than to throw men back upon insurance, and still better than to throw them back upon what are called relief schemes.</P>
    <P>I am not pleading now for relief schemes in the ordinary sense of relief work which is useless.  I am asking the Minister to take back this Vote and consider the case of the unemployed workmen, many thousands of whom have families dependent upon them, who have no resources, are deprived of insurance, will be forced upon the poor rate, and if they are deprived of that, as they may well be, in view of the utterances of many people, then you are throwing them back upon their own resources absolutely, and these resources are merely, their strength, their ingenuity, and their moral force, and moral force breaks down in many cases when a man sees his children hungry.  I am not going into any details. I press the proposition that this Vote be taken back with a view to its great increase to meet the requirements of the time, and in view particularly of the refusal of the Government to consider the question of the insurance of the unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to second the motion to refer this Vote back.  In doing so, I would like to ask the Minister whether, in arriving at the figure £115,000, he had any comparison made between the numbers unemployed this year and the numbers unemployed at the same period last year.  I also want to know whether the amount that appears on the Vote had any reference to the numbers unemployed, or whether <Col N="97" /> the Government have any true figures as to the numbers unemployed in the country.  The Government are able to get figures concerning the unemployed who are registered in the Labour Exchanges, but that would not represent more than 50 per cent.&mdash;if it did represent 50 per cent.&mdash;of the people who are really unemployed. The Minister stated, I think, that the bulk of the £115,000 was for the completion of schemes sanctioned or started last year.  Can the Minister tell the Dáil how much of the £115,000 is for new schemes, or can he tell what schemes of relief the Government had in mind?  I do not want to use an expression that would be unparliamentary, but it seems to me that the Government have entered upon a sort of policy of &ldquo;let the unemployed go to the dogs.&rdquo;  Not only are they reducing, by a very considerable amount, the sum for relief schemes, but they are not going to make any provision for people who have fallen out of Unemployment Insurance benefit.  The present Government or any other Government will fail in their duty if they are not able to provide the people with the means of livelihood.  I believe it is the duty of the Government to provide work for people who are prepared to work, or else to give them the means of livelihood.  A Government cannot allow a large section of the community to starve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson stated that there were only three things left for the unemployed to do: to beg, borrow or steal.  The unemployed will not get very much by borrowing, as very few people are prepared to lend them money, seeing that the prospect of ever being able to repay, while the present policy of the Government continues, is not very bright.  It comes to this, then, that the unemployed have either to steal or throw themselves on the mercy of the ratepayers and try to get poor relief, or, to give it its modern name, home help.  I know that the unemployed will not succeed in getting very much home help even if they are on the verge of starvation.  The Government, in my opinion, if they really intend to tackle this problem, have many ways of doing so.  The problem <Col N="98" /> is not insurmountable, as many useful works could be carried out throughout the country.  As an instance, take the case of the roads.  We know that there is an urgent necessity for good roads, and I would suggest that if the Government can borrow money for the Army to fight the Irregulars, and for the Shannon Scheme, they should be able to borrow money for a national road scheme on which to put unemployed men at work.</P>
    <P>I claim that it is the duty of the Government to provide the men with work or else feed them, but preferably to put them at useful work.  As far as Deputies on the Labour Benches are concerned, they have no desire to see men lining up outside the Labour Exchanges morning after morning to sign on for unemployment benefit at the end of the week.  They would much prefer that the men would be employed on work that would be useful to the State.  That is the claim they now make.  If the Government is unable to provide work it is their duty to provide food for the unemployed men and their families by other means.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the motion to refer this proposal back. I do not understand how a difference of practically £400,000 between this year's estimate and last year's estimate was arrived at.  Unemployment appears to be equally as bad now as it was this time last year.  The benefits of the money that was spent on relief schemes may have been felt in outlying districts of the country; they certainly were not felt in the city of Dublin.  Unemployment and hunger are as prevalent this year as last year or the year before. The skilled trades appear to be as badly hit as the unskilled trades.  No attempt whatever has been made to make any provision for the relief of the skilled workers.  In the iron and steel trades there is as much unemployment as there is in the unskilled trades.  I think the Minister would be well advised if he took some steps to provide work in these trades.  I am also aware that female workers have been very badly hit.  It appears that no effort has been made to provide employment for them.  In some households in which there was an old-age <Col N="99" /> pensioner drawing 10/- a week, that money was a help during the period of unemployment.  Now the old age pension of 10/- has, in some cases, been reduced to 6/- and to 5/-, so that there is no help to be expected in that direction. I hope the Government will consider the appeal made by Deputy Johnson and Deputy Morrissey, and will deal with proposals for the relief of the unemployed more sympathetically than they have done up to the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>For other reasons altogether than those advanced by Deputies Johnson, Byrne and Morrissey, I propose to support this amendment.  To a certain extent, I might say at the outset, it is perhaps slightly unfair that I should have to put the case to the Minister for Finance that I propose to make.  I did some time ago give notice to the Minister for Lands and Agriculture that I intended to raise certain points on this Vote, in order to give him an opportunity to give them the lie or otherwise, and I expected that it would be the Minister for Lands and Agriculture who would deal with this matter.  I do not know in what position the Minister for Finance is to reply to the points that I have to make. I want to say that when this House passes money for relief, or other schemes, the responsibility is on the House to see that that money is fairly and impartially spent, and I am supporting the amendment because of my experience that the money voted last year for relief schemes was not impartially spent.  The Minister has told us that the greater part of this Vote is to complete work that was begun in the last financial year.  As far as my experience goes, if the House passes this Vote it might as well vote this money into the coffers of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, if it is to be administered as the last relief grants were administered.  I will take conditions as I found them, speak of what I know, and will not exaggerate in the slightest; I will tell the House what my experience has been.  I will try to put things as I saw them, and I will ask the House whether it considers it fair, whether it considers it just, whether it considers it a good <Col N="100" /> national policy, that we should vote money and have schemes administered as they have been in the past.  The House can judge and can take the responsibility.</P>
      <P>The Minister, I think, was present at a meeting in my county when the question of the amount of the relief grant that was to be spent in my county was debated.  It was previous to a bye-election there.  After the Minister was questioned as to the amount of money available for Cavan, and had replied, I think, that it was somewhere in the neighbourhood of £20,000, the chairman of the meeting said: &ldquo;If you give us £40,000 we will win the election for you.&rdquo;  There was a good deal of discussion one way and the other afterwards. I am not quite clear yet as to how much money was voted for the relief of distress in Cavan&mdash;at least, we are supposed to believe that it was for the relief of distress in Cavan.  I certainly say that there was very great distress in Cavan.  There is distress in Cavan to-day; there is distress in practically every county and in every city and town in Ireland, and I was prepared at any time to support the voting of money for the relief of distress wherever it existed.  At the same time, I would like to see that the people who were really in distress would benefit from the administration of these moneys, and that the question of the existence or non-existence of distress should be the test as to whether any individual should or should not benefit. I regret to say that as far as my experience goes that was not the test that was applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, I say that when moneys are to be spent by any Department the Ministers who get these moneys are responsible to the House for the manner in which they are spent, and the Ministers' officials should be the individuals responsible to them for shaping the policy, allotting the money, and declaring how it should be spent.  I put it to the Minister: was that the policy pursued in the spending of these relief grants?  I do not know what may have happened in other places.  I have heard things.  I am not very clear; but I say that as far as my experience goes the political <Col N="101" /> test was the test applied regarding who should have the say as to how this money was to be spent, where it was to be spent, and who should have a word in the spending of it.  If it has come down to this, that when we are asked to vote money for any particular purpose that a Minister might think necessary, a political organisation, the political organisation backing the Government of the day, is the body to claim that they shall say where this money shall be spent, and by whom, I say that this House ought to declare, here and now, that it will stop voting any money for the relief of distress.</P>
    <P>I will give a few instances that have been brought to my notice.  I could bring sheafs of letters; I could let the Minister have letters that came to me during the period in which this money was being spent.  I am not raising it now; the thing is passed, and many of the thoughts that were in people's minds at the time it was spent, have passed with it.  But I am taking this up now in a cooler moment, because I think that as a question of national policy it is unsound, unfair, and something that the Dáil ought not to tolerate.  When this money was coming to the county a notice was published in the Press.  It was a notice that the President of the Executive Council was attending a meeting, and side by side with that was an announcement in the same paper by the secretary of the political organisation, stating that those people who wanted money for the relief of distress should come to the meeting and put their case before the President.  There was a great deal more in addition to that. What followed it all?  It was reported that engineers came into the county. An engineer appeared here and there, and the next thing that we discovered was that responsible officers of the organisation supporting the Government Party could go into districts and say: &ldquo;Start a work here,&rdquo; could go in without an engineer, employ men and put them at work, start a work here, start another there, and start another somewhere else.  If that did not always happen, what happened was something like this: The Cumann na nGaedheal representative of the district took the engineer <Col N="102" /> under his arm from one district to another and together they decided where the money was to be spent.  It seems to me that if money is to be spent fairly and impartially it cannot and will not be if a political organisation is to say where and how it is to be spent, because when it went to the spending this is the sort of thing that happened: drains were to be made.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture, replying to me, said that he did not consider that drainage could be done in winter.  Well, drainage was started, and this was the sort of drainage that was done in some districts: Deputies Davin, Johnson and O'Connell were supporters of the Cumann na nGaedheal.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>And the drain along their land would be cleaned.  It came along to Deputy Baxter who was not in the same crowd, did not see from the same angle.  The drain along his land was left undone, and it went along to the land of Deputy Connor Hogan and Deputy Gorey, who were of the same political organisation as the other three, and the drain past their land was cleaned.  That is one illustration of how the money was spent.  The test simply and solely was the political organisation to which a man belonged. I do not know what the President may think of that; I do not know what the Minister for Finance may think of it; I do not know whether they stand over it or not.</P>

      <P>Is it?  Here is another instance: I am in a district; a man says to me: &ldquo;I did not come to your meeting last night, I went to the other meeting.  You could not give me anything or do anything for me.  I paid half a crown and joined the organisation.  We decided to start the drain we were talking about.&rdquo;&ldquo;Was the engineer there?&rdquo;  I said. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;but you know the organiser; he was there.&rdquo; I can give his name; he is employed by the Government in another capacity, but that is another matter.  They started <Col N="103" /> to work.  This man was interested in getting drainage work done along his own land.  The man got the job as a ganger.  That went on for a few weeks. I met the man later and asked him how they were getting on.  They were suspicious at the time.  He said if they continued the work a week longer they would have the drain past his land. The day of the election came.  They were suspicious about what this man did at the poll.  He was dropped the next day and was ganger no longer.  In another district in which the relief works were being carried out there was a man, a labourer, who was suspect, who was thought not to have the same political sympathies or belong to the political organisation.  He was dropped.  He was told to go about his business.  No reasons were given, but the reasons were common property.  That is one of dozens of cases that happened in my county.  I do not know how much money was spent, but that is the way it was spent.  If you did not belong to a certain organisation there was no chance of getting your drains cleaned.  The men who were the responsible officers of that organisation decided where the work was to be done and when and how it was to be done.  They were the men who declared &ldquo;There is £60 for that work, and £80 for that work.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other evening I was at a meeting in the east of my constituency. At that meeting a farmer told me that a prominent member of the political organisation supporting the Government told them that they had suffered because of the lack of engineering instinct shown on the part of the people who started the work.  Here is the way the works were started.  The drainage was not started at the mouth to let the water out, but at the source of the river to let it flood all the more. Those men happened to be living further away from the source and they were flooded out.  They were making a complaint about how the work was being done.  They were told by this man to put 40 men on the work, and that he would see that they were paid. I do not think that they did it.  They said, &ldquo;We do not know whether they will be paid or not; we will not take <Col N="104" /> the chance.  We do not know whether this man has the authority or not.&rdquo; They have had the authority so far, and they have done it.  Men have come to Dublin here in their cars in order to get those works done.  I do not know whether the Government countenances this way of administering relief schemes or not.  If they do, it is astonishing that any Government or Minister should stand up and ask for money to be spent in this fashion and expect that Deputies would vote this money.  I dare say I got as many communications in connection with the administration of this relief money as anyone else.  As soon as I received a communication on the matter, I forwarded it to the Land Commission, to the Minister for Lands and Agriculture. I left it to their officials to see what was to be done, and to decide on the merits of the different districts as to whether or not they should have money spent on them.  I did not go to interview engineers or anyone else. I do not think money can be administered fairly if any other tactics are adopted.  After all, it is a question of political pressure, and if political pressure is to be the force to decide when people are poor and what districts are to be relieved, then I am finished with that.  There can be no proper supervision in this way as to whether good value can be given for this money or not.  Whether the number of engineers were few or whatever the causes may have been, men were not there to see that the work was done properly.  As I say, I heard the Minister for Lands and Agriculture himself saying in reply to me when Deputy Cooper made the suggestion that they should go in for drainage work on the Owenmore, &ldquo;Any farmer will tell you you cannot work on a drainage scheme in winter, and especially in the month of December.&rdquo; Some amount of drainage work was done, but it did more harm than good. It benefited a few people, but I was interested in the drainage of a river I had brought to the notice of the Deputy in charge&mdash;the Ragg.  There are about 500 acres under flood, and I had asked for an engineer to be sent on that.  The 500 acres covered an <Col N="105" /> area of about 7 miles.  The river flows through eleven lakes.  The means we found those people adopting in connection with the drainage was to start at the very source, the first lake, to let more water out to flood those unfortunate people.  That is the sort of work done.  It is only one of dozens of instances.</P>
    <P>At the same time I want to say that in some districts there was good work done and men worked hard, but in most cases the political test was applied. We had other instances.  In one instance a case had to be brought to the High Courts and a decision there was given as to the right of a ganger in charge of a body of men to make a new road, and his right to enter on a man's field and to move back his ditch five or six feet.  Will the Minister tell me that an engineer was responsible for that?  I hope he will not.  Obviously, you will admit that no engineer would be responsible for mapping out work that would mean that part of a man's field is to be taken over without any authority.  That happened. This work started, some say, because the owner of the field and the man in charge of the gang of men did not agree politically; that the ganger obtained the authority vested in him to remove the man's ditch.  He was brought to the High Court, and when the decision was about to be given against him a compromise was made. These are the sort of things that went on.</P>

I may now add what I did not want to say, and that is, that I happened to be in Cavan the night before the President came, and I met a man who came thirty miles, from the far end of the county.  He had come ten miles to one of the smaller towns, expecting to meet the engineer who was thought to be responsible for allocating this money, but as he did not find him there he came on to Cavan.  It was eight o'clock at night, and I met him by accident.  I was wondering what he was doing there, and he informed me that instructions were given out that this engineer was coming to town, because the President was coming the next day to arrange about the relief schemes.  He did come to town the night before, and the President came the next day.  I am not laying any great stress on what happened at the meeting but on what happened afterwards.</P>

The men who started the works were men who belonged to the particular organisation supporting the Ministry.

      <P>I go on to deal with the Minister's point.  It is a very trivial one.  The point I am making is far more important.  It is whether or not the Ministry of this State is going to permit members of a political organisation to do work which civil servants are paid for doing.  I want to know from the Minister for Defence, who seems to feel very strongly on this point, whether he thinks it right that any Tom, Dick, or Harry who comes into a political organisation which happens to be supporting the Government of the day, should have authority to come out and do work which civil servants are paid to do. The President will, I suppose, ask how can he answer for the sins of these people and how can he be held to have authority over these people and to see that they will do what is right?  He may ask how can he be held responsible in this House for these men for whom he is in no way responsible.  He may say that he has not the same responsibility over such an individual as he has over a civil servant and a paid official of the Government of the day. If the Minister for Defence wants me to answer his point I may say that I know one instance, in which it was brought to my notice, that a labourer was turned away because he did not see eye to eye with the ganger on the works.</P>

It was started along lands owned by members of the Cumann na nGaedheal, but if I happened not to be a member of that party they passed my lands and went on to the lands of the next farmer who happened to be a member of the party.  Does the Minister stand over that sort of thing?  The Minister need not get uneasy when we want to have this thing cleared up.  We have kept silent on the matter, but I could have produced sheaves and sheaves of facts about this subject. These facts will not be denied by these people in my constituency.

      <P>If I had any charge to make about it I would bring it forward here, and would have the courage to do so.  What we have to consider and decide is, does the Ministry of the day, or will any body of men in the country now or at any other time, stand up and claim support from the people, and claim that they have a right to that support, not for the good they did, not for the courageous things they faced and performed, but because a certain amount of State money is available, and that the political organisation that is backing the Government of the day claims to be the body responsible for the distribution and administration of that money?  I do not know whether the Ministry will stand up for that or not.  I want to hear them denounce it, and to say that it is not going to happen in the future.  I want them to take steps, if they disclaim responsibility for this, to see that it will not happen in the future.  I believe there are men, even in the Government party, who would not agree that this is sound in the best interests of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is creating, if you like, a body of men who are beggars, who are looking to the Government, thinking that they ought to give them everything, when, as the President said the other day, <Col N="111" /> they ought to try and adopt a policy of self-help.  They will not make any effort, simply because they have been spoiled, and the result is that when a fair and just case of an honest man comes along he does not stand a chance. He cannot.  How could he?  Now I am not going to say that this Vote is sufficient for the relief of distress.  I hope it will be sufficient.  We know unfortunately that there is distress in the country, and we know relief will be wanted again, but I do say it would be better we did not pass one penny of this Vote, far better for the Government and the State, if it were to be distributed and administered as the last money was, as far as I saw of it.  The Minister, or the President, may say that members of their political organisation say and do things that the leaders cannot be held responsible for. I am with them in that.  I know that individuals say and do things in other organisations that the great body of the members of the organisations would not stand for.  But when you see a definite cut-and-dried policy like what we saw carried into effect a few months ago, when you see a political organisation making a declaration as to policy, and as to its ability to carry out that policy, and when we see evidence that there must be collusion between the Minister responsible or some of his officials and that political organisation, we cannot accept any disclaimer that will come. That political organisation has a right to exist, and there is a necessity for it, but no political organisation now or at any other time ought to be in a privileged position because it is a supporter of the Government, and ought not to be in the position that it will, in a sort of back-hand way, be able to administer what are public funds voted out of the public purse to gather adherents to its cause.  The Government or the political party that stake their existence, or are dependent on methods like that, cannot last, for that support will last only as long as you have money to spend amongst these people, but when you have not the money to spend the people will say it is time to quit, and they will leave you.</P>

      <P>I know something about <Col N="112" /> the relief works and the way they were administered in County Mayo, and I must certainly say they were worked on different lines from those Deputy Baxter has described.  Take South and North Mayo.  There was an election in North Mayo, and, according to what Deputy Baxter has said, if these relief works were distributed for political reasons chiefly, one would expect that North Mayo would have got a far larger share of the relief works than South Mayo, where there was no election. But if you look at the statement of the Ministry showing the amounts allotted to the different counties, you will find that South Mayo got a far larger share than North Mayo.  Deputy Baxter has said that money was distributed for political purposes in certain districts.  Did County Cavan, because of the election, get money out of proportion to the destitution or want prevailing in that county?  He did not state that, or what parishes or districts in Cavan got relief works that should not have got them.  He said something about what the paid electioneering agents of Cumann na nGaedheal said. That was a compliment to the electioneering ability, if not to the political honesty of the organisers.  I am sure that the farmers' organisers were equally clever.  Deputy Baxter is not altogether so simple a man as he pretends to be in the statement he made here.  I am quite sure that his agents were equally eloquent and as effective as our organisers were.</P>

      <P>The very serious charges that have been made by Deputy Baxter are not, I think, so much directed against the Government Party organisation as against the Government, and they have got to be answered and dealt with in a serious way.  I say candidly I believe it would be the view of our Party, that if the money we are asking for, and which is required to deal with the distress that undoubtedly exists in the country, were to be administered in every county and in every constituency in the way Deputy Baxter has charged the Government with administering the funds in County Cavan, we would not make that demand.  I believe it is the duty of every Deputy to bring what he believes to be the present position in his own area before the Government in a proper way on a motion of this kind.  I believe, further that no Deputy with any sense of responsibility should exaggerate the position <Col N="117" /> as he finds it or as it may be in the future.  But Deputies who represent rural areas, or who have knowledge of or acquaintance with the position in those areas would have difficulty in exaggerating the position as they know it to exist.  A friend or constituent or supporter of Deputy Connor Hogan said some time ago that people in County Clare were living on dead things.  That was afterwards admitted to be an exaggeration, but I know that in the greater part of my own area&mdash;I would like Deputy Egan to contradict me if he thinks otherwise&mdash;the position is a very serious one, indeed, from the point of view of distress.  That distress is not confined to the workers in the towns, or to workmen in the countryside in non-insurable occupations.  It exists amongst most of the farming communities in what is recognised to be a tillage area.  At the last election&mdash; and we cannot get away from promises made by responsible people, even during the period of by-elections&mdash;I listened to the statement by one Deputy that £20,000,000 was to be raised by the Government to be spent on roads and the development of the country.  All I know of that now is that a certain amount of money is to be raised in connection with the Shannon Scheme.  I suggest seriously to the Minister for Finance and to the Executive Council &mdash;it is not a matter for one Minister, but for the Executive Council&mdash;that electric light in the houses of farmers or workmen would be very little encouragement to them in their present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the Shannon scheme from the national point of view, because I believe it raises the credit of this nation externally to a degree that we cannot now appreciate, and that it is an act of faith in ourselves and in the future of the country, and a demonstration of what we can do with the freedom we have got.  But holding up the electric light that may be provided by the Shannon two or three years hence, is not going to relieve the conditions that exist here to-day.  I suggested when the supplementary estimate of £250,000 was being moved by the Minister, for relief schemes in October last&mdash;I am subject to correction in <Col N="118" /> regard to the period&mdash;that the Minister should indicate what form of useful work he had in mind when he brought in an estimate of that kind.  I think local authorities, upon whom the duty of initiating schemes lies, and the people of the districts where distress prevails, are entitled to that information. I know of areas where schemes put up by the local authorities have been turned down because, in the opinion of the Minister, the money was not to be spent on what he considered useful work.  We are entitled to know what the Minister regards as useful work, especially as we hope he will seek a much larger vote than last year, if he intends to deal with the position as it is in the country.  I admit that the Drainage Bill, when it comes to be administered, will serve a useful purpose in itself, so far as giving employment of a useful kind is concerned, but if that Bill will take as long to be administered as it took in drafting and is being introduced to this House, it will be two or three years before we see the real result of our legislation.  I suggested on the supplementary estimate last year that it might be advisable, in view of the distress existing in the towns, small and large, that drainage works, or sewerage works, should be regarded as works of a useful kind, as they are, from the point of view of giving immediate employment and dealing with the abominably insanitary conditions that obtain in most of the towns and villages.  I know of at least three or four schemes of this kind that were put up by the local governing authority to the Department and that were turned down, as there was no money available to relieve the charge that would fall on the local ratepayers.</P>
    <P>I cited a case of a sewerage scheme which, if carried out at the expense of ratepayers in the dispensary district, would involve a charge of 6/11 in the £.  That particular town is adjacent to the Barrow.  It is in a low-lying district, and the sanitary conditions are simply deplorable.  Nobody, I think, will get up and say that the ratepayers of that district should find a rate of 6/11 in the £ to carry out work which everybody will admit is of a useful <Col N="119" /> nature.  I do not know whether the Minister realises the insanitary conditions that exist in most of the towns, but if he will only inquire from the Minister responsible for Local Government and Public Health, he can get some idea as to the conditions in practically every town in the Free State.  I contend that no shop or no licensed house where people are in the habit of going in large numbers should be without proper sanitary arrangements. These things will have to be taken into consideration if the health of the people is to be attended to.  I speak only with regard to my own particular area.  It is largely a tillage constituency.  We have had two very bad seasons.  The people have either been unable to grow their crops or to sell what they actually cut, as there was no fine weather period for the saving of the crops.  One can easily realise what the effect of that has been on the small farmers, who are, generally speaking, the greatest producers of the food upon which this nation has to depend.  Large numbers of agricultural labourers, who would normally be employed by these farmers, have been thrown out of employment, because the farmers have no money with which to pay them.  If the Minister has the figures of to-day at his disposal they will give him an indication of the extent of unemployment as regards that particular area.</P>
    <P>I had a letter a few days ago from the Athy No. 2 Rural District Area. Deputy Wolfe spoke in that area a few Sundays ago, and I read his speech. We have there 290 unemployed, and, as Deputy Wolfe knows, there is a certainty now that 150 additional people will be thrown on the unemployed list. Every one of the farmers in that rural district suffered as a result of the plague of fluke, which has wiped out their cattle, their sheep and even their foals.  I submitted a statement to the Minister for Lands and Agriculture with regard to that aspect of the case. That is in the vicinity of the Barrow. We were told by the Minister for Finance that the Barrow was going to be drained, when he spoke in Carlow during the elections.  I always make it my business to read the reports of speeches <Col N="120" /> by members of this House when made in my area in the local newspapers. Deputy Wolfe made a speech a short time ago which I read across the Channel. He was challenged at that meeting and asked what about the Barrow. He said&mdash;speaking no doubt with inside information as he has the ear of the Minister for Finance&mdash;that work might be started in the autumn.</P>
    <P>I mention that for this purpose: that if the Barrow drainage scheme, promised a long time ago by the Minister for Finance, only was started in that area, it would relieve, to some extent, the distress that undoubtedly prevails, as I am sure Deputy Wolfe knows, in the whole Athy No. 2 rural district. That is only one instance of what is happening all over the country.  I realise that it is the duty of every Deputy not to exaggerate the position, but, knowing as I do the present position that exists in that area, I must say that the people of this State are the most law-abiding that one could find anywhere, no matter what we may think of stunts carried out here and there occasionally. Deputy Morrissey stated that the people registered in the unemployment exchanges only represented about 50 per cent. of those acually unemployed in the Saorstát.  I daresay that would be a fairly correct estimate of the conditions existing in the tillage areas of the country.  During the last two years those engaged in tillage have been hit very severely.</P>
    <P>I realise that at the present time we are passing through the most trying period that this State has experienced since it was established.  The next four or five months will be the most trying of all&mdash;until we know what the coming harvest is likely to be.  For that reason the Executive Council, and not one Minister writing to another, should meet and seriously review the position that exists in so many areas.  I have spoken to members of the Government party, and some of them think, as I do, that Ministers are actually not aware of the acute distress that prevails in many parts of the country.  The Ministers, of course, are advised by their officials, who do not go up and down the country to get a knowledge of the actual conditions.  For that <Col N="121" /> reason the Ministers, I suggest, are not conscious of the distress that exists. We all know that the farmers of the country are either in the books of the local shopkeepers or in the books of the local banks.  We know, too, the way that the banks are treating the ordinary traders of the country.  They are pressing them for payment, and are causing a great number of people to go into bankruptcy.  People are also being obliged to put their land up for sale by public auction to pay the debts they owe to the banks.</P>
    <P>In England last year five of the principal banks in that country advanced a sum of over £57,000,000 to their customers; while in the year 1923, in Ireland we had the standing committee of the Irish banks coming to this decision: that they would only allow overdrafts to their customers to the extent of one-quarter of the amount of their deposits, the remaining three-quarters probably finding its way out of this country.  The President and the Minister for Finance know that better than anyone else, and I suggest it is their duty to deal with it.  These things are having a very serious effect on the country.  In the &ldquo;Nationalist and Leinster Times,&rdquo; a newspaper which circulates in my constituency, I have seen announcements by one auctioneer, to the effect that he has 27 farms up for sale by public auction.  The reason these farms are up for sale is this, that the banks are coming down on their occupiers with a heavy hand.  They are, in fact, compelling these people to get rid of their land.  I suggest that it is the duty of the Minister for Finance and of his colleagues in the Cabinet to discuss seriously, and without delay, what steps they should take to deal with a situation of that magnitude.</P>
    <P>The sum of £115,000 which is asked for now, is, as we all know, only a revote of portion of the Vote of £500,000 passed last year.  This latter was a sum that should have been spent before the period ending the 31st March last.  The sum that is asked for now cannot, I suggest, to any extent relieve the situation that exists in the country. It will not be found sufficient to deal with the ravages caused by fluke <Col N="122" /> amongst sheep and cattle, or with the situation created by unemployment.  If the sum of £500,000 was considered necessary to meet the situation that existed last year, in my opinion it would take twice or three times that amount to deal with the situation that exists in the country to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the discussion on this Vote is going to be rather mixed.  Two questions of the utmost possible importance have been raised: one the position of the unemployed, and the other the integrity of the Ministry in the administration of relief moneys.  I think it would be wise if we were to deal with the latter question first, and get it properly discussed, and discussed without reference to the general question raised in the motion which I put forward.  I think there is a danger that the Ministry and its supporters will try to cover up, by jocularity, the charges made in a very serious way by Deputy Baxter. I have had quite a number of communications from different parts of the country to the effect that work will not be given out under relief schemes except to men who have got Cumann na nGaedheal cards.  I have not taken too much notice of these, but I sent on two or three of these communications to the Ministry of Local Government with a certain amount of faith that, once their attention was called to the matter, the whole thing would be discountenanced, and that the actual administrators would not give any such preference or make any such condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had communications of that nature from Donegal, Kerry and other parts of the country.  I have not given excessive weight to the complaints, and I appreciate the point made by Deputy Sears that political organisers may have promised to do certain things or encouraged the idea that preference would be given to people who had cards of the organisation, and that they, as commercial travellers of the party, were making promises that could not be fulfilled.  Of course we had an illustration of that on the question raised by Deputy Myles a month or two ago in reference to the action of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in the <Col N="123" /> appointment of a Postmaster at Dunfanaghy as a solace for the loss of his candidature.  That might be explained, but it has not yet been explained to anybody's satisfaction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Baxter has brought forward a very concrete case, or rather a number of cases.  Deputy Sears takes the line that because the Cavan complaints were not duplicated in Mayo, that therefore the Cavan complaints have no basis.  That is not the kind of logic I would expect from Deputy Sears. There are two definite charges, as far as I can understand.  One is, that certain moneys were paid out for relief works which were not designed or set out, or &ldquo;marked out,&rdquo; were the words used, by the engineers.  Deputy Sears denied that point-blank, but Deputy Sears is not in a position to speak with authority on that matter.  The charge made by Deputy Baxter is first that certain works were undertaken, at the direction of the party organiser, which had not been marked out by the official engineers, and the second definite charge is that certain works were carried through, and distinct preference given, favouritism shown to political supporters, and distinct disfavour shown to political opponents.  Deputy Baxter makes the assertion that he could bring forward a considerable amount of evidence in support of these charges.  I do not think it is enough for the President to say he made no promise, and offered no bribes of a public character.  I am not going to say much about the promises that supporters or Ministers might make upon the platform in a public way.  I think the charge, in its essence, is a charge against the administration, that public funds have been allowed by the administration to be expended in support of political party candidatures, and that these public funds have been allocated in such a way as to constitute, in effect, bribery.  That is the charge fairly directly stated by Deputy Baxter. Ministers have not yet had an opportunity to deal with it, and have not yet met it in any way.  I think it is a question that we should discuss, to the exclusion of any other, and I am <Col N="124" /> inclined to press this view upon the Minister.  Deputy Baxter obviously has dealt with this matter with a sense of responsibility.  He has come from the county and he tells us he can bring forward definite evidence in support of his contention.  People who were in the election deny it, but then they were not responsible for the administration. It seems to me to be a case that might well be the subject of inquiry by a Committee of this House, and that Deputy Baxter should be given an opportunity of bringing forward definite evidence, and if necessary, evidence upon oath, in support of his contention, and the Ministry responsible could explain their position in reply to that evidence.  I think this is a case where a report should be made to the House as to how this money was administered, and whether it was in fact, as Deputy Baxter alleges, used for the purposes of political bribery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Johnson that it is very difficult to carry on a discussion along the lines on which this is carried on, because we started off with an amendment to refer back the Vote in order that it might be increased. Then Deputy Baxter cut in with another matter which certainly was not germane to the amendment and was really something that might be raised on a reduction of the Vote or on the main question itself.  Perhaps it would be as well that Deputy Johnson's suggestion should be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say one or two words, however, as a considerable case has been made on the point of distress and unemployment in the country, and the suggestion that the Government has not shown any sort of sense of the seriousness of the situation.  I would like to say one or two words with reference to that before passing on to the other matter.  It may be that we will have to provide further moneys for the relief of distress.  I do not deny that.  I certainly am reluctant to make provision in the Vote for more than a small amount in excess of the sums represented by the fairly definite scheme put forward.  I remember last year when we voted £250,000 at this time, which is the amount to be compared with the <Col N="125" /> £115,000 here.  I had a deputation asking for money for particular work. They had already seen the Minister responsible&mdash;because the moneys provided in this Vote are allocated on the recommendation of other Departments, particularly the Department of Local Government and the Department of Lands and Agriculture&mdash;about a share of the moneys last year.  There was £400,000 last year, and the Department of Lands and Agriculture spent something less than £200,000.</P>
    <P>When this deputation came to me, after seeing the Minister concerned and mentioning their project to him, I cross-examined them to a certain extent, and forced them to admit that their proposal was not a particularly good or urgent one.  Then they said, &ldquo;Well, we understood there is £250,000 going, and we only want our share.  We do not care what you spend it on if you spend it in our district.&rdquo;  I certainly think, in view of that sort of pressure, that will not stop at any amount of misrepresentation or clamour to attain their object, it is undesirable to have too much money voted at large.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not referring to that at all.  I am referring to the proposals that will come up for the allocating of money in various districts, to the lengths to which people will go to get what they think is their share of the amount.  We have provided this money and know pretty definitely what it will be spent upon.  If it is necessary to provide further money, and if fairly definite schemes are put forward from the Departments concerned and it is certain, from all the reports we get through the Department of Industry and Commerce, and from the police, who are spread all over the country, and from the Department of Local Government and so on, that acute distress, which can be relieved up to a certain amount of works, exists, we will consider that, with full knowledge of our duty to prevent the <Col N="126" /> acutest form of distress, and to prevent anything in the nature of actual starvation. We cannot relieve all distress, but we have a duty to try to take the edge off it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No; what I am concerned most with is the evidence of it and some idea of the proposals and the work that might be carried out.  I am going on to say that we are taking other steps, that a good deal more money will be actually provided by the Government in giving employment this year than last.  There will be some five or six hundred thousand pounds&mdash;a very substantial sum spent in connection with the Shannon Scheme during the present financial year.  It is anticipated, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce has already said, that work will be commenced early in the autumn and substantial sums of money will be spent.  That will not appear under the head of Relief Schemes, but it will give substantial employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that only about 3,000 people in one year will be employed under this scheme, and is it a fact that most of the money to be spent will actually go out of the country for machinery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so.  Most of the money will be spent on the civil engineering side.  Then there will be a considerable amount of expenditure on buildings.  There is an actual provision in this year's Estimates for £419,000 for new works which will enable Civic Guard Barracks all over the country to be built or reconstructed and work on the G.P.O. and work on the Four Courts, and other new work to be done.  A certain amount of money will be spent under the Drainage Maintenance Act of last year.  It is expected that a considerable number of districts will be restored this year, and the actual number will depend upon weather conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable amount will be spent in that way.  We will have the Owenmore drainage.  Money will be spent <Col N="127" /> this autumn in connection with the sugar beet factory.  It is hoped to introduce the Bill within the next two or three days.  As soon as the Bill has been passed it will be possible for the actual site of the factory finally to be selected, and the work will then begin. It is intended that the factory should be in full operation next autumn.  Certainly employment will be given during the current financial year in connection with the sugar beet factory. The question of opening a local loans fund for the purpose of making loans to local authorities to enable them to carry out buildings, sewage works and other works of that nature, is under consideration.  I may say it is most probable that some opening up of local loans funds will be done in that respect.</P>
    <P>It is also anticipated that very big sums will be given by way of road grants.  The money will be spent on the improvement of roads.  There will be a sum of £750,000, at any rate, given in that direction.  We actually did make provision last year for advances from the Central Fund to the Road Fund.  It was not found necessary to avail of the power that was taken.  So far as the provision of money is concerned, we will not hold up work on the roads.  It is anticipated, too, that some £330,000 will be paid in connection with housing grants.  A large sum will be given to farmers, or it certainly is available, and it is being given out. Loans are being made to farmers under the Land Improvements Act for drainage, and all that will give employment. I think, on the whole, although there is only £115,000 appearing here in this Vote as against £250,000 last year, actually as much money will be available from State funds in one form or another for giving employment as there was last year.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that they are growing so very fast.  Of course, people will exhaust the amount of benefit that can be given to them, and there will be some increase in numbers; but that may be met to some extent by the speeding up on road improvement. Matters are always somewhat easier in the summer time.  There is certain employment available in the summer time which is not available at other times of the year, and numbers of those works are going on.  At this time last year I think none of the works was going on, because it was merely a question of their being arranged for.  I think there was comparatively little doing in the way of relief works.  We have quite a number of schemes in various towns and a certain amount of work is actually being done in Dublin at the present time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the point.  I do not know what the Deputy's point is.  Perhaps he has a point.  Now, with reference to what Deputy Baxter said, I may say frankly I do not take Deputy Baxter as seriously in the matter as I might take other Deputies.  I do feel that, however cool he may think he is, he is not so cool, and some of the election fever is in his blood; he is not capable of giving an absolutely fair picture of the situation.  These sums for relief were provided last year when it became apparent that there was going to be very considerable distress in the country and when it was apparent in certain places&mdash;considerable areas&mdash; that there was a crop failure.  There was a cry about the failure of crops which was exaggerated, just as the distress arising from the fluke is being exaggerated now.  It was substantial, but it was nothing like what it was represented to be.  There was, however, a more widespread distress caused by the failure of turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was felt then that the only way to relieve the distress that existed was by way of making provision for carrying out different works.  Even before money was voted in the Dáil, certain preliminary preparations were made by the Land Commission.  Certain schedules of work were submitted to the Department of Finance.  In the circumstances they could not be submitted to the examination that such proposals ordinarily would get.  They could not be taken and gone into with a view to giving the complete explanation and justification asked for in each case.  We had the general reports received from agricultural instructors and overseers and others as to the distress in districts in which there was distress existing.  We had certain proposals for relief, by way of works, put forward by the Local Government Department, and there were also proposals in regard to the distribution of fuel and the provision of meals for school children in certain areas.  Money was allocated in the best possible way in connection with the various cases put up.  Money was allocated to the Land Commission on the basis of the <Col N="130" /> schedules of work that were put forward. These works, however, were frankly put forward in a somewhat tentative way.  Every specific work was not fully examined.  The schedules of works were rather provisional.</P>
    <P>When we authorised expenditure by the Land Commission on works such as making, improving and extending bog roads, making a bog pass, improving road drainage, extending roads to a bog, and drainage work on a river, we gave the Land Commission power to vary the work and to do other work of a similar character in the neighbourhood of the places affected by the works mentioned in the Schedule, if it would be found convenient to carry those additional works out, and if it would be found, on further examination by the Land Commission, that they would be better works.  All that was done.  The work of preparing these schemes of relief by the Land Commission was put into definite shape when it became apparent, as a result of the failure in the turf harvest and the partial failure that occurred in crops, that big works would be necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputies should realise what it means for the Land Commission or any Government Department to go over the country to deal with widespread distress, to get a scheme of work into operation, and to do that quickly.  I think Deputies should realise by now how slow Government machinery is ordinarily.  I hear great complaints about delays.  Delays are, to my mind, inseparable from the system of organisation that prevails in the country; they are inseparable so far as we can see at the present time.  What really causes delay is the bottle-neck process.  Things go from one individual to another, and the number of people authorised to take decisions is very small.  It must necessarily be small because of the responsibility that rests on the Minister, because of the question of Parliamentary control, and because decisions can only be taken by people who are in touch with the Minister. We have that bottle-neck system which results in the formulation of schemes. and the approval of works being ordinarily a very slow matter.</P>
    <P>Delays occur in the doing of works <Col N="131" /> in a Government that would not occur in a private firm, because there is no Parliamentary responsibility there. There is a devolution of authority that so far as I can see, is very difficult to achieve in Government offices.  We had to get these works through. Instead of still being talking about them, instead of still being in the position of having angry letters going to and fro from the Land Commission to the Department of Finance about them, we had to give the Land Commission this power to go ahead.  The people at the top in the Land Commission could not await the reporting and the writing out of justifications for their proposals, before anything was done.  There had to be a general degree of devolution of authority, that is not usual in Government works, in the carrying out of Government administration, but it was necessary because of real need.  I think, in spite of the exaggeration we heard, there was real need for these works.  There was real need for the relief of distress.</P>
    <P>We had at the same time an election going on.  We had the other side trying to claim credit for everything that was being done to please the people. I do not know what Deputy Baxter claimed.  I do not read the Cavan papers, but I know that it was put round by his supporters in Co. Cavan that he had got £15,000 for Cavan. There was that sort of attempt to claim credit for anything that was done.  I do not say Deputy Baxter did it, but at any rate his friends did put forward that claim, that Deputy Baxter had got Cavan £15,000.  I believe that on another political platform it was stated in regard to that £15,000 that if Cavan had been depending on Deputy Baxter, a penny would not have come to Cavan.  That was the sort of atmosphere you had going on.  Everybody, as far as I can see, was trying to claim credit for anything that was done.  You had these people also surrounding anybody who had the authority to take any decision about works to be done, whether they should be done, and what sort of work should be done.  You had them going along making representations. A man who was sent down to <Col N="132" /> get information in regard to works is not like somebody living in the county all his life.  He had to get local information, to see people, to discover whether there was distress, whether the people would work and who needed work, and to find out what sort of work could be done.</P>
    <P>There was the question of local representation and local pressure being put on anybody in that atmosphere. What I really feel about it&mdash;and I am at one with Deputy Baxter in what I feel is right&mdash;as far as Deputy Baxter's Party is concerned, as far as the Cumann na nGaedheal Party is concerned, it is a case of the pot calling the kettle black.  Everybody was trying to get work done in any particular district that suited them, and they were trying to claim credit for anything done, that brought any sort of feeling of satisfaction amongst the voters.  I suggest that, because that was the fact of the case, we did not hear a word about this when the election was going on, because people feared that if they objected there would be a loss of votes if they said anything. I honestly think that is an unfair representation of the position.  As far as I am concerned, I have no hesitation in agreeing with Deputy Baxter that there could be nothing worse for the country or for any party, even for the party that might do it, than to have works carried out on a political basis.</P>
    <P>I believe definitely with Deputy Baxter that to have these works done on a political basis would create a mob of political mendicants who would turn on anybody who had been giving them moneys as soon as they ceased giving them moneys.  That would have brought corruption into political life that would extend throughout the State.  So far as I am concerned, I certainly would not stand for any giving of money to a particular district because of any political object to be gained.  So far as I know, I made no promise, and I certainly took no action&mdash;I am very sure of that&mdash;because of any political pressure that was brought to bear on me, and there were all sorts of political pressures.  Fellows came up here from Cavan in motor cars to see about some <Col N="133" /> resigned and dismissed R.I.C. cases. Fortunately the President had kept me late.  I was in a bad temper, and when I met them on the doorstep I told them to go somewhere else.  I did not listen to them.  That sort of business was going on, but I must certainly say I would not for one moment stand for any differentiation politically.  I would not give work to a district which did not need it because of the political complexion of the inhabitants, and I would not refuse any district which was in need of work because of the political complexion of the inhabitants. If anything such as Deputy Baxter says was done, in the case of a drain, and if it was done in the way he suggests, and that it was not merely a sort of coincidence or some bungling in the work, I say that was disgraceful. That sort of thing should not be stood over.</P>
    <P>I think the first complaint that came to my ears about work in Co. Cavan came from Deputy Baxter himself just immediately after the elections.  I was not in that county except in the early days of the election.  As I say, Deputy Baxter made some complaints to me personally.  I made enquiries about them, and I found that we had complaints of the other character from other people, complaints about Irregulars having got all the work in certain districts.  I do not know whether they were true or not.  I do not believe the stories as to the works being bad works.  I think Deputy Baxter suggests, to some extent, that a great deal of useless, unnecessary work was done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>There was some good work done, but the point I wanted to make was that there was work done which clearly indicated that an engineer was not responsible for starting it. There was one particular work where £500 or £600 was allotted, and there was a case in the High Court over it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Baxter did not go so far as I thought he had gone. <Col N="134" /> All I could hear, and I made a good many inquiries, was that the work being done generally over the country was good and useful work.  I asked all sorts of independent people in different counties about the matter, and, as far as I could understand, the money was as well spent as such money could be spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not met the main point I made as to allocation of the money, as to the people who were responsible for saying that there would be £40 spent here, £60 in this district, £80 in that district, and £200 in another.  He has not met the point that the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation were the men who, on their own responsibility, decided that the money would be spent like that, or accompanied the Government engineer round and got the work started wherever they wished.  I want the Minister to meet that point.  The Minister makes the point that he did not hear anything about that until the election was over.  Deputy Sears listened to me stating it publicly at a meeting early in the election, and if he was doing his duty to his party and thought there was any doubt or question about what was put forward, would he not have come to the Minister and asked if this scandalous state of affairs was prevailing in Cavan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to come to that.  I was saying that, so far as I could hear, after making inquiries, the money was fairly well spent.  There was not one hundred per cent. of value got for it, or anything like it.  I do not suppose that could ever be got for it.  In view of the haste and of the particular way that the works had to be undertaken, there probably were certain bad works&mdash;I mean works that were bad from an engineering point of view, because even if you send a competent man to decide on works, if his business is to get work started and money spent to give relief, no matter how competent or conscientious he is, that man will from time to time simply rush into a scheme without proper consideration and start it going.  I would say that the number of these works that were bad from an engineering point of view was not very large, that <Col N="135" /> the position was no worse than you could expect in such a situation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the allocation, I cannot see how what Deputy Baxter alleges could have happened.  It may be that the people who were organisers for the Cumann na nGaedheal in a particular place managed to hang on to the engineer in certain cases.  They might have been the people who took the most trouble to get into touch with him or had representations ready to make to him, who accompanied him round to recommend works that were favourite works of theirs, but certainly the works had to be started and vouched for by the official of the Land Commission.  There was no possibility of any works being started in some peculiar way and being paid for out of this relief Vote other than through the ordinary machinery of the Land Commission.  The whole work was really placed on the Land Commission and was done through officials of the Land Commission.  The officials of the Land Commission had to recommend the various schemes and they had to vouch and account for the expenditure of the money.  I could not tell how an impression could have got out that other people could start works.  I certainly know that they could not.  I I do not see how any official of the Land Commission would&mdash;and it certainly could be investigated if any official of the Land Commission did it &mdash;vouch expenditure that he had no act in starting.  The work was entirely the duty of the various Land Commission officials detailed to do it.  I do know, of course, as has been stated by two or three Deputies, that every sort of political organiser in the constituency was anxious to claim that he did everything, that he was responsible for getting things started, that such organisers would be round any engineer like flies around a honeypot, and that all sorts of representations might be made to Deputy Baxter and to people in the locality.  But as to what the Deputy alleges having happened, I do not see how it could have happened. I simply cannot see how it could have happened.</P>

      <P>The statement that the Minister cannot see how it could have happened is not sufficient refutation of the statement of Deputy Baxter that it did happen.  It seems to me that it is a conflict between what Deputy Baxter says and what the Minister says did happen&mdash;whether what Deputy Baxter said is accurate, whether it is correct, and whether it can be proved. The Minister does not deny it.  He only says: &ldquo;I cannot see how it could have happened.&rdquo;  I think that the Minister ought to accept Deputy Baxter's challenge and have his charge refuted, if possible.  I suggest to the Minister that it is a matter of the very gravest concern.  If it can be believed by any number of people in the community, and if a case such as is submitted by Deputy Baxter can be supported by a responsible party, such as the Farmers' Party, undoubtedly it ought not to be allowed by the Minister to go through the country as a statement that has not been disproved.  I think some more response to the very definite charge made by Deputy Baxter ought to be made by the Ministry&mdash;that he should be challenged to prove his statement, that the responsibility should be put on him of proving the statement and, if possible, have it disproved.</P>

      <P>I would be very glad to hear any details from Deputy Baxter.  He has had a good many opportunities of raising the matter in the Dáil, and so far I have not seen that he has taken any advantage of them. There are ways in which he could have put a particular case before the Dáil. He could either have raised it at Questions or on the adjournment, and given the Minister for Lands and Agriculture an opportunity of having some investigations carried out and of making a reply.  When a case is put like that before the Dáil and discussed, we would know just exactly the state of affairs, and if there was a <i>prima facie</i> case.  At present dealing with generalities <Col N="137" /> and speaking in vague terms, I do not see that we have anything established.</P>

      <P>I think it is not right for the Minister to say that I got a chance and did nothing.  I went to the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, and told him a month ago that I intended to raise this matter on this Vote.  I told him I would give concrete cases.  I want to say that I thought it was under the Minister's Department the money was administered that I am claiming was mal-administered. I say that it is up to the Minister to throw out the challenge that Deputy Johnson suggests he ought to throw out, and let the question be submitted to a vote of the Dáil.  I am prepared to put the facts before the Minister and the Dáil.  I am more disinterested in the matter than the Minister would probably give me credit for. I could have raised it in other ways and said a good deal more, but I am not satisfied to let the matter rest as the Minister has left it.  The Minister has not met the case, and I want to have it cleared up definitely.</P>

      <P>It is very unsatisfactory from the point of view of a Minister answering not to have a concrete case put up or to have a concrete case put up without notice.  The Deputy could put up a concrete case.  He could have asked a question which would lead to investigations by the Minister, and the facts would then be in the Minister's hands.  If the Deputy had raised the matter we could have one, two or three concrete cases discussed.</P>

      <P>There is only one way in which this can be fairly and impartially decided.  It will not be decided by the Ministry that I say have made the mistakes.  It will only be decided by a Committee of the Dáil representative of the different Parties.  It is an issue big enough to be decided by such a Committee, and no other Committee will fairly decide it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should have taken the ordinary and necessary <Col N="138" /> steps to make a <i>prima facie</i> case by having given a fair opportunity for the discussion of a certain number of selected concrete cases, and not merely asking to have a Select Committee appointed to investigate a general and somewhat vague statement.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin made a statement with regard to bank deposits and advances.  I am prepared to say that the statement made by Deputy Davin cannot be true.  The figures do not disclose that there is any truth in the statement.  I understood Deputy Davin to say that the Standing Committee of the Banks had decided that they would only advance to customers 25 per cent. of the amount held on deposit receipts.</P>

      <P>It would be impossible for them to come to any such decision.  At the end of 1923 the difference between bills discounted and advances and deposits was £92,400,000. The deposits amounted to £188,000,000, and the advances and bills discounted to £95,600,000.</P>

      <P>At the end of 1924 the deposits were £182,800,000, and the bills discounted and advances made were £92,500,000.  On the face of it there were even more favourable advances to customers last year than the year before as far as deposits are concerned. I leave it to the Deputy himself as to what possible chance there is for a bank in any country where you are going to call up £45,000,000 or £46,000,000 in twelve months.  It could not be done.  People ought not to be spreading these stories, as it is a serious thing in the interests of the business of the country.  It would be absolutely impossible to call in £45,000,000 or £46,000,000.  The banks would be mad to do so.  I am a child in banking matters, but I am old enough to know that it is an impossible situation.  It could not possibly have <Col N="139" /> been a decision of the Standing Committee of the Banks.</P>
