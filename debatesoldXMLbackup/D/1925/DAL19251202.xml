      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the <Col N="1032" /> Minister for Finance if he is aware that the claim for compensation of Mr. Edward Stewart, Caherhurley, Bodyke, Co. Clare, in respect of injuries stated to have been sustained by his son, Peter, at the hands of the British forces in December, 1920, has been disallowed by the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee, and if he is now in a position to state the nature of the considerations which led the Commission to this decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The application of the person named by the Deputy that compensation should be paid to him in respect of injuries received by his son, Peter, was carefully considered by the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee. Peter Stewart is a patient in a Mental Hospital, and as the evidence before the Committee showed that his recovery is improbable it was necessary for them, in considering the application of his father, to have regard, in accordance with their terms of reference, to the extent of the dependency of the applicant upon his son.  Having reviewed the facts of the case in this light, the Committee were satisfied that there was no dependency on the part of the applicant upon the injured man, and, in the circumstances, they decided, and I agree, that they could not make a recommendation for the payment of compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The communications mentioned, each of which was duly acknowledged on receipt, refer to matters affecting staff employed in a number of different Departments, and three of them involve the consideration of issues concerning classes which are common to the whole Civil Service.  It will be understood that questions of this kind can only be dealt with after consideration of the effect that any suggested modification in existing conditions in the case of one Department might produce in all the Departments concerned.  Each Department has to be consulted, and a considerable time must consequently elapse before it is possible to communicate a decision. The Association was last month informed of the action taken in regard to Superintendents of Typists.  The questions raised in the letters on other subjects have not been overlooked, and it is hoped that a reply to each will be issued at an early date.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is now in a position to grant unemployment benefit to the six Avoca workers who were employed in County Wicklow by Orr Watt and Co., Glasgow, and whose contributions were paid in British stamps instead of stamps issued by the Saorstát; if he is aware that these men paid their contributions over a period extending from January, 1924, to June, 1925, and whether he can see his way to have the benefit paid immediately pending settlement with the British authorities and the Glasgow employers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Six Avoca workers, who are presumably those referred to by the Deputy: Patrick Travers, James Doyle, Patrick Lambert, Michael Kennedy, Robert Gallagher and John O'Toole, have claimed benefit in the current benefit year which commenced on the 15th of October last.  Their claims have been authorised, and benefit will be paid to them in proportion to the number of unexhausted <Col N="1039" /> contributions to their credit. With the exception of Robert Gallagher, all these workmen had previously claimed benefit on the 17th of June, 1925, but those claims had to be disallowed under the first part of Section 8 (4) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, as an insurance year had passed in which no contributions had been paid for them, and the disqualification had not been removed by the payment of the 12 further contributions necessary to restore their rights to benefit.  It was then discovered that contributions which should have been paid for them in this country in respect of their employment in County Wicklow by Messrs. Orr Watt and Co., of Glasgow, had not in fact been paid, the employers, apparently in error, having paid those contributions into the Unemployment Insurance Fund of Great Britain instead of the Unemployment Insurance Fund of this country.  The necessary steps were taken to collect those contributions and payment of them was finally made on the 30th of September last.  Upon the payment of those contributions Messrs. Kennedy, O'Toole, Doyle and Lambert became entitled to and were paid benefit on their claims of the 17th of June, as from the 30th of September to the end of the benefit year, that is, the 14th of October.  Mr. Travers had ceased to prove unemployment prior to date of the payment of those contributions, and so could not receive benefit as the others did between the 30th of September and 14th of October. Appeals to the Court of Referees and Umpire are pending in respect of the disallowance of the claims of Messrs. Kennedy, O'Toole, and Lambert prior to the 30th of September.</P>

The Deputy is, according to his own public statements, engaged in a campaign to impede a scheme which has been approved by the Oireachtas, and to add appreciably to the expenditure on it authorised by vote of the Oireachtas. He is seeking to defeat a deliberate resolution of the Dáil in respect to wages, that decision being sought by the Deputy's own motion.  I feel, in the circumstances, that I must be quite rigid on the matter of supplementary questions as these raise technical points which have already involved Deputy Johnson in faulty deductions, based upon erroneous calculations from figures supplied by me.

      <P>The Land Commission have no information as to the amount of costs paid as these costs are paid not to the Land Commission, but to the solicitor.  It is assumed the chronic defaulters referred to are those persons against whom decrees were obtained and the sheriff made a return of nulla bona.  During the past 5 years it has not been possible to sell such holdings in County Kerry.  When it is realised that those arrears fall on the county rates by means of deductions from the grants in aid of local taxation it is probable that the difficulty of selling the holdings by public auction would disappear.</P>

    <P>With regard to the six-day notice, the issue of this notice was discontinued as from 1st January, 1924, after notice had been given.  When they were first instituted it was only necessary to issue them in a limited number of cases, but it became the habit of a very large number of the annuitants <Col N="1057" /> to wait for the issue of the notices before paying their annuities instead of paying them when they become due, thus impossing on the Land Commission extra work and expense in the preparation and issue of the notices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Baxter's question, the facts are that in 1913 and 1914 I should say it was necessary to issue about 5 per cent. of these six-day notices.  In 1920 and 1921 that five per cent. went up to 60 or 70 and it had become quite plain that it was a waste of time to send a receivable order because 60 or 70 per cent. ignored it and waited for the six-day notice.  This is a question for consideration from the point of view of public expense&mdash;to consider whether it is right to continue the farce of sending out the receivable order and the six-day notice or to cease to send out one and make it clear to the people that they are to pay on one notice issued as at present.  Personally I think it would be a mistake to go back to the six-day notice.  If you did so you would have a repetition of the state of affairs of 1920 or 1921, everyone waiting for the six-day notice and ignoring the receivable order.  It would mean, too, a duplication of the work.</P>

If he does pay on the 30th June, the receivable order is returned to him and he has it in his house with the legend written across it: &ldquo;The next instalment due is the instalment due on the 31st December.&rdquo; Every tenant knows that perfectly well, and the return of the receivable order is, in fact, a sufficient notice.  The suggestion is that we should couple with that the issuing of a six-day notice a fortnight after the event&mdash;that is to say, the receivable order is returned in the ordinary way, the gale annuity is paid, let us say, on the 30th June, and if it is not paid, that we should issue a six-day notice in the middle of July.  That would be just a waste of money, because, in fact, what was happening was <Col N="1059" /> that people were withholding their receivable orders, not paying within fourteen days, as they were requested to do in the receivable order, and waiting for the six-day notice.  However, I do not want to make a speech about it.  I want to answer one point raised by Deputy Davin with regard to the costs. There is a good deal of talk about costs.  There were two thousand civil bills issued in Kerry, and the net costs to the solicitors was fourpence a civil bill.</P>

Undoubtedly I think we may assume that the Standing Order was drafted in view of ordinary legislation and that the parties as recognised in this House, should have a representation on a committee equal to their proportional representation here.  This Bill is of a totally different kind.  It was brought forward by a member of the Government Party but there was open voting. There was not a single Party which voted as a Party on it.  There should be some recognition of that fact, and that recognition should stand as a precedent <Col N="1072" /> for future Committees of Selection when they are appointing a Committee on a Bill of a similar type to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for going into Committee, and I will try to show it, by curtailing my remarks as much as possible.  This amendment is the outcome of an undertaking given to me when the Bill was under discussion on the third stage, and I am sorry to say that I do not regard it as a perfect fulfilment of that undertaking, because owing to the technicality of draughtsmanship, owing to the fact that the draughtsmanship of the principal Act has been adhered to, I am precluded from moving an amendment which I intended for the purpose of securing that the regulation should be laid on the Table of both House three months, and not one month, before the examination.  Sub-section (4) of Section 4 of the principal Act runs:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every special regulation made by the Commissioners under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas at least one month before the examination or any of the examinations, to which such regulation relates, is held, and if both such Houses shall within the next 21 days pass a resolution annulling such regulation, etc.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, where examinations are going to be closed to persons of one sex, I think you will agree that a month's notice is not sufficient and that three months would be a reasonable compromise.  One does not begin to work for an examination a month before it, or even three months before it, and to be told a month before that the examination is going to be for one particular class, for men or for women, is liable to cause a great deal of disappointment and it is unreasonable and undesirable.  The regulations have to be laid on the Table a month before the examination is held.  We can subsequently raise the matter within 21 days after the next sitting of the Dáil <Col N="1074" /> or Seanad.  What does that mean? That means that sometimes the examination will have been held three months before the matter can be raised in the House.  An examination held in August would not be open to discussion until November.  That is no safeguard at all; it is ridiculous.  You cannot say that an examination held in August must be wiped out in November and the persons who pass disqualified.  We cannot do that.  I cannot accept this as fulfilling the pledge on the understanding of which I withdrew an amendment previously.  This is not workable.  As a concession as regards differentiation between the sections it is worth less than nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Cooper is minimising the effect of this unduly.  I doubt, for one thing, whether a regulation can be laid before each house of the Oireachtas when the House are not sitting.  That is not my understanding of it, and I take leave to differ with the Deputy.  I think a regulation must be laid when the House is sitting.  With regard to the period, first of all, this is one of those regulations, although treated as special regulations, which is one of the ordinary regulations governing an examination, and as such, in accordance with Section 11 of the principal Act, it must be published immediately it is made in &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil.&rdquo;  That will mean that as soon as the examination is finally announced this regulation will be made and published.  Apart from that altogether, I think that the Deputy must be aware that for the Commissioners to issue an announcement of examination without indicating that it would be confined to members of one sex, and within a month of the examination to lay a special regulation confining it to one sex, would be to invite a certain throwing out of that regulation by the Houses of the Oireachtas. There is really no reason for fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is improbable that in ordinary circumstances such a short notice as a month would be given except it is an examination that is held hurriedly. Sometimes the exigencies of the service demand that a staff be got hurriedly together.  Such things, for instance, <Col N="1075" /> as a Budget, might require a great increase in staff, or, again, a change in the income tax or in any other law might require a staff hurriedly. It is, therefore, necessary that if required the Commissioners should be enabled to hold an examination at short notice.  It should be the normal thing to give more than three months. Six, eight or nine months is the notice that is usually given, but there may be times when it may not be possible to give as much as three months' notice.  That is why we stick to the regulation in the principal Act prescribing that the regulation be laid within one month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is undesirable to take even a temporary staff without examination.

      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am right in saying that there was a considerable congestion of work in the Land Commission recently which was dealt with by a temporary staff without examination.  That has been the practice, I understand, not in every Government Department, but in many. I am glad that the Minister recognises his obligation to the temporary staffs, as they sometimes feel that they are forgotten.  Though I think the Minister has made a case, he has made it on the one ground that regulations cannot be laid on the Table of both Houses of the Oireachtas when the Houses are not sitting.  If that is so, I agree, but I have found in the library regulations marked at dates, possibly inadvertently, when the Houses of the Oireachtas were not sitting.  I am referring to statutory regulations under the Dairy Produce, the Fishery, and other Acts.  They become available when the Dáil is not sitting.  These, too, are <Col N="1076" /> statutory regulations, but if the Minister will give me an undertaking that these regulations shall not be laid except when the Dáil is sitting, it will meet my case.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 3, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In page 3, Section 3, to delete lines one to fifteen inclusive.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think I owe the Minister and the Dáil an apology for bringing forward such a drastic amendment on a stage which is generally devoted to abstract, technical, and prolific amendments by Deputy Duggan.  This is an amendment of some substance.  It proposes, in effect, to delete sub-section (2) of Section 3.  I bring it forward because on the last stage I endeavoured to obtain a safeguard under which the powers sought here should be used. They were not obtained and I am convinced that the only wise thing for us to do is to delete the sub-section.  This sub-section gives power to the Executive Council to take one man, when they are satisfied that he is a suitable person, and present him to the Civil Service Commissioners without examination or any process of selection, subject to the one safeguard which I will deal with later, and have a certificate of qualification issued to him.  The Minister told us on a previous occasion that this Bill was, in some respects, more moderate than the principal Act, which it is intended to supplement.  In a sense it is, because you will have to obtain the concurrence of the whole Executive Council and not that of two Ministers.  In practice that might be a flimsy safeguard.  I cannot imagine that if the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Finance were agreed as to the candidate for a position the Minister for External Affairs or the Minister for Defence would disagree.</P>

      <P>I am <Col N="1077" /> speaking with less knowledge than the Minister.  I only judge by observation. In one respect this section goes further than the principal Act.  Section 6 of the principal Act says, in effect, &ldquo;that whenever the Minister for Finance and the Minister in charge of the Department shall consider that the qualifications deemed requisite for any particular situation are wholly, or in part, professional or otherwise peculiar, and are not ordinarily to be acquired within the Civil Service,&rdquo; and so forth.  That is in Section 1, but it is not in this section. There is no such safeguard.  This sub-section, if carried, would, subject to one small safeguard, make it possible for the Executive Council to dispense with competitive examination. The Minister will say that that is not the intention of the Executive Council. I do not believe that it is.  To create by a process of law a state of affairs by which some Executive Council at some future date is empowered to set aside examinations is a thing which I ask the Dáil to think deeply and carefully about.  I think it is unwise.  The Minister will, no doubt, tell me, as he generally does, that I have not read the Act or understood it.</P>

      <P>I assure the Minister not only did I read the Bill, but I also read the debates leading up to the Act, and any defect in comprehension is not the result of laziness but of sheer mental thickness.  I maintain this sub-section reads in the sense I have indicated, and that, subject to this safeguard, the Executive Council can appoint any person to any post without examination.  I object to that, even with this Executive Council, because they may think a man is best for a particular post, but they do not know everybody in the Saorstát.  They cannot tell that the process of a limited competition by appearance before a Selection Board might produce an equally good man, of whom they had not heard, or, if they did, whom they might have thought was unwilling to undertake that post.  This is throwing too much of a burden on the Executive Council.  They know certain parts of <Col N="1078" /> the country very well.  Excepting perhaps the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, they do not know Cork, for instance.  They know Northern Ireland with a fair amount of knowledge, and there is a certain amount of knowledge of Dundalk, but they do not know the whole country.  There may be equally suitable people for those posts, such as the State chemist, for example, who must be tired of being used as an illustration, or the engineer in charge of the Shannon scheme.  It must be remembered that there are already very considerable exemptions in the original Act, and these exemptions continue. All situations to which the holder is appointed by the Governor-General on the advice of the Executive Council are exempted from examination, and all situations to which the holders are appointed by the Executive Council, such as the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and also unestablished posts for porters, doorkeepers, artisans and unskilled labourers, and all situations in the Gárda.  These are exempt already, and there is only a limited number of posts for which this sub-section may be required in order to obtain the power to fill that limited number of posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Executive Council propose to claim this very dangerous power of absolutely dispensing with examinations, subject to the one safeguard as to whether the Civil Service Commissioners shall think fit.  That is the only safeguard, and the Minister minimised that safeguard somewhat on the Committee Stage when he said that the Civil Service Commissioners should not act as judges of the Executive Council. I hope I have said nothing to prejudice the Civil Service Commissioners, or to suggest that they are not an impartial body.  I believe they are, but when a certificate of fitness is the only safeguard it is not unfitting to inquire on what conditions they are appointed, and on what tenure they hold their office.  Section 1 of the principal Act states that it shall be lawful for the Executive Council from time to time to appoint fit and proper persons to be appointed by the Civil Service Commissioners. Every person appointed shall hold office during the pleasure of the Executive Council, and the Commissioners <Col N="1079" /> are liable to be removed by the Executive Council, so that this is no safeguard.  In the future, if some Executive Council found some Civil Service Commissioners were refusing to think fit people whom the Executive Council thought fit, then the Executive Council would sweep the Commissioners away and appoint new and more subservient ones.  That is the danger of the wide powers in the section. I am willing to give power in sub-section (1) to appoint a selection board, and I am also willing to give power in sub-section (3) to transfer to another post a person who had got a certificate.  I would be willing to extend that power to all persons now in the Civil Service, but the power in sub-section (2) is a wide and far-reaching one, and I shall ask the Dáil not to agree with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make one further effort to make it clear to the Dáil that we are not asking for powers in this particular sub-section that are not already in the principal Act.  Deputy Cooper read out a portion of Section 6 of the principal Act, but he did not read out the portion that corresponds to sub-section (2) of Section 3 in this Bill.  The portion which has a corresponding provision to the one Deputy Cooper wants eliminated is that which says where the Minister for Finance and the Minister in charge of the Department shall consider that it would be in the public interest that the rules in regard to age, or that the whole or any part of an examination should be dispensed with, the Commissioners may, if they wish, issue a certificate. That is the position, that two Ministers can put up a candidate to the Civil Service Commission on the grounds of public interest, and we propose to alter that so that in future a candidate will have to be recommended by the Executive Council as a whole. Deputy Cooper's idea of the pliancy of members of the Executive Council is one that, perhaps, some day he may alter.  Our existing Act mainly has put into statutory form the provision of the British Orders in Council.  The provision is this: In case a head of a Department and the Treasury shall <Col N="1080" /> consider that it would be to the public interest that the prescribed examination and rules in regard to age should be wholly or partially dispensed with, the Commissioners may, if they think fit, dispense with such examinations.</P>
      <P>The position in Great Britain is that it is not even the Minister but the head of the Department who determines public interest, and applies to the Civil Service Commissioners to dispense with examinations.  In our first Act we took a step in advance of that, and instead of having it done departmentally by the head of a Department, we brought the Ministers into the case.  We have now gone still further, and we have brought the whole Executive Council into it. There is another respect in which our regulation is very much tighter than the British Order in Council.  Apart from the distinction that arises from the fact that we have a statute instead of an Order in Council, that may be altered any day, our Act applies to all situations except those scheduled, and no situations of a permanent character may be added to the schedule.  The Commissioners may add temporary situations, but they cannot add permanent ones.  In England the position is that the head of any Department, with the approval of the Treasury, may from time to time by notice in the <i>London Gazette</i> add situations to the schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion has been put forward very frequently in this debate that we are seeking some sort of wide and extreme powers.  As a matter of fact we have tightened up the provisions very much in the principal Act as compared with the provisions in the Order in Council in Great Britain.  We have tightened them still further.  The powers which exist in England of adding all sorts of situations to the schedule are not being used to any extent, except in the case of charwomen or porters, but actually there is power in the head of a Department, an ordinary civil servant, in England without the consent of the Treasury to add any situation whatever, and exempt from the Act, so that we have very considerably limited the powers of setting aside the ordinary procedure laid down in the Act.  We have heard and read of <Col N="1081" /> some of the criticisms dealing with our proposals in this Bill, and they entirely misrepresent the position.  I do not think it is a practical proposition to take out this power.  We have made the procedure in regard to the recruitment of the Civil Service exceedingly rigid.  The fact that we have a statute instead of an Order in Council in itself introduces an element of rigidity which would not be dreamt of in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I believe the tightening up which we have proposed and carried out is good; but I do not want to tighten up the thing so that any peculiar or unforeseen situation cannot be dealt with when we have not some ordinary means for dealing with any such situation. I have quoted instances of cases where it might be required.  I could quote lots of others.  For instance, let us take the case of the High Commissioner in London.  That is an appointment of, at least, a semi-political character.  To my mind it is not the sort of appointment that should be made in the way laid down for the ordinary staff of our offices or of our inspectorates.  It is very questionable whether there would be any other means of appointing, say, a High Commissioner, except this particular sub-section.</P>
    <P>As for the suggestion that we are going to abuse our powers, I do not think that is at all likely.  I object entirely to the point of view put forward by Deputy Cooper, that even if there is some small degree of honesty in the present administration, we cannot hope for it and should not look for it in any administration that may succeed this one.  I look for a very considerable degree of honesty in any administration that may come into power here.  There are lots of abuses that, if Ministers stooped to them, they could perpetrate under the present Act. Civil servants are at the will and pleasure of the Executive Council.  I do not see anything in law to prevent the Executive Council dismissing every civil servant who would not pay tithes to every member of the Council.  We do not do that.  We have not done it so far, and I do not anticipate that it will be done.  I do not anticipate the members of the administration will <Col N="1082" /> ever stoop to do the infamous, or anything in the nature of the infamous, under this sub-section.</P>
    <P>I am quite confident the section is one that will be used fairly in the public interest, and that it will be used to deal with situations for which the ordinary machinery is not adequate.  I think it is an entirely wrong view that is put forward, that you must assume that things any man would have a right to be ashamed of, things that are patently dishonest, are the things we must guard against with the most minute regulations, and that we must allow no discretion whatever to people who have to exercise big powers and great discretion in the carrying out of their duties in regard to far more important matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I seem fated to the end of time to go on quarrelling with the Minister over Civil Service Bills. The reason is very largely because he always produces some small individual case to justify broad and sweeping changes.  He instances the case of the High Commissioner.  I do not know whether it would be beyond the power of the Civil Service Commission to set up a selection board to select a High Commissioner.  The Government might discover some person well qualified whose name would not occur to them. yet who would be anxious for the post if an opportunity was given to apply for it.  If it is felt it might be undesirable to chose a High Commissioner in that way, why not add him to the schedule?  Why should not his appointment be embodied in the schedule to the principal Act?  Could he not be put on the same footing as, for instance, the Comptroller and Auditor-General? We would all be prepared to meet the Government in this case. We think really that these enormous powers might be abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister rightly says, there will be a good deal of common honesty in the Government that holds sway; but the Minister knows there is a good deal of suggestion and a good deal of party pressure, a good deal of pressure from the baser elements.  We all know there are people whose main interests in politics are the jobs that can be secured and the things that can be <Col N="1083" /> done.  Every Government will be subject to that pressure, and I believe that this section gives them the loophole. The Minister justifies the section on a British precedent.  I know these British precedents.  It is quite true our statutory method is more rigid than the British system of Order in Council.  The British precedents are only made practicable by the fact that they have a great tradition in the Civil Service there.  It is a long-standing institution with old traditions and a great influence.  Those provisions are liable to be abused and have been abused.</P>
    <P>I remember the case of a member of Parliament who was a Whip, and not a very popular or successful Whip.  The Government wanted to get rid of him, but he refused to go unless he got a post. He was appointed to the Revenue Commissioners or the Income Tax Department, a branch of the Civil Service, without examinations.  He was appointed under an Order in Council.  I do not want that to happen here.  I do not think that the Ministry intends it should happen; but the powers under this sub-section would allow it to happen.  There have been other similar cases in Great Britain where people, whom the Government were anxious to get rid of, have been given appointments in the Dominions and the Colonies, and that operates in keeping the Civil Service pure.  The British rules have been, and are, liable to abuse.  I am very anxious that we should not set up a precedent that will enable our Civil Service to be abused in the same way.  It is a young Civil Service in many Departments; it has hardly been four years in existence. One of the most important things any Deputy can do is to see that the possibility of undue patronage and the possibility of the Executive Council putting up their own candidate for every important post that becomes vacant, is completely ruled out by law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  Under a democratic rule, such as we have the advantage to be under at present, one of the great Ministries&mdash;I mean Ministries in the sense of great agencies or instruments <Col N="1084" /> of government&mdash;is the Civil Service.  In a democratic system such as ours, the Civil Service is the most important element in the government of the country.  True, it neither originates nor directs policy; but it is the brain, to a large extent, of the Minister and his colleagues who do.  There is nothing more essential for the wellbeing, and particularly for the future welfare, of this country than that its Civil Service should from the very beginning stand on the highest plane that can be secured for it; that the staffing of it should be free from the slightest breath of suspicion; that there should be nothing in any statute or order that would seem to the most critical intelligence to offer an opportunity for appointments to higher posts in that Civil Service which are not in the public interest.  I have deliberately quoted from the Bill &ldquo;in the public interest.&rdquo;  I direct the Minister's attention to the fact that there are only two checks as regards the decision of the Executive Council as to a certain selection being made in the public interest. One is that the Civil Service Commissioners may think fit to allow it to go without question.  The other is the check of public opinion.  I am not going to labour once more the point that has been made by several of us already in the previous debate.  Deputy Cooper has already elaborated it this evening.  So long as the Civil Service Commission contains even one subordinate official to the Executive Council it cannot be that free and independent body which would enable it to exercise its necessary functions as the watchdog on public finance.  It is putting too great a strain on the Civil Service Commission.  I am quite confident that the present Civil Service Commissioners would bear any such strain.  I am not to be understood as making any attack by way of innuendo or insinuation against the present holders of the office.  I am speaking in general terms. If the immediate and proximate check upon the Executive Council is merely the exercise of judgment and discrimination on the part of an official who holds office at their mercy, it is not fair to put such an excessive burden and trust upon the shoulders of a man as <Col N="1085" /> to call upon him to take his independent stand and resist the entire pressure of the Executive Council that may have a huge majority among the Deputies to support its decisions on any and every matter.  A salary commensurate with such independence of character is not forthcoming.  The Minister for Finance is very fond of quoting the example of Great Britain.  To him everything that Great Britain does in the way of legislation and orders is the right thing; and the best thing that we can do here is to follow that example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, when Great Britain imposes a terrific strain of that type upon the character of an official it takes the precaution not only to select a man of undoubted stamina of character, but it gives him a huge salary to lift him out of the region of temptation and to give him a psychological aid to the preservation of his character.  Now, we will suppose that this selection in the public interest has passed the Civil Service Commission.  Public opinion will have its say.  The Minister, with great dexterity as a debater, gives as his illustration what would be an obvious and flagrant abuse of the powers and opportunities on the part of the Executive Ministry&mdash;that they would exact a tithe for themselves&mdash;a percentage of the salaries of civil servants.  It could not be done.  There never was a Ministry so corrupt as to propose a thing of that sort, because there never was a Ministry so palpably stupid as to dream of it.  It would be detected. Public opinion, no matter how deaf or obtuse in other things, would rise up against it.  Public opinion on this matter, what is its value?  We had an expression the other evening in a division on this very Bill.  Thirty-one Deputies voted as against thirty-six, and what attention did the Minister pay?  What consideration did he give to that expression of opinion?  Thirty-one representatives of the people voiced their vote.  What does it amount to?  Has this Bill been materially altered since <Col N="1086" /> to meet these views?  Fortunately on this matter, the Press, especially of Dublin, has given very full reports and there have been admirable leading articles.  Has that affected the Minister with regard to the Bill, the further expression of public opinion?  In principle, surely the Minister has got enough of power.  Why should he extend the scope beyond what was in the principal Act?</P>

In my copy of the Bill, which I believe is the same as the copy that the Minister has, there is introduced under Section 2: &ldquo;whenever the Executive Council,&rdquo; and so on.  It is part of the section.  I am entitled to refer to it. All that we are contending for here is to oxygenate the political atmosphere, to get away from the germs of suspicion. Through a long exercise of the capacity, the Irish people have got an abnormal power of suspicion, and in view of that fact it is most essential for clean administration that it shall not be in the power of any one to cite an Act enacted by the Dáil which contains in it any loop-hole or any provision which would serve as a loop-hole for corruption.</P>

      <P>In page 3 before Section 4 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>4.&mdash;The notice required by sub-section (2) of Section 11 of the principal Act to be published in the &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo; shall, where the certificate was issued under Section 6 of the principal Act as amended by this Act, indicate the sub-section of the said Section 6 under which the certificate was issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention of the amendment is that the notices of appointments and promotions which the Act requires to be published in &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo; shall show separately how many of the appointments or promotions under Section 6 are provisional or otherwise <Col N="1088" /> peculiar; how many are in the public interest, and how many are promotions out of the ordinary course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this amendment because I think the notice is not sufficiently detailed.  I think the notification that an appointment has been made or that a certificate has been issued, in accordance with certain subsections of the principal Act, does not inform the public in sufficient detail of the reasons for the appointment.  It would be merely a statement of a general character that the appointment was in the public interest or that the qualifications were of such a nature as would not ordinarily be required in the public service.  It would not give the public an opportunity of judging whether a certificate was granted on sufficiently good grounds.  This is, <Col N="1089" /> again, a request that we should trust the appointers or the Ministry or the Civil Service Commissioners absolutely, and the usefulness of any notification of the kind is nil.  It is worse than useless.  To say that a person was appointed to a position, because it was in the public interest that such an appointment should be made, is not to give information to the public.  If there is any importance to be attached to notifying the public of the reasons why a departure from normal is made, then more particulars should be given than are indicated in this amendment. I think it would be far better to be without the new section than to pretend we are getting some information when we are not getting any information.  I oppose the amendment on these grounds.</P>

I do not particularly desire to thrust the amendment on the Dáil.  I offered it because of the course which the debate took.  If it is not accepted, I do not think any great harm will be done, but I do think that, as Section 6 covers three distinct classes of case, it is better that <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> should show not merely that the certificate is issued under Section 6, but the sub-section of Section 6 under which it is issued.</P>

    <P>It was necessary to ante-date because there are important sections in the Bill to the effect that the principal Act, as modified by the amending Act, is to be deemed always to have been as amended.  The reasons for that, which was in the interest of certain individuals, were explained to the House by the Minister for Finance.  My amendment will have the effect of limiting the period of operation of this Bill, which introduces such a very important alteration in the Civil Service regulations.  The Minister will have a period in which the Bill will be actually worked and the pressure of public opinion in regard to its working will enable the whole thing to be brought to an end when the period of legality will have expired.</P>

      <P>I cannot entirely follow Deputy Magennis in the period to which he proposes to limit the Act I agree with the Minister that it does seem too short.  I should prefer that he had taken a period of four years but I strongly support the principle of limiting the operation of the Bill.  The Minister has carried the essential provisions of this Bill by comparatively narrow majorities and on a strictly party vote.  The members of only on party in the Dáil voted against my amendment just now.  Members of every party in the Dáil, including the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, voted for it.  That being so, should it not be temporary Act, binding this Dáil only and leaving it possible for the new Dáil that will come into being in the year 1927&mdash;less than two years from now-to revise the measure if it thinks fit.</P>

      <P>Possibly, or perhaps late in 1925.  I do not pretend to be a prophet.  I am not complaining of the Government using its majority.  I should have great contempt for a Government if it did not discipline its party.  There may be a new Government that will be indisposed to grapple with problems that are not directly presented to it.  The making of this Act a temporary Act will force them to grapple with it and give the new Dáil an opportunity of expressing its opinion on this question, which is not merely a matter of departmental importance but a matter so important that it affects the whole fabric of the State.  If Deputy Magennis' amendment, which, in my opinion, provides too short a time, is carried, the Minister will have to adopt the principle and <Col N="1092" /> get somebody in the Seanad to move that it should be four years or some later date, probably it would be better to make it four years.  Therefore, I shall vote for Deputy Magennis' amendment if he puts it to a division.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister if he will give the Dáil some information as to the procedure generally adopted by the Civil Service Commissioners in appointing the members of selection boards.  I want to know particularly whether members of the Oireachtas are appointed as members of selection boards, and, if so, by what right the Minister can refuse information to members of the Oireachtas who are not members of such boards as to the recommendations made to the Civil Service Commissioners by selection boards which include members of the Oireachtas.  I think it is unfair that members of the Oireachtas who are members of selection boards should be in possession of information which is denied to their colleagues in this and the other House.</P>
      <P>I raise this question principally because I was dissatisfied with an answer which I received from the Minister some time ago, in which he stated: &ldquo;I am not prepared to state what recommendation was made to the Commissioners by a selection board in this or any other case.&rdquo;  I have reason to know that on the selection board concerned in this particular appointment there was a member of the Oireachtas, and I also know the recommendation that was made.  It was because I was dissatisfied with the information I received, both from the Secretary of the Civil Service Commission and from the Minister for Finance, that I put down the question to which this was part of the reply.  In any case, I think the Minister should make it generally known what is the general procedure adopted in making the selections to the boards appointed by the Commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to use the last opportunity of protesting against the sex discrimination or sex disqualification element in this Bill. My opposition is not based on sentiment. During the period of waiting for <Col N="1094" /> a division recently a member of this House remarked to me in jest&mdash;that type of jest which is, of course, backed by all seriousness&mdash;that he was a bit of a feminist himself before his marriage. I have never been a bit of a feminist in any sense.  This is really a great economic question.  If the Minister would only regard it in its proper bearings he would realise, as Minister for Finance, that it is an economic question of very wide ramification.  He claims, of course, that these wide powers, against the taking of which we have protested repeatedly, would not be exercised by him, would not indeed be exercised by a Minister in his position or that of his colleagues in any succeeding Ministry.  But I have already pointed out, and with your permission, sir, I wish to reiterate the cumulative effect that advertisements, which did illegally profess to exclude women from certain examinations, together with the speeches and the tenor of certain comments in this House in support of the Bill, will have in discouraging women's education, particularly in the region of secondary and university education.  It will remove the stimulus which is so necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is at bottom an economic question. Some time ago the &ldquo;Manchester Guardian&rdquo; published a series of special issues dealing with aspects of our national life and the problems connected with these.  Professor Oldham, my colleague, drew attention for the first time to a very significant fact of Irish statistics.  If you will allow me I will bring this very significant item under the notice of the House.  It has a very important bearing on the question before us.  &ldquo;A table which appeared in every Irish census since 1841 is table 43 on page 62 of the 1911 census.  Interpreted it shows that since 1841, in through decennial periods 1851 and so on down to 1911 in Leinster. Munster and Connaught there has been a gradual decrease in the proportion of women in the population per thousand to men.  The Registrar-General in 1921 estimated (he could only give an estimate because there was no census) that the proportion of women per thousand (that is women to <Col N="1095" /> a thousand males) had sunk to 971 for all Ireland.  It had been in 1841 in Leinster, 1,048.  In 1911 it was 993.&rdquo; That is a position declared to be unique in Europe.  Professor Oldham has provided me with these figures.  They are part of a lecture which he is to deliver to the Statistical Society to-morrow evening.  England and Wales for 1921 had 1,095; Norway in 1910 had 1,069 per thousand; Holland in 1913 had 1,013; Portugal in 1911 had 1,100; the German Reich in 1910 had 1,026.</P>
    <P>What has a far more important and much more deadly significance is this. If you analyse the figures of the relative proportion of adult women to adult men above the age of 20 years, we get, as the census of 1881: total adults, male, 1,337,516; female adults, 1,464,000.  That is 1,095 per thousand, more women to a slight extent, than men.  In 1911 the proportion has gone down from 1,095 to 1,025.  So that we have the extraordinary phenomenon of an adult population of Ireland rising since 1891, but the rise is only in the adult male population.  What does that mean in terms of emigration? You discourage the secondary and higher education of women.  You shut out the avenues, and that in presence of what set of facts, pretty much the same facts as reign in England.  After the war there was a huge proportion of war widows and of widows due to destitution and privation in the years of the war, women deprived of the support of their husbands who were maimed and mutilated during the war, girls who had been lowered in social status as a result of the war.  All these things made it more imperative for women to earn their own livelihood. Side by side with that there was a development in the education of women; at the same time this modification of the Civil Service Regulation Act introduces a sex barrier, not an absolute barrier, no doubt, but a proportionate barrier, with the result that we shall educate, at the cost of the nation, scores, hundreds in fact, of women and export them.  We are voting here, under the name of Votes for Education, great sums, very generous sums in proportion to our revenue, for secondary <Col N="1096" /> schools and universities, and the product of that education is going abroad to help education and to raise the social status in other lands.  If I may again quote statistics, the latest show only 4 per thousand of marriages in Ireland. So the assumption that the home as a career, to be a wife and mother, is open to all those young women, is not a statement of fact.</P>
    <P>To turn to another aspect of the case, the Minister quotes to us always what they do in Great Britain.  In Great Britain we have not this item of the Constitution that gives equality of citizenship to women and to men, and yet what are the positions in the Civil Service that are held by women?  Here are the administrative posts in the Treasury classes:&mdash;Director of women's establishments, Treasury, £1,200; assistant secretary, Ministry of Labour, £850 rising to £1,000; woman establishment officer, Post Office, £800; four administrative principals at £600 to £750 (two in the Ministry of Labour, one in the Ministry of Health, and one in the Home Office); five assistant principals, £200 to £400 (two in the Ministry of Labour, one Treasury, one Board of Education and one Ministry of Pensions). The Executive posts in the Treasury class include the following:&mdash; Posts above higher executive (in Executive Departments)&mdash;four superintendents in Post Office, two at £550-£700, one at £500-£600, one at £400-£500; eight deputy superintendents in Post Office, one at £400-£500; one superintendent in Ministry of Pensions at £350-£450; one superintendent in Public Trustee Office at £350-£450; three accountants (two in Ministry of Labour and one in Ministry of Health), at £450-£550; one principal staff officer (Pension Staff), Board of Education, £450-£550; sixty-two higher executive posts at £300-£400.  The remaining higher posts held by women include medical posts, various inspectorates and certain other special posts.  These posts are held in Departments or sections of Departments organised on departmental class lines.  Those which command the higher salaries I have picked out.  They are:&mdash;Commissioners in lunacy and mental deficiency, £1,200-£1,500; medical officers, seven women medical officers <Col N="1097" /> (Ministry of Health), £1,200-£1,400, and two medical officers, £600-£1,100; one in the Home Office, £500-£800; two in the Board of Education, £600-£800, as well as various other medical posts in different Departments. Coming to the inspectorate, there is a chief woman inspector, Board of Education, £850 to £1,000; six women staff inspectors, Board of Education, £550-£650; deputy chief inspector of factories, Home Office, £750-£850; two superintending inspectors of factories, Home Office, £550-£700; six deputy superintending inspectors of factories, Home Office, £350-£550; superintending inspector and assistant general inspector, Ministry of Health, £400-£450; chief woman inspector (Insurance), Ministry of Health, £400-£550; senior woman inspector, Ministry of Labour, £500-£600; deputy chief inspector (Trade Boards), Ministry of Labour, £450-£550 (with allowance of £50); eleven first-class women officers, Ministry of Labour, £450-£550.</P>
    <P>In that admirable institution, the British Civil Service, women are not found so inefficient.  There has been no Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in it to declare that he wished to God he had no woman employee.  I put opposition to this Bill on two grounds. First, it is reactionary and against the spirit in which the Constitution was enacted; secondly, it is introducing an alteration which will have grave results on the economic side of our national life.  I waive the point that the House voted in favour of a resolution approving of the education policy of the Executive Council.  The Minister for Finance is a member of that body, and he now proposes a Bill which is contrary to the best interests of education in the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will, no doubt, make his reply in accordance with the statements he has already made: that there is no intention to penalise women, but that it is desirable to make provision so that, if necessary, where the exigencies of the public service demand, special regulations may be made confining examinations to persons of either sex&mdash;one sex or the other.  I want to urge upon the Minister if that is the intention, and if it is <Col N="1098" /> not intended to open the door wide but that merely they shall be empowered to make special regulations where special circumstances require confining examinations and appointments to persons of one sex, that something of that nature shall be put into the Bill itself. It is too late to do it now, but there will be proposed on the Committee Stage of the Bill in the Seanad amendments to the effect that the Commissioners must be satisfied that the public service requires, as a matter of need, that the examination for a particular grade shall be confined to persons of one sex and that the office could not be satisfactorily discharged unless by persons of that sex.  That at least would safeguard the interests of the persons of that sex.  That at least would safeguard the interests of the persons concerned, either men or women, and would be a fulfilment, in the enactment, of the promises that have been made by the Minister himself. Without that, I agree with Deputy Magennis that it is a distinctly reactionary Bill and is going to penalise women in the public service.  In some cases it will penalise men, and in the possible development that I foreshadowed the other day&mdash;of women electing a majority of women to the Dáil and with an Executive Council composed of women, and with women appointing the Commissioners, then in those circumstances the prejudices will be against men.  Now I want to prevent either possibility, and I would argue with the Minister that he should consider between now and the later stages of the Bill the wisdom of inserting specific instructions to the Civil Service Commissioners that any departure from equality must only be in such cases where the necessities of the case require it.  In reference to a <i>sotto voce</i> interjection of my colleague, I cannot understand the state of mind of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  He will, no doubt, have an opportunity of explaining that more fully in the near future, either publicly in the Dáil or publicly on the hustings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The position so far has been, when a Department wanted an examination confined by special regulation they had to convince the Civil Service Commissioners that there was a very good reason for their request, and if the request for a limited examination was not supported by very good reasons it would certainly have gone back to the Department.  Whether it would be possible to insert specific directions I do not know.  That is a matter I would be prepared to consider. I do think, despite whatever fears Deputies may express or entertain, it is fairly clear that just as from time to time in actual practice there must be discrimination between the sexes in the Service, there must be power given to the Commissioners or to somebody to discriminate in regard to recruitment.  If you require for some particular position members of one sex then you must be able to recruit members of that sex, and not find that your examination gives you only members of the other sex.  I do not know that I need follow Deputy Magennis through his remarks.  I think that a good deal of what he said cuts both ways perhaps.  What he said in regard to emigration and so forth certainly cuts both ways.  When he talks about the emigration of women because men get jobs, then I suppose it follows grate.  It seems to me to be an argument which has not a great deal of force.</P>
      <P>I do not think this particular Bill is going, at all, to discourage the higher education of women.  The number of women who would fail to get into the Civil Service because of this Bill would be very trifling, and it is certainly going to have no effect at all upon the higher education of women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said, two or three times during the debate, and it is hardly worth repeating, that I do not agree at all that this Bill is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution.  If the spirit of the Constitution was what has been suggested, it would mean there would be no discrimination at all in any State employment without a breach of the spirit of the Constitution, whereas it is clear that in various employments like <Col N="1100" /> those I have mentioned&mdash;military, police, preventative officers in the Customs who are Customs police&mdash;there must be discrimination.  And it is no more against the spirit of the Constitution to have discrimination in the Civil Service itself where that discrimination is necessary for the most efficient and satisfactory discharge of public duties.</P>
    <P>The cause of the existence of the Civil Service is not to give jobs and not to promote the higher education either of men or of women.  The reason for the existence of the Civil Service is that public work may be done and that must always be the primary consideration. I admit that it must be always the most important institution of the State and that it is absolutely necessary to get first rate material for our Civil Service.  If we do not get that, having good Parliaments or good Governments will not suffice.  I hold also that in a democratic country the best qualified person for a position has a right to have the position, being chosen through the appropriate system of selection, and that the Minister or Government have not the right to give it to their friends, and that the right of the Government is to find the best qualified person and appoint him or her, and that that person has a right to be appointed.</P>
    <P>I think there is absolutely nothing inconsistent with that attitude and the provisions of this Bill.  The provisions of the Bill are to deal with all sorts of situations that may arise in the future.</P>
    <P>The Principal Act is called a Bill to make permanent provision for the recruitment and regulation of the Civil Service.  You cannot schedule a class of cases to which powers taken under this Act may apply, for this reason, that whether we like it or not State activities in these days tend to extend. The State takes on new activities; that is happening all over the world.  New classes of employees are required and will be required, and you cannot foresee cases in which some discrimination may be required, and I think the only thing to do is to leave it to the Civil Service Commissioners to make special regulations which may be turned down by the Oireachtas when they think it <Col N="1101" /> necessary to discriminate, and I hold there is no real danger of abuse in that. I am satisfied that if there were a good case put up against a special regulation confining the examination to one sex, it certainly would be turned down, and the Civil Service Commissioners will have to weigh well what they do in these cases if they do not want to be in the rather ignominious position of having their regulations thrown out.</P>
    <P>With reference to what Deputy Davin states, I do not know much about the details of the way in which members of the selection board are appointed by the Civil Service Commissioners. I know they look for people of integrity and people who have special knowledge, and people who, in the Civil Service, have experience of administration.  In general, there have been very few members of the Oireachtas on the boards and, as a matter of fact, the only personal communication I ever made to the Civil Service Commission on the matter of the selection board was when I expressed the opinion that I thought that members of the Oireachtas, being elected persons, and persons who have to come before the electorate, ought not to be appointed on the selection board.  They have been appointed on a few selection boards, but I believe the Civil Service Commissioners themselves feel there are objections to appointing members of the Oireachtas on the selection board.  A few members of the Seanad have, on two or three occasions been appointed.  Members of the Dáil, so far as I know, have never been asked to act.  A selection board was something in the nature of a jury.  People come in the execution of a public duty to these selection boards.  I know people who have spent time on these boards who, perhaps, would have been better employed in some concern of their own. If they are to be attacked here personally, or if their recommendations are to be called into question, I believe it will become impossible to get the right sort of people to go on selection boards. They are advisory bodies to the Civil Service Commissioners, and I do not think it would be at all in the interest of the public service that their recommendations to the Civil Service Commission, <Col N="1102" /> which may have a personal aspect, should be disclosed and discussed here.  It may well happen that in the case of a particular appointment, which is advertised, the selection board may say: &ldquo;We think that so and so is the best candidate, but we do not believe that anybody among the candidates is an ideal candidate and we make no recommendation beyond placing the candidates in order.&rdquo;  You have then the Civil Service Commission to consider whether further advertisement would produce a better candidate, or a question might arise whether the Department of Finance would sanction a higher salary.  In another case they might feel that no higher salary should be offered, and that further advertisement would produce no better result and that the best of the people the Board had before them should be appointed, but in that case the members of the Board may not like to have their opinions on individual candidates canvassed and made known.  I think it is essential for the satisfactory working of the system that the opinions of the selection board, and their recommendations&mdash;chosen as they are by the Civil Service Commission, without any influence in the discharge of their duty except to attempt to get people of integrity&mdash;should be treated as confidential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered the real question, and I think this is the proper place to raise it.  I am not raising it for the purpose of attacking anybody.  If there is to be a continuance of the policy of including members of the Oireachtas on the selection board appointed by the Civil Service Commissioners, then I hold any member of this House ought to have the same right as they have to have the same information at his disposal.  I contend while that continues that any Deputy who asks for any recommendation that may be made by a board of which a member of the Oireachtas is a member is entitled to that information, and that he should not be told that it cannot be disclosed.  I know of a case where a selection board made a recommendation and the recommendation was known to other people outside, to <Col N="1103" /> me included, but I did not want to disclose it here, and I would not be given that information in answer to a question I asked here.  I hope the Minister understands the attitude that I am taking up.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of the Local Elections Postponement Bill, 1925.  It is a short emergency Bill, and it has been necessitated by the number of Postponement of Elections Acts we had during the last few years.  The first, the Principal Act, was in 1922.  At the time that that Act was passed the local elections were due to be held in January and June, 1923.  At that time the register was not complete, and it was considered advisable to wait until we had the new register.  As it was believed at that time that the elections would be held very soon, it was considered advisable that we should retain the ordinary triennial sequence for the periods of holding office, which ran, 1920, 1923, and 1926, and accordingly Section 7 of the Act of 1922 provided that the date from which the period of office should <Col N="1104" /> begin should be the same as if that Act had not been passed.  As we know, it became necessary to postpone these elections for a much longer period than was originally anticipated.  They were not held until last June, and we are now faced with the position, as a result of that, that the period of office of the elected bodies will conclude in January and June of next year unless a Bill of this kind is passed.  It accordingly becomes necessary to pass this Bill before next January.  The Bill also affects the election of mayors.</P>

      <P>The Minister, of course, has his power under the rules, but to treat a Bill of this kind at this stage as an emergency Bill and rush it through will be opposed to the utmost. The question of the principle involved has more or less been let slide.  I am not sure that it was wise to do that, but give us the time that is necessary to consider the Bill in proper relation to the facts of the case.  There may be a good many communities affected by the proposal, and I think we must ask the Minister to give us the ordinary time that the rules of the Dáil allow for a Bill of this kind.  The Minister, surely, foresaw the necessity.  We had one week's adjournment he will remember, when there was no business. Here was a Bill, surely, that should have been introduced at that time, and he should not come now and say that this is an emergency Bill that must be rushed.  I tell the Minister that I shall endeavour to prevent the passing of this emergency measure.</P>

I would like to know if it is the Minister's intention to hold future elections in June, because I am of the opinion that it would be far better to have the municipal elections in the winter months.  I believe that the Minister would get better results and get more people to vote then, because in June a great many people go on holidays, and voting then does not give you a true reflex of the situation.  It is entirely different in the case of rural elections, and I would ask the Minister to consider that aspect and to try to get us back to the old system, at least as far as municipal elections are concerned.</P>

I quite agree with Deputy Corish that the dates, both for county council and urban elections, are unsuitable.  I would be inclined to think that October would perhaps be more suitable for both, but that question does not arise on this Bill, which is merely to provide machinery to prevent the holding of Local Government elections in January when they had been held in June, and which otherwise would be placing us in a ridiculous position.  As regards Deputy Johnson's attitude I think it is rather indefensible. I am giving ample notice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. NOLAN Mr. NOLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a rather different line from that taken by Deputy Roddy.  I am not so anxious about <Col N="1106" /> rushing into the division of land as some other Deputies who have spoken. I speak rather on behalf of the ratepayers and the taxpayers. My reason for taking that attitude is that, as we are all aware, and as I was informed in a reply to a question put to the Minister some days ago, the arrears of annuities in Limerick amount to close on £37,000. They extend back for about five years, and it is well known that these tenants purchased on very much more favourable terms and got their land very much cheaper, than the new allottees are getting theirs.  These purchasers had only to buy out the landlords' interests, and the landlords' interest was based on a fair rent which was fixed in the courts.  Their annuities were at the rate of, approximately, 10/- to 15/- per acre, whilst the recently divided land is about 32/- to 33/- an acre.  That, to my mind, will become a source of great worry to the ratepayers hereafter, if they have to make up the deficiency in the rates caused by the agricultural grant being withheld.  The amount of the agricultural grant withheld from the Limerick ratepayers at present is something like £26,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason alone I would ask the Minister to go slow in the future purchasing of land.  Of course in the case of any land that has been purchased and an agreement signed, I do not see why it should not be divided at the earliest possible opportunity. According to what Deputy Roddy stated some land has been from 10 to 17 years in the hands of the Land Commission or the Congested Districts Board.  If such land has been in the hands of the Congested Districts Board for the last 17 years, certainly there should be enough profits to redeem the whole estate within that time and the allottees should have the land now practically free.  I am speaking from experience.  I know one small estate quite close to my own place in Limerick which has been divided recently, the Lewis estate.  There were one 65 statute acres in that estate to be divided. It was derelict for six years, and the landlord had nothing out of it during these years.  Previous to that it was let at £2 per Irish acre, in con-acre.  It <Col N="1107" /> was suitable for meadowing and it was good for nothing else.  It was slobland. It was set to the men in craglands overhead for meadowing.</P>
    <P>Some six years ago the landlord attempted to raise the rent and the local people took it on themselves to see that the rent was not raised, and as a result the place was left derelict.  The Land Commission have taken it over recently and have given £1,300 for it.  That would be £20 per statute acre, and it would work out very close to 32/- per acre in annuities.  It would be over 30/- an Irish acre.  I fail to see how the tenants of that little estate will be able to meet the annuities if the tenants on the adjoining estates, who have to pay only from 10/- to 12/- an acre, are in arrears.  The tenants on this small estate will have to pay £1 per acre more than the others.  I have had letters from my constituents asking me to see that these estates will be divided, but I am not going to do that. I am not going to take their advice for the reason I have given.  I would ask the Minister to proceed slowly in this matter, and in any case where a bargain has not been made already to hold his hand because the value of land is coming down.  An estate bought four years ago for £10,000 could, I am sure, be bought to-day for £5,000.</P>
    <P>I am sure that these estates, between the high rates and the small price for agricultural produce, will be going back in value in the very near future, and that instead of the tenants paying annuities on £1,000 or on £500 they will only be paying on £200 or £250.  That would be a great advantage to the State.  I do not suggest that the Land Commission should confiscate the estate from the landlord.  The landlords are entitled to get the full value for their land if it is taken over, but I think it will be much lower in value in another year or two because of the great fall in the price of agricultural produce. I am sure that half the land in Leinster would not be let for the coming year were it not that the graziers have so much stock on hands which they cannot dispose of at a profit.  They would not get as much for their cattle as they cost them last year.  I do not like to go too far outside my own constituency, <Col N="1108" /> but I would refer to one estate, the Scully estate, in Tipperary. The Land Commission inspected that some time ago and the inspector put a valuation of £4,250 on it.  The owner appealed and the question of the valuation came before Mr. Justice Wylie. The valuation was increased to £6,450 &mdash;an increase of 50 per cent.  If an economic rent could not be fixed on the original price, I do not see how you are going to fix an economic rent for the future on the new prices.  I would like to know if any defence is made against increases of this kind, because it certainly is most unfair, most irregular, and most unjust if the valuer put a valuation of £4,000 odd on the land and the judge, who did not see the land at all, was able to increase it to £6,000.</P>

      <P>I hope the Deputy will support me in getting that done and will also support me in asking the Minister to go slow in the matter of sales for the future.  There is another class of case that I would suggest the Minister should also take into consideration&mdash;where the landlord has refused an offer by the Land Commission. I would ask the Minister in cases where the landlords refuse an offer to make them no further offer and to leave the land on their hands for a further two years, and it will be very easy then to get them to accept the offer. There is another case in the West of Ireland which was brought to my notice &mdash;the Cannon Estate in County Mayo. That estate contained 550 statute acres, including 67 acres of water.  There were practically 100 acres occasionally submerged.  There were about 100 acres of poor arable land, and the balance was cut-away bog. To give you an idea of the value, the rental was only £87.  The Land Commission have given to the owner bonds to the extent of £6,000, and along with that he has about 150 acres of good land in Meath.  I think that is a fabulous price.  I would like in those cases to have the facts published in the Press.  There is another case which, I think, was published in a paper called &ldquo;Honesty.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I leave the question of defaulting annuitants, I would like to ask the Minister why these arrears are left running so long. Some of these people have gone into five years arrears.  I do not suggest that out of any feeling of ill will against them, but I think it is a shame to allow them to run so long.  I think these estates should be put up for sale and let them be bought in by people who are anxious to get land.  If they are not put up for sale, the Minister has only to accept the responsibility and I will have to take other action in regard to the grants withheld from the country councils.  There are about two hundred large farmers in County Limerick who, I say, could afford to pay.</P>
      <P>I do not say that the Land Commission should collect arrears from every individual, but some men, if they are only a month in arrears, are processed. That seems unfair.  I want to suggest to the Minister that he should bring these people to some sense of responsibility and make them realise their liabilities. There are other classes entitled to the lands that are to be divided. There is one class who seem to be nobody's children and they are the ex-Army men of the old Volunteers.  I think if any class of people are entitled to consideration as regards land, they have first claim, because the Act of 1923 would not have been in existence at all, and we would not be here, were it not for them.  They seem to have been forgotten in every department, and I hope when the Minister sends his inspectors out that he will give them directions to have these men given special consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Land Bill, which is now an Act, of 1923, was being discussed I could not help remembering a common phrase used by the Minister on every amendment to make the Act more definite.  He said that land could be acquired under this Act at any time, for any purpose, anywhere. That was the argument used by the Minister's supporters in 1923, and if any action was responsible for bringing the Minister's party back to power, it was the play made with the Act of 1923 on the assumption that the provisions of the Act would be administered in the best and quickest way.  Now we find the Minister coming back to the House and asking the members a question which he must, having the responsibility on his shoulders, answer himself.  He asked how far you are going to acquire untenanted land?  I do not think it is necessary to ask that, as all untenanted land was to be acquired.  He asked how far are you going to acquire demesne land, how far are you going to acquire untenanted land, and how far are you going to acquire unpurchased land? These are all questions which the Minister should answer, because he has at his disposal all the available statistics and information which would make it possible for him to answer that question better than the Deputies of whom he asked it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave figures to show the amount of land dealt with since the 1st April, 1923, as well as land which was being dealt with previous to the Act of that year.  He quoted figures to the extent, I think, of ninety-one thousand acres.  I have figures showing that in Leix, up to the 18th November, the amount of acreage is 7,860 acres. I do not know whether that would be a fair proportion, taking the twenty-six counties and dividing twenty-six into ninety-one thousand.  The point I want to harp on is this, that in Leix, out of 1,296 acres dealt with&mdash;that is land either invested in the Land Commission or where there was a price fixed&mdash;only <Col N="1111" /> 428 acres have been divided.  In Offaly there are 6,394 acres, out of which only 638 have been divided.  I think the procedure in regard to the division is very slow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has explained the reason why it has not been possible to proceed more quickly than was anticipated when the Act of 1923 was passed.  The real reason, so far as I can see, is the lack of properly qualified and experienced staff in checking the re-sale schemes.  When the Land Commission estimates were before us, I drew attention to the fact that while there was a considerable increase in the number of permanent and temporary inspectors appointed under the Act of 1923 there was not, proportionately in the Land Commission, the same amount of experienced clerical labour as compared with previous years.  I have made enquiries and so far as I can understand this delay is due to the lack of experienced clerical labour to do this highly technical work, and, so far as there has been an increase, it has been in regard to the number of lady clerks and typists.  The Minister, I am sure, will agree that lady clerks, no matter how qualified, are not suitable, as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will admit, no doubt, for work of this kind.  I suggest to the Minister that, instead of putting through temporary schemes and putting people into possession who will afterwards cause trouble, as he is doubtless aware, he should make a good case to the Minister for Finance for the appointment of additional experienced staff in the Land Commission, if he wishes to proceed with the division of land in the way I understand he desires.  The Minister also pointed out, and, I presume, <Col N="1112" /> correctly, from all the figures he put before us, that it is impossible to provide economic holdings for all the landless men and uneconomic holders, as well as the representatives of the evicted tenants, who are making application for them.  He says that you can only deal with a certain number, and asks whether farms should consist of twenty-five, thirty, or fifty acres.</P>
      <P>I presume he desires an answer.  I think the proper way of approaching a question is to ask whether any person should have a holding with a valuation of over a certain figure and not of over a certain acreage.  A man may have 300 acres of bog land at a valuation of £40 and another may have a farm of 500 at a valuation of £250.  I do not think the question is whether a farm should be comprised of 25, 30 or 40 acres, but rather whether any farmer should have a holding over a certain valuation.  The Minister, I am sure, is in agreement with Cumann na nGaedheal who are devising ways and means with a view to the encouragement of tillage.  I suggest the proper way for giving that encouragement is to provide more economic holdings under the Land Act.  If we study the percentage of tillage at present we will find that in most cases the people who till most land are people who have small holdings.  Any farmer who has over 100 acres and is not prepared to till a certain amount of the land to such an extent as will in the opinion of the Minister conform to the policy of the Cumann na nGaedheal should be deprived of the extra acreage over the 100.</P>

      <P>I have read about this committee which is in existence, but naturally I could not pass judgment upon its scheme until I see its proposals formulated and put before the House, and I think the other part of the question does not arise until then. If farms were limited to 100 acres, then some of the biggest farmers and ranch owners would lose land which should be available for creating more economic holdings.  Deputy Gorey and his party in the 1923 election claimed they had brought this Act into existence, and that they were entitled to the credit for it.  I am sure when Deputy Gorey, who is an expert on the question, speaks, he will tell the Minister what should be the greatest amount of land at the disposal of any farmer such as he represents, or like himself.  I repeat that in my opinion the matter should be approached from the point of view of valuation, and I believe that no farmer, in view of existing circumstances, should have a farm with a valuation of over £80 valuation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Nolan has raised a question which should not be put as a barrier against proceeding on reasonable lines with the acquisition of land.  The Deputy has spoken about the uneconomic price paid for land acquired for division under the 1923 Act.  I have a case before me where an estate of 332 acres has been acquired in Leix, and, as I understand it, about to be divided.  The price paid was £6,083 for 332 statute acres of not very good land.  I have been informed that the bog land or really bad portion of the estate is to be let at the rate of 17/6 per acre, and the good portion is going to be let at 35/- per acre.  I say that 35/- per acre is an uneconomic price.  To that extent I agree with any complaint Deputy Nolan has made in that direction.  I have heard of cases of estates that have been acquired <Col N="1114" /> under the 1923 Act, and when the owners went before the Judicial Commissioner he was very generous in increasing the purchase price.  I understand, and it is significant if my information is correct, that he has increased the price in such cases since the Land Bond Bill became an Act, Another question to which I wish to refer deals with the sending down of inspectors to inspect lands as they have done in my constituency, and having completed inspection they then had the lands gazetted in the &ldquo;Irish Oifigiúil,&rdquo; leaving the people in those areas under the impression that the lands were about to be acquired and divided among the local people.</P>
      <P>I know of four cases within a radius of about 5 miles in Leix where the inspectors interviewed local people, uneconomic holders, took their statements and left them under the impression that the lands were to be divided.  In one case the lands were gazetted, but after objections were raised by the owner the matter was referred to the Judicial Commissioner, who decided without giving any reason not to acquire these lands for division. That is raising false hope, and a situation that if allowed to go on will be difficult for the Minister to handle. Last week there came under my notice a case where 170 acres had been gazetted, and applications were received from uneconomic holders in the surrounding areas, but objection was raised by the owner, who has two other farms in addition to the one gazetted. For some reason unknown to me the Commissioners have written a letter stating that they do not intend to proceed with the acquisition of untenanted lands in this estate&mdash;the estate of Peter G. Alley.  That gentleman, as I have said, has two or three other farms. Local people did not know he was going to raise any objection, and I do not know if they were represented before the Commissioners when hearing the case, but that is the extraordinary result, and it will be a sensation in the district.</P>

    <P>If a man has two farms in addition to one of 170 acres, and if there are 40 uneconomic holders adjoining, it would take quite a lot to convince me that the <Col N="1115" /> farm of 170 acres should not be taken over and divided.  In cases of that kind, when Deputies ask for reasons why the lands are not being acquired, those reasons, if the Minister agrees with them, should be given.  The Minister has certain information at his disposal. I think the Deputies are entitled to have this information and pass it on to their constituents if they so desire.  I have not been supplied with the reasons in respect of the four cases I have mentioned.  In addition to the case of Alley, there are the case of Hopkins, Duigan and Cavanagh.  They are all within a radius of five or six miles.  From my point of view, and from the point of view of the local people, it would be far better if the inspectors never went into those areas. The result of decisions of this kind, and the raising of foolish hopes will, perhaps, compel the people to take action later on which the Minister would not approve of.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hall raised a question to-day in connection with division of land.  I have drawn the Minister's attention to similar cases where, when the Land Commission have gazetted land or expressed a desire to acquire an estate, the owner of the estate at once proceeds to dismiss the workmen, and deprive them of various rights, such as grazing rights for cows.  That policy appears to be a common policy in Offaly.  All the landlords there must belong to the same organisation, for they all take the same action once the Commissioners express their desire to acquire land.  Those are cases in which the Minister should recommend the Commissioners to acquire the land as soon as possible.  I know of one case where fourteen workers were thrown out of employment on the Baker estate, Mount Wilson.  That happened nine months ago and they have been unable to get work since.  Some of them are at present on home assistance.  That is a state of affairs that should not be allowed to continue.  Nine months should be long enough to enable the Commissioners to make up their minds as to the course they should adopt.</P>
    <P>The question of depriving the <Col N="1116" /> workers of their grazing rights, in cases where they have cows, is a very serious one.  So far as I am concerned, I am prepared to state, both inside and outside the Dáil, that I will advise the people concerned to put the cows back on the land they were driven off and, even where it is necessary to take unconstitutional action, they should maintain their existing rights until the Land Commission make up their minds to acquire and divide the land.  I would encourage the people to adopt any action rather than allow their beasts to be put out on the roadside.  If the animals are driven out on the roads probably the Civic Guard would come along and insist on having them removed from there.</P>

The Minister should speed up things in order to relieve distress caused by landlords for the purpose of preventing the Commission acquiring the land, or for some other reason that I am not in a position to explain.  The action taken by the landowners in Offaly is being followed in Meath, as is indicated by Deputy Hall's question to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to congratulate Deputy Roddy on the fact that his motion has been accepted by the Minister. His motion, in effect, means that the Department over which the Minister is the political head, has been dilatory in the past.  It is that motion the Minister gives his assent to.  The arguments put forward in support of the motion were put forward from those Benches as long ago as 1922-23.  Seeing they came from this quarter, they were not acceptable, but when they came from another quarter they are very acceptable. although it is, in reality, a vote of censure on the Minister, he agrees with the motion.  The division of land up to the present has been at the rate of 31,000 acres per year.  As a result of this motion 40,000 acres will be divided this month and, before this time twelve months, 200,000 acres will be divided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>All that has been brought about by a simple motion from Deputy Roddy.  I wonder what was the Department, so ably presided over by the Minister, doing during the last <Col N="1118" /> two years?  They can divide 40,000 acres in one month now, yet, since 1923, they have only divided 90,000 acres.  If that is not a vote of censure on the Land Commission, I do not know what a vote of censure is.  I am very much concerned with regard to the appointed day.  I have not yet found out the real reason why the tenants under the 1923 Act have not been vested in their holdings.  The excuse given is that the Land Commission has been dealing with farms bought under previous Acts and that they have, during the last couple of years, vested 18,000 holdings.  Is that the real reason why these lands are not vested and why these farmers, who have cleared off their arrears, have not had the lands vested in them?  Surely the excuse is not that the Department is overburdened with work.</P>
      <P>On this motion we are told they will be able to divide 40,000 acres in a month.  On the other hand, we have the fact that they have not vested any land purchased since 1923.  The farmers are suffering to the extent of 10 per cent. per annum.  They are paying 2/- in the £ on their rent.  It is not a fair proposition to have them paying interest in lieu of rent, paying off to the State money advanced for the possession of their holdings.  I hope the Minister will see that the activity of the Land Commission in that direction is speeded up.  I am at a loss to understand Deputy Nolan's policy.  On the one hand he is anxious for the motion, and on the other hand he tells the Minister to go slowly, to buy no land at the moment.</P>

It has been produced by a Deputy from the West.  It is there to deal with the problem of the West.  The West is now awake and we are asking to have the division of land expedited, and the Minister is awake and the Land Commission is awake, and we will have the land divided in the West.  Instead of that problem which this motion is set down to meet, the Minister turned the whole argument into a question of whether each farmer is to have 25 acres or not, a totally different question.  He asks what is the policy to be.  He asks: &ldquo;Am I to divide all the land so that everyone will have 25 acres?&rdquo; That is a different motion.</P>

      <P>I am afraid it has been very much discussed within the last two days.  The motion reads: &ldquo;So that the tenants and congests shall be dealt with as soon as possible.&rdquo;  I want to talk about dealing with the tenants in connection with their rents.  There are certain tenants in Ireland who are permitted to owe five years' arrears of annuities.  There are tenants in Donegal who have been processed wholesale by the Land Commission for one year's arrears, and I am pointing out that that policy is not a consistent one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid I am out of order, but we on these benches contend that the Land Commission has not been doing the work in the way in which it should be done in the past, whatever the Minister may say, and we contend that this motion asserts that fact.  It is a motion which practically sets out that the policy in the past has been dilatory. Those in support of the motion have said that the Land Commission has been dilatory.  The Minister accepts that motion, and I want to put it that in addition to dilatory methods, the Minister, or otherwise the Land Commission, has been at fault.  Now, it is well understood by us as tenant farmers <Col N="1121" /> that it is absolutely essential for the success of this State that everybody should pay his rent or annuity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, coming back to the congests we find according to the Minister's figures that there are 140,000 congests in the country, and no matter how we work in dealing with untenanted land no provision can be made for at least 100,000 of these congests. If you take that statement side by side with this fact, that there are only 200,000 economic holders in the Free State, you will understand the difficulty of the problem.  I want to state that there are 100,000 men under the present conditions, and under the Land Act of 1923, who cannot be supplied with land, and on the other hand there are only 200,000 people who have economic holdings.</P>
      <P>Those Deputies who were talking about giving land to the landless men, to the national heroes and the rest, will have to bear in mind that there are 100,000 congests that cannot be attended to under the present conditions, and that if they are to be attended to, the land will have to be taken from the 200,000 economic holders in the Free State.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture will agree that these figures are correct.  It is not for me to say what is to be done; we have not the responsibility of dictating the policy of the Government in this matter, and we are not going to state a case which might ultimately be brought against ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>We are responsible for the Act.  The Act as stated by the Minister himself gave him power to take land anywhere for congests and for the provision of land for them. There is a provision in the Act by which it will be necessary to pay a suitable price for purchased land.  But if you purchase that land and pay for it a price of 35/- an acre, the people who will get it will be living on an uneconomic holding.  I ask Deputy Davin can he solve that problem of dealing with these 140,000 congests? Can he state how it is to be done without despoiling those people in possession of the purchased land?</P>
      <P>If he can solve that problem I am in agreement with such a policy.  I am very pleased indeed that the new method for the division of land enunciated by the Minister is going to have 200,000 acres divided this year.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that.  The cult of the foreigner is running very strong in this country now. I remember about twenty or thirty years ago the same cult was rampant, and its removal required a lot of teaching. <Col N="1123" /> At the same time, just as good work was being done at home.  Denmark was lauded and has been lauded for a number of years, and the Irish people were asked to look on what Denmark and other foreign countries were doing.  They were never asked to look on the work done in their own country.  I read some of the articles of the special correspondent of the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; who accompanied a deputation to Denmark recently, in which the reclamation of heath was described as if it were a new thing.  Over 100 years ago the same methods were adopted in County Mayo by a Government Department under Professor Baldwin.  He never got any credit for the work.  Another Deputy was loud in his laudation of Belgium and on the position of small farmers there.  There is no analogy between Belgium and Ireland.  No doubt Belgium is a land of small farmers, but throughout that country is a large industrial population that consumes vegetables and other crops that the farmers produce.  Farmers there produce two or three crops in the year, which they are able to sell in these industrial centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also suggested that fishermen along the coast should be provided with large holdings as if they are unable to catch fish they must exist by the land.  It is quite impossible to make fihsermen by a wave of the hand.  If a man lives by fishing, three or four acres of land is enough for him.  On the west coast there are no fishermen in the real sense.  Any fishing that is there is more or less of a side line.  All that state of affairs must be changed.  I read in a high class agricultural publication two or three months ago that there were no real farmers in Ireland; men who knew the business from top to bottom, just as there are no real fishermen.  It strikes me that if all the land in the country was divided into 20 acre holdings the economic conditions would be just as bad as they are at present.  With his accustomed foresight the Minister for Lands and Agriculture will, no doubt, be able to produce for the consideration of Deputies a remedy for the bad economic conditions <Col N="1124" /> that I foresee for the country should no industries be established.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy did not understand what I said, then I do not understand him.  After having listened to so many speeches which, as Deputy Wilson said, we have been hearing during 1922, 1923, and, I think, 1924, to my mind Deputy Nolan&mdash;although some Deputies have objected to what he said&mdash;has sounded words of wisdom. Similar words of wisdom were expressed here before about the price to be paid for lands, and the price the occupying tenant of the future and the ratepayer will be asked to bear.  During the passing of the 1923 Act we were met by the argument from the Government benches that land was then fetching such a price.  We were told that it would fetch from £12 to £15 per acre, and we were scoffed at when we ventured to say that that was a false value on which to frame the Bill.  We stated that the 1914 prices were the real prices, and were peak prices for Ireland in normal times.  We said that prophecy would be borne out within five years.  Only two years have passed and we will reach it in three or four years time.  The State has now to recognise that, and the load they are going to put on the occupier and the ratepayer of the future.  The Commissioners <Col N="1125" /> and those responsible must set aside the war prices as being false and fictious values and must visualise what the price for the future will be. I say that Deputy Nolan has done a good service in drawing attention to this matter.  If land cannot be bought at a reasonable price, based on a visualisation of future values, then let them go slowly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have no knowledge of that.  I know that the price put on allotments is up to 35/- an acre, which I say is a ridiculous price, and one the tenants will not be able to pay in the future.</P>
      <P>I want to give comparative figures.  I speak with a lot of experience, and I have asked one gentleman in the Dáil, who has an intimate knowledge of the question, to confirm my figures, and he has done so.  I assert that the pre-war price of the best land for grazing purposes in Ireland for letting was £3 to £5 an acre.  In 1920 and 1921 the prices were from £12 to £15 an acre for the same class of land, and to-day that land is realising anything from £4 to £6.  We are coming back to sense. We were not talking sense in 1923 when the Land Bill was going through and when the price of £12 to £15 an acre was accepted.  That price has dwindled to one-third.  Anybody responsible for the purchase of land in the future must consider what land is going to realise in the future, based on the history of the past.  He should consider the amount of debt that will have to be carried.  I can assert, from practical experience, that land will not in the future be of as high a value as it was in 1914.  Land will not be worth the price in the future that it was in 1914.  Perhaps some prophet would like to stand up and contradict me.  I would like to hear his reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that. Out of these lands, fetching from £3 to £5 an acre, annuities, rent and rates had to be met and the occupier had to live.  We have been a long time listening to cheap rhetoric about the population that this country carried one hundred years ago or before the Famine, and we have been told that they all lived on the land.  They did not live on the land.  They lived in the country, but they did not live on the land.  We had basket-makers, carpenters, shoemakers, weavers, and other classes of industrialists living all over the country.  I remember them myself, and I think I would be safe in saying that they were one-third, if not half, of the population of the country.  Those people have all disappeared from the country.  Our boots, our hardware and our tailoring come from the cities or towns or from across the water.  To state that these people lived on the land is to state what is wrong.  The land of this country will not carry anything like the population that people seem to think it will carry.  You may get this figure of eight millions or nine millions out of your heads and try, as the Minister said, to face up to the facts.  Deputy Davin has asked me what we consider should be the limit or extreme size of a farm.  That is a very problematical question, and it is a question with very wide ramifications.</P>

      <P>I want to tell Deputy Davin and the Minister that when you deal with land it is not the only thing you have to deal with.  Land is one, and only one, source of living in this country.  If we begin with land we must deal with all the others.  We must deal with salaries, with investments, with profits from business, and with <Col N="1127" /> earnings from public services, like railway companies.  I might not be wrong in saying that the salary that Deputy Davin is drawing would support four families who are living on the land.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is well lost. £360 out of this place is no humbug. I do not really know what ought to be the proper size of any farm.  It depends on how people are farming their holdings.  I can understand a case where a man holding 1,000 acres should be allowed to hold those 1,000 acres, because he is a really good farmer.  I know a farm of 1,000 acres which employs about 50 or 60 families, and if it were broken up I would like to know what the position would be.  I am talking about the Mount Juliet estate.  In dealing with tenanted land, you are dealing, as the Minister stated, with a different problem altogether from untenanted land.  It is a well-established fact that two interests in land have rights in this country&mdash;the landlord and the tenant.  You will buy the one at the accepted prices that obtained under previous Acts and that the history <Col N="1128" /> of the last 30 or 40 years has dictated. Then you have to deal with the other interests.  Either the incoming tenant who wants tenanted land will have to meet the two claims or the State will have to do it.  Interest in tenanted land is just as recognised an interest as an interest in business or in investments.  Face up to the proposition honestly and squarely, that you have to compensate either for business or for land.</P>

One has the fee simple interest, with a certain limitation.  The limitation, so to speak &mdash;that is, the tenant's interest is owned by the second.  You have two farms of 100 acres, one being held in fee simple and the other being in fee simple, with the tenant's interest added.

      <P>The reference to the eleven months' tenants was made by me, and I had better explain the cases to which I referred.  I think any Deputy who heard me could clearly understand what I meant.  What I wanted was that in the case of estates that were likely to be taken over by the Commissioners, lands that the owners lived away from, that were not being worked and on which employment was not being given, notices should be served that there was to be an inspection of them so that the owners could not evade the Commissioners by letting their lands in advance.  I was not dealing at all with those who were working their land, because I believe they are an asset to the State.  I am not going to limit the man that works his land.  But, where there is land that the Commissioners are likely to take over, I suggest that they should give notice of inspection, so that the land could not be let before they could inspect it, and that they should give the market value for it and not a fictitious value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister accept the motion without accepting the main argument that it is based on? To my mind there have been slow and dilatory methods, especially in the West and particularly under the late Congested Districts Board.  Statements have been made here on those Benches <Col N="1132" /> about those gentlemen.  I do not want to repeat them.  All I suggest is that they were always found in the hotels of the West and they gave very little time to doing anything, but they retained their jobs always.  They did not want to lose hold of a good thing. I am not satisfied with the old methods of distribution, nor am I quite satisfied with the present methods.  Very cumbrous machinery is used in the present methods.  Fences have to be built.  Buildings have, in many cases, to be put up at the Commissioners' expense, where they are needed.  The expenses in connection with all this have to be charged back to the incoming occupier.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It varies in each case. There is an important sub-head of £180,000 in this year's estimates from which are defrayed certain expenses in connection with the cost of buildings which are not charged to the lands.  It depends on the circumstances of each tenant.  One might get a free grant and one might get half the cost.  It would depend on whether the land was security for any additional expenditure. If a man got a particularly cheap holding the least he might do might was to bear the little extra expense on his land for the cost of his improvements and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I contend more expeditious methods could be employed.  The erection of a lot of fences and of a considerable amount of buildings is slow, and once a man's title is made out and a division is made and future occupants selected, I think they ought to be given immediate possession.  Where they choose to do it, they should erect their own fences and buildings, and they can do it more economically than it could be done by a State Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable exception has been taken with regard to the speed at which some of these estates have <Col N="1133" /> been acquired and divided.  The ordinary method is that negotiations take place and ultimately there is an agreement. Until the time an agreement is reached the Commissioner or those engaged in it cannot consider the question of applications.  As a business proposition I do not think it would be possible for them to do it.  Once the estate is acquired then the question of considering the applications arises, and not until then.  I have no objection to a considerable amount of caution and discretion being exercised by the Commissioners in making a selection of the future occupants, because the future liabilities of the State largely depend on who is going to be put into possession in the first instance.  Unless a suitable and proper selection is made, the State will suffer.  It will do no good to the people you will put in.  The State is going to suffer, and you will not have achieved the purpose you set out to achieve.  I think caution and discretion and a proper selection of the right people are essential from the national point of view.</P>
    <P>I do not make a special case either for the evicted tenants, landless men, the congests, or the national heroes.  I make a special case for the best that are to be found in the whole of them. I say the most suitable man who is likely to make the best farmer, regardless of what section he comes from, ought to be selected for the land.  To my mind&mdash;I may be offending some old traditions&mdash;I say the people who have been disemployed as a result of the acquisition of the land ought to have, I will not say a better claim, but a claim equal to the best of any other class in the community.  Men are disemployed when an estate is acquired. Suppose a dozen men, say, are disemployed. Some get farms, others do not, and there is very little chance of getting employment from the future occupants of those lands.  There is none at all, and there may be little chance of getting employment from the farmers around.  They have their homes, they cannot obtain constant employment, and they have to clear out.  Either that or they become uneconomic holders. I say they have as good a claim, if not better, than any other members of the community.  We do not purpose <Col N="1134" /> to go over the same ground as that of previous debates on this question two or three years ago, but although it is outside the motion, the Minister has referred in his statement to the number of tenanted people who will get vesting orders this year.  We hope it will be speeded up.  These people have been waiting from 1923.  We know of the arrears of work from the 1903 Act. That has been made up, and we hope no obstacle will lie in the way of having the appointed day fixed for the tenanted farmers of this country.  It is desirable that better methods and a quicker distribution should be adopted. Perhaps the better way to arrive at that would be to appoint a small Committee to confer with the Minister. Let him take advice and he will share responsibility in that way with all the parties in the House and in the country. It is no use in blaming the Minister if he takes the right step, but I think a small Committee representing the different interests of the country might be able to suggest better means; if they are not able to suggest it, all those arguments about hurrying on must disappear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only a word or two to say on this motion.  What I have to say has very particular reference to the Minister's own constituency. The main arguments are centred round the point as to what body of claimants in the country are best entitled to get the land there is for distribution and who should be first considered. It seems to me that unless we are going to perpetuate the system we had and find fault with, and have found fault with up to the present, namely, putting more uneconomic holders on the land, we have got to consider the position of those already on the land who are titled uneconomic holders.  We have only a certain number of acres of land for distribution, and perhaps two hundred thousand more people are claiming that land than we can expect to be able to satisfy.  Someone has to take the responsibility of deciding who are to be catered for at first in the distribution of the land.  My conviction is that as regards the people who are on land or who are supposed to be on land at present <Col N="1135" /> whose outlook so far has been towards land and who are getting their living off it, our aim should be to try to make their position in some way better than it is.  Our aim should be, if possible, to try and give to those people at least nearly as much land as would enable them to get a reasonable living for themselves and their families, and before we decide to give land to men who already are not getting their living off the land, we should try and give as much land to those people who already have land as would enable them to get a living from it.</P>

      <P>And we all hope they will continue to get it.  I, at any rate, have no desire to put them off it.  I ask the House to consider the congested districts as we know them. What type of congest.  I ask, is to get first consideration?  To my mind, the congest who is worst off is the one who has the least area of land&mdash;land that is of the least value to a man at the present time.  During the summer I was in such places as Lettermullen, Gortumna, as well as in districts in Donegal, and there you would find men with little patches of land with a valuation of about 30/-.  They might have a little holding of four or five acres with not as much soil on it as you would find on the half-acre of land attached to a labourer's cottage in another part of the country.  These are the people that, to my mind, should get first consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be advisable if the Minister were to get assistance from Deputies so that he might be able to contrive means to deal with this terrible problem.  If Deputies, for instance, were to go down during the Christmas holidays to the west, or up to the districts in Donegal that I visited during the summer, they would come back, I venture to think, in a sympathetic frame of mind in regard <Col N="1136" /> to the problem that confronts the Minister, and would be able to give him some sound advice as to how he should tackle it.  There are Deputies who have never seen that side of the country, and, I am sure, have no desire to see it.  I ask them to contemplate what you see in these districts&mdash;a stretch of country that seems to be a thousand miles in extent, but in reality it may be only 20 or 40 miles.  In that wild stretch of country there is nothing to be seen but the bare rock.  The people in these districts are entirely dependent for a livelihood on soil such as that.  Many of them have families of 10 and 12 children.  Generations of these people have resided and have been brought up in these poverty-stricken districts.  The soil that was on the land some years ago has disappeared altogether in many cases.</P>
    <P>The fuel supply for the people is getting shorter and the women in particular have to tramp a distance of five, six, or eight miles to the bog and carry supplies of turf home on their backs.  The bog probably consists of a cutting of half clay and half turf off a bare rock.  The result of all that, going on as it has been for a great number of years, has been that to-day in these places you have a wild, bare stretch of country with hardly any soil, and where there is any it is growing poore year by year.  Thousands of families are dependent for their existence on soil such as that, with, of course, the little help they get from America.  Many of these families are the remnants of the people who were driven from the good soil of Ireland back to Connaught.  In the wilds of Donegal, too, we have people living under similar conditions. I say seriously to the House as a result of what I saw myself, that the conditions are such in these districts that in our day a period will be reached when these areas will absolutely refuse any longer to give a living to the people who dwell there, and then the country will be faced with the difficulty of solving an extraordinary problem. At the present time there is absolutely nothing between these people and starvation.</P>
    <P>No matter how bad the conditions <Col N="1137" /> may be in our towns and cities, they are nothing like the conditions that obtain in those dreary wastes.  If these people are to be left in the condition they are in at present, when there is land for distribution, I say that the country later on will be faced with the problem as to what will be done with the thousands of families living, as they are at present, on land that is unable to support them.  Their upbringing and their outlook do not fit these people for any kind of industrial work.  They are different even to the landless men or to the labourers in other parts of Ireland.  I say that if the claims of these people are not considered first, or at least jointly with those who will be deprived of their means of living by the breaking up of big farms, the Government in our day will be called upon to solve a problem that if tackled seriously now could be solved at least in part.  I do not say that the problem could be solved in full now, but I do urge it could be solved in part.  I say that if the interests of these people are to go by the board now because their situation is remote and because, perhaps, the claims of others can be put forward more forcibly here, then I say that will not be a good day's work for the country.  I urge strongly on the Minister to consider at once the question of relieving congestion especially where it is worst.  Everyone knows that the position of men on a ten or a six or a seven acre farm even in counties like Cavan, Leitrim, Meath, Kilkenny or elsewhere is bad enough even at the best of times, but if you saw the conditions under which the people live along the Western seaboard, not on ten, six or seven acres of land such as you find in the counties I have just named, but on two or three acres of bare rock without any accommodation whatever, it would be admitted, I think, that their position is a thousand times worse than that of the very small holder in counties such as I have mentioned.  I doubt even whether many of these people could be trained for fishing.</P>

      <P>They have plenty of fresh air, but it is God who gives them that.  I am afraid that there are many Deputies in this House who would prefer to say &ldquo;we will keep the land in Meath for the Meath men, and the land in Kilkenny for Kilkenny men and so on.&rdquo;  But I say that this is not a problem for Kilkenny or Meath or any other county, but it is one that the Government must take up seriously and try to find a solution of it.  I urge on the Government that if their main idea in the re-distribution of the land of Ireland is to consider the relief of congestion, then they ought to relieve it where it exists in a most acute form, where it is a menace to the country and certainly a menace to the lives of these people.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the matter of the six days' notice that was mentioned at Question Time to-day.  This is a matter that has aroused a considerable amount of complaint down through the country.  The action taken by his Department in stopping the notices that used to be issued by the Land Commission has created dissatisfaction, not only amongst the tenants, but amongst the people generally, while I think it has also caused a lot of trouble to his Department.  I believe the Minister could remedy the defect by retaining the receivable order after the rent is paid and until, say, within six days of the date on which the rent is again due. Then let the receivable order be sent out with a notice saying that the rent is due on a particular date.</P>

      <P>I do not want to take up much of the time of the House, as this is a subject which has been fairly well thrashed out from all sides of the House, but-the problem is such a big one, and the situation is so perilous at the present time, that I who come from Tirconaill, a county that is in a very difficult position with regard to land distribution, should, I think, make my opinion felt.  The Minister, I am sure, is just as anxious as anyone in this House, to expedite the distribution, and the re-settlement of the land under the Land Purchase Act of 1923.  I feel certain that he is as anxious as any of us to go on with that question.  But I am not so sure <Col N="1139" /> that when he first tackled the question he understood the immensity of the problem, or the magnitude of the work, he was setting his hand to.  It is a very big problem which he is tackling, and whether he will be able to do it satisfactorily will depend not so much on himself and upon his own staff as it will upon the machinery which is at hand for the doing of this work.</P>
      <P>Now this machinery, to my mind, is not nearly sufficient to deal with the situation so extreme as this is at the present time, or else there must be something wrong in the delay which is taking place in the re-settlement of the land under the Act of 1923.  We all expected, when that Act was passed, that something would be done, and done rapidly, in the matter, because of the amount of land that we knew was unused and the number of people we had in the country capable and ready to use the land in the most advantageous way, in the interests of the country generally, and in their own interests. As far as the small farmers are concerned, those that I speak for in Tirconaill have a valuation averaging not more than £5.  They are half-time labourers and half-time farmers on their own land, so that as to what particular category they stand in it would be hard to say, whether we shall best serve them by helping them in the matter of agriculture or by the development of rural industries is a very doubtful question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to migration for these men, I do not see how far this would serve the situation, or how far they would be willing to migrate.  They have not approached that question in any way that would give those who had been associated all their lives with them any ideas as to whether or not it would be a policy that they themselves would be prepared to further, or whether, at the present time, if they did agree that it might not be the most advantageous thing to a large extent.  It might be done in a small way.  You might take away individuals in some areas and leave their farms to be distributed to others, but how far that would solve the problem is doubtful.  I feel that the problem of the congested areas will not <Col N="1140" /> be solved by distribution under the Land Act of 1923.  I am perfectly convinced of that, and unless something is done otherwise to solve the problem it will not be done by this distribution. Cottage industries and fishing industries are the only industries that I can see capable of relieving the problem of congestion in these areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another question that is brought forward, and that is the question of the eleven months' system.  It would be disastrous to take away from those poor people an opportunity of getting land under the 11 months' system, because any reasonably good land in our county, that is, surplus land, and not sufficiently within the power of the owner to cultivate, is available for those who want land in order that they may be able to maintain themselves and family.  It gives them an opportunity of getting that land in conacre.  To refuse them that advantage would be very serious indeed.  Of course, there are lands not let in conacre, and that we have in our areas.  They are disputed lands, untenanted, and used, and steps should be taken, at once, to ensure that they are brought under cultivation.  The Land Commission should see that these lands are taken up and made available for produce. They are derelict, and rates are accumulating on them.  They are what are called &ldquo;no man's land,&rdquo; and these are lands that could be used for reproduction purposes, and that the Land Commission should allow them to lie there idel and to continue so for years does seem deplorable.</P>
      <P>We heard of the bad small farmers. I do not believe, speaking for the Co. Donegal, that I am speaking for bad small farmers.  We believe that our small farmers extract from the land the utmost that can be extracted from it.  We believe they leave nothing undone, and that their industry is nightly and daily employed at work, and that there is nothing that can be taken out of their little piece of land that they are not taking out of it.  That is how I wish to deal with the question of bad small farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1141" /> I come to the question now of the collection of annuities by the Land Commission.  I feel that this question of annuities through State solicitors is altogether a wrong method of dealing with this question.  I do not feel it is possible for the Land Commission to continue to collect annuities&mdash;I know it has been done for the past three or four years&mdash;unless some other system is employed.  I do not care what that system may be, but it must be a system that will enable those people, not being business men, and who very often are likely to forget what particular day, or at what particular time, they should meet this particular obligation, to do so without extra cost.  Some method must be devised by which they will be able to keep themselves right without incurring the terrible cost they incur now, because they made a mistake in not observing their obligations at the particular moment they should observe them.  All the difficulties that can be placed in the way of the people are placed in their way if they do not pay at a particular date.  They come round to everybody they know in order to try and discover a way out.  But there seems to be no way out except through the State Solicitor, and the costs are piled up.  Some other solution of that question must be found, otherwise it will leave us in a bad situation as to the collection and payment of annuities. If the costs go on as they are, these small farmers' holdings will pass out of their hands, and into the hands of the County Council, who must be responsible for the rates.  The rotation and distribution of land have been touched on.  The rotation and distribution of land have been laid down under the Act of 1923.  The first party to be considered are those who lose their employment through land, on which they were employed, being purchased by the Land Commission. These people have the first claim, and the second claim is the congests.</P>

      <P>In our county we have been waiting anxiously for the past two years for some sort of arrangement with regard to the vesting of land and with regard to some facilities for the tenants to obtain turf.  The bogs are there, but the tenants are not able to go near them because the landlords are most exorbitant in their charges.  They still hold control of the bogs although the Land Commission has purchased, and the prices they try to export from the poor people for the use of these bogs are exorbitant.  Apart from that, there are no ways of getting into the bogs, and a great deal of confusion exists also on another head, in connection with tenants in common and joint tenants. There is a tremendous amount of confusion in regard to them.  Some of them, although they are either joint tenants or tenants in common, do not agree well among themselves, and one will put the other into difficulties, with the result that we are in a continuous state of confusion.  Something will have to be done, but how it will be done I cannot understand.</P>

Every <Col N="1143" /> day the position is getting worse and more dangerous, and if you do not take it in hand and deal with it with the utmost expendition you will be in such a position that I do not know what method it will be possible to devise in order to extricate the Government out of the difficulty or keep it from being held up to public odium because of its neglect to discharge its duty to these poor people.</P>

      <P>I wish to say at the outset that I do not agree that the Land Commission has been doing everything possible during the last two years to expedite the acquisition and the division of lands among congests and others.  In the County Meath we have an organisation which, since the 26th February, 1924, has been in communication with the Land Commission with reference to estates in the neighbourhood of Navan, and every communication from the Land Commission to them states that the matter is being dealt with and that &ldquo;careful consideration will be given to the matter contained in the correspondence which you have forwarded to us,&rdquo; and signed by Mr. Donnelly.  The Land Commission has taken up the idea that a &ldquo;go slow&rdquo; policy is proper and right at present. The Minister for Lands and Agriculture is, no doubt, aware of that, and probably that is on his instructions. Being a subordinate branch of his Department it certainly has his sanction for its &ldquo;go slow&rdquo; policy.  The Minister referred the other evening to the fact that there was only a certain amount of land available for division amongst a certain number of congests and landless people, but that does not cover the point.  What we want to get from the Minister is an explanation as to the delay in the acquisition of land and in the division of lands that the Land Commission has already in its hands.  Take the Browne estate, one of the largest in the County Meath, the address of which is Trimblestown, Trim.  It has been in the hands of the Land Commission since last April, is let on the eleven months' system and must continue let until the eleven months are up.</P>

    <Col N="1145" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidHall" hpid="Mr. HALL Mr. HALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 485.  The people in that locality possess little or no land.  The farmers born on that estate are people with no more than 12 or 13 acres, and some of them with as little as 2½ acres, though these are not farmers at all.  These have been looking forward to the division of this land during the last 12 months or two years, but despite the fact that the Land Commission have it in their hands since last April, they have made no move to allot it.  I am convinced that the Land Commission are advised by the Minister to adopt a &ldquo;go slow&rdquo; policy so that this land problem shall become perpetuated and be a perpetual annoyance to the people.  At the Commons of Navan there are 300 families living on holdings averaging 6½ acres, and these people have been agitating with the Land Commission for the last two years for the division of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are living within a mile and a half of the town of Navan, and they have put up very sound and substantial arguments to the Land Commission in support of the acquisition and the division of the lands of Commons, Williamstown, Bawn, Bective, Grange and Kilcarron on several occasions. All the promises that any human being could think of as necessary were given to them, and these promises were made with every appearance that they would be carried out, but up to the present day nothing has been done for these 300 families.  They have to travel a mile and a half to the town of Navan and pay the highest price for milk while they have not sufficient land to graze a cow which would supply their families with one of the necessaries of life.  Deputy Nolan might feel it was necessary to have lands that are in the hands of the Minister for Agriculture or in the hands of a subordinate Department of his, the Land Commission, divided, but he does not feel that the Land Commission should go any further for another while.  They should sit down and do no more.  The officials they are employing should be allowed to sit down, smoke cigars and have a jolly good time for the next three or four years.  That was his idea of the situation.  If I misinterpreted Deputy <Col N="1146" /> Gorey I am sorry, but undoubtedly he did say that he was in agreement with Deputy Nolan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Land Act the Land Commission have sufficient powers to purchase at their own price despite what the price was in 1914 or at present.  They can set their own value on it.  I do not think Deputy Gorey's argument is a good one, that the Land Commission should go back to the 1914 price, because the Land Commission can go back to that if it so desires.  We cannot see that there is any justification at all for the present delay.  The people cannot see it. The people say that the Government or the Minister responsible in this matter is holding the land over to dangle before the eyes of the people as a perpetual annoyance instead of dividing it to relieve the unfortunate position in which they find themselves.  It is necessary that the Minister should make some statement as regards the Browne Estate, that I have mentioned, and to let this House know what is his intention as regards the division of that property.  Is it the intention of the Land Commission to continue letting the Browne Estate year after year, or is it their intention to divide the property among the people?  Let it be either one or the other, and let the Minister make the people aware of it.</P>

I do not call a man a farmer who has only 15 acres, but Deputy Gorey suggested that people with larger holdings were entitled to a holding because they were supposed to be working it.

      <P>If the Minister is asleep I am surprised he did not go to sleep long ago.  We are led to believe by the farmers that such a man is placed in such an unfortunate position that he cannot work that land.  I suggest that that man is just as bad as the landless man.  If the landless man is incapable of working land, that man who has land at his disposal and is not working it is also incapable, and that land should be taken from him and he should be placed on the same basis as the landless man.  There is too much argument against the right of the landless man to come into his place on the land of Ireland.  If we go back and try to sum up history a little bit we will find that 75 per cent. of the <Col N="1148" /> landless men are the great-grandsons of men who possessed property in this country, who were dispossessed by a regime that was most distasteful in this country.  They were dispossessed by the perversity of a villain of a foreign type.  Deputy Gorey and his type will support these people.  Deputy Gorey will support men who hold three or four hundred acres and who let it.  One of them, who sits on the Government benches and with whom he was in conversation this evening, a man who holds at the moment something like 600 or 700 acres and who is not utilising it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is time that people of that type should be got to realise that they are only the custodians or the trustees of the landed property, and that they should utilise it on behalf of all the people.  We want to get rid of that system, and if we are going to do it now is the time.  There is no use in dangling the Land Act of 1923 on every platform before the eyes of the people, pointing out the good clauses of the Act and forgetting all the bad clauses and at the same time forgetting what remains to be done to bring the good clauses into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that Deputy Leonard is not present, for, if he were he would, I am sure, unless he has become a hypocrite entirely, agree with me that the southern portion of County Meath is practically owned by a few individuals&mdash;Lord Dunsany, the Earl of Fingal, Patrick Leonard, John Leonard, and Mr. Kenneth of Garristown, That system, however, cannot be allowed to continue.  The small landowners or the landless men in County Meath are the very poorest individuals who exist there, or, in fact, in Ireland, because those that have property in County Meath have too much, and those who have none have little or nothing at all.  We were overridden by landlords in County Meath for generations and we are in the same position to-day.  Prior to the Treaty we were agitating for the acquisition <Col N="1149" /> of land, and the small uneconomic holders and landless men united and, through security in the bank, managed to purchase many farms in the county, but they find themselves to-day in the unfortunate position that they are not able to meet the bank demands to pay the principal.  They were not born with a perambulator at the bedside, like Deputy Baxter.  They were probably born on a bed of straw under an old mud chimney.  They were not lucky enough to be born in grandeur and splendour and with a great fuss and a great feast to follow.  They are the children of parents who were the victims of a system, and they inherited the stain of that system, but they now call on the National Government to blot out that stain of a system inaugurated in this country by a foreign oppressor.  Deputy Baxter may jeer at matters of that kind.  It is a usual thing for men of his particular brand to jeer at working-class poverty, but although he may jeer he may, and I hope he will, be brought to realise that the people to whom I refer have as much stake in this country as either he or his party.  The landless man is to get nothing.  We are to consider the men with fifteen or sixteen acres before the man who has no property.  What is to become of men such as those whom I mentioned in a question to-day who were dismissed at Kells and Ballyhaise&mdash;29 men dismissed owing to the acquisition of land?  What is to become of such men if they do not get sufficient land to enable them to eke out a livelihood for themselves and their families?  Is the Minister for Industry and Commerce to pay them the wages that they were paid heretofore, and is he prepared to pay them unemployment benefit?  Are the farmers, whom Deputy Gorey represents, prepared to employ them at the rate of wages prevailing in the locality?</P>

      <P>The men living nearest to the Rotheram estate were living within two-and-a-half miles of it.  They never worked on it, and the people who got it were people who were not interested in the division of land.  There were no employees on that estate.  The herd, perhaps, got land.  There is no use mentioning the Rotheram estate. Perhaps Deputy Baxter could ask me about the men on the Ballinlough estate at Crossakiel, Kells.  They were allotted parcels of property and they tilled them last spring, and they had a threshing will on the farm for nine days last harvest.  One is never asked a question which could be favourably answered in the interests of the working classes, but one is always asked questions with the object of throwing the working classes into the mud and trampling on them as they were trampled on heretofore.  Then there is another estate, that of Nicholsons at Ballinrath, where 19 men were dismissed last Monday.  The men on the Nugent Everard estate were dismissed a fortnight ago.  I want to see that these men get justice.  Some of them have worked on the estate for thirty years, and the shortest period of years for which any employee worked on the estate was six.  These men are entitled to some consideration by the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture and also by the Land Commission in the division of this property.  It is not fair to come along and give something to somebody who has something.  It is time to give something to somebody who has nothing. It is all very fine to say that the congests and uneconomic holders are to get everything.  What about the man who has nothing staring him in the face but the workhouse?  He may be able to live for a few years by having a cow grazing on other persons' property and paying dearly for it. What has he if he loses his employment but the workhouse staring him in the face?  If he is married he cannot emigrate, and if he is single he must have <Col N="1151" /> money to take him away.  Whether he is married or not he does not like to leave his native home.  He likes to live at home, and I think with a National Government established here by the Irish people he should get an opportunity of living at home, and it is up to the Government to provide the individuals of this State with the means whereby they may live.  I do not know anything about the national heroes whom Deputy Gorey was hitting at, but had it not been for some of those heroes whom Deputy Gorey was hitting at he would not be here to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy spoke about the rights of congests and uneconomic holders, and he left his reference to the national heroes last of all.  In my opinion the men who gave service to the country, and brought it so far that it was able to set up its own government, are entitled to some consideration. I am referring to the old, pre-Truce I.R.A., and I think the Minister and the Land Commission should certainly give consideration to those men who did great and noble things.  Some compensation should be given to them for the services they have rendered.  I do not know about the ex-National Army officers.  If they had pre-Truce service they should be considered, but if they had not I would leave them to the Minister's discretion, and I hope he will not consider them very favourably, for the reason that you would have no National Army and no ex-National Army officers if it had not been for the pre-Truce I.R.A.  I think it was Deputy Lyons who was interrupted by Deputy Gorey with the remark that the tenants of labourers' cottages did not till their plots, and from that the Deputy inferred that they were not entitled to land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidHall" hpid="Mr. HALL Mr. HALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say in defence of the cottage-holder referred to by Deputy Gorey that he works from eight in the morning until six at night &mdash;on Deputy Gorey's farm, perhaps. He has to go home probably a distance of a mile or two after his work, and by the time he has taken his supper it is probably eight o'clock.  Is he not entitled to an hour's rest or two before he retires for the night?  If the labourer got sufficient land so that he could stay at home and work it, he would become a national asset, and a greater national asset than Deputy Gorey or any of his friends.  He proved that in the division of the land at Ballinlough, Kells, where ten of the sixteen tenants put on the land were labourers, and in the way they worked the land they gave a lead to every farmer in the locality last season. There is no use in saying the landless man is not entitled to land.  He should get the first preference, because he has been dispossessed and disinherited by people who came here from another country to interfere with the rights and liberties of the Irish people.  I do not know whether Deputy Gorey is as bad as his speeches and interruptions may lead one to think; he may have a better heart than one would think from his words.  I would ask the Minister to urge the Land Commission to hurry up with the division of land, especially in Navan area, where there are three hundred families who cannot get sufficient milk under any circumstances, and for the small quantities they do get they pay the highest prices in the town of Navan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked certain questions of the Minister for Industry <Col N="1153" /> and Commerce respecting the finances of the Shannon scheme, the contract price and the cost of wages proportion. He gave certain answers, and, following upon the answers, he informed the House that certain erroneous results and calculations had been made by me upon the figures which he had given. I want to draw the attention of the House to certain figures, and it will then, perhaps, give the Minister an opportunity at some time to give us full information as to the calculations, the prices, and the ability of the scheme to pay a fair wage.  It is quite possible &mdash;I do not at all deny the possibility&mdash; that any calculations I have made may be incorrect.  I may have made wrong deductions from the figures that have been placed before the House; but any deductions that have been made, have been made from the figures and the facts, or rather, I should say, the figures and the information, placed before the House.  I want to submit that they are the deductions that any Deputy would make from the information given us.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that the provisions of the contract in regard to labour costs are not based on the number of workers, but on the experience of engineers as to the normal proportion borne by labour to other costs of works of this kind.  The contract is for a sum of £2,492,000, and the labour costs are estimated to be 36 per cent. I have taken certain figures from the estimate of Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert and from the experts' report, but it appears from the Minister's answer to my questions that one has no right to take these figures and to draw any deduction from them.  The Minister said that the provisions of the contract in regard to labour costs are not based on the number of workers, but on the experience of engineers as to the normal proportion borne by labour to other costs on works of this kind.  Of the £2,492,000, 36 per cent. is the estimated proportion, and I take it from the Minister's answer that is the normal proportion borne by labour for costs on works of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I was deducing also that the original proportion was probably 33? per cent., or somewhere about that figure, and the balance making up the 36 per cent. was due to an increase as recommended by the experts.  I think it is desirable that we should get a lot more information from the Minister than we have had.  We have been told that Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert were provided with information as to the labour costs, and upon that information they based their estimates. They said in their estimate&mdash;which was presented to the Dáil and upon which the Dáil was to make its findings&mdash;that &ldquo;it is calculated that in the case of partial development about two-thirds of the workmen employed, approximately 1,400 men, can be accommodated in huts, while the remainder can be lodged in the neighbouring towns and villages.&rdquo;  The calculation there is 1,400, and on that basis the total number employed would be 2,100.</P>

It is the sentence I wished to read: &ldquo;The number of workmen has been calculated on the basis of the normal output of our workers.  Should this output, contrary to our expectations, not be attained, the number of workmen would have to be increased and this, of course, would affect our estimate of costs.&rdquo; There was an estimate based upon the normal output and that resulted in the calculation of the number of workmen required.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is calculated that about two-thirds of the workmen employed could be accommodated in huts while the remainder could be lodged in the neighbouring towns and villages. The number of workmen employed, according to Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert's proposal, would be 2,100.  They say the number of workmen has been calculated on the basis of the normal output of our workers.  That has nothing to do with huts.  They add: &ldquo;Should this output, contrary to our expectations, not be attained, the number would have to be increased, and this, of course, would affect our estimate of costs.&rdquo;  Their estimate of costs, 33 1-3 per cent., which the Minister more or less agrees was the estimate, was based on the normal output of German workers.  The Minister was good enough to inform the Seanad that Siemens-Schuckert had given a freewill testimony.  He said: &ldquo;These German engineers already have had an experience of Irish labour, and they have found Irish labour to work under conditions that would not be tolerated in Germany.  Their output was in no way behind what they would get in Germany, and they have given me of their free will that testimonial.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far we have it that this estimate was based upon the normal output of German workers.  The Irish workers' normal output would be equal to that of the German workers, and on that there was a calculation of 2,100 men estimated to be necessary.  The experts, after examining the report of Messrs Siemens-Schuckert, made certain comments, and they told the Minister and <Col N="1156" /> the Dáil that it was desirable to make an increase, at least to estimate for a possible increase, in the cost of labour. They tell us that Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert's project was based upon a very detailed estimate of costs, accompanied by explanatory texts.  The texts gave a short description of the process of constructional plans for the works, and that is the subject of observations. Amongst these observations are the following: &ldquo;The total estimate is based on basic prices appearing in Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert's report, and the authors of the report have arrived at these prices, partly as a result of their own inquiries and partly in accordance with the figures given to them by the Free State Government.&rdquo; This did not include the cost of the building machinery.  At the end of each section of the estimate items are given covering the transport of machinery back and forward, the cost of its hiring and maintenance.</P>
    <P>We have not had placed before us how these unit prices are made up, but one may deduce from these that the cost of hiring machinery, its transport to and fro, general expenses, contractors' profits, and wages cost, amounting to one-third, would all be included. Then we have this statement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The experts had given special consideration to the question of labour costs in the execution of the works, and have examined in the light of labour conditions in the country the basis of Siemens-Schuckert scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And they go on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Taking all the circumstances into account the bases adopted by Siemens-Schuckert were reasonable, but that it would be wise from the point of view of the Government to allow for a possible increase in the estimated expenditure under this head of an amount equivalent to 8.25 per cent. of the total outlay of the civil constructional part of the power development plant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It appears from the information that has been given to us that that 8¼ per cent. of the total has been included in the contract prices which are estimated to be £2,492,000, so that prior to the <Col N="1157" /> addition of this 8¼ per cent., or excluding that 8¼ per cent., the cost would run to about £2,300,000.  Adding 8¼ per cent. to that or about £190,000, or making 36 per cent. of the total we had £900,000 or, to be exact, £897,120. So that we have the sum of £900,000 estimated as the cost for wages, the labour costs in Ireland of this scheme. We have had also from Siemens-Schuckert that they were calculating that 2,100 men would be required to do the work.  The experts at a later stage in their report said that during the period of the first partial development, about 2,500 workers would be employed at the power development work proper for three years.  So that between one estimate and the other there was anything from 2,100 to 2,500 men estimated for that period of three years.</P>
    <P>As the Minister told us, provisions of the contract regarding the labour costs are not based on the number of workmen but on the experience of the engineers as to the normal proportion borne by labour to other costs from works of this kind.  The normal proportion then was in the first instance £710,000, to which has been added £190,000.  I wonder then if the Minister could tell us what was the estimated cost per man per week for general labour in the Siemens-Schuckert original proposition?  Perhaps he does not know.  The information that was supplied and upon which their estimate was based was that in the Co. Clare, the Co. Limerick. and the Co. Tipperary, the adjacent counties, road workers were paid 36/- and 35/- per week, that is, to men living at home. But the estimate, the Minister tells us, was not made up of any calculation of the number of men per week per wage, so much per week per man, on a given number of men.  That was not the way the estimate was made up, but rather on the proportion of the total based upon the engineers' experience of works of a similar kind.  In any case, we have £900,000 as the proportion estimated to be set apart for wages.  But, nevertheless, we have, notwithstanding the fact that that was not the method of calculation, the figure of 2,100 or alternately in the experts' <Col N="1158" /> report, 2,500 men for a period of three years.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to ask ourselves how much of the £900,000 would 2,100 men draw in three years at a given sum per week, or we may take the 2,500 men and ask the same question.  If we take 2,100 men at 32s. a week, which is a sum which has been mentioned for general labour (and beyond which the Minister says the scheme would be uneconomic and would entail a charge upon the taxpayers or on the consumer of electricity) for three years, we arrive at the gross sum of £525,000, leaving a margin for payment over and above 32s. a week for skill or otherwise of £375,000.  If we take 2,500 men, the number mentioned in the experts' report, and calculate their wages for three years at 32s. a week we have £624,000, leaving still a margin of £276,000.  Now the figure that has been presented, and these are the only figures that have been placed before us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister can give us that information and he can help us out in his calculation as much as possible.  The figures that are placed before the Dáil from these two sources, Siemens-Schuckert in the first place, and the experts in the second place, were 2,100 and 2,500 men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister's case is that these figures are not reliable and should not be taken into account, then we are entitled to ask how many other figures are not to be relied upon and how many of the other estimates are unreliable? The Minister has told us that the scheme would not be economic if any higher rate of pay than 32/- per week were conceded as a general rate for general labour.  He may prove to us by figures that he will now adduce as to the number of men that may be required, that their calculations or estimates or suggestions or incidental statements were false or misleading, and that a much larger number of men will be required and that a much greater proportion of the £900,000 set apart for wages will be exhausted and absorbed.  Whether he will do that successfully or not I do not know, but I hope he will give us the fullest possible information on this matter, if only to satisfy our curiosity.  The 32/- per week is insufficient.  It will not bring out an economic job.  It will not induce the best workmen to give their best work on the job, and it will be more costly than a fair wage for good labour.  But that is not the matter that I asked the permission of the Dáil to deal with.  I want to give the Minister an opportunity, either now or at some other time, to give us the fullest possible information as to how these estimates were made up for wages, costs, and any other material matter affecting this contract.  It is a matter of public interest and, while it will not affect my judgment that 32/- per week is an entirely and utterly inadequate wage, it might go a little further towards justifying the Minister's contention and the figures he has hitherto put forward.  In any case, I say that the information placed before the Dáil <Col N="1160" /> was that 1,400 men would be two-thirds of the number required by the contractors and that the experts added 400 to that, making it 2,500.  I want to know what are the bases of the costs of wages which will account for a sum of £900,000 as the proportion of wages on this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No; that would be too much like the Deputy's method of getting in erroneous statements without any time to have them corrected. The Deputy has taken Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert's figure of 2,100 men, where they are talking about how men are to be lodged, and he goes on to the experts' statement which includes approximately&mdash;the word &ldquo;approximately&rdquo; is used in one case and &ldquo;about&rdquo; in the other&mdash;2,500 men.  The experts, he says, jump from 2,100 to 2,500 men, without saying a word about this change.  I suggest that that is not what experts are called in to do&mdash;that in a task of this sort they would be likely to pass over, in an incidental way, an increase from 2,100 to 2,500, without saying: &ldquo;We think the number of men allocated to this piece of work is too small and must be raised by 400 men.&rdquo;  They were very accurate and detailed in most of what they did.  This is a correction made incidentally, and on this we have this calculation.  It is to be noted that the figure of almost £1,000,000 which Deputy Johnson gets out and his saving of something in the region of £376,000, is always made on the basis of 2,100 men.  He gets back for the purpose of his calculation to the Siemens-Schuckert incidental figure, and he will not take for the purpose of his main calculation 2,500&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I refer to numbers. They would have been increased in numbers enormously if Limerick City workers had had any forethought and had not deprived themselves of the building of a light railway in Limerick City.  We have also a certain number of dockers engaged on the scheme.  They are not getting 32s. per week.  That is another element of calculation&mdash;the number of dockers who are going to be employed at this job, which is going to give continuous employment at the docks for a year and going to give it to dockers at dockers' rates, which are fixed on the ordinary basis, that a docker works two or three days of the week and is idle for the rest.  While there is continuous employment promised a certain number of men at dockers' rate, we have no element of that nature entering into Deputy Johnson's calculation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Let Deputy Johnson take 3,000 men.  Let him take 2,100 unskilled.  Let him take some number of that who, though unskilled, are getting higher wages than 32s. per week, because they are working in <Col N="1162" /> Limerick City area, and take the multitude of men outside&mdash;about another thousand&mdash;who are not of the completely unskilled type, and I think he will find that, so far from having anything in hand, the money set aside for labour-cost has been exceeded.  The idea seems to be that experts who were called over here, in settling about this piece of work on lines known to ordinary engineers, calculated that there would be so many men employed.  No calculation of that sort is ever made. The calculation is that labour costs generally involve one-third of the entire cost.  Here it was raised, because the experts said the cost of labour here was higher than on the Continent, and they raised it a little.  There is no calculation as to the number of men.  There could not be a calculation as to the number of men.  The numbers fluctuate according to the nature of the section of the work, according to the weather, and according to the season of the year.</P>

Several meetings were held which resulted in a proposal by the Committee for a substantial duty on imported sole and harness leather, the only classes of leather tanned in this country at present.
