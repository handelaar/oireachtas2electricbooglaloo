      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that small cottage industries sending such goods as lace, embroideries, stockings, etc., on approval outside the Saorstát have considerable difficulty in finding a Customs officer who will sign the necessary forms, and whether he will consider if it is possible, where such goods are sent on approval by parcels post, to allow the goods to be inspected, and the forms signed, by the Postmaster at the post office from which they are despatched.</P>

      <P>A number of applications for compensation have been received from the person named by the Deputy.  Of these, two awards in respect of the pre-Truce period have been received from the Compensation (Ireland) Commission, and have been duly discharged by the issue of two paying orders for £80 and £27 with costs.  It is understood that portions of the claim which were not within the scope of the Commission's original terms of reference are at present under investigation.  An award for £120 and £17 5s. 6d. costs in respect of the post-Truce period was paid in September, 1924.</P>

      <P>On a claim made on the 7th January, 1925, Daniel Doherty received unemployment benefit for 60 days in respect of 60 contributions to his credit in the Unemployment Fund.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he will state the reason for the refusal to pay unemployment benefit to Patrick Cribbon, Rathangan, Co. Kildare, book No. 1721, Kildare Office; whether he is aware that Mr. Cribbon's father died about a month ago without making a will; that it is alleged that benefit was refused on the assumption that Mr. Cribbon is now the owner of his father's holding; that his title to possession may not be proved for the next six months, and whether, as this man, having been employed for the last two years, and having his card fully stamped, is now unemployed and without means, he will have further enquiries made with a view to payment of benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT (for Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the statutory conditions for the receipt of benefit is that the claimant proves that he is unemployed and unable to obtain suitable employment.  The claim made by Patrick Cribbon, of Rathangan, on the 6th instant was disallowed because he failed to fulfil this statutory condition. The claimant was notified of the disallowance of his claim and of his right of appeal to the Court of Referees, but up to the present no appeal has been received from him.  The circumstance of his father's death not being relevant was not known or taken <Col N="1874" /> into account in connection with his claim to benefit.  I would suggest that if Mr. Cribbon feels aggrieved by the decision of the Insurance Officer he should appeal to the Court of Referees against that decision.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that Mr. T. O'Reilly, Aughowle, Ashford, Co. Wicklow (Wicklow Office, Serial No. 475), has been employed in an insurable occupation for the past three years, and if so, if he will state why his claim for unemployment benefit has been rejected.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT (for Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit is that the claimant must prove that he is unemployed and unable to obtain suitable employment. When Terence O'Reilly claimed unemployment benefit on the 25th of March last it was known that he had been an insured contributor for some years, but it was known also that he was not unemployed or unable to obtain suitable employment, and his claim was therefore disallowed.  He appealed from this decision to the Court of Referees, which recommended that the claim could not be allowed. The Insurance Officer accepted this recommendation and the claim accordingly remains disallowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the President aware that the appeal was decided in the absence of the claimant, as he was unable to travel to Dublin for the hearing, having no money; that the man has been in an insurable occupation for a number of years, and will he state why he has been disqualified apart from the reasons stated now?  I would also like to know if he is to continue in insurable occupation and stamping his card, seeing that while he was idle he was refused unemployment benefit.</P>

      <P>There is no information on the file, so far as I can see, which indicates that he was absent when his claim was under consideration, but I accept the Deputy's statement. The information on the file discloses <Col N="1875" /> the fact that he is the owner of ten acres of land, and that the valuation, which is £7, goes to show that this land must be of good quality.  I am not in a position to express any opinion on that, but those are facts as contained in the file.  If the Deputy wishes, I will bring to the attention of the Minister the fact that the claimant was not present when the decision was taken.</P>

I had intended dealing with the matter under the Local Government Bill, but the drafting of the section would require considerable thought and time, and, as the Bill took a very long time to get through, I thought it advisable not to put such a section in during the course of its progress.

Although the repair of the cable has been repeatedly on the programme of a British cable ship, which would normally have undertaken the work, it has not been possible on account of rough seas and bad weather conditions to effect the repairs.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned the discussion on this Vote on Thursday, I had raised a certain question regarding the position of the Parliamentary Secretary.  The sitting was brought to an end just when I had opened my statement.  I would like to make clear in this matter that I am not inspired by any animus to any individual in what I have to say.  When the question of the appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence <Col N="1879" /> was under discussion, during the debates on the Ministers and Secretaries Bill, I queried and opposed the insertion of the provision which sets out that a civil member of the Council of Defence, being a member of the Dáil, should act as Parliamentary Secretary. I was not able then to see the need for the addition of a Parliamentary Secretary to a Ministry, the duties of which &mdash;in expectation&mdash;would gradually decline to comparatively small dimensions. None of us expected that there would be occasion, in respect of the Ministry of Defence, to have a Parliamentary Secretary, by Act of Parliament, when no such provision was made in respect of other Ministries.  However, it was made an Act of Parliament and it is not the business of the Committee at this stage, I understand, to discuss the merits of the legislation. But we are entitled to discuss the salary paid to, and the duties of, that officer.</P>
      <P>The provisions of Section 8 of the Act states that he will be responsible for such duties as are assigned to him by the Minister for Defence and that he shall act as Parliamentary Secretary to the Council of Defence.  I think we ought to understand what, as a matter of fact, are the duties that are assigned to the Parliamentary Secretary. We have not had any experience, until yesterday, that any duties of a Parliamentary nature, at any rate, had been assigned to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am still of the belief that it is unnecessary to have a paid Parliamentary Secretary attached to this Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then the question of responsibility for finance arises.  The Parliamentary Secretary is designed as being responsible to the Minister for the finance of the Military Defence Forces.  When that responsibility is attached to the same person who acts as Parliamentary Secretary it would seem to be obvious that the Dáil would look to that officer for information respecting the finance of the Department, leaving the Minister the time and opportunity to deal with the more important question, perhaps, of the defence of the country, military strategy, and such things as <Col N="1880" /> that, in conjunction with the Council of Defence.  I consider the request to vote £1,000 for the salary of the Parliamentary Secretary is not justified until we have reason to believe that the office is essential.  It is quite conceivable that even within the statute a person who is a member of the Dáil shall be appointed, and it is conceivable, also, that that person would be acting as an unpaid Parliamentary Secretary. I would have no hesitation whatever in voting an adequate salary for any officer if I had any reason to believe that the office was necessary, and that there were duties attached to the office, but so far as I have been able to see there are no duties attached to this office, or there were not until yesterday. Yesterday we had an opportunity of finding out; in the absence of the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary was able to answer questions on behalf of the Minister.  But, surely, it was obvious that a discussion of the Army Estimates was an occasion when the officer responsible for the finance, who presumably would have the duties essentially attached to that office and would be familiar with all the financial operations of the Department, particularly the Estimates of the Department, should be here to deal with the Estimates when they were under discussion.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have to say that it is somebody's duty to call attention to this defect, and to say that we ought not to be asked to vote a salary of £1,000 for such an office until we can see some evidence that the office is essential.  I await the explanation of the Minister, first as to what are the duties that are devolved by him upon the member of Dáil Eireann who is responsible to the Minister for the finance of the Military Defence Forces, and what are the duties assigned to him as Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>A Parliamentary Secretary, as Deputy Johnson states, has been appointed under Section 8 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act. The appointment was made in order to fulfil the requirements of that section, and to establish a Council of Defence. A Council of Defence could not be established <Col N="1881" /> without a second civilian member, who was to be styled Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence.  Deputy Nicholls has acted in that capacity for some time.  Since he has been appointed, the Council proper has been set up.  Further, I have assigned various duties to the Parliamentary Secretary in connection with pensions and matters of that kind that are cropping up daily.  His duties are to go to the Army Finance Department, where he has an office, and to examine all the documents and papers that come to hand, and see that they are in proper order.  He has also acted as chairman of various committees that have been sitting from time to time, and he carries out that work on my instructions.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Johnson is stressing the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary was not here the first day on which the Army Estimate was being discussed, I wish to say that he was absent with my consent.  The Parliamentary Secretary was unwell, and I knew of that fact.  It was not for the purpose of coming under notice that he was here yesterday to answer questions on the Order Paper, but because I was unable to be here.  If I could have been here I would have answered the questions myself, as I have always done since I became Minister.</P>
      <P>As far as the Estimates are concerned I stand by them, and if I am in office this time twelvemonths when the Estimates come up again, I certainly will not assign their defence to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I take responsibility for them myself, and I do not wish to put that responsibility on anybody else.  As far as the Parliamentary Secretary is concerned, his office has been arranged in Collins Barracks, and he will have ample work to do there every day.  Of course it was mandatory on us to appoint a Parliamentary Secretary, to constitute the Council of Defence.  I try, as far as I can, to carry out the law as it is laid down for me.  I sometimes find it very hard to do that because of pressure from every section of the House to break it.  I, however, try to carry it out, and I am doing it in this case as well as in others.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister has missed the point of Deputy Johnson's complaint.

      <P>Having an office in a Department is not everything.  I would imagine that a Parliamentary Secretary, where there is a Vote of £3,000,000 coming before our Party, who are supposed to look after the question of expenditure, would be here to explain matters.  How can you expect us to vote a salary to a gentleman we cannot see doing his work from our point of view?  He should be here.  We had one particular item on this Vote, in connection with veterinary instruments, that nobody seemed to know anything about.  We looked on it as an absurd item.  If the Parliamentary Secretary was doing what he is supposed to be doing he could have been here to explain that and, perhaps, remove any doubts as to whether we were doing right in voting for it or not.  You must not take me as being personal in this matter.  I look upon the voting of £1,000 salary to a Parliamentary Secretary in the light of a duty, but it is my duty, if I am to vote for it, to see that the Parliamentary Secretary will do his duty.  Therefore I think it is not a fair proposition to ask us to vote for it.  I certainly will oppose the granting of that £1,000.</P>

I have already explained that the Parliamentary Secretary was absent with my knowledge and consent.  If Deputy Wilson expects an officer to be in this House when he is ill, I think he is expecting too much, <Col N="1883" /> and I do not think the Dáil will back him out in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this matter is not made easier by the Minister's explanation. There are included in this Vote an Army Finance Officer, a Deputy Army Finance Officer, and an Assistant Army Finance Officer.  Now we are to understand, I take it, that the Parliamentary Secretary is going to be responsible in the office for the details of the finances.  Then, of course, one would be inclined to ask what is going to be the function of the Army Finance Officer.  I am afraid there is every appearance of a coming conflict there if the Parliamentary Secretary is deputed by the Minister to be responsible for putting the accounts in order and seeing that the details of the accounts are correct, and doing work which hitherto has been done under the direction of the Army Finance Officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>No, under my direction&mdash;under the direction of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated that it was hitherto done under the direction of the Army Finance Officer.  Now, we are led to believe that the functions hitherto carried out by the Army Finance Officer are to be undertaken by the Parliamentary Secretary.  If that is the case, then I say there is going to be a conflict of interests, and that work ought not to be done by the Parliamentary Secretary.  One immediately asks oneself the question: what is the meaning of the term Parliamentary Secretary, if the function of the person in question is to look after the accounts in the finance office of the Minister?  I would expect that the person to whom is deputed the duty of acting for the Minister in respect to finances should make himself familiar with the general finance business and be able to relieve the Minister of those important matters, as between the Dáil and the Minister. Departmental officers, permanent officials, have not access to the Dáil. If it is to be said that the Parliamentary Secretary, to whom is deputed the responsibility of looking after the finances of the defence forces, is to undertake <Col N="1884" /> the duty which hitherto has been carried out by departmental officers, then I am afraid we are coming to a pretty pass, and there is going to be confusion in that department before very long.  I can fully believe that the Minister has explained very satisfactorily the functions of this officer outside the Parliament.</P>
      <P>We all have an idea of what the duties of a Parliamentary Secretary would be within, and in relation to, the Parliament; but while we may have our imaginations as to what these duties would be, we have not had very definite evidence.  I hope the Minister will be able to give us more satisfaction in this respect.  No doubt he is helpless to the extent that he is bound to appoint a member of the Dáil to act on the Council of Defence, and that person shall act as Parliamentary Secretary. But, again, I say we are not bound to vote or to approve of the payment of £1,000 salary in this way, without some evidence of the duties attaching to this office.  I put it to the Minister and his colleagues that the time has come when there should be an amendment of the Ministers and Secretaries Act in relation to the Council of Defence.  The Minister should be relieved of the responsibility of appointing a Parliamentary Secretary.  That is, perhaps, just going near the borderland of disorder. Will the Minister explain to us what the respective duties are of the Army Finance Officer and the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>The duty of the Army Finance Officer is to see that all the accounts presented for payment are properly vouched and properly checked.  His duties are very far-reaching. Every account, every pension, and everything else in connection with the expenditure of three million pounds&mdash;four million pounds last year &mdash;must go through his office.  On the other hand, the Parliamentary Secretary has got to examine anything that is put up to him by the Army Finance Officer.  He has to determine questions of policy in regard to certain matters that may come up in my absence, and he has to read and sign all documents <Col N="1885" /> as far as pensions, gratuities, <i>ex gratia</i> payments and other things are concerned. Very often he will not take the responsibility on himself of deciding some of those matters, and they are referred to me.  I take the responsibility and I am responsible to the Dáil for anything I do in that way.  Through his staff, the Army Finance Officer is responsible to me.  I assign certain duties to the Parliamentary Secretary, and amongst those duties is the financial end of the work that I am responsible for.  That is as reasonable an explanation as I can give the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Army Finance Officer is the responsible accounting officer for every penny of money that is paid.  If he recommends a wrong payment to me or to the Parliamentary Secretary, and puts it forward as being right and just and according to law, he is responsible for that, and I certainly would hold him responsible for any errors he may make in any respect.  He is a responsible officer, an old civil servant.  I think we all know the Army Finance officer for a considerable number of years, and I think he has earned the respect of everybody in regard to his work.  His duties are not taken from him.  He does the finance work and the careful examinations that are necessary. The Parliamentary Secretary determines questions of policy, or whether, in his judgment, certain payments should be made.  He has plenty of work to do dealing with all the documents that pass through.  I think that explanation is as reasonable as could be given.  So long as the law is there the Parliamentary Secretary must be there, if we are going to carry on the Department of Defence.  Otherwise, we cannot carry on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to intervene for a few moments on this question.  For something like eight or nine months I had an opportunity of estimating the amount and the character of the work which has to be discharged by the Minister for Defence.  I think it is my fault that a Parliamentary Secretary was not appointed at an earlier date.  It will be within the recollection of Deputies that it was not my intention to continue in the office <Col N="1886" /> of Minister for Defence.  From my experience of the office generally, I would have no hesitation in saying that the work, taking it in volume, is very much greater than the work in any other Ministry.  At one time I had to attend every Sunday morning for about four hours in order to deal with some matters that could not be dealt with during the week.  When acting as Minister for Defence, I was perfectly satisfied that a Parliamentary Secretary would be necessary in the Ministry.  I do not think I could be even fairly satisfied that the Parliamentary Secretary could have accommodated himself to the duties of the office in the limited time that has elapsed since his appointment. It is possible even that the Minister could not lay down what might be called cast-iron regulations for the duties of Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>This particular Ministry suffers from several disabilities.  There are very grave doubts as to where the head office really is.  When I was Minister I laid it down that the head office and all the other offices should be centred in one barracks, the Griffith Barracks. As far as I know, that has not yet been done.  It should be done.  It ought to be done in the interests of the service and in the interests of the Ministry of Defence.  I also expressed the opinion that the appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary to this Ministry ought to have been made twelve months ago. With the passing of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, it was the intention that the appointment would be immediately made.  As the Dáil is aware, many things happened which prevented that being done at the time.  In my view it is unlikely that the regular statutory duties that will be performed by the Parliamentary Secretary to this Ministry will be ready for nearly twelve months.  The distribution of the work, and the character of the work that the Minister will need the Parliamentary Secretary to discharge, will need many months of experiment, examination and review in order to see how best the services of this officer can be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The preparation of the estimates takes place towards the close of the <Col N="1887" /> calendar year.  The Minister came into office at the very end of that period, and the Parliamentary Secretary was not appointed for some time.  He was, in consequence, presented with estimates of which he could only get a superficial knowledge before they were introduced here.  I suppose it would be quite within parliamentary procedure for him to stand for those particular estimates; but it must be within the knowledge of Deputies that the work of the pensions section of the Ministry, and a good deal of other administrative work, had to be attended to.  While the term Parliamentary Secretary is used possibly in order to satisfy Parliamentary etiquette, the fact of the matter is that the Parliamentary Secretary has really been acting as an assistant Minister.</P>
    <P>The various offices of this particular Ministry are spread over the entire city.  There is portion in Parkgate Street, and another portion in Portobello Barracks.  If I were Minister, I would not have any of the offices in a barracks in which there were soldiers quartered.  There is a portion in Molesworth Street, and yet another portion in Griffith Barracks.  For a short time some of the offices were in the College of Science.  The mere gathering together of those offices is a work of very considerable difficulty. There are administrative difficulties placed in the way of a new Minister coming in, and a new Parliamentary Secretary coming in.  There are reasons, for instance, why particular matters should be dealt with in a particular way.  It would be unreasonable to expect that even if the Parliamentary Secretary were here to outline the duties he has to perform, he would be in a position perfectly to satisfy members of the Dáil.  I think it is right that the statement made by Deputy Johnson should be corrected&mdash; that is, that the Parliamentary Secretary can interfere with the Army Finance Officer.  He must be, and he is, the official responsible, but the Parliamentary Secretary is responsible in a different connection.  His responsibility is mainly a political one, the <Col N="1888" /> other being purely an official responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>This sub-head gives the ordinary Deputy some food for thought.  Looking at the totals, we find £60,000 for 1925-26, and £52,000 for 1924-25, an increase of £8,000.  If you go more closely into the figures you will find that there are some items that money had to be found in the Estimates last year that are not included this year.  Last year over £20,000 was paid for temporary clerks.  This year that is reduced to about £16,000.  There are reductions in other Departments. Really, this apparent increase of £6,000 should be £23,000 or £24,000, when we take into consideration some of the positions that have been abolished. There is a new item in this year's Estimate of £1,000 for a Parliamentary Secretary.  That is more or less balanced by the £600 that was allowed last year for a private secretary to the Minister. Then we come to the Deputy Finance Officer, which is a new creation, carrying a salary of £620.  There is also another new officer at £550.  There is an increase of two higher executive officers whose salaries amount almost to another £1,000.  There is an increase of ten junior executive officers, accounting for an increase of over £2,000. There is also a staff officer, which seems to be a new creation, carrying a salary of £250.  Instead of ten clerical officers there are seventy this year, the salaries amounting to £7,330.  There is a reduction in temporary clerks from 128 to 90, with a corresponding reduction in cost of about £4,000.  There is also a reduction in temporary messengers, so that evidently there is not as much work to be done.  Last year the allowance for extra clerical assistance was £9,190, and this year nothing is provided.  I make out the extra charges to amount to something like £25,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It strikes one as peculiar, when the Army has been reduced from 50,000 to 16,000, and the cost from £10,000,000 to £3,000,000, that an increased staff should be necessary at an increased cost running to my mind to an extraordinary amount.  If two years ago, when the Army was three times its present size, this Department was able <Col N="1889" /> do the work with a certain staff, what is the explanation for this large increase under this sub-head?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is scarcely fair to compare the £10,000,000 Army with the £3,000,000 Army.  The comparison ought to be with last year's Estimate, which was for over £4,000,000, but the actual expenditure worked out at something over £3,000,000.  As far as the comparison is concerned, it is really £3,000,000 this year as against three and a quarter millions last year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection I may point out that I believe on examination it will be found that a number of Army officers were formerly employed at work which is now done by civilians.  An examination of the various items here will disclose the fact that the £9,000 allowed for extra clerical assistance last year disappears this year.  It will be noted, however, that the bonus which was £5,000 last year is £14,000 this year.  That indicates a difference in the class of officers employed. In other words, there was a flat rate paid last year&mdash;I forget the exact amount&mdash;but it was about £3 per week.  It will be noticed that the number of temporary clerks has decreased from 128 to 90.  What has happened is that an examination has taken place, and the results are disclosed in the figures for clerical officers, who number 70 as compared with 10 last year. That means that the standing strength of the clerical section has been increased, and, as a consequence of that, the bonus has automatically increased. The Estimate is a complicated one, but on closer examination it will, to a large extent, defend itself, if allowance is made for the Parliamentary Secretary, the Deputy Army Finance Officer and the Assistant Army Finance Officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite follow that. I am making allowance for the reduction of temporary clerks from 128 to 90, and the increase of clerical officers <Col N="1890" /> from 10 to 70.  But that does not explain the rest of the items.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it does.  This seems to me a very expensive department, and I do not think it is justified, in view of the reduction in the Army and the reduced volume of business to be attended to.  Last year this department had to deal with a large number of claims for pensions, etc.  Most of these claims have been dealt with, and the particular departments have been closed.  Without further explanation, these figures do not appear to be justified. I do not think the public will accept the President's explanation as being sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>As the President says, this is a very complicated matter. I am not quite sure that his explanation gave us the whole truth of it.  It is common knowledge to all Deputies that the work of the Army Finance office has been to a considerable extent dealing with accumulated claims from the time of the fighting.  There have been claims for compensation, for billeting, for motor vehicles commandeered, and for arrears of pay, and a considerable amount of time had been devoted to that work.  Very wisely those were dealt with by temporary clerks for the most part.  The time has now come when some of these temporary clerks can be discharged, and have been discharged to the extent of 38 at some hardship to themselves, because some of them are over 55 years and could not enter for an examination to be made permanent.  I would like a little more consideration given to the claims of the men over 55 years who have been discharged from the Army Finance office. I think they should be the last to be discharged instead of the first.  However, that is in parenthesis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to find out is that although you reduce the temporary clerks, who were comparatively cheap, you are increasing enormously the establishment of permanent clerks who, <Col N="1891" /> if they are required, are required to deal with a situation that is not a normal but an abnormal one, in connection with accumulated claims of the past.  This increase from 14 to 24 junior executive officers, and from 10 to 70 clerical officers does need some justification more than the President has given.  We should be told something as to the work that they are to do, and why this considerable expansion is necessary.  After all, it is not merely a question of replacing temporary by permanent staff.  The staff of the Department is increased by over 50 people &mdash;from 179 to 250&mdash;though, as Deputy Gorey said, the Army is smaller and the expenditure on it is reduced.</P>
    <P>This is also a growing Estimate.  All these clerical officers and junior executive officers are on an increasing scale of pay.  Next year this Estimate will be higher; the year after it will be higher still, and they are all pensionable&mdash;at least, I understand they are. This is an uneconomic change.  On the whole, it would have been better to have continued the temporary staff, rather than to create an enormously inflated establishment, as far as we can tell.  The Dáil has no means of knowing what work is being done.  On the surface it appears to be enormously inflated.</P>
    <P>I do not want to attack the Minister on this ground, because, as the President said, he had very little time to revise the Estimates.  But I do say that we are making a very big commitment for the future.  It may be justified. Possibly it can be justified on the ground that it will give more rigid financial control; that it will prevent officers in the Army from incurring liability which they had no business to incur; that it will afford a more detailed and complete supervision of every item of Army expenditure.  If that is the case it may be justified, but it has not been justified up to the present. It will be very hard for us sitting here this afternoon to balance fully all the issues that are at stake: the advantage of improved financial control as against the disadvantage of increasing your establishment and making yourself liable for at least 80 <Col N="1892" /> additional pensions on retirement.  We are not in a position to balance these figures.  I say now, as I said before, that it is evident from the discussion on these Estimates that some inquiry into the financial administration of the Army is needed, and, if the Government will not set up an outside Committee or a Committee of the Dáil to go into the Estimates, they should, at least, set up a sub-Committee of the Executive Council to go into the details of the financial administration of the Army.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Gorey, in analysing the figures and the alleged increase, did not take carefully into consideration the explanation given at the bottom of the page.  If he did so he would find that there is an official who is still acting as Private Secretary to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding all this explanation, there is the fact that there is an increase of 53 additional officers, most of whom are permanent, to the establishment since last year. We were told last year by the Minister's predecessor that the arrears of work, to which Deputy Cooper has referred, had been cleared up.  If that is a fact, there does not seem to be a justification for an increase of 53 additional officers.  There is a remarkable thing about these Estimates, apart from other Estimates.  It is stated at the end of the page that certain officers are on a personal scale.  What is the justification for a personal salary in the cases mentioned here?  Is there any necessity for supermen in this particular Department?  How do these individuals come to get a personal scale above the salaries generally recognised for such positions?  I could understand the reason for that, perhaps, in the case of the Army Finance Officer.  Six higher executive officers are in receipt of a personal scale of salary.  That is six out of nine, and that goes right down through the personnel of this staff.  I do not think that there are as many permanent officials in the other Departments as there are in this; I mean permanent officials having personal <Col N="1893" /> scales of salaries.  I also want to ask the Minister what is the recognised scale paid to temporary clerks. I assume that there is no bonus attached to their wage or salary.  I am not quite certain whether overtime is included in the £16,292 or in the £20,528 which was paid under this sub-head last year.  Cases have been brought under my notice where clerks attached to units in the Army are working for scab pay.  I hope that the Minister, like myself, regards clerical work as work of an important nature, and I hope that the House will not regard 27/- a week as a standard pay for clerks who are doing highly technical work.  I would ask the Minister whether there is any standard scale of salary for these temporary clerks, and, if there is, why it is not shown in the Estimates.  In the last figures in the sub-head there is shown a sum of £14,856, as against £5,447.  That, I take it, is a bonus shared among the permanent officials of the Ministry. There were 128 temporary clerks last year, as against 90 in this Estimate. As against that there were 10 clerical officers last year, as against 70 this year.  I want to know whether the increase from 10 to 70 has been due to the appointment of a number of those who were originally demobilised.  I mean, were those amongst the 128 men employed last year.  Was it a case of transferring temporary clerks to the posts of clerical officers?</P>

      <P>I want to say that the increase is accounted for as follows: &mdash; Parliamentary Secretary, £1,000; Deputy Army Finance Officer, £620; Higher Executive Officers, £1,235; Assistant Army Finance Officer <Col N="1895" /> and ten Junior Executive Officers, £2,242; Staff Officer, £250; fifty-nine Clerical Officers&mdash;I think that should be 60&mdash;£5,867; typist, £66.  That disposes of what I think we call the clerical element.  Then there are five cleaners, five packers and porters, one storeman, one printer and one compositor. The bulk sum amounts to £12,645. The increase in scale due to increments and promotion is: Secretary, £25, and the Army Finance Officer, £195.  I think the salary had not been fixed previously.  It was a question, I think, of transfer and fixing the scale.  The personal scale, I may inform Deputy Davin, is what is known as the British scale, and it was the scale in operation during the time of the British occupation here.  When these offices are vacated it is not intended that they will carry the same scale of salary as now.</P>

As a matter of fact, the Department of Defence was one of the new departments, and an inducement has sometimes to be given to a person to transfer from a peaceful occupation to one that is not quite so peaceful.  The increase in the rate of typist's salary is due to the increased cost of living.  As regards the difference between the bonus of £14,856 this year and £5,447 last year, the increase is due to the difference that occurred last year, 85 points as against 95 points.</P>

      <P>The President has not given us, nor has the Minister given us, any general justification for this Vote&mdash;I do not ask for justification in detail&mdash;by way of increased work or increased efficiency on the part of this branch.  We have not been told anything to show why we should have six cleaners instead of one; whether additional establishments have been opened. That is, of course, a very small point, but it is the sort of point we have been told we have to go into here.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Lands have got up and stated that there is no need for any Committee of Inquiry into Finance, that the Dáil is the Committee of Inquiry for Finance. That being so, we have to pursue these rather tedious inquiries and try and get some justification&mdash;even some general justification&mdash;for additions to the staff of something like one-fifth.  The staff is one-fifth greater than last year, leaving out of account these cleaners, and packers and machinists, and so on. We ought not to let this Vote pass until we get some justification on this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended also to call attention to this point.  No explanation has been given of the increase extending from junior executive officers down.  There is an increase from 14 to 24 in one case, and from 10 to 70 in another case, which means an increase of 70, whereas when we come down to the temporary clerks we have a reduction from 128 to 90.  Therefore, we have a reduction of 38, as against an increase of 70, paying no attention to these storesmen and packers and printers at the end of the list.  But I would like to know what is the extra work which requires this huge number of temporary clerks, with an increased number of junior executive officers and clerical officers.  I maintain that there is a distinct increase of at least 32 officers in this particular line.  I am sorry to press this matter, but it is really a matter to which some attention should be paid.  I made reference, on a previous occasion, to a direction in which I thought some saving might be effected.  I was rather amazed at the disparity between the answers I got with regard to that matter.  I suggested that there was no necessity for St. Bricin's Hospital, that the soldiers treated there could very well be treated in the general hospitals in the city. The answer the Minister for Defence gave was that they did not intend to continue treatment in St. Bricin's Hospital; that they intended to treat only pensioners there.  The President got up and said that they could not treat soldiers in general hospitals, that they must have discipline maintained. I am not sure whether it is necessary to introduce any very marked military discipline in respect of people on pension or not, but the answers given to me seem to suggest lack of understanding as between the Minister and President. The President is now attempting to answer questions which I think the Minister for Defence ought to answer. I think he should put up to us the case that there is a great increase in the work of his Department in order to account for the increased number of people he is employing.  I think that is essential.  The ordinary individual like myself thought when we were bringing <Col N="1898" /> down the Army numbers that we could look forward to a considerable reduction in the staff in these offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think a satisfactory explanation has been given in regard to the question I asked in respect of temporary clerks.  This matter has been brought under my notice on several occasions during the past couple of years, and I am not prepared, as a member of the Dáil, to allow a vote of £16,292 to go through without knowing what that amount represents, and how it is made up. Under every other sub-head you have a scale given, plus bonus.  Why have the figures not been given, if there is a standard scale of salary for temporary clerks?  I had a case brought to my notice the other day of a man about 45 years of age who served in the Army, and risked a great deal from the beginning of the outbreak in 1922, and who is at the present time employed as temporary clerk at 27s. per week.  He had grade pay allowance of 10s. 6d. per week, but it was taken off him.  He made representations to the Army Finance Department, but they said that because there was some loophole in the regulations issued with regard to this unit, this individual clerk must continue to receive 27s. per week.  From the President's answer it would appear that there are temporary clerks receiving £3 per week, and it is quite possible that there may be some temporary clerks receiving £6 and £7 per week. If there is a recognised scale, the figures ought to be put before us.  If any qualified clerks&mdash;and I take it that the Army would not take on any except qualified clerks&mdash;are employed in the military barracks outside or in the Army Finance Department, and are receiving 27s. per week, I ask the Minister to say if he considers that a fair scale of salary for the work.  I would be surprised if he said that he considered that a fair figure.  If 27s. per week is the recognised figure, this sum of £16,292 cannot be properly analysed by me at any rate.  Taking the figure as it stands, for 90 temporary clerks during the coming year it would work out at about £180 each.  If that is the average for the whole lot, why not give <Col N="1899" /> £180 to all temporary clerks?  The Minister must be conversant with the staffing of his own Department and the scales of salary paid both to temporary and permanent officials.  I ask him to give a more satisfactory explanation than the President has given, because we all admit that the President cannot be expected to stand up and defend the interests of a Department with which he is not thoroughly acquainted at the present time.</P>

We know what officers got it, but in no particular has this Vote been justified or has an attempt been made to justify it either by the President or by the Minister.  Our Army has been reduced, and our Budget has been reduced, but our staff on this Vote has been increased out of all proportion. We are preaching economy in the country.  We want economy in the lower branches, and through county and local administration.  Here we have this glaring increase which the President has not explained away.  Deputy Sir James Craig has referred to St. Bricin's Hospital.  That does not come under this Vote at all.  But as it has been referred to, I would like to know what system would serve the Army if we had not St. Bricin's and a medical staff at the head of the Army.  We have no ambition to get hold of St. Bricin's Hospital.  It does not concern the Deputies of the Dáil, but I think St. Bricin's Hospital has worked wonders for the Army.</P>

      <P>I am more convinced than ever, after hearing the President's <Col N="1900" /> explanation, that this Vote is not justified by the size of the Army, and it is not justified by the requirements of the country.  There is no necessity whatever for this increase of £8,000, and the President has not convinced me that that £8,000 should not be £20,000 or perhaps £25,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I overlooked one point in my explanation, and that was that there were quite a number of officers and soldiers engaged on clerical work in previous years.  Now, this is a civil staff, and in cases where the Army Finance Officer took over offices which were manned by officers or soldiers, there are now civilians engaged. I do not think it is a fair comparison to put on one side last year's or the previous year's Estimate, and to put on the other side this year's Estimate. This year's Estimate does lend colour to the suggestion that there is a stronger establishment, but it does not follow that there is more money spent upon the administrative machine than was spent last year or the year before, because of the fact that it was not distributed so correctly as it is now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>We hear a great deal in this House about what the Army should cost and what it should not cost. Here is where you can either save money or spend money.  If you are going to curb the management of this establishment so that the heads of that establishment will not be able to save money in the way they think they can save money&mdash;that is by proper accountancy&mdash;I say you are adopting a wrong policy.  It will mean that more money will be required on this Estimate next <Col N="1901" /> year.  When the Budget was introduced it was urged that Army costs should be further reduced.  If you are not going to make it possible for this Department to effect economies by strict accountancy, you cannot get reductions in the cost.  You can disband men and reduce men's wages, but if you do not deal properly with store accountancy and staff accountancy you are not going to cut down your cost. The most important item, perhaps, in this connection, is the inspection of our stores throughout the country. These stores are valued at hundreds of thousands of pounds.  They are taken into account and must be paid for.  If we do not see that these stores are properly looked after, and if we do not send down proper officers to ensure that, we are going to lose a great deal more than the whole of this Vote.</P>
      <P>As far as Deputy Davin's point is concerned, I have no responsibility for the pay of temporary clerks.  It was fixed before my time, and the Deputy knows&mdash;he discussed this matter last year&mdash;that there are three grades, the highest of which receives £3 13s. 6d., and the others according to their grade.</P>

      <P>I have not the exact numbers at the moment, but I will get them for you.  These rates were fixed, not this year or last year, but some three or four years ago, when these men came in first, and they have continued at that rate.  That is for temporary clerks.  They do not get bonus.  Other officers do get bonus, and that is the reason&mdash;the chief reason&mdash;for the £8,000 increase on this Vote.  It is made up principally of cost-of-living bonus, and if there are discrepancies and certain people taken on and certain amounts placed opposite their names, these amounts do not appear in other accounts.  They would appear on votes for officers and so on if they were charged last year to that Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1902" /> While a number of men were disemployed we tried, as far as possible, to see that these men got work in some other Department.  The present strength of the temporary clerical staff is 67.  Since the 1st January, 1925, 14 temporary clerks entered the clerical grades as a result of examination, and there were transferred to other Departments 39.  There were discharged, but referred to a committee with a view to getting them into some other Departments, 33, and there were two resignations. That accounts for the temporary staff that we had to get rid of in our Department.  I may say as far as the Department is concerned, that we were absolutely helpless in the matter.  An examination for officers was held some 10 or 12 months ago.  A certain number of them passed that examination.  They were walking about the streets with no employment whatever, and we had no option but to employ them.  The men whose services were dispensed with were employed on a week-to-week basis, but I succeeded in getting them two weeks' notice, or pay in lieu of notice. These men had no fixity of tenure whatever and it was simply because these other men had passed an examination, and because the Dáil thought they were entitled to some recompense for the sacrifices they had made that they were taken on of course.  As far as some of the work that was done by temporary clerks was concerned, it was of such a nature that we should have civil servants to do it.  It was not possible in the troubled times we passed through to get the required number of trained civil servants to do that work and it had to be undertaken by temporary clerks.  We are trying to get the Department down to a proper footing, and though it may cost a little more money, this is the only way that we can get the Army accounts and everything connected with the Army on a proper basis. Seven or eight thousand pounds may look a lot, but you could lose it in one store in the country at the present time if you had not a proper system of accountancy and a proper system of supervision.  I think, taking the Department as a whole, you are making for further efficiency by the re-organisation that has taken place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BEAMISH</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not object to having the work thoroughly done and fairly paid for, but the Department is evidently dividing itself into two; it is discharging and recharging.  Discharging when it is required is perfectly reasonable, but recharging is finding employment for the discharged. I am very bothered about that.  My mathematics probably are altogether wrong.  We are all willing to grant a reasonable staff, but why, as the Army is diminishing gradually in number, do we require another section to be rising? Water does find its level, I understand. Of course it is a very hard thing that men should have to walk the streets. As our worthy Minister says, they could, if it were necessary, be used most admirably, but where the work is being diminished and the Army is being diminished and the staff increased, the work is being done extremely inefficiently.  I do not mean inefficiently by those few who were carrying on the work, but inefficiently because there was not a sufficient staff. But it looks very peculiar to see a diminution of the Army and an increase of the staff.  Of course it is very awkward to reduce expenditure in an establishment.  I have got a little business, and I know it is a very disagreeable thing to do; but I do not reduce my staff by taking on an additional establishment similar to the one I had before.  If it was public money I might, perhaps, be forced to do it, but being a private concern I would be a bankrupt if I did it.  If you discharge and recharge we do not get the economy we are asking for.  An enormous sum of money is required to raise agriculture up to the standard that has been set for it, very wisely, by the Minister.  If we want to get to this standard, where will we get the money? I do not see how you can get it by discharging and recharging.  It is not a business proposition.</P>

Involuntarily, and without intending it, he has been putting up a false issue to the Dáil.  I say without intending it.  We ought to have some particulars of what these travelling expenses are. We are entitled to them in order to compare them with the travelling expenses for Board of Works staff and other bodies, who have to supervise stores all over the country, and see whether the Army is more extravagant, or less extravagant, in this direction. We ought to have something shown to us.  We have nothing at present.  I am afraid we shall not get it.  It only reinforces my plea for a committee to investigate these matters, a committee of some kind that could sit around a table and go on asking until they get an answer, instead of voting Estimates as we have been doing.</P>

I realise that all the case that could be made has not been made, that there is need for a much more complete accountancy staff than existed up to a year ago.  It has been steadily improving.  We have all recognised that, but this is the difficulty. Up to six months ago every Deputy knew that thousands of accounts had been under consideration. There were disputes, claims, disputes again, and claims again, from all parts of the country.  I think this had been gradually wearing down, and only a few days ago the Minister told us that they had overtaken arrears.  Having got over the difficulty of the outstanding accounts and got into something like working order, regarding pensions and claims for back pay and so on, still we have an increase in the total staff and an increase of £8,000 net in the estimate.  I daresay that a case can be <Col N="1906" /> made quite satisfactorily, but it has not been made, and I think Deputy Bryan Cooper is perfectly justified in claiming that there should be a justification from the Minister for this increased vote.  After all, it must be borne in mind that the Ministry has been insisting in season and out of season on the necessity for economy, and they have a right to justify this increase, which may be economical.</P>

      <P>That is the point, but the Minister has not really made any defence of this increase, except the broad statement that it may be economic. I suggest to the Minister that it is quite desirable that he should explain the position of the respective sections of his Department in respect of what is required for one class of work or another, and that he has not up to this moment justified the increase in the staff or the cost of the staff.  I believe it can be justified, but I would like it to be justified to the Dáil and to the public.  It has not yet been justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say it is rather difficult to expect the Minister to justify it.  You have had three Ministers for Defence within, I suppose, fifteen months.  The first Minister had the responsibility of the establishment of the Ministry of Defence. The second Minister came along and took over that establishment with huge arrears of bills, accounts, and so on, without the reorganisation scheme that has been dealt with lightly by the Minister in his explanation. Somewhere about last July the Finance Officer reported to me that he was sending some of his staff to the country to check stores.  Other than having to answer a number of questions that were put here concerning pay, dependants' allowances, gratuities, pensions claims, compensation claims on behalf of persons injured, compensation claims in other respects, and so on, the present Minister could not have any idea of the difficulty of administration that existed in the department for two, three, or four years.  The arrears of accounts have been cleared off even <Col N="1907" /> though it has taken a fairly long time to do that, but certainly they have been dealt with much more expeditiously since the Army Finance Office was organised on a new basis, and since the period when expert internal administration commanded all the attention of the office.  This particular establishment might not be so large in twelve months' time, as soon as it is properly organised.  I will not, however, promise there will be any reduction.  I have seen the returns and the expenses in the last year, and the figure was something like £48,000 up to the 31st March.  The item for the last month was the heaviest for the whole twelve months.  Taking it on that basis, this particular sum of £60,000 is, I think, justified.</P>

      <P>The President has made what, perhaps, might be called an appeal, that the matter be not pressed too far because of the short period of time the Minister for Defence has been in office.  See exactly where that leads.  Here are certain Estimates, and somebody is responsible for them.  They have been drafted, presumably, in the main, subject to the authority of the Minister for Finance, by the permanent officials of the Department. The Dáil wishes to get at the figures, and surely it is not too much to expect that the Minister, if he is not himself fully conversant with all the details&mdash;I believe he should be, and is, conversant with them&mdash;should in any case be able to communicate to the Dáil some detailed justification of the increase in this item, having regard to the fact that the Army has been decreased. I think the Minister has indicated the lines of a justification&mdash;if I may make bold to interpret his argument&mdash;when he says that if this increase in this particular part of the Vote leads to a greater efficiency in the supervision of the finances of the Army, the result will be an increased saving in the end.  That is an admirable statement, and, as such, it is by way of being towards a justification. That, nevertheless, does not go into a detailed justification of this particular increase&mdash;an increase in one section of <Col N="1908" /> an army that has been so largely decreased. I do not think it is quite sufficient for the President&mdash;I say it with all respect&mdash;to put in the plea that the Minister has been only a short time in office, and, therefore, does not understand, or might not be in a position to answer, all the details.  Having indicated the lines of justification, the Minister might have entered into a defence of the details.</P>

We could pass a Vote on account until we get, as we believe we will get, a correct and charming statement from our present Minister for Defence.  When we get that we can pass the whole Vote, if we so desire. A Vote on account is, I think, a reasonable suggestion.  If our worthy President would set out an Estimate in the quick way in which he always calculates everything, it would be an excellent thing.

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, to put myself in order, I will vote a reduction of £16,292. The Minister may be, as Deputy Beamish says, a charming man; but, so far as I am concerned, he is not a charming man.  He has been blindfolding members of the House with the figures he has given in answer to my question.  Perhaps he did not do so intentionally, but I consider that his reply would lead one to believe he was trying to blindfold Deputies.  He says that the maximum figure for temporary clerks is £3 1s. 6d a week.  If you divide 90 into £16,292, you will find the all-round figure is about £180, which proves that in this Department there are clerks employed at a figure in excess of £3 1s. 6d.  I contend that the Minister is either not thoroughly acquainted with conditions in his own office, or he is declining to give the correct information to the House.  For that reason I think this Vote should be reduced by £16,292.  I believe that clerical workers are entitled to certain payment, and under no circumstances will I agree that the wage, or the salary or, if you like, the pittance of 27s. a week, is sufficient pay for a man doing highly technical and important work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have before me the case of a man employed as a clerk.  He attested as a clerk and his form of attestation entitled him to grade pay.  When his period of enlistment expired, and when he reattested, his papers were also marked for grade pay.  He applied through the ordinary channel for the grade pay which had been stopped <Col N="1910" /> from him and, in answer to his application, this was written to him: &ldquo;Prior to the 7th December last any soldier in the Army who performed certain specified duties, of which clerical labour was one, received additional rates of pay without any limitation as to numbers.  Additional pay is now issued only in cases where the post is clearly shown in the establishment order as being a trade or position to be filled by one of the tradesmen eligible for additional pay.&rdquo;  If, through any fault of the people responsible for drawing up regulations, the position which the individual holds, and the work he is doing, is not clearly defined, it is surely hard on the individual.  He gave good service.  That case points to the unfair and unjust treatment meted out by the Minister, who is nominally, if not actually, responsible for those men employed under him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>He should be entitled to grade pay, according to the admission made by the Army Finance Department. He apparently did not get it because somebody did not read through the regulations issued.  However, he is a civilian so far as the work is concerned.  He is employed on highly technical work, store clerk's work, which, as the Minister unconsciously or consciously admitted previously, is work of a highly important nature.  I contend that 27/- a week is not sufficient for that work.  I want information from the Minister as to how many of the 90 temporary clerks are employed at the figure of over £3 1s. 6d. a week.  How many are paid £5 or £6?  There are other figures which the Minister had in mind, but he did not name them, and I think we are entitled to have them in the same way as we have received figures and information under other sub-heads.  I move a reduction of the Vote because <Col N="1911" /> of the answers given by the Minister. His answers are entirely unsatisfactory, misleading, and not correct. When men are employed on highly technical work of the responsible nature that the Minister himself even has admitted, they should be paid a proper salary, or at least a proper living wage.</P>

      <P>I trust it would not be objectionable or troublesome if I suggested that the Vote would be made the same as it was last year until we get from the Minister the explanations that have been asked for.  I think the feeling is in the air that explanations should be forthcoming.  Why not have £52,000 instead of £60,000?  Then everybody can be paid and, when the satisfactory explanations come along, the figure of £60,000 can be reinstated. I do not think Deputy Davin would object to that suggestion.  In fact, I think he will co-operate with me in regard to having some of the money kept back.  Of course Deputy Johnson might disapprove of it, because there might arise other questions where other reductions might have to be made.  I am only suggesting voting part of this money until the whole matter is cleared up in a more complete fashion.  We could, for instance, leave the Vote as it was last year, and we could put on the additional sum required when the explanations asked for are brought forward.</P>

It is a very healthy sign that Deputies on the Government benches are beginning to speak out their minds on important matters of policy.  We will welcome more of it.  I suggest to the President that this Vote will not be satisfactory from the point of view of Deputies or the country.  A decision on a Vote like this will not be satisfactory.  It would be more satisfactory, as Deputy <Col N="1912" /> Cooper suggests, if the Vote were withdrawn for the present until the Minister would come back to the House with explanations on the different points raised&mdash;explanations that will be acceptable.  That would be a better and a sounder step than to go forward and get a decision now on the Vote. The President himself instanced cases of regular officers who did this work last year.  There ought to be some statistics showing the numbers employed at that work last year who were not civilians.  The attitude that the Minister takes up, that money spent on this department may mean a saving on other departments, ought to be capable of being supported by facts.  Let the Minister give consideration to this question, and come back to the Dáil with facts that will be satisfactory. It would be better tactics than trying to get a decision on a Vote, and leaving Deputies still dissatisfied.</P>

      <P>There is a matter of dispute, apparently.  The person concerned is attached to the workshop and stores section of a certain corps in which no provision is made for the service of clerks.  Apparently this man is doing the work of a clerk, though no provision is made for the service of a clerk.  Therefore, according to the regulations under which the finance officer is acting, this man is not entitled to receive proficiency pay.  But, if proficiency pay is not provided for in a particular department, surely they are not entitled to put a man at work for which proficiency pay ought to be granted.  Some consideration ought to be given to the qualifications of a man who is being paid as a soldier without any proficiency pay, and who is doing work for which proficiency pay should be given.  Apparently the man has hitherto being doing proficiency work, and getting proficiency pay.  Now, because he is working in a department in which there is no provision for proficiency pay, he is not getting it.  The work is continuing as it had been carried on for some time, but by the accident, shall I call it, or the design of the department, no provision was made for proficiency pay in that section.  Therefore, the man is to lose pay for extra special work.  In view of the Minister's promise that he is prepared to look into this case, we might leave it, but it should be made clear that if a soldier is going to be detached from military work and put on special work for which proficiency is required, he should be paid accordingly.</P>

I am not in a position to give the number of temporary men and their grades that Deputy Davin referred to.  I do not think I could be expected to do it.  It has never been done.  I do not believe it is done in any Parliament.  If an <Col N="1914" /> instruction were given that every employee in every department should be mentioned in the Estimates, and his pay and rank given, we would want a large addition to our clerical staff, and instead of this Estimate being for £60,000 it would more likely be for £70,000 or £80,000.  We have the details in the office and if any Deputy gives me notice as to any particulars he may require I will have them for him within fourteen hours.  It is not possible to carry about all the documents that are kept in an office of this kind, or to have the particulars at your fingers' end when questioned. This Estimate is a fair, reasonable and just estimate.</P>
      <P>As to Deputy Beamish's remarks, I wonder when he wants to reduce his expenses in connection with any of his businesses in Cork does he start with the people who keep his accounts.  I think they would be the last he would touch.  I think that he would rather keep that department at its proper strength.  That is what every business man would do.  That is what we are doing, and I say we are justified in doing it.  I trust that whoever presents the Estimates next year will be able to point to the fact that the Estimate has been reduced and that the expenditure is reasonable and is justified.</P>

      <P>Some of the items in sub-head (z) seem to me to be most extraordinary.  There is an item, &ldquo;Disposal of 12 horses at £7 each.&rdquo;  I would like to know how the horses were of equal value, although that value is not very much.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us the kind of work which these horses have been doing.</P>

      <P>I am interested in the revenue from lands.  I take it that it is in part of my constituency, Glen Imaal, that most of this money is earned.  I would like to know how this revenue is estimated.  I have received serious complaints about the condition in which that property of the State is being maintained, especially the trees planted <Col N="1917" /> there, and also in connection with the letting of land.  Perhaps the Minister could give us an idea of the way in which this property is conducted, and whether it is by open tender, or otherwise, that this revenue is collected.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister about the same matter.  I want to get some information in regard to the letting of lands.  Does this apply to the letting of old discused barrack grounds where barracks have been destroyed? Is part of that revenue got from that source?</P>

      <P>I would like to know what the policy of the Minister is in regard to the future disposal of these lands.  Are they let by public auction or is there open bidding?  Has the Minister considered the question of selling these lands to municipal authorities to build houses under the recent Housing Acts?  I know a particular case in my county where there is disused military ground and where the town commissioners are desirous of getting that land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Fethard.  They are very anxious to build houses there. In certain cases I think that such ground might be used for playing fields.  A great many of the small towns lack facilities for fields in which to play football and hurling.  Life is very dull for young people in towns where they have no playing fields, and the young fellows are placed at a disadvantage compared with those in other towns where such fields are available. I would like to know whether these lands are at the disposal of the Ministry or the Board of Public Works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of Army lands is, of course, a very big one.  I speak of them as Army lands because I think they are still under the control of the Ministry of Defence, but there are, as we learn, very considerable areas of land which were handed over by the British authorities, and, so far as we have learned, they <Col N="1918" /> are not being put to the best use.  Some information from the Minister as to the general policy in respect to these lands should be made available.  There is a big estate at Kilworth.  There is the Curragh and one or two other large areas, and there are a number of small areas.  Some time ago I asked a question with regard to the use made of the former remount farm at Lusk.  We learned that the greater portion of it was being let for grazing on the eleven months' system.  While it would be capable of bearing a large number of labourers if properly utilised, it is being grazed, and a couple of men are employed over a large area.  We were told that there was an increase in the area under tillage this year over last year, nevertheless the area under tillage is small.  I think it is time that we had some information from the Ministry as to their intention regarding these lands. Whether that statement of policy is to come from the Minister for Defence I am not sure, but I would like to hear that proper consideration is being given to the question as to how these lands are to be utilised to the best advantage. We are not yet in a position to know the extent of lands under the Army control.  This revenue, £7,423, is, I understand, the regular revenue accruing from certain leases and tenancies which have been made, and it is more or less a fixed sum, but the whole question of the disposal of lands under the control of the Army should be ripe for discussion.  I would like to hear from the Minister whether we are within measurable distance of a declaration of policy in respect of the disposal and utilisation of these Army lands.  I hope it will be promised to us that before any final decision is made as to how these lands are to be disposed of we should have the matter under general discussion in the Dáil, and that we can learn perhaps what the views of the Minister for Agriculture, or of the Minister for Local Government, or of the Minister for Industry and Commerce may be with regard to it.  The question is a big one, and would be worth a very considerable amount of consideration and discussion before any final decision was arrived at.  In <Col N="1919" /> the meantime perhaps the Minister will give us some information as to the present position of Army lands, irrespective of this particular item in the appropriation-in-aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more or less interested in the heading, &ldquo;Sale of Clothing.&rdquo;  I am more interested in that than in the heading, &ldquo;Unserviceable Stores.&rdquo;  There is an item here of 300 motor cars, twenty motor bicycles, and the sale of twelve horses at £7 each.  Deputy Davin has enquired as to this price of £7.  I might also ask what is the reason of these twenty motor bicycles at £20, and the 300 motor cars at £40.  I take it that these are average prices, as much as the cars and bicycles are worth, and I am quite satisfied that £7 is as much as the horses are worth.  If the price of hacks and of agricultural horses was taken into account twelve months ago, which probably was the time that these cast-off horses were dealt with&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they are being dealt with now.  It is an appropriation coming in this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Even at that price I can understand a cast-off horse being sold, and you can buy agricultural horses and hacks, or horses broken down or sold because of old age, at a very small price.  I can understand that being a very fair price for that class of horse; as a matter of fact it will be difficult to find customers for them.  I think that there might be a good deal to be said with regard to the sale of clothing and the method that has been adopted to deal with it.  I am given to understand that all the cast-off clothing of the several Commands was brought to Dublin.  In all the barracks all over the country cast-off clothing has been heaped outside and allowed to rot.  I have seen a considerable amount of it.  It was ricked in the barrack squares, and as far as I can see from the time it was kept there exposed to the weather it was bound to rot.  It may be more valuable in that state than when it is sound.  I do not know.  I am not an expert in these matters, and do not know whether it <Col N="1920" /> is to be used for paper-making or be re-made into clothes.  I understand all this stuff is brought to Dublin, ricked, and allowed to rot, and for the whole country it fetches £500.  I think there is more necessity for an explanation of the small amount of this than of any other item under this sub-head, and I want an explanation of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin is very anxious about the price of these horses. Some of these horses might not fetch fifty shillings; some of them might fetch £50.  I am not in a position to say what they will fetch.  This is a mere estimate of what we think they will bring when sold by public auction, and they will be sold by public auction, and in no other way.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not hunters. If they were, we would put them down at a higher price.  Deputy Wilson wants information about the Glen of Imaal.  The Department have to do with the plantations there, and they have been handed over to them. Wherever there are trees planted we have handed the lands over to the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction, and we have no more to do with them.  I will tell you in a moment the position with regard to these lands.  Deputy Johnson asked a question about Kilworth.  That has been handed over.  This clothing that Deputy Gorey knows so much about is the old clothing collected and sold by competitive tender.  This, again, is not what happened two years ago.  It is the ordinary day-to-day clothing that we expect will realise £500, which will be put to this year's account as an appropriation-in-aid.  We do not know what it will bring.  From the following statements, Deputies will be in a position to judge for themselves the present position of the military lands:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The total area of lands at present under Army Finance Officer's administration is about 26,000 acres, the greater portion of which is mountain land.  The whole of these lands was used by the British for military purposes. The total rent payable is £6,292.  In many cases where lands <Col N="1921" /> were leased, the owners retained the grazing rights.  However, in such cases, the leases in every instance are being surrendered as opportunity offers.  Military lands are set for grazing purpose on the eleven months' system, by public auction, in lots to suit grazing tenants, or let through auctioneers by public tender to the highest bidder.  Such lettings are made subject to military usage. Cattle, sheep and horses are taken on for grazing purposes at an authorised rate per head per week on the following lands:&mdash;Tallaght, Killeagh, Moore Park (Fermoy), Glen Imaal, and Cool-money. The revenue is collectable by trusted herds, who are responsible for the entry and removal of cattle, and their supervision whilst on the lands, and forwarded direct to the Army Finance Officer.  On the Remount Farm, Lusk, a field area of about 10 statute acres has been cultivated and planted this season under a potato crop.  When the crop matures the produce will be utilised for consumption by the troops. Hay is also grown on about eighteen statute acres, and used for feeding of military horses.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the area of the farm?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the area of the whole farm here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it nearly 200 acres?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is less than 100&mdash;it is about 80 or 90 acres.  There are some of our lands that were highly rented.  We took them over and we had to take them under the old leases and conditions under which the British Government held them.  We are very anxious to get rid of a good deal of these lands.  We do not want to have them as a burden on us, and we lose a good deal of time and money in seeing after them generally.  Some of them are held under lease, and until these leases run out or until we get some suitable way of getting rid of them, it is impossible to get them off our hands. We are losing money in many instances by paying these exorbitant rents.  As far as the letting of lands for grazing <Col N="1922" /> is concerned, the lands are let in the ordinary way to the highest bidder, and the whole thing is absolutely above board.  We try to get the most money we possibly can get out of these lands.  Deputy Heffernan wanted to know something about the case of Fethard.  If we have lands and buildings and if we do not require them for military purposes, we hand them over to the Board of Works.  They dispose of them to the Urban Council or to anybody that may wish to use the lands for public utility works.  I do not know if I could lay it down as a public policy that we should hand over lands and plots indiscriminately to make into sports fields.  We generally endeavour to find somebody who will take the lands off our hands and relieve us of the financial responsibility in connection with them.  We have to keep some of them for use as rifle and artillery ranges.</P>
      <P>We do not want three-fourths of the land that we must keep on our hands until we get a suitable opportunity of disposing of it.  For instance, in Tallaght we pay £294 annual rent.  That land pays all right, however.  As receipts for grazing cattle we get £650. I must say that in other places we have to pay a higher amount in rent than the amount we receive for grazing.  As regards the mountain land at Glen Imaal and other places that we have for our artillery ranges, we are negotiating with the Department to take over more than half of the Glen of Imaal for forestry purposes.  These negotiations are taking place at the moment between my Department and the Department of Agriculture and as soon as they are completed we will hand over the lands. We will require some of that land and we are keeping portion of it.  The general policy is to get rid of all the surplus land we have at the earliest possible date.  As I said a moment ago, we must find a suitable time for that. There is a good deal of that land under lease.  We have taken over certain responsibilities and it is a question of getting rid of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDoyle" hpid="Mr. M. DOYLE Mr. M. DOYLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister say that his Department is actually losing money on the lands?  How much <Col N="1923" /> are the losses?  How much is the difference between what he pays for the land and what they are let at?  In regard to the land at Kilworth, I would like to know if these ten acres of potatoes which the Minister mentioned, have been planted by three men.  If that is so, I say these men are doing great work, especially in a season like this.  Had these men the assistance of the military in tilling this land?  I should have been very glad if the Minister for Agriculture were listening to the statements of the Minister relative to these lands.  It would give him an idea of how hard people who hold land all over the country are hit.  Here we have large farms attached to these military stations where they have a good deal of free labour, and other advantages that the ordinary farmer has not.  Still the Minister complains that these lands are a burden on his lands, and that he is doing his very best to get them off his hands.  That should be an instructive lesson to the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three men employed.  If we want extra men we have to employ them, or if we want women to drop the potatoes we employ them.  I think if Deputy Doyle were <Col N="1924" /> asked: &ldquo;How many men do you employ on your farm?&rdquo; he would say: &ldquo;Two, three or four,&rdquo; as the case might be, and if he were asked: &ldquo;Do you employ any more in the harvest?&rdquo; he would say he employed three men normally and more in the harvest if he required them.</P>

      <P>Do I understand the Minister to say that he is anxious to get rid of the State lands?  Under Article 11 he would be infringing the Constitution if he were to make away with them.  He would have to place an agreement on the Table of the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from the Minister's statement of policy with regard to those lands that it is the intention of the Commissioners of Public Lands to dispose of those lands to the highest bidder and to get the best price.  As far as large holdings are <Col N="1925" /> concerned, such as the large training grounds in Kilworth and other places which are available, I do not see any objection, but I think the process of free sale with regard to the small quantity of land attached to the old barracks which have been described ought hardly be resorted to without consulting the Dáil, for the reason that if those lands are put up for sale the local people who want them for the purpose I specified will always be outbid. I think the Minister and the Executive Council should consider whether some preference should not be given to local town commissioners or societies.  I think some opportunity should be given to the people of the towns to develop those playing fields, and if even on the sale there were a small loss to the Ministry the good which would result would be altogether in excess of it.  Although Ireland is a country in which land is plenty, in town after town you find that there are no playing fields or parks available for the people.  Young fellows have to go into a farmer's field. They are hunted out and they go into another farmer's field.  I think it is well worth the Minister's while to consider whether he could not help some of the towns by handing over those fields, possibly at a less price, to some body such as the town commissioners or whatever body is in charge.  If the present policy is pursued, before we know where we are all those lands will be gone.  The good which would result from the handing over of those lands in the way I mentioned would be altogether in excess of any possible loss which might accrue to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard the Minister's explanation about old clothing, that it was going to be put up for auction.  I suggest that this old clothing should be disposed of in the different towns where it happens to be found.  It would save expense, and would give an opportunity to the local people, who have as much claim as Dublin has to it, to procure this material that might be very useful to the inhabitants.  I believe it used to be the custom to sell it in one heap, and that the Jews are the people who get <Col N="1926" /> hold of it.  It is said that one big Jew, who has been identified with army matters for some years, gets it.  His name has been mentioned freely as the man who derives all the benefit with regard to this class of thing and some other classes of things.  We have someone else to cater for in this country besides Jews.  I suggest this clothing should be sold at the different Army depôts down the country, where it accumulates, and that it should not be brought up here and sold in one big heap to a big Jew.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little interest in Jews like Sayers &amp; Co., who have been identified with the Army for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not interested in Sayers and Co.  I am interested only in getting the best prices possible for the material that we have to dispose of.  I have been heckled all day and told I am not giving information. Now, when I try to get the best possible value for this material I am also heckled.  There is no case put up for starting auctions or taking tenders for old clothing in every little post where there are 25 or 100 men.  I am interested only in getting the highest price, whether the tender be from a Jew or a Gentile.  I do not believe that better prices would be procured if Deputy Gorey's suggestion were adopted. As to the point raised by Deputy Heffernan, when lands pass out of the possession of the Army authorities, or when they have no further use for them, their disposition, according to the leases, rests with the Office of Public Works.  I do not know if Deputy Heffernan was serious when he suggested that such lands all over the country should be handed over for playing pitches.  My own opinion is that the land should be disposed of to the best advantage.  If there are persons in the vicinity of towns where there are such lands, and if they put up a reasonable proposition to the authorities, I am sure it will be considered.  I do not <Col N="1927" /> think it would be good policy to lay down that preference for lands which were attached to barracks should be given to people who want it for such purposes.  I think the lands should go into the market, and those who want it for public purposes can then make their case to the Office of Public Works, who will consider the question of giving them a preference, or of leasing or renting the lands to them.  As far as my Department is concerned, when the lands are handed over we will have no more to do with them.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that the Minister and myself are of one mind as to the sale of old clothing.  His ambition is to get the best price for it.  That is also my ambition.  I suggest that the proper way to get the most money for the clothing is not to sell it in bulk, so that only two or three men can buy it. The secret of shop-keeping in this country is to buy in the greatest bulk and sell at the cheapest price.  Those who can do that make the most money. If the Minister accepts my suggestion he will get most money by selling in small lots wherever the clothing has accumulated through the country.</P>

      <P>We pay the soldiers who are shoemakers proficiency pay. A soldier has an allowance for his clothes and equipment.  He gets the work done, and it is charged up in the ordinary way by the workman, who is paid by the Army authorities.  If the soldier gets any repairs done outside what is allowed by Regimental Orders he has to pay for them.  During the year we estimate that we will get £1,000 from such work.  We may get £800 or £1,200, but we estimate for £1,000.  The money goes to the general Army funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to make a statement dealing briefly with the principal items that come under the authority of my Department.  I hope by doing so that I may anticipate some questions. It is not an easy matter to do so, but it may shorten discussion, and it may be helpful to Deputies later on if they have certain facts on the official records. I would also like to mention that this Department is fairly comprehensive, and that the number of matters that come under my jurisdiction are very far away from my supervision. I have only knowledge of them at second or third hand, and, although they are legitimate topics for discussion, it would be very difficult for me to give any detailed information on them.  To be able to do so I would require to have the head of every section of my Department and every inspector here.  Even then a great many matters would not be answered at first hand.  To begin with, the total Estimate for the present year shows a decreases of £275,453 compared with the previous year.  That is mainly accounted for by a decrease in the Vote for housing.  These Estimates were prepared at the end of last year, and at that time we did not see clearly what provision would be made this year for housing.  Since then a new Housing Act has passed through the Oireachtas, and it will be necessary to have a Supplementary Vote for it later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am dealing with housing it may be well to give a brief statement of the position with regard to it in the Free State at present.  The principal statutes in relation to housing in An Saorstát are&mdash;The Housing (Building Facilities) Acts; the Housing of the Working Classes (Ireland) Acts; and the Labourers (Ireland) Acts.  The Housing (Building Facilities) Act, 1924, with which we are all familiar, became law on the 21st of April of that year.  It enabled the payment of grants out of State funds of from £50 to £100 to private persons erecting three, four, or five-roomed houses between the floor area limits of 520 and 1,000 <Col N="1930" /> square feet.  The grants for houses erected in rural areas were slightly less than those for urban areas.  The Act also provided for the payment of grants of two-thirds of these amounts for the reconstruction of existing houses in urban and suburban areas. This Act expires on the 21st February, 1926, but can be extended to certain cases up to 21st June, 1926.  The total amount made available for grants under the Act from State funds was £300,000, apportioned as follows: £250,000 for new houses, and £50,000 for reconstruction.  Local authorities (county councils, county borough councils, urban district councils and town commissioners) were authorised to supplement the State assistance afforded under the Act in the following ways:&mdash;(a) By a further free grant; or (b) by a loan; or (c) by the grant or lease of a site; or (d) by carrying out development works.  The sale prices and rents of houses provided under the Act were restricted up to the 26th June, 1926.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, local authorities did not to any great extent exercise their powers to supplement the State assistance.  Urban authorities, with the exception of Dublin, Waterford, Clonmel, Thurles and Ennis, did not formulate schemes for supplemental assistance.  Most of the county councils granted loans to builders, but two county councils gave reduced cash grants.  To the 22nd of last month proposals have been approved for the erection of 3,178 new houses and for the reconstruction of 113 houses.  Of the new houses 565 (232 in Dublin) are in municipal areas, and 2,613 are in the rural districts.  In respect of these houses £269,605 has been earmarked for new houses and £5,333 for reconstruction. It will be seen that a balance of £25,062 remains unallocated, but this balance will be consumed when the applications at present before the Department are dealt with.  Many of the approved houses are completed or nearing completion, and it is anticipated that the proposals approved to date will materialise almost to the full during the ensuing building season.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the Labourers (Ireland) Act, I find that under the <Col N="1931" /> Labourers (Ireland) Act fourteen local authorities are completing schemes providing about 300 houses.  It is anticipated that the effects of the grants now available under the Housing Act, 1925, will lead to a considerable amount of rural building activities.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing under the Working Classes Act, work under these Acts has been mainly confined to completion of schemes undertaken by the local authorities under the Government scheme of 1922, whereby £1,000,000 was made available for the erection of houses by urban authorities.  Approximately 2,100 houses have been provided or will be completed within the early portion of the financial year.</P>
    <P>During the past financial year only one important contract was entered into by a local authority under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1919.  This was by the Dublin Borough Commissioners in June last for 197 houses at £550 per house, this being the second Marino scheme.  A contract for the first section of the Marino scheme was taken twelve months previously for 590 houses.  During the past few weeks a contract has been entered into for 200 houses at £530 per house.  Generally speaking, competitive tenders show that contract prices are decreasing, but it would not be accurate to suggest that the cost of the principal building materials has fallen to any appreciable extent.  Imported goods show a substantial decrease in price, and would account for the reduction, but building materials and bricks still remain at a prohibitive figure.  As regards the present building outlook, I would say that fresh inquiries with a view to providing houses are received by my Department at the rate of about 50 per day, and it would seem that the 1925 Act is likely to be taken up as favourably as its predecessor.  The Dublin Commissioners have taken contracts for 550 houses this month, and are inviting tenders for various schemes containing a further 700 houses.</P>
    <P>Smaller urban authorities are also proceeding; they are: Waterford, Ardee, Drogheda, Tuam, Ennis, and Killarney. While we are not yet in actual <Col N="1932" /> official touch with the proposals, we know that large firms are endeavouring to get their employees to form public utility societies for the purpose of providing houses under the 1925 Act.  I do not think at the moment that it is necessary to go any further into the housing question.</P>
    <P>Coming to the individual sub-heads of the Vote, it will be found that under sub-head (a) there is a decrease of £7,285, and a reduction of 17 in the number of the staff.  Vacancies which occurred in the permanent clerical staff have, for the time being, been filled by temporary clerks.  The reduction has been mainly brought about by the transfer of the temporary staff, formerly on loan, to the Soldiers' and Sailors' department for the administration of the Act relating to the provision of cottages for British ex-service men. This service is now under the control of a Land Trust, and the temporary staff have been taken over by the trust, and will be provided for out of the trust funds.  While the temporary staff were on loan their remuneration was recouped in full by the British Treasury.</P>
    <P>One general inspector retired under the Treaty during the year and one lady general inspector resigned on marriage.  Neither of the vacancies has been filled.  Two temporary engineering inspectors were employed for the Road Department, and two of the temporary housing inspectors who were on loan to the Soldiers' and Sailors' Department have been taken over by the Land Trust.</P>
    <P>The Vote for the present year contains provisions for 13 members of the permanent staff on loan to the other departments, including 7 members on loan to the Sailors' and Soldiers' Department, whose salaries are being recouped in full by the Land Trust.  One member is attached temporarily to the General Register Office, one is attached to the Department of Justice, one to the General Nursing Council, one to the Board of Works, one senior Auditor to the Exchequer and Audit Department, one general Inspector to the Department of Defence.  The cost of the staff on loan is approximately £6,500.  Of the inspectorial staff, seven have been appointed to discharge the <Col N="1933" /> duties of local authorities that have been dissolved&mdash;that is four to the Dublin Corporation and Dublin Union; one to the Kerry Council and Board of Health, and the County Cork Boards of Health; one to Offaly County and Board of Health, and one to the Tipperary Urban District.</P>
    <P>Coming to sub-head (b), travelling expenses, etc., of inspectors, the actual travelling expenses are recouped, and subsistence allowance is provided in accordance with the scale in the Estimates. Last year's estimate was £11,200.  The actual expenditure was £9,431.  Sub-head (bb) is for expenses in connection with the International Congress.  This was for attending the International Congress in connection with roads and tuberculosis, and the International Union in connection with tuberculosis, which are both very commendable objects.</P>
    <P>Sub-heads (c and d) are for salaries of auditors and for travelling, etc., of auditors.  There is a decrease of £4,000 in the Estimates and a reduction of five in number.  Three resigned under the Treaty, one was transferred to the Exchequer and Audit Department, and one temporary auditor resigned.  None of the vacancies has been filled. Travelling expenses and subsistence allowance is given as in the case of inspectors. At the present time the audit generally throughout the country is rather in arrear owing to the disturbed conditions of the recent past.  We expect as a result of the Local Government Bill and the doing away with the rural district councils that we will be able to catch up with the arrears of audit in the near future, and that we will then be able to keep well up with our work.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E is the amount provided to meet any unforeseen claims that may arise in respect of the period prior to 1922.  Any proceedings involving legal costs are now conducted through the Chief State Solicitor's Department.</P>
    <P>Sub-head (f).&mdash;These are normal expenses incidental to the holding of public inquiries in connection of local authorities for loans.  When an inspector is directed to hold a local inquiry due notice has to be given in the <Col N="1934" /> Press for two consecutive weeks. These notices are inserted by my Department. In important inquiries a shorthand writer is engaged to furnish a verbatim report of the evidence. The costs are recovered from local bodies except in cases of inquiries connected with the Poor Law.</P>
    <P>Sub-head (g).&mdash;This deals with the Dublin Vaccine Institution.  In 1876 it was arranged that the Dublin Vaccine Institution should become a Government office under the control of the Local Government for the purpose of gratuitously distributing lymph to the authorities of workhouses and dispensaries in Ireland.  Under this arrangement the then existing officers of the institution became subordinate to the Local Government Board, but did not become Government officers as regards title to pension, etc.  An arrangement exists whereby the requisite quantities of glycerinated calf lymph would be obtained under contract from time to time as required by the National Vaccine Institute at Sandymount.</P>
    <P>Incidental expenses.&mdash;For these £200 is for office travelling.  It is necessary at times to send an indoor officer to the country to consult with local officers upon special duties&mdash;for example, work connected with registration and making arrangements for dealing with matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>Miscellaneous minor services.&mdash;These represent the cost of advertisements, daily papers, Local Government publications, petty office expenses, expenses of messages, and tram fares, when urgent delivery of letters is required. Often times it is necessary in these urgent cases to send despatches by hand.</P>
    <P>Telegrams and Telephones.&mdash;These represent the amount payable to the General Post Office in respect of the cost of telegrams and telephone installation. We had all that last year.  It is often necessary in my department to send a wire where in the ordinary case a letter might do.  Sometimes a very urgent matter comes up before a local authority, and it is necessary for us to have an answer to the questioi sent down to them before the body <Col N="1935" /> meets, and in that way expenses in telegrams are incurred that in the ordinary case would not arise.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to go into sub-heads (i) and (j) at the present moment.  These are in respect of annuities payable by rural district councils for advances under the Labourers Act.</P>
    <P>Maternity and child welfare schemes may be provided in accordance with the Notification of Birth (Extension) Act, 1915.  The State Grant was not made available until 1916.  The grant is largely distributed among voluntary agencies.  Briefly, the scope of the grant covers expenditure on the following services for expectant and nursing mothers, and children under five years of age; health visiting by trained nurses; home-nursing services, including midwifery and medical aid; home help during the confinement period; hospital and lying-in accommodation where necessary; creches and day nurseries, and the supply of milk and food in necessitous cases.</P>
    <P>The National Grant defrays fifty per cent. of the net cost of approved services. The principal undertaking assisted is the provision of health visitors, that is to say, trained nurses, who get in touch with expectant and nursing mothers, and children under five years of age, and give advice as to maternal health, and as to the care and management of young children.  The primary object of health-visiting is preventive, so as to forestall the development of conditions of ill-health. The work is carried on by whole-time officers in the larger centres of population, and elsewhere the services of district nurses have been utilised on part-time conditions.  About 130 nurses in all are so engaged.  Twenty-four local authorities and ninety-three voluntary agencies participate in the grant. The grouping of the voluntary agencies is as follows:&mdash;Health visiting, 71; centres, etc., 5; institutions, 7; boarding-out agencies, 6; food provision, 4. It is satisfactory to note that the downward movement of infant mortality is maintained.  The rate in the Irish Free State for 1923 is the lowest <Col N="1936" /> on record.  The general infant mortality for 1924 was as follows:&mdash; Whole country, 71 per 1,000 births; urban districts, 102 per 1,000 births; rural districts, 55 per 1,000 births.  It was, therefore, somewhat higher than in 1923 (66), but 10 per thousand under preceding 10 years' average.  It is, of course, realised that much remains to be accomplished.  In rural districts nearly two-thirds of the total infant mortality takes place in the first three months, a condition which would doubtless be remedied by a more efficient midwifery service.  It is hoped that the proposals for a reform of the public health services will be of material service in this direction.  I have here a long list dealing with the different child welfare agencies that are recouped under the grant, but I think it would not be necessary to go into them here.</P>

      <P>No.  The cost of this service in regard to the treatment of venereal disease is showing an upward movement with the development of the existing schemes, and the increasing numbers seeking treatment thereunder. The number of out-patients' attendances at the treatment centres for venereal disease increased from 22,230 in the year 1922-23, to 25,292 in 1923-4, and the number of in-patient days from 6,783 in 1922-3 to 7,022 in 1923-4.  The number of new patients dealt with at the treatment centres shows an advance of 212 for the year ended 31st March, 1924, as compared with the preceding year.  The total cost of approved arrangements during the year 1923-24 was £8,913 18s. 6d., of which 75 per cent., or £6,685 8s. 11d was refunded to local authorities from the State Grant, <Col N="1937" /> leaving only £2,228 9s. 7d. to be met from the rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The measures for the treatment of venereal diseases adopted in Great Britain following upon the findings of the Royal Commission on venereal diseases were extended to Ireland in 1917.  Section 148 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, enables regulations to be made from time to time by the central authority with a view to the treatment of persons affected with epidemic, endemic or infectious diseases and preventing the spread of such diseases, and in pursuance of that power regulations were made in 1917 respecting the provisions to be made by sanitary authorities of the county boroughs for the treatment and prevention of venereal diseases.</P>
      <P>County councils not being sanitary authorities within the meaning of the Public Health Acts, an Act was passed in 1917 amending Section 148 of the Public Health Act of 1878, so that with the previous assent of the county council that section shall have effect accordingly as if a county council were an authority within the meaning of the section.  It was difficult in many cases to get the prior assent of the county council.  The provision, on the side of administration, was incomplete in so far as county councils had no medical superintendent officer of health, as in county boroughs.  Under the recent Act each county will in future have its own medical officer of health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are five approved schemes in operation&mdash;Dublin County Borough and Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Monaghan counties.  The curative system comprises treatment centres attached to Dr. Steevens' Hospital and Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, respectively, and consisting in each case of an outpatient clinic, with a certain number of beds for intern patients.  Patients are treated irrespective of means or place of residence.  Agreements were made by the Dublin Corporation and the <Col N="1938" /> Dublin County Council with the authorities of Dr. Steevens' Hospital and of Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital respectively, under which the Corporation and the county council undertook to pay the cost of the respective treatment centres in so far as such cost was not covered by agreements with other local authorities.  Arrangements were also made for the carrying out of Wassermann and other bacteriological tests by the pathological laboratories at Trinity College, University College, and the Royal College of Surgeons, Dublin, in connection with venereal discase patients attending the treatment centres, or under the care of any medical practitioners in the areas of the contracting local authorities.  Salvarsan preparations were to be supplied free to such of these medical practitioners as could furnish evidence of experience in the administration of these remedies.  Kildare, Wicklow, and Monaghan County Councils have also similar agreements with Dr. Steevens' Hospital.  Negotiations are proceeding for setting up a treatment centre in Cork.</P>
    <P>Under the Education (Provision of Meals) (Ireland) Act, 1914, an urban district council is empowered to make arrangements for the provision of meals for children attending national schools.  If there are any such children in its area who are unable, by reason of lack of food, to take full advantage of the education provided for them and there are no other funds available to defray the cost of the provision of the necessary food, the council might be authorised under Section 3 of the Act to expend from the rates such sum as would meet the cost of such food not exceeding an expenditure equivalent to the produce of a rate of one halfpenny in the pound, on the district.  The amending Act of 1916 doubled this maximum, and the limitation was entirely removed by the Act of 1917, which also made a Government grant available for recoupment to councils of an amount not exceeding one-half of the sums expended by them from the rates for the provision of food as above mentioned, subject to regulations made for the purpose of securing that the arrangements <Col N="1939" /> for the provision of such food are adequate and are carried out efficiently.</P>
    <P>Where a county borough or urban district council contributes towards the provision of school meals, the arrangements are usually administered by a committee composed of representatives of the council, the managers of the schools and other persons interested in the work.  The circumstances of the children are investigated and the necessitous cases authorised to receive the meals.  The arrangements for supplying the meals are generally of a simple character. Where there is no central dining hall available to accommodate the children from the different schools in the area. suitable apartments in the school buildings or the school rooms themselves are utilised.  The time selected for serving the food is usually the play-hour. The meals vary in character according to facilities provided; consisting in some places of soups or stews, in others of bread and butter or jam, with milk or cocoa.  Recoupment from the grant is confined to half the actual expenditure from the rates for the provision of food for the meals.</P>
    <P>In three county boroughs and twenty-three urban districts, the councils have been authorised to incur expenditure from the rates for the provision of school meals for children attending national schools.  Such expenditure was, however, incurred during the year ended 31st March, 1924, in only two county boroughs&mdash;Dublin and Cork&mdash;and in 13 urban districts. The urban authorities in the Saorstát have been repeatedly reminded of their powers as regards the provision of school meals, but during the past year schemes were adopted only in two districts&mdash;Clonmel and Rathmines.  The general views in other urban districts were, that there was no necessity for such arrangements or that the children were already sufficiently provided for by voluntary agencies.  During the year 1923-24, 11,576 school children approximately were fed, of whom 5,696 were dealt with in Dublin county borough, and it is estimated that 1,595,517 meals were supplied.  The <Col N="1940" /> total cost of the schemes for that year was £12,760 11s. 2d., and the amount disbursed from the grant thereon was £5,300 19s. 6d.</P>
    <P>On the Estimates last year, I think the question was raised about bringing in other schools, such as the Christian Brothers' schools.  They can only be brought in by legislation, and it is hoped to introduce an amending Bill later on.</P>
    <P>With regard to Sub-head O&mdash;medical treatment, etc., of school children &mdash;the administration of this service is governed by the Public Health (Medical Treatment of Children) (Ireland) Act, 1919.  It is designed to carry the system of health supervision through the school-going period up to the age when the boy or girl comes within the provisions of the National Health Insurance. The Act places an explicit obligation on local authorities to adopt suitable measures for the purpose. Under the statutory regulations a scheme may provide for encouraging and assisting the establishment or continuance of voluntary agencies.</P>
    <P>Five such schemes have been assisted from the grant pending action by the local authority.  Progress is being made with the municipal schemes in Cork and Clonmel; the medical officer in the first-mentioned area has reported the results of her preliminary survey, and the Commissioner is now in a position to decide as to future developments.  It is understood that a scheme for Dublin county borough has been drafted for the consideration of the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>As regards the administrative counties, the appointment of county medical officers of health will provide machinery for instituting the arrangements for school medical inspection, but as the amended system of public health administration will not come into force until the 1st October next, when the new officers will have to familiarise themselves with the general problems of the position and primarily with the prevention and control of epidemic diseases, it is not expected that more than initial steps towards introducing measures in the interests of the health of school children can be undertaken before the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1941" /> The first step towards effecting the public health reforms under the Local Government Act, 1925, which were outlined by me when the Bill was before the Dáil, will be the appointment of county medical officers of health. These appointments cannot be made until October.  It is recognised that the success of county health administration must largely depend on securing the services of good officers for these positions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the welfare of the blind, there was some discussion on this subject last year.  I am desirous of doing everything possible to promote the welfare of the blind.  Under the recent Act the new boards of health are specially charged with the arrangements for dealing with the various classes of necessitous blind, whether by the provision of education and training in suitable cases, or by affording outdoor relief or maintenance in homes to the unemployed blind.  Their duties in this respect are co-ordinated with their general public health functions, and I am hopeful that there will be a wider and more sympathetic interest taken in the welfare of this class of the community in future.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to state the actual number of blind persons in the country at present, but I understand it is somewhere between three and four thousand.  The number of persons in receipt of blind pensions in December, 1924, was returned as 2,878.  The problem is a comparatively small one and the financing of the arrangements of local bodies should not prove very costly.</P>
    <P>A generous scheme of assistance for blind persons has been approved for Dublin county borough, and was inaugurated on 1st ultimo.  Blind persons are admitted to the register on a certificate from a recognised ophthalmic surgeon or specialist.  In addition to provision for the education, training, employment and maintenance of suitable blind persons in the existing schools, workshops and homes for the blind, the wages of blind workers employed in those workshops and living in their own homes, are being augmented on the following scale:&mdash;<Col N="1942" /> A flat rate per person per week of 7s. 8d.; weekly allowance for wife, 5s.; weekly allowance for first child, 3s. 6d.; weekly allowance for each additional child, 2s. 6d.</P>
    <P>As regards monetary assistance to necessitous blind in their own homes, this will be given so as to provide weekly incomes to&mdash;Single or widowed persons over 15 and under 50 years of age living with relatives or friends, 12s. 6d.; single or widowed persons over 15 and under 50 years of age living alone or in lodgings, 14s.; single or widowed persons 50 years of age and upwards, 7s. (with blind pension); married man under 50 years of age with wife, 19s.; married man 50 years of age and upwards with wife, 12s. (with blind pension); addition to weekly income for first child, 3s. 6d.; addition to weekly income for each additional child, 2s. 6d.  Persons under the age of 15 years will be regarded as children.</P>
    <P>These allowances will not be payable to persons who continue to act as mendicants.  The scheme has been adopted for a year and will be subject to review at the end of that period, having regard to the experience gained in its operation.  The estimated cost is £5,500.  Two hundred and thirty blind persons are at present on the register, but further cases are under consideration.</P>

      <P>I take it that that is a scheme for the Dublin Commissioners, and that it is applicable only to the Dublin area.  I presume that the Minister would have no objection to having a scheme of a similar nature put into operation in another area.</P>

      <P>The number of blind persons is, as I have stated, relatively small.  The number would be about 3,000, and it might be difficult for a local authority to initiate a scheme for a very small number of persons.  It is better to have the larger institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to tuberculosis, I think most Deputies are familiar with the working of the various Acts.  Approved tuberculosis schemes are being administered by the councils in twenty-two counties and two county boroughs (Dublin and Waterford), whilst partial <Col N="1943" /> schemes dealing only with insured persons and their dependents are carried out by the insurance committees in Meath and Wicklow counties. Tuberculosis schemes have not been adopted in Cork, Longford, and Roscommon counties or in Cork and Limerick county boroughs.</P>
    <P>The natural development of the schemes is responsible for an increase in the estimated expenditure for the coming financial year, the returns furnished indicating a recoupment from the national tuberculosis grant of £40,000.  The coming into operation of the provisions of the Local Government Bill, 1924, applying compulsory notification of tuberculosis to all districts in the Saorstát, and transferring the functions of county tuberculosis committees to boards of health is difficult to gauge, but will doubtless result in substantially larger numbers of patients being brought under treatment.</P>
    <P>During the past year, a new sanatorium and hospital for advanced cases, with thirty-five beds, has been opened at Renmore, Galway.  The institution is already full and its further extension is under consideration.  Arrangements are made by local authorities for the provision of suitable treatment for uninsured men discharged from the National Army suffering from tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>The total number of patients dealt with under approved tuberculosis schemes during the year 1923-24 was 9,013, composed of 2,392 insured and 6,621 uninsured persons, and the amount issued from the grant as recoupment in respect of the cost of their treatment was £31,000 approximately.</P>
    <P>Mortality from tuberculosis has decreased considerably in recent years. The death rate from the disease in Ireland per 1,000 of the population had gradually declined from 2.9 in 1904 to 2.07 in 1914, but during the Great War, from 1915 to 1918, it rose to 2.2.  In 1919 it dropped to 1.94, and the reduction has continued through 1920 (1.70) and 1921 (1.57), while the figure for the Irish Free State for 1922 was 1.46, and for 1923, 1.41.  The rate for 1923 shows a reduction of 36 per cent. as <Col N="1944" /> compared with the rate (2.2) for 1911, when the legislation in connection with tuberculosis schemes first came into operation.</P>
    <P>I think that covers pretty generally the principal items of the Department. No doubt there will be some discussion on roads and on medical services generally, but I do not think it would be possible for me at this stage to anticipate what questions may be asked on these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in the detailed statement he has made, omitted to refer to a matter which concerns a large number of people in this country at the present time.  He made reference to it, however, on several occasions in places outside this House.  The matter I refer to is the road policy of the Minister's Department.  I have read speeches which the Minister is alleged to have made at branch meetings of the Government Party organisation in his own constituency, as well as one which he made recently at a convention of delegates of that organisation held in the Mansion House, Dublin.  I fail to see why the Minister would not indicate to the House here, first for preference, his policy in regard to an important matter of that kind, rather than to make statements outside the House which cannot be relied upon, so far as any records are concerned.  The position with regard to road repair and road maintenance particularly, has been a rather serious one during the past couple of years, at least in some counties, and in one or two of the counties in the constituency that I represent.  We have had from the Government, through the Railways Act, an indication of its policy so far as the railways are concerned, but we have yet to learn what the Government intend doing on the question of canals. On the occasions that I made inquiries in regard to this matter, I was informed that the failure to come to a decision on the recommendations of the Canal Commission was due to the delay that has taken place on the part of the Government in coming to a decision in the matter of its road policy.  It is <Col N="1945" /> obvious to Deputies and to the ratepayers of the country who have to bear the present high charges, that the latter cannot continue to bear the present heavy burden inflicted upon them by reason of the damage done to the roads by the traffic of heavy motor lorries.</P>
      <P>In Leix County, and this is a good example, the estimate for road maintenance last year was reduced from £45,000 to £28,000.  The reduction was authorised either by inference or in fact by the Minister for Local Government. He must know quite well as a result of the reports of his own officials that that amount was not sufficient to carry on the ordinary work of road maintenance.  This year the county surveyor's estimate was submitted for £48,000, and that was reduced to £25,000.  I do not know whether it has yet received the sanction of the Minister, but he takes a very serious view of increasing the estimate of last year beyond the figure of £28,000.  The fact is the roads are in a very much worse condition than they were twelve months ago, and the Minister is now faced with sanctioning £3,000 less for the maintenance of those roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have every sympathy with the local ratepayers in protesting, and strongly protesting, against these high charges, which are only made possible by the heavy traffic that has developed inside the last couple of years in regard to motor transport, for which the ratepayers are called upon to pay.  The Government has laid it down definitely in the Railways Act that they are not prepared to subsidise the railways. That is one section, and a very important section of our transport system. But the Minister for Local Government and his colleagues, whether authorised or otherwise, in the recent miniature General Election, made the statement from public platforms in this country that large sums were to be spent on construction, reconstruction and repair and maintenance of roads.  The Minister for Local Government said as recently as September, 1923, in a speech outside the House, that the sum of £1,560,000 had been actually spent in that particular way.  Now, the Government is actually faced with this position. <Col N="1946" /> I put them this question  berately, and I say it concerns both the railway companies and the workers concerned, and the ratepayers of the country: are they going to subsidise one form of transport against another form of transport?  That is the position they are faced with, and have been considering for a long time, far too long, and that is the question I would like the Minister to deal with here when speaking on this estimate. To show how serious the position is in Leix, and I think it is equally serious in Offaly, I may say we have 750 miles of roads being repaired, or supposed to be worked, by 35 men, 10 of whom are overseers.  I think the Minister will agree that it is impossible to carry on the work of ordinary road maintenance for over 750 miles of road with 35 men, 10 of whom are not actual workers themselves.  The cause of that is, as the Minister knows, owing to the reduction of the estimate.  The estimate was reduced by 50 per cent.  The men became unemployed, and that is the reason why 35 men are doing to-day what 150 or 175 did a couple of years ago.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister speaking some time ago to a deputation which approached him on this matter.  He was very guarded in his reply, and, perhaps, rightly so.  But the Minister must face the fact and come to a decision.  If he has already come to a decision, as one would be led to believe by statements made by him outside, I think he should make his decision known to the House.  I realise that a decision on the matter may be bound up with the question of raising the necessary money, and, perhaps, with an alteration in the existing method of taxation in regard to motor lorries and motor vehicles generally. The Minister for Finance, apparently, had that question in mind when he said that it might be necessary at a later stage&mdash;probably before the end of the present year&mdash;to introduce a Finance No. 2 Bill.  I take it that what he had in mind was the likelihood of an alteration being made in the present method of taxation of motor lorries.  I believe Deputy Gorey had some inside information in regard to the views of the <Col N="1947" /> Government on this matter, because I read a statement he made on the subject, when speaking on behalf of a candidate in the recent Cavan election, and I also read a leading article in the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; following that remarkable declaration, the substance of which none of us was aware of until Deputy Gorey made the statement.</P>
    <P>The position seems to be this: the Roads Advisory Board have been considering this matter.  Any ordinary Deputy could gather from the speeches of the Minister and from the leakage of information on the part of Deputy Gorey, to which I have referred, that some decision must have been come to by the Roads Advisory Board.  That decision must have been come to before the recent Cavan election and before the Minister made his statements outside the House.  The Minister must, therefore, have his mind made up on whatever recommendations he has received from the Roads Advisory Board.  If that is so, let us have some light thrown on the subject here.  If the Minister has not yet been able to persuade the Minister for Finance to find the necessary money to carry out those great schemes of which he has been dreaming, then, perhaps, the Deputies here, if acquainted with the position, will help him to force the Minister for Finance to come to what ever decision is necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go any further into the matter but, on an Estimate dealing with the Local Government Department, it would not be proper to let pass the burning question of how the roads are to be constructed and maintained and repaired in the future.  If the county councils, which have reduced the Estimates in the cases I have referred to to the amounts to which I have referred, are not compelled by the Minister to pass the County Surveyor's estimate, as submitted, then the Minister is faced with the task of finding the money that will be necessary.  I approach the consideration of this question from the point of view of what is the Government's policy in regard to transport in general.  If I were satisfied that the mind of the Government <Col N="1948" /> was running in the direction of nationalisation of all means of transport&mdash;whether railways, canals or roads &mdash;I would be satisfied that the necessary money should be raised under the present methods.  But I am not prepared to agree to the policy of the Government to collect, by present methods of taxation, for the benefit of the motor people of this country, who abuse the roads to the extent the Minister knows, public money and use it to subsidise one form of transport against another.  The whole question is bound up with the Government's general policy of transport.  I think the Minister should put at the disposal of the House what information he has on the subject.  He should tell the House whether he has received the recommendations of the Roads Advisory Board, and if he has, whether he has come to any decision on them.  If not, he should tell the House on what grounds he made the statements he has been making outside this House in regard to the money which he proposes to use for the making of trunk roads and the maintenance and repair of other roads in the Saorstát.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir JAMES CRAIG Sir JAMES CRAIG">
      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in the past a pretty severe critic of the cost of administration of this Department. When we come to the details of the various sub-heads, I may still have some criticism to offer but I want to say, generally, that the Ministry have made a very determined effort to reduce the cost of administration.  I have the figures for two years ago&mdash; 1923-24&mdash;and the figures for the present year.  I find that so far as salaries, wages and allowances are concerned, there is a reduction of £14,200.  That is a very different proposition from what was presented to us two years ago.  When we come to item (B) (travelling, etc., of inspectors) there is a reduction from £13,000 to £10,500&mdash; a saving in the two years of £2,500. The Minister, I think, will remember the criticism that I offered on one occasion. I said he had so many officials with so little work to do, travelling about the country, that it would be better for him to pay their salaries and allow them to stay at home so as to <Col N="1949" /> save expenses of travelling.  There is, however, a considerable reduction in this item during the past two years. When we come to the salaries of auditors, I find that there is a corresponding reduction&mdash;£9,000 from the estimate of the year before last.  I find also that the travelling expenses of the auditors have been reduced by £1,500.  There was a reduction of £700 last year and this year there is a reduction of £800.  In the cost of inquiries, there is a reduction of £1,500 as compared with two years ago.  In the estimate presented to us, there is a total reduction in the cost of administration, as compared with two years ago, of £28,700.  I think that is extremely satisfactory on the whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other side of the picture, there is a certain amount of increase but not anything like the increase that we will press for.  I hope, when we come to deal with the various sub-heads.  So far as child welfare is concerned, there is an upward move from £10,000 to £14,385. Provision for treatment of venereal disease has jumped from £4,500 to £7,500.  That amount, I expect, will continue to increase.  I may say now, as I may not have the opportunity of saying it later, that the amount of money expended in this way has been very wisely and very usefully expended and that there is a tremendous improvement in regard to venereal disease.  In respect of grants under the Provision of Meals Act, I am sorry to say the increase from two years ago is only from £5,000 to £6,000.  As most of the Deputies who have been here for some time know, I have put forward a claim, from time to time, that every child attending a national school should receive some sort of meal during the day.  It is quite impossible for a child who is badly fed and early fed to keep up its attention during the day.  There is a great wastage, so far as education is concerned, in trying to teach children who are hungry.  I am sorry that this item has not increased to a much greater extent and that more grants have not been applied for.  We cannot criticise at present the medical treatment of school children because, as the Minister has said, we have not yet got into working order as regards our <Col N="1950" /> County Medical Officers of Health, who will be really responsible for this work, With regard to the welfare of the blind, strange to say, this item was brought down last year from £8,400 to £7,500 and the same sum is estimated this year.  With regard to the treatment of tuberculosis, the sum went up from £35,000 two years ago to £38,000 last year, and £43,000 this year.  I wish to offer my sincere congratulations to the Minister for Public Health on the wonderful change which has taken place in regard to the death rate from tuberculosis.  It is extraordinary that from the year 1904, the death rate from tuberculosis has gone down from 2.9 to about 1.4.</P>
    <P>Without entering into criticism, in detail, of the various sections, I do think the Ministry have made a determined effort&mdash;it may not have been as successful as many of us would like&mdash; to reduce the administrative cost of this Department.  They have made a fair attempt to meet the criticisms that were formerly offered, and I am sorry that in many ways there is not a much larger bill to foot with regard to the public health, or what I may call the utility portion, of the expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Davin, I am very anxious to hear what the road policy of the Ministry of Local Government is. This is a problem which is engaging the attention of various associations and societies at the present time.  We are now in the month of May.  The weather has not been very good, but, at the same time, I think it has been sufficiently good to permit of work being done on the roads.  Most of the councils in the country are awaiting a declaration by the Minister as to what his road policy is to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the arguments put forward by Deputy Davin.  I do not think there is any analogy at all between the railway position and the road position.  The railways are owned by private people; the roads are the State highways.  It is the function of the Local Government Department and of the Local Government authorities throughout the country to look after the roads and to subsidise <Col N="1951" /> their maintenance if necessary in the interests of the people of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Who owns the motor lorries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>The owners of the motor lorries pay a certain amount of money each year, and that money is utilised for the upkeep of the roads. There is no analogy between the road position and railway position.  I am as well aware as Deputy Davin that there is undue usage of the roads by heavy motor traffic, and I think that until a great many of the roads are put into a proper state of repair the tonnage of lorries should be limited.  The attention of the Local Government Department has been directed to that side of the problem, and I think it should treat it with the seriousness which it merits.  The Local Government Department ought to give more money for roads than they have been giving in the past.  The amount of money they are giving is not sufficient to do a good job on the roads.  The roads, even up to the present, have been only patched in haphazard way. There is not sufficient money for local authorities to enable them to deal with the roads as they should be dealt with.  This is a problem that will have to be faced sooner or later, and the sooner the better, because the roads are certainly deteriorating.  Local authorities will require a greater amount of money in the future owing to the delay in declaration of policy and to delay in provision of money by the Local Government Department to enable the local authorities to put these roads in the condition in which they should be put.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I think that the sooner it is recognised that the only way to solve this problem&mdash;so far as trunk roads are concerned&mdash;is to adopt the system of concrete roads, the better. It is dearer than the ordinary steam-rolled or bitumen surface, but in the end it will cost less.  The upkeep will be considerably less and the roads will, in the end, pay for themselves; that is, so far as the trunk roads are concerned. If we are going to cater for <Col N="1952" /> the motor traffic which is increasing in weight and quantity every day, if it is to be catered for as we hope and expect it will be, there is nothing for the trunk roads but a concrete surface, and the sooner the Minister realises that the better.  It may be a bit dearer, but it will eventually pay for itself. Like Deputy Davin, I have seen statements made by the Minister and other Ministers to the effect that a certain amount of money was available, but, so far, we are in the dark, and councils in the Saorstát are in the dark, as to what is to be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin referred to certain counties that have not reduced their estimates.  I deprecate that as much as Deputy Davin.  Of course, we realise that it is necessary to reduce estimates, because the people are not able to pay.  There is no question about that.  We fight against it as much as we can, but the position is there all the time.  It is the same in my own county and urban area as in other parts of the Saorstát.  However desirous we are of doing certain work, it is impossible to find the money for it. There is no use in striking a rate when the people are not able to bear it.  Then again, there is no use in criticising councils.  If the rates are too high, people will probably make representations to the Minister, and perhaps the rate may be made invalid altogether. I hope the Minister will declare his policy so far as the roads are concerned. With Deputy Sir James Craig, I would like to congratulate the Minister.  I think there is a big improvement in this Department for the past twelve months.  The functions are very varied.  To my mind, it is the most complicated Department in the Government, and I know it is not easy for it to get into its stride.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about free meals for school children, and he again referred to the fact that it is not legal, though he did not actually use those words, for pupils in Christian Brothers' schools to be supplied with meals.  I would ask the Minister seriously to consider this question.  It simply means that a poor person is kept away from the Christian Brothers' schools, where <Col N="1953" /> he would get a better kind of education than in the national schools.  If the child is poor he has to go to the national school, because he will get a meal there.  Though it is not legal at the moment for local committees to supply meals to children at Christian Brothers' schools, I would ask the Minister favourably to consider the matter and make some arrangement so that the auditor would not surcharge the council in whose area this thing would be done.  I know, and I am sure the Minister does too, that there are committees exercising their functions in this connection and granting meals to pupils at Christian Brothers' schools. I hope that this time twelve months, when we are considering this estimate again, the Minister will not make the same statement that he made to-day and that he made on the last occasion when we were considering the Estimates. The Christian Brothers deserve a great deal from this country, and their pupils deserve much also. The same treatment should be meted out to them as to pupils in national schools.</P>
    <P>There is another question I would like to refer to.  I think the Minister ought to interfere in the question of technical education.  At the moment, technical education is under the Department of Education.  The people who administer the funds of a Technical Committee are under the control of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Recently the Department of Technical Education initiated joint schemes in the various counties and amalgamated various Technical Committees and some local Committees.  Take the case of Wexford, for instance.  The secretary and principal of the Wexford school has been compelled to go out on pension, and the Wexford Corporation have been informed that they are to be responsible for his pension.  That will mulct the ratepayers to the extent of 4d. in the £.  Along with that, they will be responsible for two-thirds of the salary of the new principal and secretary, who will be secretary for the whole county scheme.  We consider that is unfair.  The scheme was initiated by the Department of Technical <Col N="1954" /> Instruction, and the pension of the man they compelled to go out, who is still active, should be charged upon the funds of the general scheme.  Has the Minister's Department been consulted about this?  So far as I know, the Corporation of Wexford and the Committee have power to levy a rate of 1d. or 2d. in the £ for technical instruction, and we would be going beyond the powers conferred on us by Act of Parliament if we were to levy a higher rate.  The Wexford Corporation have refused to strike the rate, because they believe the ratepayers would be too heavily muleted.  I would ask the Minister to intervene.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  As one who has, perhaps, initiated the controversy over the road tax and heavy motor traffic, I do not want to say very much at this stage.  On previous votes I have said a good deal already under this head.  The result has been that the Roads Advisory Board, I believe with the direction, or under the authority, of some friend of mine in the Department, have appointed a sub-committee to consider and report on this question.  We know they met and took evidence, and that for some time they did not meet.  We do not know if they have reported to the Roads Advisory Board.  We have no idea of the nature of the report or how, if it was handed in, it was dealt with by the Roads Advisory Board or the Minister's Department. We are waiting for the report and for a declaration of policy by the Minister.  The matter has not been raised in the country, because people are waiting on the report.  The country has been advised to remain quiet until the report and the Minister's declaration of policy are issued.  There is no indication, however, that people in the country have abandoned thought on this question.  They have their minds pretty well made up on the matter.  The Minister has asked for time, and has mentioned that a new Bill would be necessary.  We have given him considerable time; we are <Col N="1956" /> prepared to give him more time; but the day is fast approaching when the declaration of policy must come.  The sooner the Minister gives us that the better.  We will postpone any annoyance that we may cause, provided he is going to deal with this question, and we will give him reasonable time to declare his policy.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of it as much, perhaps, as Deputy Davin is aware of it.  A certain matter occurred here before the Cavan election, but that has been thrashed out, and I do not propose to go back on it.  That has been brought to a point, and I do not propose to take it out of the place where it was left.  I do not know if it would be right to refer now to the question of whether there should be a tax on petrol or on horse-power. Perhaps it would be better defer that until we have the question up in proper form.  Reference has been made to the damage that motor vehicles do to roads, and Deputy Corish has said that they pay something towards that.  Of course they pay something, but it is nothing in comparison to the damage they do.  You might as well give us a crumb where we expect a loaf.  The damage done can scarcely be calculated on the class of roads that we have in the country; the macadamised roads. The damage cannot be calculated.  The country cannot continue to subsidise the present system.  Something else has to be done.  Whether it is State money or local money is to come to the rescue in making the roads, I maintain the present system must be changed. Deputy Corish has mentioned concrete. I am sure the Minister's advisers have been studying this thing very closely, and are prepared to tell us the result of their deliberations as to whether a concrete or some other surface would be best to withstand the present fast, heavy traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the present system of road-making and maintenance is not able to withstand that traffic.  The public are anxious to <Col N="1957" /> know what is the policy of the Minister in the matter.  If the public are silent at present on the matter, that is not an indication that they have ceased to think about it.</P>
    <P>Another important question that arises with regard to the roads is to what extent the main arteries of the country are to be made a State charge. That is a question that the new county councils will be up against.  It is one of the planks in the platforms of all the candidates at the forthcoming elections.  All of them are anxious to know where they are and what they are up against.  There can be no doubt as to what the Farmers' Party think about this.</P>

      <P>I am not going to enter into a controversy now.  The Minister has not yet declared his policy and until he has it would not be right to discuss the matter.  Several Deputies have spoken with appreciation of the work that has been done by the Department of Local Government.  I have not come very closely into contact with the Department, but I know what has been done and I know the criticism the Department has been subjected to for dissolving certain public bodies.  I have always supported the policy of the Department in that matter, and the results to my mind have proved that the action of the Department was justified.  The courage of the Minister in regard to this matter is worthy of commendation.  We hear less criticism now of his action. I think this Department has done very good work.  It is, perhaps, one of the best Departments we have.  If the Minister is not prepared to declare his policy with regard to the motor tax now we will not press him, but we expect a declaration of policy from him in the near future, and we want to see the promised Bill brought in very soon.</P>

      <P>The speech of Deputy Gorey has tempted me to make some remarks, because I think that if we stop at the stage at which he <Col N="1958" /> stopped we would make a very big mistake.  I agree with the Deputy that heavy motor traffic pays a proportion which is altogether out of comparison with the damage it does to the roads. I agree with him that this is probably not the time to consider how any attempt should be made to readjust that proportion.</P>
      <P>I agree with him that the conclusion to be drawn from the amount of damage they do as compared with the damage done by others is that there is something wrong with the system. But I do not agree in the conclusion that he draws from that, that there is merely something wrong with the method of construction of the roads. That is wrong, I believe, but I say that even with an improved method of construction, even with concrete roads, leaving the rest of the traffic as it is, we will still be faced with almost the same problem you have at present&mdash; that the heavy traffic will damage those roads in a proportion that is altogether out of comparison with the amount contributed, if other conditions remain the same.</P>
      <P>The Minister, I think, would make a mistake if he merely considered that point and did not go further.  The problem is somewhat deeper.  If you allow very heavy traffic to be carried on wheels that are of the kind now permitted, that traffic will continue to damage the roads to an extent for which it practically cannot pay.  The error, I think, arises very largely from this&mdash;that heavy motors are allowed to carry heavy traffic on a small section wheel.  That means that there is extraordinary pressure brought to bear on the roads.  No matter what you make the roads of, if you permit heavy loads to be spread over a small area you will still have a practically ruinous destruction of the roads going on. I rise simply to ask the Minister when he is considering this problem to have it considered seriously from the point of view of requiring an increase in the sectional area of the wheel that is going to carry heavy traffic&mdash;to a certain extent that may mean proportionate to the load the lorry is going to carry&mdash;otherwise the problem will remain unsolved.</P>

      <P>For the same reason I do not want to enlarge too much on the question of the roads, but this is apparently the only opportunity I shall have of expressing the feelings of my constituents with regard to the existing state of affairs. There is no doubt that the present system cannot be continued, and that the ratepayers cannot continue to maintain the roads at the present cost, even as they are maintained at present with the help received from the Government. As Deputy Davin has said, the ratepayers are subsidising the owners of the heavy lorries at the expense of the railways.  The traffic which naturally should fall to the railways&mdash;particularly the short-haul traffic&mdash;is now falling on the roads and being carried by heavy motor lorries carrying loads up to six tons and paying a tax which is not at all in proportion to the amount of damage they do.</P>
      <P>I do not quite agree with Deputy Thrift that the damage caused by the motor lorries is due to the narrowness of the tyres.  My experience is that the large flat tyres used by lorries has the effect of sucking up the surface of the road.  You will find little holes due to the suction of these heavy wheels passing over the macadamised roads. I know a road that was steam-rolled in the old days&mdash;one of the first roads steam-rolled in my county.  Under the ordinary iron-shod traffic, that road held in a nearly perfect condition for about eight years.  That road was steam-rolled last year and is now showing great defects.  It is beginning to show pot-holes and a good deal of repairing has been done on it since. The conclusion I come to is, that either these motor lorries will have to be made pay a tax which will in some way compensate for the maintenance of the roads, or, still better, that a law should be passed making it a penal offence to run motor lorries of any weight, say, exceeding three tons, on those roads.  That was proposed during the passage of the Local Government Bill, but the proposition was defeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1960" /> The present state of affairs is unsatisfactory and it is not being met. We have had no indication of the policy of the Minister in regard to it, but something must be done.  It is evident that with such a large mileage of roads the present attempt which is being made to maintain them up to a high standard cannot be continued.  Even if the upkeep of the trunk and main roads is made a State charge, if the large motor lorries are still allowed to travel on the roads the expenditure would be more than the State could bear.</P>
    <P>There is only one item I should like to refer to under sub-head (A).  It is the only increase of any importance that I can see.  That is the salary of the Private Secretary to the Minister, which has been increased from £1,000 to £1,200.  I should like to know if that is a normal increase due to a scale, or a special increase.  I have no information as to the ability or qualification of the Private Secretary.  I am sure he is an excellent official, but I would suggest that in present conditions increases of salary of that amount can hardly be recommended.  I should like to know why such an increase is being granted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. J. CONLAN Mr. J. CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by a member of the Kildare County Council that during the past financial year, £100,000 has been spent on the upkeep of the roads in that medium-sized county.  Of course, a considerable percentage of that sum came from State sources, but the portion that had to be borne by the ratepayers has placed an almost intolerable burden on them.  In Kildare we are in the unfortunate position of having to bear most of the heavy traffic that goes outside our borders, both for the west and south, with the result that this enormous expenditure has to be borne.  Whilst, as I say, 80 per cent. of the sum spent is spent upon two or three main or trunk roads, the sub-main roads, not to talk about the byroads, are in many cases in a very neglected condition.  The upkeep of the main roads for the heavy lorry traffic absorbs the greater portion of the total outlay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is patent that the present system of macadamised steam-rolled and <Col N="1961" /> tarred roads is absolutely out of date. I was speaking lately to an engineer who has had considerable experience in supervision of road maintenance and repair.  I asked him what term of life he would give to a road repaired under the present system&mdash; would it be about twelve months?  He said six months would be nearer to the mark.  That is true.  I know of my own personal knowledge that roads have to be repaired which were steam-rolled and tarred certainly not twelve months ago.  With regard to the suggestion that concrete should be used, I would like to know how that would suit horse-drawn traffic, as there is still a considerable amount of that traffic, despite the revolution created by the motor car and tramcar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask Deputy Heffernan one question. If he observed a small hole in the surface of a road and wanted to make it bigger, would he choose a mallet or a pickaxe?  It is true that there are other points to be considered beyond the one I have mentioned, but I was pointing out the one which, in my opinion, required the most serious consideration by those responsible for road upkeep.  If you get a small hole in a road and a thin wheel with a big load strikes it, it knocks a big chunk out of the side of the hole, but if there was a large surface wheel with the same load it would pass over the hole and do little damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very technical matter to put to me, because it is really a question for a surveyor and it is one which I could not answer. I think that the analogy suggested by Deputy Thrift is hardly correct.  If you get a pickaxe instead of a mallet to enlarge a small hole in a road it does not prove that a narrow tyre will do more harm than a large one.  My opinion is that the large tyre has a peculiar suction effect and when the vehicle has passed you will notice a disintegrating effect on the surface of the road.  I maintain that it has the same effect, whether it is the wheel or the weight which causes the steam-rolled road to be loosened.  I think if the speed of vehicles were lessened it <Col N="1962" /> would reduce the damage to roads.  I think that the Minister has power to regulate the speed of motor vehicles.</P>

      <P>When the Local Government Bill was going through, I was going to put down an amendment to regulate the speed, size, weight and carrying capacity of motor lorries, but I was informed that the law as it existed gave the Minister power to regulate all these matters.  Beyond doubt, apart from the fact that the weight of lorries does very considerable damage, the owners of lorries are not satisfied with merely making use of the roads, but they drive their vehicles at a terrific speed.  That, undoubtedly, increases the weight of a lorry considerably.  Has the Minister considered, or is any effort being made to consider, the importance of applying the law in regard to the speed of lorries?  Until such a time as legislation makes new regulations, the Minister ought to try and protect the roads so far as possible.  I would like to know what steps the Ministry has taken, either through the Gárda Síochána or otherwise, to put the law into effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesMulvany" hpid="Mr. MULVANY Mr. MULVANY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MULVANY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a question in regard to steam lorries.  In County Meath there are a number of them travelling every day.  Each lorry carries about six tons, with a five-ton load behind on a trailer. I never could learn what the owners of these are contributing to the upkeep of the roads, or what they are paying in the shape of taxation.  In Trim, the capital of Meath, there is a trader who has one of these lorries on the road from Trim to Dublin six days of the week.  That road is like the headland of a ploughed field, and is not like a road intended to carry ordinary traffic.  So far as the ordinary motor lorry traffic is concerned, I suppose it pays a heavy tax, but I would like to know for my own information, and for the information of my constituents, what these people who drive steam lorries through the country are paying.  I say that these steam lorries are more detrimental to the roads than motor lorries.  I have my own opinion as to the damage done by motor lorries <Col N="1963" /> and other mechanically-propelled vehicles.  I am a fairly close observer as to the way these things happen. Of course, doctors differ and patients die, but my opinion is that it is these highly-geared vehicles, driven at a speed of fifty or sixty miles an hour, which are more responsible than anything else for the pot-holes in the roads.  Many of these highly-priced, highly-geared, and highly-graded vehicles are paying less taxes than unfortunate farmers or business men who drive around the country in &ldquo;tin-lizzies.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been asked by every speaker so far to declare the policy of the Government, if possible, but certainly that of his Department, in respect to roads.  It has been generally admitted, I think, by everyone who has had anything to say on the question that very big works are required to be done on the roads.  Apparently the problem is, what class of work is to be done, that is to say, what kind of construction is to be applied.  I want to support the general contention, but I want also to draw special attention to the importance of the matter from the point of view of unemployment in the country.  If it is admitted, as it has been admitted by Deputies in all parts of the House and by Ministers on other occasions, that there has to be a great deal of money spent on the roads for reconstruction as well as for repair, now is the time that any definite policy that has been decided on should be put into operation when you have large numbers of men waiting for employment at useful constructive work. It was stated by engineers, and I think it has been generally admitted, that there is probably no form of public work which is capable of absorbing usefully a larger number of labourers than road reconstruction.  I want to press that view on the Ministry, that it is essential, if there is any decision come to, that the work should be put into operation at the earliest possible date with a view to employing men who are waiting for employment, and, if no decision has yet been come to, <Col N="1964" /> that some speed will be given to the consideration of that matter and that an early decision will be arrived at. I have been reading in the newspapers of rival claims of different districts respecting a proposed new trunk road, as though it had been decided that there would be a new trunk road between Dublin and the South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not yet heard anything officially about that, whether any decision so far has been come to or not, though I have heard of deputations from counties to the Minister.  As Deputy Davin pointed out, there have been speeches in the country regarding the policy of the Government on road reconstruction and repair, and we ought to know what has been decided, and how soon the new policy, if a new policy has been decided on, is to be put into operation. I do not want to suggest, even now or at any time, that you must employ men for the sake of employment, that you must pay men wages for doing useless work.  I think that is bad policy, but here you have absolutely essential work that will be of value to the country, both immediately and permanently, and you have a large number of men waiting for that employment.  You have a definite proposal from the motor users in respect to the method of financing a road policy.  You have demands from councils all over the country that the decision of the Government should be made known, and that some work of this kind should be started immediately.  I want to press for some definite statement of policy in regard to all these things.  We do not want to discuss the finances of this matter on this Vote, as to begin with, it would be out of order, and secondly, it is not for the Minister to answer.  He is, however, responsible for the general supervision of work on road construction and reconstruction, and he is advised by road engineers, and he has the Roads Advisory Board, which has been considering the question for a long time, to advise him.  I want to support the demand of those who ask for a clear statement of policy in respect to roads, and to press on the Minister the necessity of putting into operation whatever policy he has of giving employment to some of those <Col N="1965" /> 50,000 men who are waiting and clamouring for employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>A Deputy has referred to the speed of motor lorries.  That was one of the matters submitted by the Road Board to the Committee. Evidence was given upon it.  I, myself, gave evidence, and a report is being framed.  That is the reason that I did not deal with the speed of cars or with the question of tyres, which was also dealt with by most of the witnesses.  I agreed that most wheels, even cart wheels, should be widened.  I agreed that even a cart wheel should be widened by between three-quarters of an inch and an inch.  The reason we did not deal with that question is because it is one of the subjects of that report.  That report, however, has not yet come to hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the question of the quality of the tar used on the surface of the roads.  I want to know how and where that material is procured, and if the Minister's advisers are satisfied with regard to its quality and the results it is giving.  I have seen a good deal of this stuff put out, and whether it is due to the weather, though I am convinced it is not, it has been very little better than water.  I have also seen tar barrels laid close together along miles of road in Kildare and Kilkenny and afterwards they have all been collected and taken away; the tar had been removed and was not spread.  Perhaps I should have gone further and made inquiries as to the reason for that, but I took it that it was because it was not good, and what I saw of it that was spread did not give good results at all.  There is a very important question in connection with this matter.  This material that I saw gave me the impression that we were experimenting, that we were actually beginning where other countries commenced years ago, in the direction of experimenting.  Certainly, if the material that I saw on the roads from Dublin to Kildare, into my own county, and in other places is a sample of what the Minister's advisers have thought well to do, the matter is in a very early experimental stage.  I suggest to the Minister that if we are to develop we <Col N="1966" /> ought not to begin by experiments; we cannot afford experiments.  We would naturally have to experiment if other countries around us were only in the experimental stage, but they have gone very much further than that; they have been experimenting for years, and I suggest that it would be a much cheaper and a surer method for us to find out the results of experiments elsewhere. They have been experimenting in America, on the Continent, and in England, and I think it would be very well spent money to send some of the heads of the Department on a tour to see results elsewhere, the results given by the different materials employed, and the cost, so that we could see what could be done here.  Modern road-making has gone very much further than the experimental stage; it is at that point that we should commence, and not at the very early stages.  I have seen material used on roads that was very inferior and that could not give good results, even when spread in good weather.  That has certainly occurred in Kildare.  I think that the quality of the tar must be so very poor that it could not be used anywhere else and could only be used by people in the experimental stage who did not know much about it.  I do suggest that the Minister would be well advised to send the men in charge of road construction to other countries to find out the results of experiments regarding cheaper and better methods of road making.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke previously I had in mind a few matters that I thought could be dealt with under other sub-heads, but in looking over them I find that this is the only sub-head under which they can be discussed. One thing I would like to refer to is what I consider to be the undue interference of the Ministry with the question of workers' wages.  I have in mind one particular case in the County Wexford, a barber employed in the County Home.  The position was advertised in 1922, I think, at £2 5s. 0d. per week.  The Ministry at that time sanctioned the appointment, but three or four months ago they sent down a letter to the County Board of Health making it mandatory upon that body to reduce that man's wages to thirty <Col N="1967" /> shillings a week.  I do not think that the Ministry ought to interfere to that extent.  The position is that that man has 190 patients to shave each week; he may have to cut the hair of a great many of that 190 in the week, and I do not think that £2 5s. 0d. is an unreasonable wage for that man.  The County Board of Health are unanimous in rejecting the Minister's proposal. They have made representations three or four times in connection with the matter, but the Ministry still maintain that unreasonable attitude.</P>
      <P>Another matter to which I would like to refer is this&mdash;during the progress of the Local Government Act through the Dáil, the party on this side of the House, my colleagues and I, made various attempts to get the Minister to adopt a pension scheme for workers employed by local authorities. I would ask the Minister again, as we are discussing his policy under sub-head (A), if he will soon introduce a Bill which will enable local bodies to provide pensions for working men.  At present there are many bodies who have old men working for them.  They have been working for them for perhaps forty or fifty years, and I do not think that anybody would expect them to throw these unfortunate men on the side of the road after giving faithful service for such long periods.  The men themselves are prepared to contribute to a pension scheme; that fact has been repeatedly made known to the Minister, and I do think he ought to consider the advisability of bringing in such a Bill at once.  There are many public bodies who employ old men; the men are not as useful to them as they were ten or twenty years ago, but still they do not want to throw them to one side. I would ask the Minister to consider the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the point made by Deputy Gorey about tar on roads, to my mind tar is not the proper thing at all to make a suitable road surface. I think that the Minister should stipulate that the various councils should use &ldquo;Mexfelt&rdquo; or &ldquo;Spray Mex,&rdquo; which I consider are the only proper solutions to make a good road.  Tar <Col N="1968" /> is not sufficiently strong to bind the macadam on the road.  I would also like to appeal, as Deputy Johnson did, for a consideration of the road policy of the Minister, and to ask him to make his policy known soon.  As Deputy Johnson said, there are, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, 52,000 unemployed, and they could be put at the useful work of road-making.  They are asking for work.  As we have often said, we do not advocate the dole system as such; we believe that men should be given suitable employment.  Here is a problem facing the country, the problem of road-making, and we believe that money should be put up by the Government for that purpose, and to give these men much-needed employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish has reminded me of another point.  He complained that the Minister interfered unduly with wages.  If the Minister interfered unduly with the wages of workers, directly or indirectly under the Minister's Department, I am afraid that he does not trouble to interfere sufficiently to see that a good return is got for the wages paid.  On this question of road construction we cannot dismiss from our minds the fact that one reason why our roads are not maintained at a better standard is because we do not get as good value for the money spent on them as we would like.  One thing that strikes me as very peculiar in this matter, with regard to the rate of wages paid and the output expected for the wages, is the unfair discrimination against a contractor as compared with men employed under a direct labour scheme. A contractor contracts to do certain work; the county surveyor comes along after a certain period, and if the work is not done to his satisfaction the contractor will be paid a certain proportion of the price for which he tendered to do the work; that is, he is paid in accordance with the work he does.  Take it the other way and you will see that men engaged on direct labour on the roads are paid any way, and there is no doubt whatever, it is very generally accepted that while we get some batches of men <Col N="1969" /> under some gangers and assistant surveyors who give a very good return for the money, taking it in general, there is nothing like a satisfactory return in labour for the amount of money spent.  If there is anything depressing at present, from the point of view of the Ministry, or from the point of view of the county councils, I would say that it is the fact that men on the roads do not seem to be conscious, or do not seem to be sufficiently concerned, about giving a good day's work.</P>
      <P>If you like, they prefer to continue and drag the work on, with the result that it costs £1,000 to do certain work that might have been done for £600 or £750.  County councils cannot afford, and are not prepared to give men work or to continue work, while it is generally conceded that they are not working as hard as they might.  We know that very often there are contractors who are in a position to do the work, but these road-workers come in in a body to the meetings at which the contracts are to be given, and as a result, the contractors will not be given the work.  The contractor might be prepared to do the same work at a lesser amount.  I suggest to the Minister that until the time comes when bodies of men who are employed under the direct labour schemes are prepared to come together and contract to do a certain specified amount of work for a certain amount of money, you cannot expect a satisfactory return.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish may not agree, but I say if the Minister wishes to intervene as to wages, the Minister has also a right to intervene to see that when men are paid a certain amount for doing certain work, that work should be done.  I am inclined to the view that a sufficient amount of work is not being done for the money that is spent, and until the Minister can make regulations in this respect, and until he is prepared to strike out on a bold policy with regard to this matter, we will not have our roads properly maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that I wish to call attention to, but whether it is a matter for the Ministry or the county councils, I am not quite clear.  We have along our roads hundreds of tons <Col N="1970" /> of stuff piled, in some places for an eighth of a mile.  In some places it is difficult to pass; certainly, two vehicles cannot pass at a time.  It does not seem to be clear whose responsibility it is to prevent anything like that.  At any rate, these conditions exist, and it is extraordinary that we do not have more accidents as a result of them. Whether it is that we have not proper supervision in the country or that we have not better general supervision from the central authority, I do not know.  Something will have to be done in regard to the first point I raised about direct labour methods.</P>

      <P>I did not say give them to the farmers.  Give them to the worker, the man who is prepared to work, but if you are paying good wages, see that he does his work.  I would ask any Deputy, is it going to be an inducement and an encouragement for a man to spend money when he finds that for the money he is spending he is not getting a good return? Any man who thinks that is making a mistake.  If you want a man to spend money you have got to show him that he is going to get good service for that money.  When a man gets good service it is an encouragement to him to spend more money.  I believe that it is only when the men who are working on the roads come together and contract to do a certain amount of work for a certain amount of money, that you will get a good return.  You have to get men to come together to compete, to say what they are going to do the work for, whether they are batches of men on direct labour, or small farmers.  I think that is the only way the problem can be dealt with.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy Baxter has succeeded in killing the contract system on the roads.  He pointed out that if the county surveyor finds the road half done he will pay the contractor half the money.  The people have to travel over these roads that are half done, in danger of being <Col N="1971" /> thrown out of their carts, motors, or other vehicles.  That means, to my mind, a complete slaughter of the contract system.  I disagree with him in regard to his statement about the men engaged on direct labour.  All of them I saw in my district are giving a good return.</P>

      <P>All of them&mdash;the big bulk of them.  I would advise the Government to make the roads immediately that they propose to make under the big trunk road scheme for two reasons.  One of them is that they are badly needed.  I would suggest that they should get the most modern and the most scientific material on the road, not, as Deputy Gorey said, to be experimenting, but to find out the best stuff that is being applied in other countries.  They can then apply it to our roads at home.  The other point that I wish to make is that the work should start immediately in order to relieve the unemployment that exists throughout the country and to relieve starvation also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points that have been touched upon by Deputies that I wish to refer to briefly.  In the first instance, Deputy Davin has brought on the question of motor lorries.  To my mind, it looks as if he spoke in the interests of the railway company, though he seemed rather to suggest that the Government were subsidising the lorries on the roads at perhaps the expense of the railway company.  It is not for us to subsidise motor lorries or railway companies. It is for us to find for the ratepayers of the country, in all instances, the cheapest means of bringing their produce to the various markets by the railway station or seaport, as the case may be.  I dealt with this matter when it was brought before us on the last occasion.  I dealt with the value of motor lorries to the country. I pointed out to the Dáil that where eggs were being brought with the butter on motor lorries direct to the boats from the country, they were able to reach the boat on the night of the day on which they were sent.  If they <Col N="1972" /> were sent by rail they would have to be held over until the next day.  I am aware of the harm that has been done by lorries to the country roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested then and I suggest now that the speed of those lorries is a probable cause of the trouble.  I refered to the fact on that occasion that it was not a loaded lorry that did the harm. It was the half-empty lorry or the empty lorry returning at an undue speed and getting into potholes and tearing away roads that were only newly patched.  If the Minister's Department would see that a speed limit would be imposed on these lorries the injury and the loss they are causing by the destruction of roads would cease.  I have discussed the matter with the owners of the lorries.  I always find it is better in matters of this kind to get the opinion of those who have reason to know, because the thing is costing them a good deal of money, or the opinion of people like engineers who are there to consider such matters. The owners of those lorries tell me that the life of the lorries is cut in half by the undue speed at which they are driven home by the employees.  I maintain it is within the power of the Government to have governors put on those lorries to ensure that they will not go beyond a certain speed.  The Civic Guard cannot hold them up.  There are roads where the Civic Guards cannot hold them up.  The only way to control them is by a speed regulation laid down by the Minister.  Deputy Gorey has referred to the material used in parts of Kildare and Kilkenny.  I know that there are certain roads in certain counties where the material used has been satisfactory and right.  I in no way deny the accuracy of Deputy Gorey's statement, but I say the Government should have more inspectors who would be more in touch with the work done in the country.  You have an inspector, Mr. Quigley, but he is not capable of performing all that work.  County Councillors and T.D's. are to blame. They usually know that such things arise and they have not a sufficient sense of civic duty to see that what is being done is wrong.  I do not think it is fair to lay the responsibility on Deputy Gorey or any other Deputy to <Col N="1973" /> bring the matter before the Minister. I maintain that the moment a report comes in from a county councillor or a ratepayer, or even a T.D., that something is wrong, that the Local Government Department should send down someone to see that the county surveyor is doing his work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Even a T.D.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Even a T.D., if the work is thrown on a T.D. to do it.  It should not be thrown on him to do it. The Local Government Department should enquire into the way the ratepayers' money is being squandered. Deputy Baxter referred to that from another point of view.  A good deal of this matter need not be brought up by Deputies in this House, but if it is, I hope the Local Government Department will be pressed to look into cases where the ratepayers' money is being squandered.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made by Deputy Baxter to the contract and direct labour system.  Certain roads in the country do not lend themselves to direct labour.  You must have contract. In some parts you have roads through hilly districts with only three or four small farmers living there. Road workers live two or three miles away.  These may be small sections of roads, of perhaps not more than half a mile.  I think in roads of that kind it is cheaper to give them to small farmers than to give them to direct labour. Our county council has found that, and I think the same statement can be made by representatives of other county councils.  As far as direct labour is concerned, we have seen the cost of direct labour as compared with the contract system.  We say it is better done by direct labour.  Undoubtedly there is something wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All surveyors are not equal.  Some of them are not equal to their work, and more of them, perhaps, are on the principle of Gilbert and Sullivan's Ministers who &ldquo;stuck to their desks and did not go to sea, for those are the rulers of the King's navy.&rdquo;  Some of these county surveyors are running their roads from their offices, and are seldom seen on the roads.  A general <Col N="1974" /> may command his troops through good officers, but I do not think that applies to county surveyors.  They are costing you a good deal of money.  The assistants go out and see material and measure it, but unless there is a break they are not to be seen.  They are only half-time officers, and some of them complain they are not sufficiently well paid.  They do not know when men go to their work, and they do not pay surprise visits.  Decrease the number of assistant surveyors, or if they are required, appoint them as whole-time officers and make them do their work. You have a lot of honest working-men in some districts, and in other districts men are not giving a return for the money paid them.  One of the reasons is that no system of promotion is adopted.  If a man has experience of a road that man, from being an assistant ganger or road man, should be promoted to a ganger if he does his work well.  Men have been appointed as gangers who have no knowledge of road work.  They should not be there. It should be a question of promoting the man who knows his work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sir James Craig dealt with the need for the provision of meals for school children.  I am in absolute agreement with him there.  In the country school children have often to go four or five miles after an early breakfast.  If the weather is bad it stands to reason that children who are fasting cannot benefit by the education they receive.  The money that is spent in that way is not wisely spent, as the children are watching for the hour they will get home in order to get something to eat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Baxter enunciated a certain principle on which he would advise councils and local authorities generally to act as regards road-making.  He complained that good service was not being given in many cases&mdash;I think he spoke in a general way&mdash;under the direct labour system. I have always advocated that good wages should be followed by good service. Deputy Baxter in complaining that good service was not being given gave no proofs.  He merely made the assertion.  To make sure that good <Col N="1975" /> service would be given he would let out the work by competitive contract to groups of men.  As he said, let groups of labourers be pitted against groups of farmers and see which would do the work cheapest.  That is the principle on which Deputy Baxter would have the Ministry act towards county councils.  I say it is a vicious principle.  It is a principle that was fought out long ago and the result was the initiation generally of the direct labour system.  What are you asking labourers to do but pit themselves against farmers.  That is to say, the labourer who has only his labour to keep him is asked to put himself into competition with farmers who have farms to keep them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Baxter spoke of groups of farmers contracting, and pitting themselves against groups of labourers.  If Deputy Baxter makes the limit in such a case four acres, I do not call that man a farmer at all.  He is an uneconomic holder. I am speaking of farmers who are at an advantage in competing with labourers who have no land.  You are inviting the labourer to go out on the street to do nothing, or inviting him to take such action as he can against the farmer who is taking the food out of his mouth.  It is a bad policy to suggest that labour should enter into conflict with farmers for the purpose of competing for road contracts. It is going to incite an immense amount of antipathy in the country.  I hope that is not the policy of the Farmers' Party.  I hope it is not the policy they are going to the country on at the next elections.  I <Col N="1976" /> would like to hear definitely whether that is the policy they are enunciating or if they are advocating that farmers should compete for contracts for road making against labourers.  It would be well if we had a definite statement whether that is the policy Deputy Gorey enunciated and advised the Government to support and take up in their communications with county councils.  That is practically telling the labourer that he, a landless man, must pit himself against the farmer, who has already a means of making a livelihood.  I say that is an unfair proposition, and introduces a vicious principle into the work of road maintenance and road-making.</P>

      <P>The whole direct labour agitation has been directed towards that class of farmer, the uneconomic holder.  I am not prepared to claim that a farmer who has 20 acres ought to be also a contractor. We never held that.  The class I mention is the class that direct labour has driven off the roads&mdash;the uneconomic holders.  If a man in that position had only a few acres he was put off the roads.  That is what we objected to.  If Deputy Johnson admits that the man I refer to is a labourer and an uneconomic holder we are of one mind.</P>
