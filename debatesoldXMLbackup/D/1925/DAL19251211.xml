      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY (for Tadhg O Murchadha)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the Dunmanway, County Cork, Circuit has been vacant for over twelve months as far as a Pensions Officer is concerned; that temporary officers have since been doing duty there, and that such officers are usually transferred after a period of a couple of weeks; and whether, seeing that the above arrangement brings about a dislocation of work and entails hardship and inconvenience on the aged poor of the district, he will make representations to the Revenue Commissioners with a view to having a permanent officer appointed to the Circuit.</P>

      <P>Dunmanway Customs and Excise Station was rendered vacant by the transfer of an officer, who was experienced in Customs work, to Cork Customs Station, to provide for the additional work in that Station caused by the imposition of the new import duties included in the Budget of 1924. The work of Dunmanway Station has since been performed by Unattached Officers.  There is no reason why dislocation of work or hardship should arise in stations worked by Unattached Officers, of which there are always a considerable number.  At present, the staff position renders it a matter of difficulty to keep the number of vacant stations within normal limits. Dunmanway Station will be filled as soon as the exigencies of the Service permit.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that early in 1923 Patrick Boyle, of Farranthomas, Newcestown, Co. Cork, was taken from Newcestown Roman Catholic Church by National troops to remove barricades on the roads; whether he is aware that while engaged in the work a concealed mine exploded, killing two men and injuring Boyle very seriously, and if he will state the reasons why Boyle received no compensation in respect of his injuries.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that advertisements for temporary postal workers during the <Col N="1780" /> Christmas season, issued by his Department, do not contain any statement that a preference will be given to men who have served in the National Army, and whether, if such preference is being given, he will consider the desirability of stating the fact in order to avoid raising false hopes in the minds of persons now unemployed.</P>

      <P>The only advertisement issued in connection with the recruitment of temporary postal workers for the Christmas season is a small poster which is exhibited at the local Employment Exchanges and local Post Offices.  This poster does not contain any statement that preference will be given to ex-members of the National Army, but it is the fact that such preference is given and that where ex-National Army men suitable for the work are available they will be employed in preference to others.  This condition is well known amongst the persons registered for employment at the Exchanges, and no inconvenience is known to have arisen from the fact that it is not stated in the poster.  For the sake of economy the advertisement as well as the forms used in connection with this work are printed in large numbers, and the supplies are used up before there is any reprint.  Accordingly, the poster already in stock is being used, and no fresh poster has been printed this year.</P>

The notice ostensibly does one thing, but there is certain machinery behind it with regard to getting people marked out in the different sections for the particular type of work required. Merely because, in bulk, a big number have applied, does not assume, and cannot be taken to mean, that there will be, say, a special number of one type or section of men required for the number of skilled posts open under the scheme.  The point to which the Deputy refers will not cause any danger, because each individual case will be considered in accordance with the terms of the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and if there is not employment for a man of a particular type applying then his case will be decided on that fact in accordance with the Acts.</P>

      <P>There is no record of any claim to unemployment benefit having been made at the Mullingar Branch Employment Office by Mr. Bernard Rabbitt, of Irishtown, Mullingar, nor can it be found that he attended at that office or made any enquiry in reference to unemployment benefit.  There is no record of any contributions under the Unemployment Insurance Acts having been paid at any time in respect of Mr. Rabbitt, and he would not, therefore, be entitled to unemployment benefit.  Under the Acts passed by the Oireachtas special contributions were credited only to men discharged from the Army on or before 29th June, 1924, they being regarded as the men specially recruited for an emergency.

      <P>In page 2, Section 2 (1), line 35, to delete the words &ldquo;may resolve to&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to make it mandatory on the local authority, when it is of opinion that there is a demand for allotments, to proceed with the powers given in the Bill and provide for such allotments.  The Bill leaves the matter entirely within the option of the local authority, in respect of whether there is land available or not, or whether it is possible to make an agreement or not, to proceed and I desire that the local authority will realise that it is an obligation laid upon it by legislation, that where there is such a demand, and where local authorities are satisfied there is such a demand, it shall be looked upon as a duty on their part to do their utmost to provide these allotments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that according to arguments that have been adduced on all sides, where there is a number of citizens in <Col N="1785" /> any district who are keen about this matter they should be given facilities, and that it should be an obligation on local authorities to do their share in meeting this demand.  That is the sole purpose of the amendment.  I would like that the Minister would agree that there should be mandatory provision in the Bill in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson certainly appears in a new role in advocating an amendment of this kind.  His whole attitude from the outset on the recent Local Government Act was one of hostility towards what he considered the bureaucratic policy of my Department in forcing local authorities to do things that they did not want to do.  I think in this case that Deputy Johnson should be consistent.  If local authorities are responsible bodies, and if we are justified in leaving them a very wide discretion in other matters, I think they should certainly be entitled to be left to their own discretion in a matter of this kind.  I think no responsible local authority, if it was shown conclusively that there was a demand and a necessity for allotments in its particular district, would refuse to give effect to that demand.  Deputy Johnson has made no case that would justify me in dragooning local authorities into doing something against their will in this case.  Accordingly I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In page 3, lines 4 to 7 inclusive, to delete Section 3 (2).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is directed towards deleting the following sub-section:&mdash;&ldquo;A local authority shall not acquire by agreement under this Act land outside their own area without the consent of the council of the county, county borough or urban district, or the commissioners of the town in which the said land is situate.&rdquo; I do not understand the purpose of this clause.  The effect of it seems to me to be that the local authority may not enter into private negotiations with any landowner for any period at all, without applying to the county council, county borough, or <Col N="1786" /> the urban council of the district where the land is situate.  It means, in effect, that there shall not be merely an agreement on the part of the local authorities, but that they shall also convince another local authority of the necessity for putting into operation the provisions of this Act.  I am entirely unaware of any reason whatever which would justify such a prohibition.  Perhaps the Minister will have arguments to put up in favour of it, but I would like to hear them before agreeing to this provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a well-recognised procedure and the acceptance of it would be consistent with the general spirit of local administration.  After all every local authority has a certain amount of jurisdiction over its own territory, and in many cases a local authority may have a particular district or a particular piece of property earmarked for a particular purpose.  A neighbouring local authority may have some idea of having an afforestation scheme on that particular piece of property or they may have an allotment scheme of their own in contemplation or may have some building programme in view.  It is only right that they should be satisfied that there is no immediate likelihood of their requiring that property for any particular purpose of their own in the future, before allowing the property to be taken over by another local authority.  I do not think there is any possibility of a responsible local body refusing to grant this request by another local authority if there was no serious objection to their doing so.  It would be a very unusual procedure not to have this proviso inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that such a proviso was inserted in previous enactments relating to allotments, but it would seem to me that, inasmuch as a proposition of this kind has to be submitted to the Minister, he might consider it his duty to inquire whether there is any opposition.  I feel if you are going to give a veto to one local authority in regard to agreements in respect of land, even in circumstances such as these, it is making the difficulty of providing allotments doubly great. The Minister says that it is a common <Col N="1787" /> form in the matter of local government legislation.  Well, I must accept that, but it seems to me that the effect of it would be to place an added obstacle in the way of the development of the allotment scheme.  Would the Minister agree that only in cases where there are stated reasons to his satisfaction such a refusal should be allowed to prevail?  If it was a case of obstinacy, for instance, or a disagreement in policy, would the Minister overrule that objection?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the representations of Deputy Johnson, I will accept the amendment as it stands. There is not very much in it.  This was the usual procedure but if he thinks that this provision might be abused, in any case, I will waive my objection and accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In page 3, lines 8 and 9 inclusive, to delete Section 3 (3).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The motion is to delete the clause restricting the period to a term of five years.  I do not think there should be any restriction at all, and in any case that term of five years may be quite too short.  I do not know what the reasons are for putting in a period in regard to this because the conditions under which the lands will be acquired will inevitably have regard to the fact that it is a permanent taking, a long-lease taking or a short-lease taking.  These conditions will have to be all taken into account in the taking of the land and to make a specific statutory restriction does not seem to me to be necessary or desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a necessary safeguard.  The value of property fluctuates very considerably.  The value of a piece of property may be very different at the end of five years from what it was when it was taken over. It is only right that the local authority, if it acquires land for an exceptional purpose of this kind, should not be tied up indefinitely, whether it is a paying proposition from its point of view or not.  There should be an opportunity of readjusting the position at reasonable <Col N="1788" /> intervals.  Under the Bill there is ample power to re-acquire the property without any obstacles.  If conditions have not altered in any way, the property can be reacquired on the same terms as before.  If they have altered they can be reacquired with such alterations in the terms as are equitable from the point of view of both contracting parties.  I consider that a limitation of this kind is absolutely necessary in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before Section 9, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Whenever the estate or interest of a local authority in any land acquired by such local authority for the purposes of this Act is terminated by any means (other than resumption of such land by the immediate landlord thereof under the power in that behalf conferred by this Act) and on such termination such land is in the opinion of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture in a condition substantially less suitable for agriculture or pasture (as the case may require) than when it was acquired by such local authority, such local authority shall pay compensation for such deterioration in the condition of the land.</P>
      <P>(2)  The amount of compensation to be paid by a local authority under this section and the person or persons to whom, and, if necessary, the shares in which it is to be paid shall be determined by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whose decision shall be final.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is introduced in pursuance of a desire expressed on Committee Stage that compensation should be given, in certain circumstances, to owners of lands whose property had substantially depreciated during the period of tenure by the local authority. It would seem to cover what is in Deputy <Col N="1789" /> Conlan's mind in regard to amendment 5.

      <P>I move amendment 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, before Section 14, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Whenever a local authority is of opinion, as a result of representations made to them, or on their own motion, that there is a demand for common pasture for milch cows and goats in their area, and are further of opinion that the costs and expenses to be incurred by them in providing and maintaining the land for such common pasture and otherwise in relation thereto may reasonably be expected to be recouped by the payments to be made to them for the use of the common pasture, such local authority may resolve to provide land for such common pasture under this Act, and may thereupon carry such resolution into execution under and in accordance with this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Whenever a local authority has resolved in accordance with the preceding sub-section to provide land for common pasture, the provisions of this Act (other than the limitation of the size of an allotment) shall apply in like manner as if &ldquo;allotments&rdquo; included &ldquo;common pasture&rdquo; and &ldquo;rent&rdquo; included a charge for turning out an animal upon common pasture, and the power of the local authority to make regulations under <Col N="1790" /> this Act shall extend to the making of regulations in regard to any or all of the following matters, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the classes of persons eligible to be permitted to turn out animals upon pasture;</P>
    <P>(b)  the number of animals to be turned out upon the common pasture;</P>
    <P>(c)  the charge to be made in respect of each animal turned out.</P>
    <P>This amendment is for a definite purpose which I think of the gravest importance in this regard.  It was proposed in the Bill which I had the pleasure, honour and privilege of introducing, that provision should be made for what are known as cow-parks or grazing lands for milch cattle and goats.  I have had representations from different parts of the country as to the importance of this provision in the earlier Bill and regret that no provision was made for it in the present Bill.  There is no doubt that in many of the provincial towns there has been a shortage of milk and that the poorer people have had difficulty in obtaining supplies.  It has been one of the charges against the creamery system that farmers who are anxious to get all they can in the way of monetary return for their produce send all their milk to the creamery and that their families are deprived of the necessary quantity. The development of the grass holding to permit of the cottager keeping goats or milch cows for the use of himself and his neighbours should be encouraged rather than discouraged.  This Bill does not make any provision for the acquisition of grass lands for this purpose and my amendment is proposed with a view to remedying that omission.  The present law on the matter does not fulfil the requirements. One of the objections made to the provisions of the original Bill was that farmers, tradesmen, merchants and others would take advantage of the powers and use the land for grazing bullocks and for purposes other than the provision of milk.  Under this provision which I suggest, the use of these lands would be restricted definitely to the purpose in view.  I hope the Minister has reconsidered his attitude in <Col N="1791" /> this matter and that he will agree to make provision for cow-parks or common pasturage for milch cows or goats for the purpose I have indicated.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Johnson's amendment.  A large number of workers who are fortunate enough to be able to obtain security for a loan for the purchase of a cow, have to pay at present from £10 to £12 per year for the grazing of that cow.  That takes away the entire profit of the investment. I am sure the Minister will realise the necessity for these grazing tracts and that he will try to improve the economic position of the worker. If he accepts this amendment, he will be taking a step in the right direction and he will be giving the workers an opportunity of having milk and butter for their families at cost price.</P>

      <P>This is a Bill to provide allotments for town dwellers and, for that reason, I think that the acquisition of property for common pasturage or for cow-parks is outside its purview.  There are already powers to rural bodies to acquire lands for this purpose, but they are in an altogether different position, because there is plenty of land available in their areas for the purpose and they can acquire it without any difficulty.  Under this provision, there would be a considerable amount of capital and labour involved, and there would have to be a good deal of technical skill available if the scheme were to be a success.  I am of opinion that it would be impossible to obtain these requirements in the neighbourhood of the towns.  A considerable amount of land is required for this purpose, not merely a quarter or one-eighth of an acre, as in the case of allotments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the neighbourhood of towns it is very difficult to acquire any quantity of land that would justify the introduction of a Bill for the purpose. There could, no doubt, be acquired a few acres of land around a town, but that would only satisfy the demands of a very limited number.  Then, as has been remarked, it is very likely, if we introduced a provision of this kind, that it would be abused.  Probably it <Col N="1792" /> would be much more likely be used as accommodation land for fairs and markets than for feeding and providing pasture for milch cows.  In general, I am opposed to the idea of having the milk supply produced so near the towns and cities; from a hygienic point of view there is a good deal to be said against it.  I am not prepared to accept Deputy Johnson's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will realise that the proposed section gives power to local authorities to make regulations in regard to any or all of the following matters, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the classes of persons eligible to be permitted to turn out animals upon pasture; (b) the number of animals to be turned out upon the common pasture; (c) the charge to be made in respect of each animal turned out.</P>
      <P>The Minister's fear that this is going to cause difficulty to City Corporations or Commissioners of towns is quite unfounded. It is certain that in the working of it it could only be effective in respect to the small towns.  Such small towns contain many people anxious to provide milk for themselves and their families.  This is the only reasonable method whereby that provision can be secured without imposing upon the individual applicant a very excessive charge for the rent of the grazing that he requires.  Complaints are very general that people who desire to keep a cow are obliged to pay excessively the local shopkeeper for the use of the land in the neighbourhood, or the farmer living in the neighbourhood of the town.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister is doing a disservice to the people of the towns who desire to have grazing facilities for milch cows and he is incidentally doing a disservice to the cause of health and physical development.  The objection the Minister raises, that it is not desirable to encourage the production of milk so near to a town as this would entail, is rather hard to understand. We know there is a good deal of milk produced right within this City and within urban areas; milk is even produced in byres, where there is no grazing at all.</P>

      <P>It is all a question of cost.  Deputy Johnson and Deputy Lyons say that the land is available; they mention that the shopkeepers have the land.  To acquire that land would involve the payment of high prices. Presumably the price the local authorities would have to charge would be approximately the same as what the shopkeeper would charge.  The local authorities would have to acquire the land at its proper market value and they would not be able to get the land at any less figure than the local shopkeepers would charge.</P>

      <P>I would like to observe on this amendment that it is really arguable whether it is outside the scope of the Bill.  At any rate, waiving that point for the moment, I think it is certainly clear that an amendment of this kind, involving an alteration in the most important definition of the Bill, should be introduced in Committee rather than on Report. As the amendment aims at making a very definite alteration in the Bill, it needs, as it were, a consequential amendment in the definition section <Col N="1794" /> which has been discussed on Report.

    <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 1 and 2 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    <P>The power of assigning to a judge of the High Court the duty of acting at the Central Criminal Court for the time being shall be vested in the President of the High Court alone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, before Section 3 is put, to have some explanation of it.  This Section provides that the power of assigning a judge of the High Court to be a judge of the Central Criminal Court and to act as such at the Central Criminal Court for the time being shall be vested in the President of the High Court alone.  I do not know whether there is any change in the law or practice in respect of this, but I am given to understand that it has been the practice that there should be a rota and that the judges should, without seeing what cases were coming forward, and without knowing the cases that were to be tried by them, be allotted in some sort of rotation.  Now assigning this authority to the President of the High Court seems to me to open a responsibility for appointing a particular judge whose views may have been already declared on certain principles involved, and it is likely to lead the way to suspicion, and, shall I say, minimise the confidence the public should have in the courts, to say that a particular judge shall be appointed to try a particular case <i>ad hoc.</i>  I do not pretend to speak with any authority or knowledge.  I am only dealing with this matter as it appears on the <Col N="1796" /> face of it.  But the practice, that in the course of a session, judges should be appointed beforehand and automatically fill the place without knowledge of what cases are coming forward, seems to be more in accordance with the responsibilities of the High Court than that when a special case of a particular character comes forward affecting particular persons any individual, even though he is the President of the High Court, should have power to decide what particular judge should try that particular case.  I think it would tend to the lessening of public confidence in the impartiality of the courts.  I raise that point with a view to having some explanation from the Minister as to the meaning of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this section is simply to provide some definite and certain channel of assigning judges to the Central Criminal Court, not as the Deputy suggests or seems to think <i>ad hoc</i>, for a particular case, but to take a particular session's work, and to take a particular term's work at that kind of business.  Without some such provision the matter was entirely vague. It was understood that there was a practice and precedent about it, that the power of assigning lay in a particular quarter, lay with the President of the High Court.  But pressed for any express provision to that effect, none would be forthcoming, and it is thought desirable to set out specifically that it shall lie with the President of the High Court to make the assignments, not to get away from the idea of rotation, but to fix a rotation, and state in what order that kind of work was to be taken by a particular judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister not make sure that that would be the effect?  Could he not do so by inserting a provision saying that periodically at the opening of the session, or something of that kind, such a rotation should be fixed?  As I read this, &ldquo;the time being&rdquo; might be fitted into the trial of a particular case, and I think the Minister should be obliged to give us some reason as to why the change should take place.  Have there <Col N="1797" /> been any evils arising out of the present practice that require to be remedied? Can the Minister instance any defects in the practice or procedure, or any evil consequences of the present procedure that would require a change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly the Deputy should be prepared to assume that the section would not be put in without some reason&mdash;if the difficulty had not, in fact, arisen, that it was not clear that there was authority somewhere to say what particular judge would take a particular term's work. Otherwise you leave it vague.  You leave it entirely a matter for discussion and agreement, and there is, at any rate, the possibility that agreement would not be forthcoming.  In the absence of such agreement it is necessary to say that a particular person has the power of assignment. That is what is sought here.  I do not agree with the Deputy that a particular judge, having been assigned to take a term's criminal work, that this section would leave it open to the President of the High Court, or anyone else, to withdraw that judge or send some other judge <i>ad hoc</i> to try a particular case.  I think that was the Deputy's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect yes, but I think that the position may be that a central criminal court may have one, two, or three cases to be heard&mdash;one of them being, say, of a high political importance.  If this is inserted in its present form it might well be that the confidence of the public in the court would be damaged if it could be said that the President of the High Court was appointing a particular judge to try a particular case or a series of cases which will obviously appear to be <i>ad hoc</i> in view of the importance of this one case.  Unless you set down the procedure over a particular period or periods, not apparently or obviously dealing with particular cases, I think there is going to be damage done to the public confidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is rather difficult to meet that point of view, assuming that it exists largely and that Deputy Johnson is representative <Col N="1798" /> in expressing it.  Apply that to other cases, to the general work of the courts, and someone must have the power of assigning judges and apportioning the work of the courts, and if the person doing that is to be open to the suggestion, or the suspicion, that he is apportioning work and assigning judges with an eye to the probable result of a case if tried by a particular judge, then it is rather a difficult frame of mind to meet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is something in the Courts of Justice Act in regard to that matter.  The provision of the Courts of Justice Act says &ldquo;the Central Criminal Court shall mean the judge of the High Court to whom is assigned the duty of acting as such court for the time being.&rdquo; Assigned by whom?  There was a lacuna in the 1924 Act and it was left entirely vague as to how and by whom a judge was to be assigned for this particular work, and the suggestion that the assignment should be made by the principal judge of that particular court, by the President of the High Court, seems a reasonable one.  After all, he has a responsibility for all the work carried out by the High Court and he must apportion the work amongst the available judges.  Incidentally he must apportion and, I submit, should have power of apportioning, this particular phase of the work, the Criminal Court, and that is really all that is sought in Section 3 of this supplementary Bill.  As I say, it is almost impossible to meet the frame of mind which says that judges will be assigned to try particular cases&mdash;if criminal also, presumably, civil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As we found in other Bills, there are certain suggestions that really could not be adequately guarded against by the provisions of this Bill, and I think this suggestion is one&mdash;the suggestion that judges will be selected to do particular work with an eye to the probable result if it is done by this judge, rather than by that judge.  That suggestion goes to the very root of the whole judicial system and to the root of your whole confidence in the administration of the law, and, I think, it cannot be met.  If one were to attempt to meet it, it would really mean that one had not confidence in the judges appointed by the Executive and in the desire of judges to be impartial between indicted persons and the State.  I can only suggest, if and when cases of that kind arise, Deputy Johnson, or his successor in the leadership of the Opposition of the future, would merely have to put down a motion and raise the whole question.</P>

      <P>I do not see any way out of it.  Section 3 of our Bill seems to be merely filling the lacuna in the Act of 1924 which stated that a particular duty was to be assigned without stating by whom.  If you say it is not to be assigned at all, and if you leave no power of assignment to anyone, then it is simply a matter of consultation, in the hope of agreement, between the judges themselves.  Supposing one judge says:&ldquo;I do not like Green Street.  It is stuffy and I find it is not good for my nerves and so I will not do that kind of work,&rdquo; what will <Col N="1800" /> happen unless there is somewhere the power of assignment?  And I know no more appropriate person to make assignments than the President of the High Court.  There would be something in Deputy Johnson's suggestion if assignments were left to me.  I am notoriously corrupt and partisan and might be inclined to do the kind of thing the Deputy is suggesting.  Here we say that assignment is to be made by the President of the High Court who is responsible for seeing that the work of that court is carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that question has been asked as it enables me to clear up the matter of the Rules of Court and their relation to this Bill. I was in this position, a rather peculiar position, and I ask Deputies to try and appreciate the fact that this Bill could not be framed until the Rules of Court were in draft.  That took a long time. The Committees could only meet in week-ends as they were mostly working judges, justices and professional men, and the drafting of the Rules, which is a very technical business, had to be very carefully and thoroughly discussed.  The Court Officers Bill could not be framed until the draft rules were in existence and until we knew what the general framework was going to be.  The rules themselves cannot be put before the Dáil and Seanad until the Court Officers Bill is law.  The rules deal with a variety of offices which will be only created by the Bill, and I could not bring rules before the Dáil and Seanad in which an officer is mentioned when there is in fact no such officer in existence, so that while the drafting of the Bill had to await the Rules of Court I had to know what they were going to be like.  The actual laying of the rules before the Dáil and Seanad must await the passage of that Bill as otherwise we would be talking about approving rules which refer to offices which were not statutory and which had no existence in law.  The matter, therefore, is not just as obvious <Col N="1801" /> as it looks.  Criticisms of the delay of the Rules of Court are easy and plentiful, but there are many sorts of reasons for that delay.  There are administrative reasons.  The drafting of an important Bill had to await these rules. I have them now in my office exactly in the form in which they will come before the Dáil and Seanad, but I cannot put them before the Dáil and Seanad until this important Bill has been passed by both Houses.</P>

We cannot even commence the consideration of the Court Officers Bill until the Committee have reported on the question of the Rules of Court. The Court Officers Bill will be introduced immediately on the reassembling of the Dáil after the Christmas Recess. When that is through the Rules which are now in existence will be placed before the two Houses, and they cannot be placed before that.  There are Bills, such as the Jury Bill, which are of greater necessity than the Bill now <Col N="1802" /> passing, and which I would like to get through very quickly.  There is also the matter of a permanent Bill for the execution of Court decrees.  That is an important measure which I would like to get through, but I think that possibly this discussion has little relevance to Section 3.

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal shortly with one or two points. The question of the price was debated at great length and it is a very important question, because whereas there may be complaints now as to whether land purchase is proceeding as expeditiously as it might the kernel of the situation is that in three, four or five years land purchase will be completed, and for sixty-seven years after that the tenants and the tenant-purchasers will be in occupation.  It is much more important that their condition should be economic during the sixty-seven years in which they will be paying annuities than that they should get their holdings to-day or tomorrow. The section dealing with price is quite simple; it is the same section as appeared in the 1903, 1909, and 1923 Acts.  It says that the price shall, in the case of an appeal, be ultimately <Col N="1805" /> decided by the Judicial Commissioner, who is a High Court Judge.  He gets no guidance from the Act itself; he is merely told that the price shall be a fair price to the owner and to the Land Commission, the Commission, presumably, representing the tenant.  It would be impossible to make the section more specific than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Untenanted.  No possible form of words could be devised which would get the agreement of any section of the House and which would cover the particular price which the Land Commission should give for different varieties of land.  If any Deputy tries to find some form of words which would do so he will realise the difficulty at once.  There is not so much difficulty about untenanted land.  You buy the landlord's interest and you have a precedent established by the 1903 and the 1909 Acts.  Untenanted land has nearly always been bought cheaply.  There is only one interest to acquire, that of the owner of the fee simple.  But there is this to be remembered, that even on the assumption that the same price is given for the same quality of land under the 1923 Act as was given under the 1909 Act you will have a much bigger annuity.  Interest and sinking fund is now 4¾ per cent.  Interest and sinking fund under the 1909 Act was 3½ per cent.  If £100 an acre is given now the annuity is 95/-; if £20 an acre is given now the annuity is about 19/-.  If £100 an acre were given under the 1909 Act the annuity was 70/-; if £20, it was 14/-.  That is inevitable; it cannot be helped.  I am not applying this figure of £20 to any particular quality of land; I am just taking that figure, and for average land any farmer will agree that £20 an acre is a very small price for the fee simple.  Yet if you give such a very low price as £20, you must have an annuity of 19/-, whereas under the 1909 Act it is 14/-.  That applies to land purchased at any price, and it is a great difficulty.  I do not see any way out of it.  You cannot reverse for the purpose of land purchase all the factors that operated in 1914.  The <Col N="1806" /> point I am making is that even if land is now worth in money no more than it was worth in 1914 the annuity will be higher.  It would have been possible, if you could get a state of sweet reasonableness in everybody, to have some bonus system.  There was a bonus system under the 1903 and 1909 Acts, but we have none now.  Looked at fairly and impartially from the point of view that every man is entitled to fair play, and that is the only point of view from which you can look at it, you must give a fair price.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as untenanted land is concerned, no rent is being paid out of it.  It is fee-simple land in the possession of a landlord and is being purchased by the Land Commission. Ultimately in the last resort the Judicial Commissioner has to decide the price, and the only leading he gets from the Act is the section that says that the price is to be fair to the owner and to the purchaser.  He must take into account the interests of both.  For the sake of endeavouring to deal with the point without raising a contentious argument as to whether such and such a price is too high or too low&mdash;a point that could not be settled, because we are not clear as to what price we are dealing with&mdash;I take an average of £20 an acre.  If the Land Commission purchase land at that price the allottee, who may be a landless man, or a tenant who has given up his holding, or a tenant who has got this land in addition to his holding, will pay 19/- annuity as against 14/- in the case of the 1909 Act, and as against 13/- under the 1903 Act.  That is a difficult state of affairs, because the Land Commission as a whole must act on the assumption that any proprietor is entitled to get a fair price and, on the other hand, they must take into account what the <Col N="1807" /> tenant has to pay.  It may have been that the ideal solution of that un-undoubted dilemma would be some bonus system, something that would reconcile the genuinely conflicting interests of the Land Commission and the owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that land is being bought fairly and reasonably under the 1923 Act by the Land Commission, and I think there is no danger that the prices being paid now will leave holdings uneconomic in any conditions that are likely to develop during the next 60 or 70 years, that is to say, the period for which annuities will be paid.  That is an extremely important point.  It is much more important than other points that have been raised and that have got much more attention and so much more time.  With regard to tenanted land that is fixed.  There is a certain reduction of 30 and 35 per cent. on the original rents, and so far as non-judicial rents are concerned the rent is fixed either by agreement between the landlord and the tenant or by the Land Commission, and in this case whether they be judicial or non-judicial the rents are extremely low, and there is the reduction of 30 or 35 per cent. That is a big reduction considering that the rents are the same as those that ruled before the war.  Deputy Gorey said that his Party pressed the question of price very strongly during the debates on the Land Act.  They did, but they pressed the point in connection with tenanted land, and for every hour that was spent on the question of price in connection with tenanted land I should say that there was not half a minute spent on untenanted land. While this Bill was going through the Dáil the question that agitated the minds of people was whether rents were to be reduced under the Act.  That was not as important as the other question, namely, the question as to what price was to be given for untenanted land.  So far as congests are concerned, the rents will be fairly reasonable, because you have to take their rent on the condition that it may be a little bit high, along with the rent of the old holding which will be lower as a result of the large reduction given under the <Col N="1808" /> 1923 Act.  In dealing with the landless men the boot will begin to pinch.  That is the question of the untenanted land.</P>
    <P>When you come to the question of tenanted land you are faced with a more difficult question.  You have other interests to deal with, that of the owner and that of the tenant, and the principle on which the tenant's interest is to be held was settled a great many years ago in the '81 Act, and has always been adopted ever since.  It was laid down in the '81 Act that if a holding was being resumed from a tenant the tenant was entitled to get what is called a redemption price.  It is not exactly the market value as we know it.  It is very difficult to define it.  It is the market value subject to certain considerations which make it slightly less.  The question we had to decide when we were dealing with the Bill in the Dáil was whether we should alter that basis when resuming tenanted land.  That would have been a serious thing to do, and I do not think it would be possible to get the majority of the Dáil or Seanad to vote for an alteration on that basis.  It was never questioned.  There was no objection put up against it that we should alter that basis in the '81 Act as the resumption price.  We did not alter it.  It is there when land is being acquired, and the tenant purchaser is entering for his period in accordance with the basis in the '81 Act as to the resumption price.  You, therefore, have something approximating closely to market value, and in addition you have to buy the landlord's interest.  That is calculated on the basis of so many years' purchase of the rent or upon such and such a reduction.  That makes that land extremely dear, and that one practical consideration makes it extremely difficult to deal with, or acquire, large areas of tenanted land.  It may be when the needs of land purchase become more pressing, as the Act develops, that a considerable body of opinion, whether it be majority opinion or minority, will develop in the direction of facing this question again.  But if it faces it there would be very serious issues raised which will shake security.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for AGRICULTURE Patrick J. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, but we do not name the appointed day in any case where there is a likelihood that we will not acquire the land.  The whole question of whether you are to acquire tenanted land or not comes up on the question when you name the appointed day for the tenant. We are not using the expression &ldquo;tenanted land&rdquo; in connection with land purchased.  It is not tenanted land but land held on fee simple subject to a mortgage, the mortgage being the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the difficulty about tenanted land and it faces the Land Commission in a great many cases.  However, with regard to tenanted land, they are able to buy land very reasonably, because in a great many cases tenants holding large areas of land have made up their minds that they might as well offer that land to the Land Commission.  They know that times are changing and, to put it crudely, they think it is well to <Col N="1810" /> get out now at a decent price.  In that way the Land Commission can acquire considerable areas at a fair price.  In other places where they acquire it compulsorily at high prices they try to set off one estate against another.  If they buy tenanted land as well as untenanted land they pool the price of both, apportion the annuities and so get over the difficulty.  Those cases will show the difficulty of acquiring tenanted land on a wholesale scale.  With regard to purchased land you have to buy the fee simple from the tenant subject to a mortgage, the mortgage being the advance already made by the State. First you have to redeem the mortgage. That is to say, you have to buy off practically the existing advance because on the average I should say the existing tenant purchasers have not been vested for more than 18 years.  Therefore, there is only 18 years' annuity out of 67 paid off, and therefore in redeeming the annuity you have practically to pay off 90 per cent. of the advance from time to time to be made on that land.  Another condition is that if you were actually buying the land and not merely giving an exchange you would have to give the tenant something approximating to the resumption price of untenanted land. In the Land Act, 1923, it was decided that we were going to take powers to acquire purchased land compulsorily.  It was pointed out that that would be a serious thing to do, that any section in any Land Act which gives the Land Commission power to acquire land compulsorily at the ordinary price of fee simple land, that is, at a price which is about half its market value would, for the purpose of an advance from the bank, reduce the value of such land to half its market value.  In other words, we would be certainly doing something which would reduce the value of 70 or 80 per cent. of the land of the country to half its existing value.</P>
    <P>That would have very serious reactions. There was then the other question, whether it is a good principle that the State should take to-day what it gave yesterday, and finally it was decided, in view of the fact that it was necessary to acquire some purchased land especially in the congested districts, <Col N="1811" /> that what should be done was to give power to the Land Commission to take land compulsorily, and on the other hand to give equally suitable and not less valuable land elsewhere to the tenant purchaser.  We buy some land offered voluntarily at a fairly reasonable price.</P>
    <P>If you take into account, in regard to purchased land, tenanted land and untenanted land the considerations that apply to price attached to each of these various classes of land and couple with that the position you have now, that the rate of interest is 4¾ per cent. as against 3¼ per cent. under the 1903 Act and 3½ per cent. under the 1909 Act, you will see the difficulty of rushing land purchase.  Land purchase is a very difficult job and it would be a very great mistake to rush it.  It is a question that requires the most careful consideration if we are not going to have a state of affairs here over the long period of 67 years by which tenant purchasers would be endeavouring to pay uneconomic annuities.</P>
    <P>The question of price alone is one that cannot be rushed.  It is one that must be dealt with with extreme care and in a variety of ways if we are to get results that are economic.  When people accuse the Land Commission of having estates in their hands which they have not divided and which they set for, say, eleven months, they ought to remember that in a great many cases they do that because they hope to get cheaper land in the neighbourhood to pool the prices and therefore pool the annuities.  There are considerations of that kind to be taken into account. Another thing that affects the rate at which land can be divided is that when the inspectors go to divide land they may find that they can make a fairly reasonable scheme, say, if they just divide a particular estate that they had at the moment, but that if they could get another piece of land which was near the estate and which was likely to come on the market in a short time&mdash;if they could get that land by agreement or that the Land Commission acquired it compulsorily&mdash;they might feel that in the division of an estate placed like that they could do a lot better.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1812" /> A great many considerations enter into the question of what an economic holding is.  An economic holding depends on rent, area and a great number of other factors&mdash;on the proximity of the holding to the house and farm of the man who is working it.  You can divide untenanted land among a number of congests who live two, three, four or five miles away.  You can make their holdings economic in the sense of bringing them up to £15 each or so, but still you leave them in an unsatisfactory position.  In the case of a man who has six, eight or ten acres of land two miles away from his home, you have to remember that that land has to be tilled, manure must be carted to it, and stock must be driven to it and back from it, and the result is that you leave him in a most unsatisfactory position. Every farmer knows that.  The Land Commission are constantly up against that problem.  The inspectors who know all about practical farming know that a farmer finding himself in that position and who gets from the Land Commission a share of an estate that is divided is still left in an unsatisfactory position.  The inspector says to himself that he knows he can divide the estate among a certain number of holdings, but still that he will not make them economic and personally he will not feel satisfied with what he is doing.  He knows that he is just doing something which will please for the moment, because people are always pleased to get something extra for very little.  It would be better for them, he says, and I would be doing better work from the point of view of the tenant purchasers if they waited until some places which would provide more land came into the market in, say, two or three months' time.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Land Commission can act on the principle that the moment they get an estate they can divide it regardless of surrounding circumstances, or they can deal with the question as they should deal with it, in a proper and efficient manner, by realising that the decision to put a tenant into possession of a holding is not one to be viewed in the light of this year or next year or the next three or four years, but rather in the light that you <Col N="1813" /> are putting him into the possession of a holding that is economic in the full sense of the word, and a holding in which he will have no difficulty in meeting his liabilities during the following 67 years in which he will have to pay his annuities.  Deputies should remember that when complaining about Land Commission delays.  I want to say that I am not making any excuse whatever for the Land Commission delays in preparing agreements to purchase, and I am not making any excuse for the reason that I mentioned before.</P>
    <P>The preparation of agreements to purchase must be carried out with the greatest care.  If not, the vesting order will be wrong, and the vesting order is evidence, and is taken as evidence, of every particular in connection with the holding: area, annuity, reservations, rights of way and so on.  It is the system which was adopted first under the Local Registration of Title Act which contemplated that every charge on land should be registered immediately under that Act.  That saved farmers and land owners generally thousands and thousands of pounds and has saved them even more than that, if you consider that time is money also.  We all know that the law's delays as regards making title and other matters has been the subject of much literature of one kind or another.  All these delays were swept away by the Local Registration of Title Act because all such claims must now be on a folio, and if a claim is not on that folio it does not exist. If a man wants to sell his land he knows that his folio will show whether there is any claim on it or not.  If there is no claim on the folio then no claim exists.  If a man has a dispute as to whether a right of way on his land has been encroached upon by someone, by even half a foot, he comes in with his folio with the map attached, a map that is accurate to an inch.  He hands the map to the judge's assessor and no witnesses are necessary.  The map proves itself to the judge's assessor, and it shows whether or not the right of way has been encroached upon.  The same applies to bogland.  That is why it is so necessary to prepare with great care these agreements to purchase.</P>
    <P>The regulations as regards vesting <Col N="1814" /> have been altered now for the first time as compared with the 1903 Act. An alteration has been made to the effect that the inspector, instead of preparing and mapping out a holding and instead of preparing agreements to purchase, prepares a single agreement known as a temporary convenience agreement which is registered.  There is no checking.  Everything is approximate in that temporary convenience agreement.  It is taken straight away to the estate.  Tenants and the tenant purchasers sign this temporary agreement and are put into possession immediately under it.  After that the regular agreement is prepared with great care and with the leisure that such a thing requires.  All that means that Irish land purchase will be expedited by that means and that it will proceed at least three times as quickly as heretofore.  That is in operation at present.</P>
    <P>Another point raised by some one on the Labour Benches, I forget by whom at the moment, was the question of the rights of labourers under the Act.  It was raised in particular in connection with the dismissal of labourers on estates that are bought by the Land Commission.  I mention it especially because I know of cases where that trouble occurs very often.  The Land Commission inspects some of this land; that is the first the owner hears of it. The owner then writes to the Land Commission protesting.  They offer a price; he refuses.  The next thing is he calls in the labourers and hands them notice, and he says to them: &ldquo;I am very sorry; our relations have always been the best for the last twenty years, but here the Land Commission comes along, and I must fire you out.&rdquo; That happened in a great many cases. Of course the idea is to open up every sort of device to prevent the Land Commission going ahead, and he thinks it is useful to get the labourers to his side; they have their notice to quit, and he says: &ldquo;It is the Land Commission. You cannot blame me, the land is being acquired, and it will be in their hands in a week or a fortnight.&rdquo; They cannot blame the owners, and they join in the general chorus, and <Col N="1815" /> everything is done to obstruct the Land Commission in the acquisition of the land.  The owner probably lodges notice, which means that the Land Commission cannot take up the land for three months more, and he plays his cards in such a way that he can hold up the land for a year.  Deputies should remember that.  I say that publicly because I have received a great many letters on the point.  People are under a misapprehension when land is vested in the Land Commission. Everybody connected with the estate will know it at once, and then the owners of the land call their labourers together and tell them they must dispense with their services, as the Land Commission has acquired the land.  It would be well worth while knowing whether, in fact, the Land Commission had acquired the land or not.  I get representative people saying: &ldquo;This is a sad state of affairs.  Those people are out of employment.&rdquo; I cannot interfere, but I point out that nothing that the Land Commission does makes it necessary for the owner to dispense with his labourers&mdash;nothing whatever.</P>
    <P>Of course at the time the land is acquired, that is for a week or so, arrangements have to be made, transition arrangements, and they will possibly interfere with the routine as it existed up to that time, and it may mean dispensing, for a short time, with a man or two.  I am not referring so much to that.  What I am referring to is this particular system which certain owners of land adopt in order to fight the Land Commission on the question of the acquisition of land.  That is so from the moment the inspector inspects the land, and there is agitation of one kind or another.  Perhaps the owner makes the case that it is a stud farm.  The Press is worked up on that stunt, and very often they also call in the labourers and tell them that the Land Commission requires this land and they must be dismissed.  The owner says: &ldquo;The Land Commission wants my land and I must dispense with you.&rdquo; The Land Commission cannot deal with a question of that kind. They cannot make any arrangements with the labourers until they acquire <Col N="1816" /> the land.  After they have acquired the land the regular labourers can be easily dealt with, and they are easily dealt with by the Land Commission after they acquire the land, and these probably find no difficulty in getting grazing rights for a cow or a horse which they formerly enjoyed.  I think these are all the points that have been raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister deal with the position of land which is expected to be acquired and forestalled by sales made presumably with the expectation that possession will give security, possession being nine points of the law?  That seems to me to cause as much difficulty as any other&mdash;the feeling that the prospects of the congests or labourers or others are being forestalled by a sale before the land is acquired by the Land Commission. The large holders are extending their holdings by this method, and a good deal of agitation arises as a consequence amongst those who thought they were going to get a division of this land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some difficulty there, but I do not think it is as widespread as the Deputy suggests.  You hear of a case very often where some parties in the neighbourhood think there is going to be a sale.  I have been told of such cases where people say the land is going to be sold, but the sale does not take place.  There is the possibility of it, and that gives rise to agitation and there is a lot of noise because people think the place is going to be sold, but I do not think there are many sales for the direct purpose of evading the Act.  In any event, what can be done?  You have powers under the Act.  One thing can be done.  You have powers to acquire land compulsorily at a certain price.  These powers can be exercised by the Land Commission rigorously and they can be exercised even though the purchaser is in.  There will be a certain practical difficulty of course.  The land might be divided into three or four or five holdings of say fifty acres, and it is not quite as easy, I agree, to go on to a holding of fifty acres and acquire it as it would be to acquire the original holding <Col N="1817" /> of 450 acres.  There is that practical difficulty, and the only way I see out of that particular difficulty is for the Land Commission to enforce strictly its rights regardless of who is in whenever they think there has been a sale for the purpose of defeating the Act. It is right that they should enforce their powers strictly in such a case. Where there have been such sales we have insisted on purchasing at a smaller figure than had been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say that whenever there is an appearance, or satisfactory proof of an evasion, that the rights of the Land Commission will be enforced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it would be a very difficult thing.  There are two sides to the question.  You must make it quite clear that the citizen has rights to sell his property, that is number one. It must be established as a matter of law and practice that the citizen has a right to sell his property, and that is complicated when dealing with a grievance that may arise as the result of that particular right and it is made more complicated by the fact of agitation, which is often developed against a sale which is perfectly genuine and with which the Land Commission would in fact not interfere.  I want to make it quite clear that a property owner has a right to sell his land. I want to say that the Land Commission will exercise its right to purchase land regardless whether it is A.B. owns it to-day instead of C.D. a week ago, but that is all the distance we can go on that point.  It is another of those practical difficulties of land purchase that must be solved, not so much by legislation as by the good sense of the officials administering the Act and by the efficiency with which they do their work.</P>

For a long period of years politicians of every party in Ireland have got themselves into power on the old cry of &ldquo;the land for the people.&rdquo; We are just coming down to hard facts now, because the Minister for Agriculture has stated that there is not enough land to go round.  It is a good thing that we have got as far as that.  At all events, as a consequence of the unequal division of the land in this country, it is regrettable to find <Col N="1819" /> a few people owning and controlling almost the whole of the land to the detriment of the State.  We have evidence of the widespread evils caused by the unequal distribution of the land. We have a ruined land industry and all that that involves, a terribly congested labour market, a limited number of manufacturing industries, a dearth of employment and a vast mass of unemployed people in the towns and cities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should our people be driven out of the open country into the cities and towns?  It is due to the neglect of the land.  The land to-day is given over to bullocks and that is not an economic proposition. What sum of money are we sending out of this country for our daily supply of bread and other foodstuffs, most of which could be produced by our own people instead of getting other countries to produce them for us?  Butter, eggs, bacon and other foodstuffs could be produced here, and that would save us from exporting millions of money for those necessaries of life.  We are relying upon foreign countries for our supplies of bread and other foodstuffs.  That has not been contradicted, and I am sure the Farmers' Party will agree with that statement.  What would happen in the <Col N="1820" /> morning if a war broke out in Europe, which is not impossible?  We talk about a defence force for Ireland, while the real defence is food for the people.  If a war broke out &ldquo;corners&rdquo; would be established in foodstuffs, supplies would be held up, and you would have a revolution.  What would there be to stop that?  A defence force! It would be an impossibility with the hungry people.  Would there be anything to prevent secret service agents, by means of a clever financial arrangement, depriving us of our food supplies?  There would be nothing to prevent it.  Therefore I say we should create as many economic holdings as we possibly can in the country.  By doing that we would be doing something towards the uplifting of our people economically, physically and morally.  In the County Carlow there are about 2,000 acres of untenanted land, as the Minister told me some time ago in reply to a question.  Some time since the Minister asked me to put him some question in connection with three ranches held by Land Committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask him now what is the difference between the price that the committee offered for the lands of Kellistown and that which the Land Commission were prepared to give; and also what is the difference in price between the Land Commission and the Land Committees in reference to Duckett's Grove and Moyne.  These lands contain a couple of thousand acres.  The guarantors for these lands are in rather an awkward position. The matter is serious, because some of them are not now in a position in which they could be compelled to stand to their agreement, with the result that a few people will have to foot the whole bill.  There are a number of uneconomic holders in these districts who want to get in on the land, but they do not like to place the guarantors in an awkward position on account of the patriotism they displayed.  The acquisition of land was one of the objects of the movement at that particular time.  Those people did not want any of the land for themselves, but became guarantors in order to acquire the land for the people.  I want to know what <Col N="1821" /> is the present position in connection with these holdings, between the Land Commission and the Land Committees or guarantors, as the case may be. The Minister said that he was going to introduce legislation in connection with this matter, and I ask that it be introduced as early as possible, because there are a number of these cases all over the Saorstát.  I also urge that the Kilcomney estate, near Bagnalstown, which is now owned by the Land Bank, should be dealt with, so as to relieve the uneconomic holders, and make them an asset to the nation.</P>
    <P>When putting people on the land I would like if the Minister would get some guarantee that they would cultivate a certain percentage, say ten, twelve, or fourteen per cent., so that it would not go back to grass, as otherwise there would be no difference between one big grazier and several small ones.  I urge the Minister to have the division of the land completed at as early a date as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. COSGRAVE Mr. COSGRAVE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COSGRAVE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very important point, as a considerable number of people, in trying to anticipate the operation of the Act, broke up their land, and made tenancies of 400 or 500 acres.  These people had the land on the eleven months' system, and when the Act came into operation permanent divisions were made in order to evade it, and allow those who had some of the land to retain possession of it. A good many tenancies of that kind have been made.  The cases to which Deputy Doyle referred arose in the days of the boom, when certain men who wanted to be good fellows put their names down when any price was being paid for land.  Up to £75 and £80 per acre was paid for such land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HENNIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Deputies have taken part in the discussion with regard to the distribution of untenanted land.  My suggestion to the Minister for Agriculture is that the <Col N="1822" /> Land Commission should retain some of that land for the education of farmers. The Land Commission has land in its possession in each county and I suggest that it should retain sufficient for a medium sized model farm at which instruction would be given to farmers in the surrounding districts. Instructors and demonstrators have been going through the country for the past few years giving good advice, but that advice, with some exceptions, is not acted on by the people.  I was present at one lecture advertised on the rotation and manuring of crops. There were only about ten people present. In a house in the neighbourhood there were a considerable number of farmers playing cards, and when they were asked to attend the lecture they refused, saying that they did not believe in lectures.  They expressed the view that the instructors were paid to talk and lecture and that if they had to practise what they preached they would not be able to make farming pay. In my opinion about 50 acres should be retained for a medium sized farm in each county in the Saorstát, and an official should be put on that farm and told that he would have to work it and live on it.  I was at Athenry model farm once or twice and I believe that farm work is done very well there.  I have been told that it was a demonstration farm and that it did not pay.</P>

      <P>I was glad to hear Deputies' views on the division of land especially with regard to Connemara. In a great many cases in Connemara I believe that the Minister and the Land Commission cannot do all that is needed, but in many cases the tenants on these holdings are living under terrible conditions.  Some of them have plots for potatoes which are only about 30 yards square.  Deputy Mulcahy and <Col N="1823" /> Deputy Baxter have seen these plots. On the other hand there are large sheep ranches let on the 11 months system and on some of these ranches there are up to 1,000 sheep.  I would like to know from the Minister what his intentions are as regards the provision of lands for people living on the coast.  As regards co-operative farming societies that bought land in 1919 and 1920, that land is now in the hands of the Land Commission and the purchasers have paid about one-fourth of the purchase price.  They have been paying at the rate of 6¼ per cent., and up to the present they have not got the benefit of the Land Act.  I would like to know when they will get the benefit of the Act or when ranches held in common will be distributed.</P>

      <P>As to the points raised by Deputies Doyle and Broderick dealing with Land Bank or Committee cases, Deputy Doyle dealt with probably a unique case where a committee gave £80 or £90 an acre and borrowed the money from the Bank.  The Land Commission thinks that land was worth about £30 an acre.  It is extremely good land.  There is something like £50 in the difference in prices.  It is practically the same question as Deputy Broderick raised.  I have made a proposition in detail to the Minister for Finance to deal with these cases, and I will not enlarge on the proposition now.  Roughly speaking, the proposition is that we will have to find the difference between the fair price and the price at which the lands were purchased. There is no going back on the original purchase.  The money was raised and the Bank has to be paid off. The only way out is to find something to fill the gap between the price that was paid and the fair price.  I can introduce a Bill when I have got a decision.</P>

There is no question of taxing the county for it.  That is only one little detail of the proposals.  With regard to the other point&mdash;the point raised by Deputy Cosgrave and also by Deputy Gorey&mdash;the question of a tenancy being created since the passing of the Act, there is a section in the Act&mdash; I have not the Act by me at the moment&mdash;which points out that no tenancy created after the passing of the Act&mdash;I forget the exact date that is mentioned&mdash;is valid for the purpose of the Act.</P>

      <P>I forget the date&mdash; whether the provision was for a month before the passing of the Act or not. But I know that it is comprehensive enough to include any tenancy likely to be in contemplation at the time of the passing of the Act or any tenancies which have been created since the passing of the Act.  No owner is in a position to create a tenancy since the passing of the Act.  Deputy Hennigan raised the old point about demonstration farms, and Deputy Gorey emphasised the point that it was demonstration farms that were referred to and not experimental farms.  What is the position as Deputy Hennigan set it out? You may have ten people from a parish in a county turning up to a lecture.  In that same county you are to have a 50-acre farm which is not to be an experimental farm but a demonstration farm, and by a demonstration farm is to be understood a farm worked on ordinary commercial lines.  Of that 50-acre farm, there are to be 10 acres devoted to tillage, 15 acres to meadow and 25 acres to grazing.  It is to be a good farm, worked on commercial lines.  Ten acres tillage is rather high for a 50-acre holding; it represents <Col N="1825" /> one-fifth of the holding.  The tillage is to be well done.  We are to have really good mangolds and turnips.  The land is to be properly tilled, manured and fertilised and the drills are to be well opened.  The oats are to be well sown and there is to be clean land.  And that farm is to be run on commercial lines.  We are to do none of the foolish things that we do in Athenry.  We are not to experiment in three or four varieties of mangolds and lose money on the experiment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson has got to the point.  A good farmer is of real value to the district.  A good farmer in a parish can do more than the Department of Agriculture within that parish, but he will only touch that parish, and the State would want to have 10 or 11 farms of that sort in a county, run at tremendous cost.  And for nothing.  I do really doubt whether that would be as useful as efficient instructors who will, after all, be able to get in touch with good farmers, <Col N="1826" /> people who are capable of appreciating and of receiving instruction, and whose farms will become demonstration farms. Not a single one of the gentlemen playing cards on that occasion would turn up to look at a demonstration farm run by the State.  And even if they did, what would they say?  They would say: &ldquo;It is easy for them to have a good farm when they have the State behind them.  We do not believe the accounts are right.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If you have to pay a superintendent, and if you have to pay all the others the salaries that you pay first-class technical men and women, the profits will soon disappear.  Then you have the question of hours and pensions and general regulations.  I make no secret of it.  Farming cannot be successfully done by the State for one hundred and one reasons, and no State, so far as I know, that has ever considered the question, has ever attempted it.  The real business of the State is in the direction of experimental farming, and the day an experimental farm pays it should be closed.  It is not conducting experiments.  No experimental farm is carrying out experiments which are worth anything if it does not make nine failures for every successful experiment.</P>

      <P>Níl agam le rádh acht cupla fochal ar an gceist seo mar tá <Col N="1827" /> gach Teachta annso, beagnach, ar aon intinn liom.  I desire to say that I am very pleased with the unanimity with which my motion has been received on all sides of the House.  I made it perfectly clear, in my opening remarks, that the object I had in view was to get an assurance from the Minister that the division and distribution of these lands would be expedited.  The Minister accepted my motion and, at the same time, intimated that a change in method was contemplated, whereby 200,000 or 250,000 acres would be divided next year, instead of 40,000 or 45,000 acres, divided under the old arrangement.  This change will probably have the effect of bringing about the result I desire.  At all events it is something in the nature of an experiment, and naturally I must withhold an opinion on its merits until I have some opportunity of gaining an experience of how it will be worked. The only difficulty I foresee is that trouble may arise because of the fact that temporary possession does not necessarily mean that the occupant will eventually become the legal owner. I would suggest to the Minister that great care should be exercised to see that when a tenant is given temporary possession, the Land Commission should be as sure, as it is possible to be, that there is no possibility that he will be removed subsequently from the holding.  There were many points raised in the debate that were outside the scope of my motion altogether. Consequently it is not my business, as mover of the motion, to deal with any of these points.  The Minister has replied to these criticisms, and I feel that I can really overlook them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one matter I wanted to draw the Minister's attention to in particular.  I made special reference to this matter in speaking to my motion. That is the question of the congestion in the West.  In the days of the British regime it was recognised that this was a special problem and the British authorities constituted a special Board to deal with it.  I feel on account of the peculiar condition of affairs that exists particularly in the congested districts, it will be absolutely necessary <Col N="1828" /> for the Government to take some special measures to deal with this particular problem.  I do not think the Minister or the Government can contemplate, with equanimity, the prospect of voting away large sums of money every year for the purpose of relieving distress and unemployment in these areas.  I think if the problem is to be tackled at all, the first thing that has got to be done is to establish some kind of special machinery for dealing with it.  I feel myself that possibly the functions of Government, at the moment, in these congested are as might very well be co-ordinated under some central control&mdash;I mean education, industries, agriculture, fisheries and so on&mdash;and by that means you would probably be able, eventually, to grapple successfully with the problem. I think that is a matter that deserves special attention.  I do not think any time should be lost in dealing with it because even after all the available land, tenanted or untenanted, has been dealt with the economic problem will still remain.  Deputy Wilson&mdash;I am sorry he is not here&mdash;seems to feel aggrieved because the Minister met this motion in the way he did.  I think Deputy Wilson or any other Deputy could have introduced a motion long since and probably the Minister would meet him in the same way as he met me in regard to this motion.</P>

      <P>This debate has gone on so long that a very large number of questions were asked, and I hope I am not introducing a question that the Minister has answered already. There were a few questions to which I referred in my original statement.  I mentioned fee farm grantees, who come under Section 38.  I want to know from the Minister if he can give me any information, with regard to the number of cases that have been heard and if the redemption value of the fee farm grant was fixed on a purely <Col N="1829" /> arithmetical system or is the value of the land taken into account in fixing it?  That is the first question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is&mdash;is the land security for the rent?  That is the test.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If the land is not security for the rent, will the rent be reduced?</P>

      <P>The other case to which I was referring is the case with regard to reserved holdings where the purchase money exceeds the £3,000 limit.  Will the Minister say what is his policy with regard to such holdings or has he any definite policy?  Is the method by which the land is farmed taken into account?  Owing to the uncertainty which is caused in many cases by the delay in allowing the owner to purchase, what is the Minister's policy in regard to that particular class?  The third question is in regard to what is known as emergency men in the country.  I know the Minister can answer me by saying: &ldquo;Who will tell me whether a man is an emergency man or not?  He holds on the same tenure as the ordinary farmer.&rdquo; The fact remains, however, that there is such a class who are definitely known to be emergency men and who have existed for years on sufferance, who never could become useful members of the social community.  In many cases there are people who were evicted from the land in the possession of these emergency men.  I would suggest that <Col N="1830" /> the Land Commission, having authority to take over any land for the purposes of division, should select such places and should dispossess such men, of course, after granting compensation.</P>

      <P>I answered the first question.  In regard to the second question concerning farms of a £3,000 limit, the Land Commission have power to make larger advances provided the owner puts up a certain amount of the purchase money, and they will certainly take into consideration how he has farmed his land.  In regard to the third question, we are all emergency men in a sense, if we go back far enough.  It is a question of how long.</P>
