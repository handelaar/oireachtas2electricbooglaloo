      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether any pension or compensation has been awarded to ex-R.I.C. men who resigned or were dismissed, and who were shown to have given at the time of their dismissal or resignation less than four years' service, and, if so, whether he can state the number of such awards and the reasons for giving such awards, seeing that four years' service was deemed generally essential to entitle a man to compensation or pension.</P>

      <P>Pensions have been awarded under Section 5 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, in four cases in which the service in the R.I.C. was less than four years.  In three of these cases the resignation took place during the conscription crisis of May-June, 1918, and was proved to have been intimately connected with the anti-conscription movement; in the fourth case the man resigned in May, 1920, in the early stages of the active campaign against the British, and gave immediate proof of his national sympathies by services rendered to the Volunteers.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that Gárda Michael Devins, of Nunstown, Drumcliffe, Co. Sligo, sustained an injury to his leg while engaged in digging a trench at Clonskea Castle in August, 1922; that in June, 1924, the leg was again injured as a result of a fall from a bicycle while on duty; that on 20th March, 1925, Devins was discharged as medically unfit after spending a number of weeks in hospital, and whether, in the circumstances, and in view of the fact that his permanent disablement is due to injuries received while discharging his duties as a Gárda, the Minister does not consider that he is entitled either to a pension or gratuity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE (for Minister for Justice)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Gárda Síochána records do not disclose that this man sustained any injury during his period of service in the force.  From the surgeon's report it appears that his discharge from the Gárda was due to tubercular disease of the shin bone, but there is nothing to show from what cause this developed.  He was sent to St. Vincent's Hospital on the 3rd March <Col N="2447" /> last with synovial effusion around the knee, and it transpired, on X-Ray examination, that the condition was caused by tubercular disease of the shin bone.  He was discharged as medically unfit on the 20th March.  I am having further inquiries made in the case and I will communicate the result to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether it is his intention to introduce legislation before the Recess to amend the Unemployment Insurance Acts, so as to enable unemployment benefit to be paid to persons who, through prolonged unemployment, have exhausted their credits.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT (for Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean the whole of the summer and the early part of the winter are to pass, and that people who are disqualified for unemployment benefit through continuous unemployment are to remain a charge upon the poor rate, or upon the charity of the public, or upon what they can take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the President aware that since the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave his reply to Deputy Corish, a considerable number of men have ceased to be eligible to draw benefit, and that the ranks of the unemployed have been added to by some hundreds, perhaps some thousands, in the interval, and does he not think that there is a good case, and that the Government should try to ease the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been looking at the Minister's previous reply. He said in the course of his answer: &ldquo;Having regard to the season of the year, to the measures taken in the Budget <Col N="2448" /> to stimulate employment, and to the present state of the Unemployment Fund, I think it is difficult to argue that these figures necessitate any present extension of benefit.  The persons who have exhausted their rights are persons who have had relatively few contributions paid for them, that is, relatively little insurable employment in the last four and a half years&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;and in having had their actual contribution multiplied already five times, they have exhausted any reasonable claim to be provided for out of the Unemployment Fund.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the President contemplate substituting anything else for the Unemployment Fund, so that the people may be enabled to live?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister had in mind the advantages to be derived from the measures that were outlined in the Budget.  He had also in mind the huge sums that are in course of distribution through the Road Fund and the Building Facilities Act, that was passed this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, the Minister will agree that there are too many men who are out of benefit, so far as unemployment insurance is concerned, for the Government to stand idly by without doing anything for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the President say how he expects men who have been unemployed for months, some of them for over a year, to live until the funds which the President has said are set aside for roads and reconstruction, become available?  Is the President aware that although the county councils have been reformed and certain sums have been allocated to them for road work, the money has not yet been placed at their disposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the President realise that the figures given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the date he answered my last question, are not a true reflex of the situation, and that his figures were based <Col N="2449" /> only on the number of people who made application for benefit in the last benefit year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I must say that if I were to accept all the statements made to me to-day I should have to admit that the country was in an absolutely insolvent state, and I hesitate to admit that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the President not understand that there are 40,000 or 50,000 persons unemployed, that there are 10,000, 15,000 or 20,000 who, within the next few weeks will be out of benefit entirely, and that no provision is being made to meet the needs of these people, very many of whom have been unemployed for months and months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Not through this particular fund, but through other services. Considerable efforts have been made to afford employment.  It is not by reason of benefits from a fund which at present is in an almost insolvent state that this can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether the means come from the Insurance Fund or from other funds, people must live.  We will assume that.  They may die if they wish, but supposing they are to live, how does the President propose that they shall live in the meantime, while he is waiting for these Budget proposals to become active, and operative, and absorbent?  How are the people to carry on?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

    <P>Sub-head (a) of this Vote provides for the allowances at the rate of £30 per month for Teachtai who are not in receipt of salaries as Parliamentary Secretaries.  This year, as last, we have thought it right to provide for the full complement of Teachtai.  I do not suppose it is likely that all the members who have been elected will take their seats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>We thought we ought not to neglect to make provision for their doing what they ought to do.  There is a slight saving under sub-head (b)&mdash;&ldquo;Travelling Expenses of Teachtaí.&rdquo; That is based on the experience of last year.  In the case of the Seanad there is provision for the total number of Senators and there is again a small reduction in the amount provided for travelling expenses.  That is also based on last year's experience.  Sub-head (e) shows no very great change.  There is a certain amount of increase due to increments.  Amongst the additions to the staff has been that of a shorthand-typist, who was found to be necessary owing to the considerable rush of work that was experienced all along during the year.  There are also twelve cleaners employed here who were not employed last year.  Against that there is a disappearance of the item for allowances for the service of porters, engine man, attendants and cleaners of the staff of the Royal Dublin Society, which amounted to £600 last year. With the disapperance of the R.D.S. from these buildings, provision for the House maintenance comes directly in the ordinary way on this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is provision for one junior executive officer this year as against three last year.  As a matter of fact, only one was appointed.  The provision for three last year was in anticipation of requirements.  It was found, however, that it was unnecessary to appoint more than one.  As to the item of telephones and telegrams, the sum of £100 is put down for telegrams as a precautionary measure, in case it were necessary to communicate with members of the Oireachtas by telegram for any reason during the year.  Last year the expenditure on telegrams was only £4. It may be that there will be no greater expenditure this year, but it was felt desirable to include provision in case it were necessary.  The figure for telephones seems to be fairly high, but there is a large number in the building, and there is a considerable amount of telephoning from them.  The contribution of the Saorstát Eireann Inter-Parliamentary Union to the Central Body at Geneva appears here.  This body has already received a contribution from State funds.  I am sure it is a very estimable body, but on reading the file I discovered that they managed to get the money without stating, in writing at any rate, just exactly what is the work and the importance of the <Col N="2455" /> Inter-Parliamentary Union, which was a feat on which they are probably to be congratulated.</P>

      <P>On sub-head (a), I should like to raise a question as to the Deputies who do not attend the Dáil.  I do not mean the Deputies who belong to a certain party which has decided not to send representatives into the Dáil.  I refer to certain Deputies who are well-known to members and who are giving very poor attendance. I know one or two and I think that they have not attended for months.  I would suggest that some steps should be taken in the matter.  It is not right that Deputies elected by the people, and who have agreed to accept the allowance for expenditure, should continue to occupy that position, draw the allowance and give no service whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to point out to the Deputy that the Constitution provides in the first place that the Oireachtas shall provide payment for its members.  There is also a statutory enactment providing for payment of a certain allowance, and we are carrying out the provisions of that particular Act.  I do not know if the Deputy was a member when it was passed, but that would be the occasion to make provision for such recalcitrant members, if they can be called that, who do not turn up.  I do not think it is a matter which, even if it had been provided for, it would be easy to manage.  However, the fact is that there is a statutory obligation on the Minister for Finance to pay those <Col N="2456" /> members, and, as far as I know, there has been no machinery provided to show in what way members attend.</P>
      <P>On the occasion of this Vote, I take the opportunity with very much regret to inform the Dáil that the Ceann Comhairle is at present incapacitated from attending, and will be so for two or three weeks, or more, possibly.  He has not been in very good health, and I took the liberty of advising him, in accordance with the advice he had previously received from his medical advisers, that he should take a holiday. I am sure I took that action with the approval of all the Deputies, and that we will express the hope that he will be able to return to his duties shortly, fully restored to health.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity of asking, what is a member of this House?  When do they fulfil the conditions and become members?  Certain conditions have to be complied with. First, they have to be elected, then they have to come here and subscribe to the Constitution and sign the roll. There is a good deal of doubt as to the position of those who have not come into the Dáil, and as to the proper procedure to adopt&mdash;whether to leave it as it is or try to meet the situation.  It is quite plain that unless all the conditions are complied with there are only a limited number who are really members of the Dáil.  It is questionable whether some of the seats have not been automatically vacated.  I have been asked to get some information on this head, and I take this opportunity to ask for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No Act has been passed declaring that a Deputy must comply with the terms of the Constitution within a given period.  It has been left over.  It would be open to anyone on the last or any of the final days of the sitting of the Dáil to enter the House and become a member. There are provisions in the Payment of Members Act, I believe, stipulating from what period any allowance would be paid, but other than that, there is nothing provided for.  The other question is a political question, and my personal view is that it is better to let <Col N="2457" /> those matters rest.  It is, after all, a question for the constituencies: if they are dissatisfied with the persons they have elected.  They have elected them. Certain sections in the country, under the Constitution and under the proportional representation system, have the right, if they so desire, of electing persons who would not take their seats in the Dáil.  An interference with that just now would, in my view, be rather unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have previously expressed here what my views were on the question of proportional representation for any constituency returning more than one member&mdash;which applies to every constituency&mdash;that an election which is brought about either by death or resignation is not fair to the particular section of the community that sent the particular member here.  Let us take, as an instance, the Independent members, apart from those representing Trinity College.  A by-election in any constituency would, in the majority of cases, not result in the return of a person who would represent the particular section of the community which had previously returned an Independent member.  In my view, that is unfair; but that view is not shared by others. If Deputies would wish me to be more explicit, I would take as an illustration a Deputy representing, say, the Chamber of Commerce in Dublin or the Dublin Port and Docks Board&mdash;a man of that type having a city seat and vacating it.  It is unlikely that at a by-election a representative of the same group would be elected.  Such Deputies represent something a little different from what is called the majority party, and my view is that you disturb the essence of proportional representation if you place upon the shoulders of the whole electorate the responsibility of returning a Deputy in such a case.  Probably a supporter of the majority party would be returned, while the person vacating the seat might be a minority member. It appears to me a better method of selection, as long as proportional representation is the method of election, to allow the particular sections responsible for the nomination of the original Deputy to nominate his successor, and to have his co-option moved in the Dáil. <Col N="2458" /> That view is not accepted by other people, but I think it is the essence of proportional representation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Under sub-head (e), I would like to raise a few points.  The Minister's opening statement has been so full that it leaves very little room for general criticism.  I want to call attention to the sums set down, of £600 and £350, for a librarian and assistant librarian for the Oireachtas.  I do not think £950 would be at all too much to pay if Deputies and Senators were able to go to the library and get the help which they may need on certain subjects.  At present that situation does not exist.  I do not know if I am exceptionally ignorant, but I have to admit that I do not know where the librarian is to be found.  I do not know whom I can turn to to find out provisions in British Acts or in British Parliamentary papers.  I suppose the librarian is somewhere in the building, but there is no indication, to the ordinary member, as to where he can find him or whether he can get any help from him if he does succeed in finding him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our library, which is a very small one, is not, I think, very well arranged. Certain papers are filed but others are left lying about loosely.  That applies to the cost-of-living papers.  They are not filed but are left lying about the room.  You may take up one which will be for October and the next you take up may be for May.  Again, books disappear from the library, at times, without any indication as to where they are gone.  Last year, after a good deal of agitation, we succeeded in having a collection of British Acts placed there.  Two days ago these British Acts disappeared.  I suppose they have been removed to some other <Col N="2460" /> part of the building but there is no notice that these Acts can be consulted somewhere else.  If we are to vote £950 to this service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask for a fuller statement of the position in regard to the library.  As regards the librarian, Deputy Cooper's question, unless I am very much mistaken, answers itself in the arrangements now being made for an office for the librarian.  At all events, that was the information I got yesterday when I inquired as to what was the object of the carpentry work that was proceeding. I would like if the President, in reply, would state what books are being brought into the library, where those books come from, where these Acts that have disappeared have gone to and what is being done to put the library on a footing commensurate with the Parliament of this country.  Even as it is, the books that are there&mdash; wherever they have come from&mdash;do not exactly constitute the kind of library that one would think ought to be possessed by this Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This service is one that has been interrupted by reason of the fact that the accommodation available for the Oireachtas has been delayed.  Now that Leinster House is definitely devoted to the Oireachtas, I understand that arrangements are being made for the setting up of the library.  The library will consist, in the main, of the books that constituted the Castle Library, and I understand that the Ceann Comhairle will be responsible for making application for such Acts as are needed by Deputies or Senators, in the course of their duties. I should think that by the time the Dáil reassembles in the autumn, the library will be functioning to the satisfaction of members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the President has missed the point of Deputy Cooper's request.  Provision <Col N="2461" /> has been voted for the librarian and assistant librarian for two, or perhaps three years, but we do not know which officer to apply to for information with regard to the library, such as it is.  I think some information is due us on this matter.  I do not think the matter was raised in previous years.  We were hoping that the library would be made available and that it would be possible to get access to the volumes that are now in the Castle Library.  I think it is due to us that we should have some information as to the librarian, where his office is, how he can be found and what his functions are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The librarian's office at present is in the Castle.  The names of the librarian and assistant librarian were, I think, given to the Dáil before.  Mr. Kenny, known as a writer as &ldquo;Sean Gall,&rdquo; is librarian, and Alderman Kelly is assistant librarian. I take it that both officers will be responsible to the Ceann Comhairle through the Clerk of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Castle Library will meet our needs. Presumably, there have been no additions to the Castle Library since 1921, and the essence of a Parliamentary library is that it should be up to date. What we need are such documents as the Report of the Cost-of-Living Committee in Great Britain.  We should, too, have access to the new British Pensions Bill, in case the Labour Deputies desire to draft and bring in a similar measure.  I do not say that we require all the British Acts, but we require a great many of them.  The smaller British Statutes we may not need, but they would be very useful to us if we could get them.  Then we should have the Year Books of the various dominions&mdash;Canada, New Zealand, and so on.  I believe these Year <Col N="2462" /> Books are somewhere in the building at present.  I raised that point last year, and the Ceann Comhairle told me that they were in the building, but that there was no means of making them available.</P>
      <P>I think there has been too much delay in connection with the library. We took over Leinster House nearly six months ago, and the delay that has occurred has been a very great handicap on private Deputies, as compared with Ministers.  A Minister can send his private secretary to the National Library or elsewhere in search of the material he requires, but a private Deputy has to do his own research work, and he is labouring under immense difficulties at present.  If we are to work the library, I think the responsibility should not be left solely on the Ceann Comhairle.  He should be assisted by a Library Committee, representing all Parties.  They will be able to see that the books that they require are procured. It is a somewhat onerous responsibility, and the Ceann Comhairle should have the assistance of members drawn from all sides of the Dáil, so that they may indicate what books and papers they require.  I should say that what we require are Parliamentary papers, census returns and statistics, rather than a library of books.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind Deputy Cooper that while Leinster House has been in our possession for six months, it was only at its last meeting, or second last meeting, that the Seanad was accommodated here. There was a physical difficulty in providing for the library.  It is now, however, on the point of completion.  All those books and Acts and papers are to be had.  They are here, and they will be available as soon as the institution itself is in working order.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Vote, it will be observed from the details given in part 3 of the Estimate, that some changes have been made.  A reduction of £200 in the amount of the provision for Parliamentary Secretaries is due to the reduction of the salary of one of them from £1,200 to £1,000 inclusive. That was effected when Deputy Dolan was appointed in room of Mr. McCarthy.  The allowance for private secretary for the President has been eliminated.  The officer who was in receipt of this allowance has returned to his normal duties and the work of private secretary is performed by the Secretary of the Executive Council. The lower Executive officer and the allowance which was formerly paid to him as assistant private secretary has disappeared from the Estimate.  This officer has been promoted to the higher Executive grade and continues to act as assistant private secretary.  Three temporary clerks included in last year's Estimate are replaced by three clerical officers and the result is, as will be observed from part 3 of the Estimate, a saving in the actual expenditure for the current financial year.  Expenses for travelling last year were approximately £540, and of this £85 was for travelling within the Saorstát and the balance&mdash; £455&mdash;for travelling abroad, principally to London in connection with various conferences.  It is impossible to foresee, with any degree of accuracy, when conferences of this nature will be required, but it is estimated that £750 will cover such items as may arise during the coming year.  It is to be borne in mind that in addition to the actual expenses of the President and staff of the Council, there are also charged under this sub-head all travelling expenses incurred by other Ministers or Secretaries on State business which pertains to the Executive Council as a whole, rather than to their own particular department.  The item of incidental expenses comprises newspapers, periodicals, advertisements and many other small items which are not otherwise provided for.  As regards item E (Maintenance of Motor Car) for which £700 is down, there is an arrangement being made for the present year, as an experiment, that there should be a fixed allowance of £500. That sum would include the depreciation on the car, which would be provided for by the President, road tax, insurance, etc.  It will also include the cost of petrol, oil, tyres, etc., for official journeys.  The estimated mileage is 20,000.  Of that sum of £500, £300 is for overhead charges, including depreciation, road tax, insurance, etc., and £200 is for running expenses.  That means that the figure of £200 for special repairs will be no longer necessary. It will be observed also that there is provision for two chauffeurs at £4 per week each.  In future, the chauffeurs for the President's car will be provided by the Army.  This will represent a reduction on the Vote of £416; but that is really a paper reduction, as the cost of the chauffeur on the Army strength will amount to the same figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the President if he contemplates that the items for two A.D.C.'s are to be permanent.  I appreciate the importance of maintaining the dignity of the President of the Executive Council, with respect to A.D.C.'s, on the same level as that of the Governor-General. I do not know whether there is any deliberate rivalry in this matter.  One is tempted to think there may be some. I take it that I am to assume that the reference made in favour of the appointment of such officers in the case of the Governor-General is equally applicable in respect to officers of this character in the case of the President. It does occur to one that, inasmuch as the President is in and around this building for about twelve hours a day, and I suppose, if he is a wise man, he tries to sleep seven or eight hours per night, there are very few hours of the day when the protection which these <Col N="2465" /> officers could give him would be needed.</P>
      <P>I do suggest it is too great a charge to be borne for so small a service.  I do not mean by that that the protection required by the President is so small or that the loss would be small if he succumbed to the temptations he might give to certain people; but, for the few hours that he would require that protection, it seems to me an A.D.C. at a salary of £500, rising to £700, with bonus, and an additional A.D.C. paid out of Army funds, plus £3 per week, is too high.  These officers, as well as the officers acting in a similar capacity for the Governor-General, ought at an early date to be dispensed with.  There is, in the Appropriation Account for the year 1923-24, reference to a certain expenditure for petrol.  It is noted as being very excessive, and I surmise that the officers who acted at that time, and who, presumably, have been changed since that time, were responsible for the excessive expenditure on petrol.  A sum amounting to £400 was required for petrol for one car in the year.  The fact that there was that immense expenditure on petrol under the jurisdiction of an officer who was acting as A.D.C. at the time, rather shows that there was not due consideration given to the duties appropriate to this office.  All I would press for is that consideration be given to the question of whether these officers are required, and whether it is intended that they be permanent adjuncts to the office of the President of the Executive Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt very much, unless I am otherwise informed, whether the President ever asked for the protection of those A.D.C's. Whether he did or not, I must say that I cannot see there is any necessity for the continuance of them to-day.  The conditions are such that the President is not so fearfully unpopular as that he is not able to go about through the city and the country just as any ordinary member of the Dáil, or even of the Executive Council.  This first A.D.C., who receives £500 a year does not, I notice, receive any of that from the <Col N="2466" /> Army.  Now, would it not be possible to do in regard to him what it is proposed to do in regard to the President's chauffeurs, namely, that he should also be taken from the Army? If the President does require protection, who would give him better protection than an officer of the National Army?  Furthermore, I do not think that we in this State should be called upon to keep up two rival establishments: a Governor-General with A.D.C's and a President of the Executive Council with A.D.C's.  I think it should be either one or the other.  There are countries much larger than our country, with far greater wealth and resources, who have first Ministers of State in a similar position to the President of the Executive Council, and I do not know whether they have A.D.C's at all or not.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Prime Minister of Great Britain has an A.D.C., and I do not think there is any more necessity for the President of the Executive Council to have them.  If it is considered it is necessary for the protection of the person of the President&mdash;which I altogether scout&mdash;that he should have A.D.C's., I suggest that they should be officers of the Army, paid out of the Army Vote, and, if necessary, give them a small increase upon their Army pay and make it part of Army promotion.  I do not think that in the interests of economy it looks well to have upon the Estimate special officers set aside for this purpose at a time when I do not think anybody would consider there is necessity for it.</P>

      <P>I am not sure that the matter I want to raise comes strictly within this Vote.  I addressed a question to the President on the subject before, but I would like to raise it again, and I am determined that he shall not escape me now.  It is a matter that has a somewhat international bearing.  It is in connection with debts contracted by the British Auxiliary Police Force in this country. When they went around to discharge their debts, they paid fifty per cent. of them, and then proceeded to discharge the other fifty per cent. by the moral persuasion of automatic Colt revolvers. <Col N="2467" /> These debts are still unpaid.  The matter has something of an international flavour, and I think the President is the proper person to say something on it.  What I refer to occurred in Killaloe. When I asked a question about it before, the answer was that the matter could be dealt with through the Colonial or Foreign Office, or some British office.  One letter that I received from the President read as follows: &ldquo;I am desired by the President to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th inst. with enclosures regarding certain unsettled claims with traders in Clare against members of the British Auxiliary Forces, and to say that he is having them dealt with through the Department of Finance on lines already indicated.&rdquo;  That was in January last. The British Auxiliaries have gone for some time.  When they were sent over here they contracted debts while discharging duties for the British authorities. How are the citizens of this State to proceed against people who, possibly, are in Palestine or somewhere else at the moment, unless the Government of this country affords them some protection or takes some action with a view to giving them an opportunity for compensation?  It is very poor compensation to get fifty per cent. of their debts paid and get the remaining fifty per cent in the shape of an automatic revolver.  The President ought to have something to say on that matter.</P>

      <P>Under the same sub-head there is an item for cleaners, messengers and a protective force.  I think we should have some information as to the present position of the protective force.  I understood that the protective force had been demobilised and that the police who were employed under that title had become part of the Gárda Síochána.  The body concerned presumably act in relation to the Government Buildings.  I do not think it is good that we should set an example to private employers in this way, and have a special force outside the ordinary police or military.  I think the Minister for Justice indicated, when talking in connection with recent Bills, that there should be only one armed <Col N="2468" /> force, and I take it this is separate from the ordinary police or Gárda.  I would like to have some information on the matter.</P>

      <P>With reference to the point raised by Deputy Johnson, the protective force is almost demobilised. I think there are only four members remaining and they will be given positions as messengers, or some similar position, as vacancies occur.  The sum that is charged against the President of the Executive Council under this heading is really calculated on the floor space occupied.  The entire cost of cleaning, messengers, and the protective force for Government buildings is something in the nature of £5,000 per annum.  That is divided between various departments on the basis of the floor space occupied by them.</P>

      <P>The term &ldquo;protective force&rdquo; was applied in the beginning and, although the force has long since lost its protective character, the term has been all along used.  Police and military are at the moment doing the duty.  There are two or three items that were mentioned to which I wish to reply.  Deputy Johnson raised the question of expenses connected with petrol for the motor car.  I admit that the car is an expensive one.  As far as I have been able to make out, it gives a rather intermittent return, sometimes four or five miles to the gallon and sometimes fourteen.  I have not been able to discover the particular journey on which it gives fourteen miles, whether it does so going over level ground or down hill.  This service is now a matter for myself since 1st April, and the bills that have been furnished to me in connection with the car would be sufficient to stagger any person under a salary of £4,000 a year.  Last week or the week before there were 48 gallons of petrol consumed.  Though the money for that quantity is relatively small, 48 gallons is really a big <Col N="2469" /> consumption for a week.  The oil consumption bears a very poor proportion to the petrol consumption.  The oil consumption is as high as 1 gallon to every 8 gallons of petrol.  That varies also, and sometimes it runs from 1 gallon of oil to 10 or 12 gallons of petrol.  Anybody with experience of cars will realise that it is a rather expensive item.</P>

      <P>I think it was Deputy Redmond who raised the question of the A.D.C.'s.  When I assumed the office of President I was provided with four officers by the Army.  At that time, of course, conditions were different to what they are now.  Last year, on this Vote, some Deputies expressed the opinion that those officers ought to be continued.  The reason that there are two is that although the number of hours of actual duty may be very small the continuation over a day is pretty long.  I have had them on duty sometimes for 18 hours at a stretch.  I am sure the ordinary officer would require to have a day's rest after such a duty as that. I think they take a day on and a day off.  They are both officers of the Army. The senior officer formerly was attached to General Collins's staff.  He had been for some years with him, and I think it was due to him that he should be appointed. Properly speaking, he is not an Army officer, and properly speaking, I suppose he is.  He was in the Army and on my advice he left and took up what he is entitled to take up, a Civil Service post, having been formerly a civil servant.  He is a civil servant.  At least there are times when he is a civil servant and times when he is an Army officer.  It suits my convenience at any rate that he should be the one sometimes and the other at other times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2470" /> I do not think, from the point of view of danger, that there is as much necessity as might be thought from some of the entries here.  In any case I would be prepared to take the risk if there was any such thing, but I do not think there is.  However, it is held by some people that they should be there and they certainly have done their duty very well.  The allowance that is given to the extra A.D.C. is less than was given to the A.D.C. to the Governor-General, not that there is any rivalry between my institution and that of his Excellency the Governor-General.</P>
    <P>In regard to the matter raised by Deputy Hogan, I think even Deputy Hogan himself would admit, if he were in my place, and I was in his, that he would be very much puzzled by such a matter as he has mentioned.  In the Department of Defence and other Departments we have refused to accept responsibility for the debts of officials, and soldiers or officers of the Army, and I think that the British Government would be in a position to repudiate any charge in connection with the Auxiliaries. Had that matter been brought to our notice immediately after the Treaty was signed, and before these men left the country, I think we would have been able to do something in the matter, but even if it had we could not have forced a settlement.  I heard of no case in which officers or soldiers on active service during the war incurring debts could be brought to book by their respective Ministers of War.  Disciplinary action might be taken against individuals, if information were given in time, but I rather think that if a commissioned officer in the British Army&mdash; Captain Redmond might possibly correct me&mdash;does not pay his debts it is rather difficult to deal with him, from the point of view of the Minister of War.  I believe the traders in question have lost their opportunity by allowing the time to elapse that has elapsed.  It would have been necessary to have acquainted us with this matter so that we could press for a settlement before they left the country.  I doubt if they were truculent, or if we did not get sympathetic consideration, that it would be possible for the British Government <Col N="2471" /> to have interfered in the matter.</P>

      <P>The position is that these people had pass-books and a regular account was kept.  I am informed by an ex-Major of the British Army, who could not possibly be considered as giving anything beyond what was purely a formal statement of the facts to which he is prepared to testify, that these officers went about in full war paint knowing that they were about to leave the town, and asked for the bill.  When it was presented to them they said: &ldquo;Divide that by two.&rdquo; Everybody knows the effect of a British Auxiliary's revolver when it was swinging at his knee.  There was no adequate protection at the time.  These people could do nothing but divide the bill by two and get half.  Is it to be said that the State can afford no protection or provide no compensation for these citizens, where these people were able to get away with the boodle?  I am sure the President appreciates the situation. I am sure he should appreciate it to the extent of making an effort to get the British Colonial Office to see that these people are compensated, because they acted on behalf of the British Government while they were here, and they made the people of that particular town understand that in other matters they were acting on behalf of the British authorities.  In the matter of contracting debts they were also acting on behalf of the British authorities.</P>

      <P>Taking another aspect of the case, this was absolutely loot, and the British Government have refused to accept any liability in respect of loot committed by any of their forces.  In the case of my mother's house, it was raided 73 or 74 times. There was a considerable amount of damage done and a considerable amount of loot took place during that time.  What did the Wood Renton Commission offer?  I believe that she was sent a cheque for £25 to cover 73 or 74 raids.</P>

The unfortunate man, dashing down the road after the officers, said: &ldquo;Will you tell me whether you are confiscating it or looting it?&rdquo;  If it were confiscated he would be paid for it, but if it was looted he would get nothing.</P>

    <P>A question was raised by the Public Accounts Committee in paragraph 31 of their Second Interim Report in regard to the inclusion of the National Insurance Audit in the Exchequer and Audit Department.  This is a matter that will be dealt with in the Minute which will be submitted in connection with that Second Interim Report, and I do not propose to offer any observations in connection with it at the present moment.</P>
    <P>Once or twice during the year some question was raised of delay in furnishing the Comptroller and Auditor-General's Report.  Under the Exchequer and Audit Act of 1866 that Report was due on the 30th of January in each year, but this year it was laid before the House in April.  It should be understood, however, that the delay was due to delay by Government Departments in furnishing their Appropriation Accounts?  As a matter of fact, the Appropriation Account of the Army was not furnished, I think, until the middle of March last, when it ought to have been ready a considerable time before that, certainly by the end of January.  It is hoped that the machinery of Departments will enable them for the future to deal with their financial business in a more expeditious manner to enable them to keep up to date.</P>
    <P>With regard to the various sub-heads of the Vote, there are not any very great changes.  Last July, I think, the Secretary and Director of Audit was put to the maximum of his scale.  He is a very competent and efficient officer; he has most responsible duties to perform, and it was felt that some increase, beyond the scale of salary that he was actually receiving, was required.  I think that there is practically no other change except the employment of a boy, an additional messenger being required.  It will be noticed that three senior auditors are provided.  Various people are provided on scales, and the amounts this year are less than those estimated for last year, where it would seem that they should be greater in view of the fact that increments would be falling due.  But last year, when the Estimates were being prepared, the staff had not actually been appointed, and a certain mean point on the scales was taken as that on which the various people would stand.  As a matter of fact, they stand lower on the scales than was anticipated last year when the Estimate was being made up and when the men had not actually been appointed.</P>
    <P>Very little travelling has been done by the officers of the Exchequer and Audit Department.  That is due largely to the fact that most of their work is naturally done in Dublin at headquarters. There will be, perhaps, a certain amount of additional travelling in the future, because when the local store and supply accounts in the Army have been put into the state that we hope they will be put into this year, officers of the Department will travel for the purpose of carrying out local audits. But so far the Army accounts, local supply accounts, and store accounts have been in such a condition that that travelling did not arise.  Under the other travelling sub-head there is a much larger sum&mdash;that is, under the National Insurance Audit branch.  The auditors of that branch deal with the accounts of various approved societies and have to travel to carry out these audits.  Certain auditing work is done by the British Comptroller and Auditor-General on our behalf, and that is repaid <Col N="2475" /> under sub-head CC.  The accounts that they audit are the R.I.C. pensions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There were other retirements also.  There are the ordinary pensions and the pensions that arose out of demobilisation.  It would not have been possible to allocate certain R.I.C. men as having been Saorstát R.I.C. men, and certain others as having been Northern Ireland R.I.C. men. The pensions are paid by the British Government, and the amount is allocated between Northern Ireland and the Saorstát, on a basis which is really more or less provisional so far, of 75 per cent. and 25 per cent.  The same thing applies in regard to civil servants who had retired before the Treaty; it was not possible to allocate some of the pensions to the Saorstát and some to Northern Ireland.  Consequently the entire pensions are paid by the British Government, and recoupment is made by the Saorstát Government and by the Government of Northern Ireland. The auditing of the accounts of those services is done by the British Comptroller and Auditor-General, and we recoup the cost.  If we were doing any work for the British, recoupment would be made on the same basis.  Certain small items of audit have actually been done for them, but the work involved was so small that the question of any change did not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that there is much ground for criticism on this Vote.  It is mainly a Vote for salaries, and I think we recognise that the responsibilities of the people that are doing this work is very considerable, so that the question of salaries does not very largely arise; that is, considering the responsibility of the Department, members of the staff are not overpaid.  But I would like, on this Vote, to raise a matter which I have already raised in connection with the Post Office.  I do not know whether the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs answered it or not, because <Col N="2476" /> the discussion on his Vote lasted a considerable time, and I may not have been here while he was replying to criticisms. I took the liberty to ask the Minister for Posts, in view of the commercial aspect of his accounts, to express an opinion as to the desirability and the necessity of continuing the bonus system through the whole of the organisation of the State.  I would like to ask the Minister for Finance to express his views on this matter, because in this account the bonus amounts to about £4,000 on salaries of about £7,000.  As far as the accounts are concerned, this bonus system is entirely confusing.  You find in the account a scale for clerks of £60 to £200 for men, and £60 to £150 for women. That is not what they are paid; if you add the bonus the matter wears a completely different aspect.</P>
      <P>I maintain that of all branches of the community the last people who should have this bonus continuing are civil servants.  After all, the Government and their officials are more responsible&mdash;I do not say they are entirely responsible&mdash;than any other part of the community for variations in the cost of living, and they have more power over the cost of living than anybody else.  Why a person should get a salary plus a bonus I do not know.  If the cost of living goes up he suffers nothing, though he does lose something if it goes down.  Everyone of us is in some way concerned with the question of the cost of living, and why ninety-nine-hundredths of the community should have to bear the increased cost of living on their shoulders, while civil servants alone are put in a different position, I cannot understand.  If the cost of living goes up they are recouped; if it goes down, of course they suffer correspondingly.  The whole system is out of date, and some steps ought to be taken to put civil servants on a flat salary, so that they should take their share in the ups and downs in the cost of living figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised this question the other day, and I think Deputy Davin supported his contention regarding the stabilisation of <Col N="2477" /> wages.  There is undoubtedly a good deal to be said in favour of Deputy Hewat's point, and there are differences of opinion amongst those who are in receipt of varying salaries under the bonus system.  But I am very doubtful as to the proposition that the time has arrived when stabilisation should be made.  Is Deputy Hewat, with his experience of commerce and finance, prepared to say that we have now arrived at the stage when the pound sterling will maintain its level, that there will not be fluctuations in the cost of living due to variations in currency; or is he prepared to maintain that prices will be fairly stable from now onwards and that the variations in prices will be less in the future than they have been in the past?  We saw from the cost of living returns of the last two or three quarters that there had been considerable increases for one or two quarters, and then a considerable decrease.  It may be said, and it is claimed by some, that we have arrived at a stage when prices will be more or less stable round about 80 or 90 or 100 points above 1914, though there is a big margin between 80 and 100, but that we have arrived at the stage when prices will be very much less variable than they were since 1914.  I think we have not had sufficient experience to be able to say that prices will be stable.  If a change is made in the Civil Service in respect of the bonus system, does Deputy Hewat advocate that the bonus should be absorbed into the pay at a given date, and if so, at what date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it present prices he is going to assume as the basis of stabilisation? The question would have to be discussed very thoroughly, and I think no decision should be arrived at, either now or in the future, without consultation and conference with the people concerned.  I think that there should be a proper understanding with the officers of the various Departments before any stabilisation takes place.  It is not so simple a proposition as the Deputy may think, and it is not so easily proved as asserted that the time has arrived when there should be an absorption of bonuses into salaries.  I think it might even be contended with <Col N="2478" /> a good deal of force that the bonus system ought to be a permanent part of the scheme of pay; a good case might be made for that proposition.  It is not generally acceptable.  Most people think they would rather gamble on the value of their pound, following the example of commerce, and industry, and finance.  But until we are satisfied that prices are not going to fluctuate in anything like the degree that they have for the last five or seven years, that we are entering a period of stable prices, I think we ought not to make the change that the Deputy advocates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not expect the Minister to do anything in this matter without full consideration.  I raised the question because I think the time is ripe for the consideration of the continuance of bonuses in the Civil Service after they have been abolished everywhere else.  In the case of the Irish railways the wages are all inclusive. Take commercial life.  For a very long time during the war, and after the war, owing to the uncertainty of prices the contract system lapsed.  The contract system to-day is in full force.  I merely bring the matter under the notice of the Minister and the House, and I hope that the Minister will tell me that he will give the matter full consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Hewat that it would be helpful if the bonus could be indicated against the rate of pay.  We see here, for instance: &ldquo;Senior Auditor, £550 to £700, rising by £20.&rdquo;  Unless we are pretty sharp at calculating we do not know what that means in fact.  If we knew that £550 meant £750 when bonus is included, it would help us to appreciate the real merits of these figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the point raised by Deputy Johnson, there is in existence for the use of accountants in Government offices a ready reckoner showing the amount of bonus on each rate of salary, and Deputies could have that.  Under the bonus arrangement scarcely any salary carries bonus much in excess of £200. In certain odd cases it runs to £230 or £240, but generally it does not run much above £200.  Probably on £550 it <Col N="2479" /> would be something like that.  The difficulty about the matter, apart from the fact that there is no certainty that prices are very stable yet, is that the bulk of civil servants have Treaty rights.  We could not merge the bonus in salary and deprive them of the possibility of an automatic increase in case the cost of living went up, without their consent.  If we were to do it without the express consent of civil servants, we would certainly have to fix an inclusive salary so high that they would run no risk of loss and that any court would be so convinced. It seems to me that to fix it in such a way as not to be upset by the courts, or as would secure the agreement of civil servants, would involve making the salary include not bonus according to a cost of living increase of ninety-five points, but, perhaps, one hundred and fifteen or one hundred and ten points.  Certainly if I were to sit down beside a body of civil servants to reach agreement with them for the abolition of bonus, something would have to be given away, and I believe they would certainly have to get a salary fixed that would include bonus at a higher rate than according to ninety-five points.  As long as there is the possibility of fluctuation, I do not think it is practicable to get rid of the bonus by having an inclusive salary.  If we had had four or five years of very small fluctuations, it might be possible to strike a bargain that would be fair and not expensive to the State, but I believe such a bargain could not be struck at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the further point that while there is a possibility of variations that are appreciable, there is a good deal of justice in the bonus system.  The people who benefit particularly by the bonus system are not those who can be held to have any great responsibility for policy or administration.  The higher officers get a comparatively small amount of bonus.  It does not generally run to more than a few pounds over two hundred.  Those who really benefit are the persons whose basic salary is small.  Persons whose <Col N="2480" /> basic salary is £91 or under have a bonus calculated at 130 per cent., with a deduction of 1/26 for every five points that the cost of living falls below 130.  That means that their bonus is substantial, amounting practically to 100 per cent.  Over £91 and below £200, I think the calculation is based not on 130, but 90 per cent.  Over £200 it is based on 60 per cent.  The scale is detailed in the front of the Estimates. Then there are special cuts for salaries above £500.  I think that the maintenance of the bonus system for the present is absolutely dictated by the Treaty rights that civil servants have.</P>

      <P>The only objection is that the Estimates are published for the year and you might have different rates of bonus during that period.  At present it is 95 points.  Before the end of the year it may be 90, or it may be 100.</P>

      <P>No, but of course you would have great difficulties if you made a distinction like that between men sitting side by side in one office. The great bulk of the civil servants have Treaty rights.  Those who came in since are often on lower scales, with less leave.  Their conditions are not conditions which could be regarded as too favourable, like those arrived at in England in the period after the war. But if we add to these less favourable conditions the abolition of the bonus, we might have friction and lack of harmony which would not be worth the saving.</P>

    <P>As Deputies are aware, the primary functions of this Department are the assessment and collection of various duties: customs and excise duties, estate duties, stamps, excess profits duty, which is a disappearing item; corporation profits duty, income tax and super tax.  In addition to these primary duties, the services of the Department are utilised for many other matters.  The stamping branch, for instance, is responsible for the manufacture of postage stamps, national health and unemployment insurance stamps, entertainment and other revenue stamps, and various impressed stamps.  It prints the old-age pensions orders, stamps prepaid postal stationery, prints savings certificates, etc.  The customs and excise branch has also many duties in addition to the collection of revenue and the suppression of smuggling.  It does the bulk of the work in connection with old-age pensions, and the cost of that particular work amounts to about £91,000 per annum.  On the customs side the services of the staff are utilised for a great many matters not affecting revenue. They prevent, for instance, the importation of reprints of copyright works, the importation of obscene literature, goods contravening the Merchandise Marks Act, anthrax-infected goods, dangerous drugs, illegal medical drugs, fictitious stamps and coins and dyes for their manufacture; fish illegally caught, lottery advertisements, unsound meat, matches containing white phosphorus.  It also has duties in connection with the enforcement of health and quarantine regulations, with the importation of explosives, alien emigration at certain ports, wreck inquiries, and the custody and disposal of wreck; the collectors are generally receivers of wreck, and other officers are deputy receivers; registration of ships and fishing-boats, engagement and discharge of seamen, as agents for the Department of Industry and Commerce; collection of light dues, harbour dues, quit rents, publicans' licence duties, etc.</P>
    <P>The increase in this Vote comes mostly under subhead (a) and subhead (e), which are of a like nature.  As to the £55,740 coming under sub-head (a), the following are the factors:&mdash;First, normal annual increments of salary. These amount to £16,576.  That may seem a very large sum for salary increments, but it must be remembered that this is practically a new service. There was very little customs work done here before the establishment of the Saorstát.  Some of the estate duty work and the super-tax work was not done in this country.  New and additional establishments had to be provided to deal with this work.  That means that men who were experienced had to be promoted to controlling grades, and to take charge of new recruits. The result is that very few men are actually at their maximum. The £16,576 due to increments in salaries is divided over 1,756 people.  The average increment, therefore, amounts to about £9.  There is a bonus increase, due partly to new staff and partly to increase in the rate, of £4,654. There was additional staff employed mainly as a result of last year's Finance Act, amounting to £15,300. There was additional overtime, due largely to the same cause&mdash;£12,450.</P>
    <P>The new duties last year did result in a very considerable addition to the work of the revenue department.  We reduced the duty on tea, but we did not abolish it, and no reduction of <Col N="2483" /> work was occasioned by that change. We imposed new duties on boots, soap, candles, motor bodies and glass bottles. These were <i>ad valorem</i> duties which involved a great deal more labour than specific duties.  It is easy to weigh out so many hundredweights or tons of sugar, and pass them through.  Chemical tests may have to be made out, but the amount of work involved is comparatively small.</P>
    <P>Importations are likely to be very often in large quantities.  But when you deal with <i>ad valorem</i> goods, documents have to be examined, the value has to be established, and the amount of labour involved is very considerable indeed.  As a matter of fact, it was estimated that, in Customs officers alone, apart from preventive men and clerical labour, the changes in last year's Budget would necessitate the employment of forty additional Customs officers.  We got those forty additional Customs officers by taking men away from certain other duties.</P>
    <P>The collection of arrears under Schedules D and E was formerly done by Customs and Excise officers.  That work was put on the Collectors of Income Tax, who had previously only concerned themselves with Schedules A and B.  It was possible by employing additional collectors and by giving existing collectors additional pay for extra work, to free some forty Customs and Excise officers for work at the Ports.  But even with those additional forty, the staff was very short.  Since our own Customs Service was set up, there has been hardly a Customs officer who has got anything like his full leave.  Some of them have scarcely got leave at all.  Various types of work, partly in the nature of preparation of complete statistics, but of such a character that an officer with technical knowledge is required to deal with it, has actually fallen into arrear.  We have all the time been very short of Customs officers.  We had sixty officers on loan from the British Service.  Most of them have gone back.  By 1st October, they will have all gone back. We have recruited certain numbers by examination.  We had one examination in August, 1923, when we recruited <Col N="2484" /> fifty men.  We had an examination in January, 1924, from which we recruited fifty men, and an examination in October, 1924, from which we recruited forty men.  We would have taken a great many more but only forty men, or thereabouts, qualified.  The examination was rather disappointing in the quality of the candidates who came forward.</P>
    <P>With the imposition of the new Customs duties and in view of the shortage that already existed, it was necessary to secure additional officers to those provided for in the Estimates. We have had a Selection Board sitting and have taken from various Departments, clerical officers of a good type, with some years' experience of official work.  About fifty of those are being promoted to be Customs officers and it is believed that in the course of six months or a year they will be able to give fairly satisfactory service and will enable us to deal more expeditiously and satisfactorily with the public.  They will also enable us to give members of the staff their leave and prevent the state of discontent and the possibility of breakdown that must be present when men are, for too long a period, overworked and denied their leave.</P>
    <P>Sub-head (B) covers travelling and subsistence allowances.  There is a slight reduction under that sub-head, due to various economies and to closer scrutiny and greater care.  Travelling and subsistence allowances are payable to officers whose duty involves the covering of large areas.  The average annual mileage travelled on duty by an Excise officer is about 6,000.  A good deal of that is over roads that are not served by any system of public conveyances. That involves the use or hireage of motors.  There is a very wide distribution of the Revenue staffs.  They are in all parts of the country and they are dealing with money and carrying out responsible duties.  To get efficiency and uniformity of action, adequate provision has to be made for inspection. That involves considerable travelling and subsistence allowances.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C deals with removal expenses. Where officers are removed <Col N="2485" /> from one part of the country to another which course is necessary where you have Departments with large provincial establishments, they are paid the reasonable vouched costs of removing themselves and their families and effects to whatever new station they may be assigned.</P>
    <P>The next item (D) is due to a slight change in the commission paid the distributor of stamps, who is the Secretary of the Dublin Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E deals with allowances to assessors and collectors of income tax. The increase arises out of last year's Budget, and from the necessity of employing more tax collectors, in lieu of the Customs and Excise officers who were freed from their income tax collection. That involved the addition of a sum of £8,750.  The other part of the increase is attributable to the fact that, in last year's Finance Act, provision was made for remuneration of the banks for keeping records of British dividents paid, and for deduction and remission of tax on foreign dividends.  That amounts to £12,000. As Deputies are aware, if taxpayers or receivers of dividends are willing that particulars of the dividend paid should be furnished by the banks to the Revenue authorities&mdash;dividends that have suffered British tax&mdash;then, the banks are not bound to deduct our income tax.  The result is that people have not tax deducted at the source but are assessed in the ordinary way. At all events, they do not suffer the double deduction of tax.  That involves a very considerable amount of work on the banks.  As a matter of fact, the banks have supplied nearly 150,000 separate statements, and it is really more troublesome to supply statements than simply to deduct the tax.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F deals with carriage on parcels and so forth.  That is an item that requires very little explanation in the case of a Department like the Revenue Department, which has offices all over the country.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G deals with machinery and repairs in the Stamping Branch.  I have already dealt, to some extent, with the working of the Stamping Branch.  It has only been set up since <Col N="2486" /> we took over the duties, and the expense of the first years in connection with the acquisition of plant, dies, and other types of machinery were greater than they will normally be.  There will probably be a further decrease.  The next sub-head deals with uniform clothing.  We have a considerable number of officers in uniform belonging to the preventive and watcher grades, and the messenger staffs also wear uniform.  The number is, I think, 345.</P>

      <P>Are the uniforms got through the Post Office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They are got in the way that the Gárda Síochána and other uniforms are got.  There is a slight reduction in that.  The next is a minor item&mdash;the getting of copies of the Poor-Law Valuations from local authorities for the purpose of Schedules A and B assessments.  The quinquennial writing up of books took place last year, and the amount was larger than normally.  These particulars are got from the local authorities, to avoid flooding out the Valuation Office at a particular period of the year.  It is found more satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anything that requires any lengthy explanation under Sub-head K.  There was considerable expense involved for overhaul of a launch, and it is not expected that it will require anything this year. Bicycles, for land patrol, are really paid for out of Sub-head K.  There are some fifty bicycles supplied to various officers engaged in preventing smuggling along the frontier, and there is an allowance of one shilling per week for maintenance of the bicycle.</P>
      <P>Sub-head L provided for technical equipment of various branches of the Revenue service&mdash;hydrometers, gauging apparatus, cyclometers, and delicate instruments dealing with weighing apparatus.  It also provides for the cost of the paper for the adhesive stamps in connection with the entertainment tax.  I do not think there is any explanation of the variation needed.  It is casual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head M provided for legal expenses other than the salaries of the solicitor and staff.  They include such <Col N="2487" /> items as counsel's fees and costs in actions that may be decided against the Department.  Deputies are probably aware that the administration of the Income Tax Laws involves a great amount of litigation.  The Department is continually in the Courts.  Apart from that, there is the question of rewards for officers and others who succeed in detection of offences against the Revenue.  Where the amount exceeds £50, special sanction of the Minister for Finance is required.  This is a Department in which, if there were more of that very useful class of citizen &mdash;useful, in the new circumstances&mdash; the common informer, it would be a great advantage.  The highest award paid during the year amounted to £300, in a case in which there were many thousands of pounds of revenue involved and recovered.</P>
    <P>Sub-head N deals with minor items, such as the laundering of towels and dusters and commission in respect of bank drafts, which officers get for the purpose of sending duty to the Commissioners. It also includes things like newspapers and periodicals.</P>
    <P>In regard to Sub-head O, offices are in many cases situate in rural districts. It is very often impossible for the Board of Works in these districts to find suitable accommodation for the purpose.  If the officer has a private house and it is found desirable to use a room in that private house as the office of the Department, an allowance is made to him for it.  This is a very economical solution of the problem of accommodation in many cases.</P>
    <P>Under Sub-head P there is a large increase.  That is due to one item of default which occurred just about the time the Estimates were being made up.  It was default on the part of a collector of income tax.  His bond amounted to £2,500, but the defalcations, the amount of which has not yet been fully established, substantially exceeded that, and will have to be borne this year.  The man has, so far, succeeded in evading arrest.  I do not know whether the Appropriations-in-Aid show any very great difference from last year.  The amount for the special <Col N="2488" /> attendance of Customs officers is considerably larger, but the other items are as they were last year.</P>
    <P>So far as it can be estimated, the cost of the new duties imposed in the 1924 Budget come to about £25,000. There are other increases in the costs of the Department due to circumstances arising from the fact that staffs were already short.  There will probably be a like increase as a result of the Budget changes this year, the new taxes imposed, and the fact that they are taxes which are much more difficult and more expensive to collect than taxes such as the tax of 4d. or 5d. a pound on tea.  There is no saving in staff by reason of the reduction in sugar duty.  There is no more expense in collecting 1d. a pound on sugar as against 2¾d.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very big and complicated account, and I do not think that I am in a position to criticise all the items in detail.  This involves a tremendous lot of salaries in Departments doing different work in connection with Customs and Excise, and in connection, generally, with the Revenue Department.  As regards the salaries here, the amount shows a net increase of £61,960.  I think the Minister's explanation indicates that that increase is only the beginning of a series of increases, and I think that is right. I think the importance of a Vote of this kind lies in the large total.  We must recognise that as far as this account is concerned, it is only in its infancy.  I do not wish to deal with this matter as being a question of free trade versus protection.  I wish to draw attention to the swelling nature of the account.  First of all, it is a naturally swelling Department, because you have a large number of persons employed and, without any addition to the staff, those persons would themselves be entitled to increased remuneration and that will automatically swell the account as we go along. In addition to that, you have had a large number of extra people taken on in this Department during the last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister must recognise, as far as the Customs are concerned, there is real need to facilitate the <Col N="2489" /> public more than they have been facilitated up to the present.  It is not unnatural that at the inception of a new tax arrangements take some time to be completed and the public, in the meantime, must suffer considerable inconvenience. I suppose that is unavoidable; but I think the Minister will be the last to deny, in connection with the taxes that have been put on, that an enormous amount of difficulty has been experienced by the general public, partly, no doubt, through their own fault in not making themselves conversant with the rules and regulations that apply, but also by reason of the more or less chaotic state of the different offices that are dealing with matters affecting the Customs.  Go inland, and come to Excise matters, then take the arrangements in connection with the ports of the country as a whole, and the progress of obtaining revenue and the policy of placing a duty on goods becomes apparent.  Of course there is always an effort&mdash;a rather human effort&mdash;to avoid paying these taxes if it can be done.  I think there is a necessity for examining thinly populated districts, very wide areas, where smuggling would be comparatively easy, and where the detection of smuggling and protection against smuggling will be harder.  In that direction I think the growth of this Department may be very severe.</P>
    <P>While we recognise this is a large amount to spend in connection with the Revenue Department&mdash;£802,530&mdash;I am really afraid that that amount is likely to increase largely.  Perhaps the Minister could give us some general opinion as to what the growth in the personnel of this Department is likely to be. Possibly he may be able to say that the present staff and the existing regulations will deal with anything that is likely to arise out of the imposition of taxes.  That would be a very reassuring statement.  It would not be unfair to ask him to give us some indication of what the different departments are likely to require in the way of additional staffs and to indicate the expense that would be necessary to gain the efficiency needed if the taxes that have been imposed are going to be safeguarded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I did mention that and I do not believe I could say more on the question at the moment. I think the changes made by this year's Budget will involve a cost of something around an additional £25,000 on the Customs side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder does the Minister really think that the additional £25,000 will place everything on a satisfactory basis?  If he does, that would be quite a reassuring statement. If, in the coming year, it is going to cost only an additional £25,000, I would be quite satisfied.  I would be satisfied if it is limited to that amount.  I rather anticipate, however, that as our experience grows we will find that the various protective measures that will have to be taken will swell the account to a very much higher figure.  I would be very much reassured if I thought the amount would be limited to £25,000. It is very hard to analyse the figure of £600,850 for salaries.  I suppose that includes bonuses.  It covers such a wilderness of salaries of varying amounts that it would be very difficult to criticise them in detail.  From a superficial examination there does not seem to be anything that would need particular criticism.  I have taken the whole sum as a basis for the argument that I have put forward in regard to the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Grave complaints have been made in connection with Customs delays at the quays.  Complaints are not confined to delays alone, but to the injury that goods suffer through the delay.  I had a case brought to my attention this morning in which one of our large houses imported a quantity of perishable apparel.  This apparel was lying for some days, if not longer, on the quays.  There was some difficulty in finding the consignment.  Considerable delay arose in that way and, after the consignment had been found, there was further difficulty in getting the amount of the duty assessed.  After these primary difficulties had been got over and the form received by the consignee showing the amount of the duty, then the consignee's servant had to go with that form from the quays to an office in Beresford Place.  There was <Col N="2491" /> quite a queue outside this office in Beresford Place and added to all the other delays was nearly a half day's delay on the part of the official at Beresford Place in connection with the paying of the duties.</P>
      <P>That is a case that was only brought to my notice this morning.  It is one I am sure of hundreds, if not of thousands. That is a matter that ought to have immediate attention.  Take the case of wearing apparel.  It is a very perishable commodity.  It suffers very seriously if left for any time in a damp store and it is obvious that all these stores along the North Wall are not at all what one might look upon as of an ideal character.  The delay from that point of view alone is very serious, but furthermore, these commodities are required for what is known as a season trade.  At different periods of the year different commodities are in request and if there is any holding up of these commodities in the Customs a large amount of trade is lost and traders suffer considerably.  These are matters that ought to have the attention of the Ministry.  We have pointed out the injury that those new tariffs were going to do to the trade, and I am sorry the Minister has not been able to take steps to remove some of that injury.  But here is a matter that he can deal with.  It is a matter that his Department ought to deal with.  Yet these series of complaints have been going on for weeks and weeks, and, as far as one can gather, no very serious effort is being made to cope with them. I would be glad to know from the Minister what is being done.  Let him take the case I mentioned as being typical, as Deputy Hewat pointed out, of thousands.  Let him say now definitely what steps he is taking to deal with that particular difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few comments on this Estimate.  I think Deputy Hewat has said something about how disagreeable it is to business men to get on down at the Clearing House.  This is attributable more or less to the duties on small articles.  At least the principal portion of the difficulty could be attributed to them. Of course in the case of a large article <Col N="2492" /> that costs a big sum of money one does not scruple very much perhaps about the cost of collection, but in the case of an article costing 2s. 6d. it is a different matter.  The position is this, especially with regard to motor parts: while the firms dealing in repairs have to keep staffs on their premises to deal with this question of clearance, or they have to employ a clearance agency, and many of them do employ clearance agencies, after a week or a fortnight a bill is sent up from the Clearing House and you see an item that costs 1s. 6d for which 5s. is charged for clearing. That is an impossible position.  A great difficulty has been caused by including these small parts under the head of revenue.  It is not fair.  I have seen the weekly balance sheets, or the monthly balance sheets, of a few garages in Dublin.  I have seen items which cost 2s. 6d. or 1s. 6d. and the collection of which cost 5s.  That is something the Minister ought to consider.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Supplementing what I have said to Deputy Hewat, I think it is true that extensions of protective tariffs will always lead to additional costs in maintaining the Customs service, but I anticipate that some sum such as I mentioned, about £25,000, should bring our staffs up to what we require.  It has to be borne in mind that most of them are young men and inexperienced in the work.  As I said already, none of them is at the top of his scale, while most of them are at the bottom of their scales, and the increments for some years to come will amount to a substantial addition every year.  For instance, here are people that we have got in as a result of examinations for the Customs and Excise. As a result of an examination in August, 1923, we got 51 men, all ex-Army men.  As a result of an examination for Writing Assistants, in November, 1923, we got 20.  That was a general examination.  As a result of a Customs and Excise examination in March, 1924, we got 49, 15 of whom were ex-Army men.  Then there are Clerical Officers.  Probably some of these are used for income tax work as well as for Customs work, so I will <Col N="2493" /> leave them out.  For Customs and Excise, again, in October, 1924, we got 40 men.  Amongst the officers, we have at present something like 279 trained and experienced men, but many of them would not be at the top of their scales.  Being experienced, they are men who would have been promoted to grades exercising control.  Then we have the entrants from the two examinations for officers in 1923, 137 of whom we might call new men and raw officials.  There are certain pensioned officers whom we brought back, and who are doing service&mdash;some 20 or so of them.  In addition to these we have promoted from the clerical grade in various offices in the service to the rank of Customs officers some 50 men since we came to the decision to enforce certain new duties this year.  You have, therefore, something like 180 or more who are absolutely new.  That has some bearing on the remarks that Deputy Good made with reference to delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was very little Customs work done here before the setting up of our own Customs.  Customs duties were paid when goods were landed in Great Britain, and they were shipped and landed here free of duty.  The Customs service has practically been created from the foundation in three years. There has always been a shortage of experienced officers.  There is a shortage of fully experienced officers still, and there is no doubt if we had more officers&mdash;more experienced officers&mdash; certain complaints that there is ground for would be removed.  The bulk of the delay is in connection with the clearance of goods through the Customs, and is by no means attributable to the Customs officers.  All sorts of people are involved.  For instance, the railway and shipping companies are involved. They have not taken all the steps that they might have taken to provide accomodation in the way of transit sheds.  If you have shortage of accommodation in your transit sheds congestion must take place.  Goods are piled on top of one another, and the actual finding of the goods and the getting of them out becomes more difficult.  There is, in certain cases, insufficient transit shed accomodation.  That causes delay. Other causes of delay are due to <Col N="2494" /> importers themselves, who fail to furnish the documents required by the Customs.  They expect to get their goods through quickly without taking the precautions that are necessary to get them through.  But the blame for everything is put on the Customs.  The blame that is due to the importers, to the shipping companies, and to the railway companies, and to everybody else, is all put down to the Customs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">

      <P>There is one case that I cited that the Minister could deal with. Duty is assessed at the North Wall. The servants of the consignees have to walk from the North Wall to Beresford Place where they have to stand in a queue outside a temporary office.  That is a matter that could be obviated. Why should they have to go half a mile and wait at a small office while the few officials there have to deal with a volume of business?  That is a matter that ought to be attended to.</P>

      <P>That is a matter that I certainly can look into.  But, as I say, in all these things arrangements that seem quite simple are in some cases quite impossible, because of the shortage of an experienced and responsible staff.  I do not say that this particular case is one of them, but in certain cases arrangements that would be quite simple this time next year, are not quite so simple just now.</P>
      <P>As I have told Deputies, we have taken 50 men into the Customs who had certain experience and a good record for work as clerks in Government offices, but whose value in assisting in Customs work, so far, is not very considerable. I do not think that the clerical delays and difficulties that Deputy Gorey referred to are mainly due to the Customs.  However, as I promised Deputy Cooper at another stage, I am setting up a committee on which we will have certain non-official people &mdash;motor users or people in the motor business&mdash;who will go into the matter and see what changes can be made to facilitate clearance of these parts to which Deputy Gorey referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>These particular officials, unfortunately, come to be appointed by the Minister for Finance, and it is a duty with which he would be very glad to have nothing to do. They are not civil servants in the sense that they are not pensionable.  I think they are technically re-appointed from year to year, but in practice they continue to discharge the functions as long as they are satisfactory.  Recently I have endeavoured to leave the matter as much as possible to the Revenue Commissioners and not to intervene at all.  Since the demobilisation of the Army began the appointees have been almost entirely ex-officers.  In other cases where a small district becomes vacant it is joined on to a larger district adjoining and the officer of the larger district is given the two districts. Our policy, so far as we have been able to carry out a consistent policy in the matter, has been to endeavour to enlarge the districts, to give the collectors sufficient work to enable a salary to be <Col N="2497" /> paid which would make them almost whole-time collectors.  We believe that in that way we will get more reliable and better men.  The salaries, I think, have some basis that relates to poundage, but they are actual salaries.  They are generally quite small salaries except in cases like Dublin and Cork, districts with big collections, where the salaries might run up to £400 or £500.  In a great many districts the salaries are only for part-time work and would be £100 or £120.</P>

    <P>As Deputies will see from the Estimates, the great bulk of this sum is actually for the payment of old age pensions.  Even apart from the reduction in the number of old age pensioners which followed the 1924 Act, there has been for a considerable time an annual or a very steady decrease in the number in the area that is now the Saorstát.  I think that with one or two amending Acts there had been at times a slight increase, but the measure of the decrease may be taken in this way: In 1912, when the peak point was reached, the number of old age pensioners in the area that is now the Saorstát, was 156,000.  This figure has steadily decreased to the point that on the 31st March last it was 115,817.  It might be of interest to Deputies if I gave some indication of the numbers of pensions at the various rates.  On the 31st March last the number of pensioners paid at the 10s. rate, that is, people who were over 80 years of age when the 1924 Act was passed, was 29,693.  The number at the 9s. rate, the new full rate, was 59,609.  The number at the 8s. rate was 7,759, at the 7s. rate 4,062, at the 6s. rate 6,899, at the 5s. rate 1,927, at the 4s. rate 2,250, at the 3s. rate 1,660, at the 2s. rate 1,323, and at the 1s. rate 635.</P>
    <P>There is a remarkable difference between the proportion of old age pensioners in various counties.  Of course, <Col N="2499" /> that is very natural, because conditions vary considerably.  If we take the old age pensioners alone and leave out the pensioners under the Blind Persons Act, we find that the numbers per thousand of the total population vary from 21.01 in Waterford Borough up to 57.55 in County Leitrim.  In the same way the charge to the State, if calculated as the amount of rate on the rateable valuation of the various counties, varies very considerably.  In County Meath the amount paid for old age pensions is equivalent to 1s. 9d. on the rates of that county; in County Mayo it is equivalent to 14s.; in Leitrim, 11s. 2d.; in County Kerry, 10s.; in County Donegal, 12s.; in Westmeath, 2s. 5d.; in Wicklow, 3s. 1d.; in Wexford, 3s. 9d.; in Limerick County, 3s. 5d.; in Leix, 3s. 5d.; in Kildare, 2s. 5d.; in Kilkenny, 3s.; in Dublin Borough, 2s. 4d.; in Dublin County, 1s. 8d.  The expenses of the pension committees have not varied since last year, and it is not anticipated that there will be any variations.  The appropriations-in-aid are due to repayments by pensioners of amounts wrongly paid.  That would occur, for instance, in cases of fraud or misrepresentation when discovered.</P>

      <P>There are two cases I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister in reference to claims for old age pensions, both of which were refused by the pensions officer.  The names of the applicants are:&mdash;Mrs. Elizabeth Cass, Caragh, New Bridge; and Mrs. Wiseman, Bishophill, Ballymore-Eustace. In both these cases I brought evidence before the pensions officer, which he said convinced him. He said he was satisfied they were both entitled to the pension, and that if they made fresh claims to the Pensions Committee, and the claims were passed by them and sent on to him, they would go through as a matter of course.  I gave this direction of the pensions officer to these persons, and they carried it out, so that I concluded the matter was settled.  Months have gone by since that occurred, and I found just by chance the other day, that in neither <Col N="2500" /> of these cases, although they have complied with the directions given them, has anything been done, and these unfortunate old people are still without their money.  I would be deeply grateful to the Minister if he would inquire into the matter and see that this recommendation is carried out, as very great hardship has been inflicted on these people, who are most deserving cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with the matter of blind pensions and the way in which the law has been interpreted with regard to the degree of blindness and also as regards the delays in deciding appeals.  It is no exaggeration to say that unless applicants for a blind pension can prove total blindness there is very little chance of them receiving a pension.  There is nothing in the Act to require that a person must be totally blind.  The fact is that the pension officer appeals against every application, even though he knows the person is so blind as to be unable to do work for which eyesight is essential.  What is laid down in the Act is that the person must be so blind as to be unable to perform work for which eyesight is essential.  Pensions are refused even though the applications are accompanied by a doctor's certificate.  When an appeal is made and sent forward to Dublin, it is quite a common thing for the applicant to have to wait for twelve months, or two years, or in some cases longer, before the appeal is decided.  That is a very great hardship on poor people who, in many cases, are destitute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way in which the degree of blindness is being interpreted by the pensions officers and the inspectors is not fair to the applicants and is not giving them the benefit of the Act.  I have in mind a couple of cases.  One man applied for a blind pension and after a lapse of two years the pension was granted from the date of application. In another case the applicant was waiting for fifteen months before the medical inspector came and decided that he was entitled to the pension from six months after the date of his application and nine months before the inspection was made.  In another case <Col N="2501" /> the inspector decided after a lapse of seventeen months that the applicant was entitled to the pension from the date of the medical examination.  In that case it was a great hardship that the medical inspector did not come six or twelve months earlier.  Probably the Minister's answer will be that in the case of a progressive disease, the medical inspector will be able to say at what time the person reached the degree of blindness required.  Applicants for blind pensions are certainly of opinion that unless they can prove, not only to the pensions officer and the committee, but to the medical examiner, that they are totally blind, they have very little hope of getting a pension. Take the case of a man who has been working as a tailor for forty or fifty years and whose sight fails him to such an extent that at sixty-five years of age he is no longer able to work as a tailor. That man is of no use for any other class of work, but if he has sufficient vision in the opinion of the medical examiner to enable him to pitch manure into a cart, he is disqualified from receiving a pension.  That is certainly a very great hardship upon such people. Cases of that kind are occurring every day in the week.</P>
    <P>The Minister should see that there is a fair interpretation of the Act and that there is a speeding up of decisions in appeal cases.  I know there has been considerable improvement as far as that is concerned, and I am led to believe that for the future they will be able to deal with the cases within a reasonable time.  It is only fair to say that the delays are not due to the medical inspector, but to the fact that there was not a sufficient number of medical inspectors appointed.  It was only after great pressure from Deputies that the Government agreed to appoint the second inspector.  I hope the Minister will see that there is a more liberal interpretation of the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to call attention to another matter in connection with old age pensions.  In my constituency a number of persons who were receiving the old age pension in one particular district suffered as a result of the legislation introduced last <Col N="2502" /> year.  In a number of cases people felt that they were treated unfairly and they approached the local officer to have the cases re-opened.  I took the cases up with the Department here and was advised that they should acquaint the pension officer that they desired to raise the question of their pension with him with a view to obtain ing an increase.  That was done and the pension officer refused absolutely to take any notice of the applications.  In at least two or three cases, when they failed, the pensioners sent to the pension officer a statement by registered post asking to have their case taken up and put before the committee.  The pensions officer deliberately ignored that and, as a matter of fact, denied that he had ever received any such applications.  I am assured that this officer is very careless in his work in this respect and has the reputation of being rude to pensioners generally.  He has acquired such a reputation in the district that old age pensioners are led to think that there is no use in approaching him.  He is a sort of Kaiser in his own dominions and has gone out of his way to be insulting and nasty to pensioners, and has refused to do his work.  The pensions officer I referred to is Mr. McKenna, who lives at Clonakilty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to be able to say that conduct of that kind is not general.  Personally, I have not had any other complaints of conduct of that kind.  In the case of a well-paid official like that, I think he might do the work he is paid for doing, and I am glad of the opportunity to bring this officer's conduct to the notice of the Minister.  In at least one of the cases, my colleague of the Farmers' Party who is not present at the moment&mdash;Deputy Donovan&mdash;informed me that one of the persons who endeavoured to get a case re-opened was absolutely destitute.  I am satisfied that there were good grounds for reopening some of the other cases.  Be that as it may, the duty of the officer was to do the work he was paid for. I take it that the Ministry does not wish officials to adopt that attitude and to take upon themselves the duty of finally deciding cases of this kind.  The final decision rests with the Department, <Col N="2503" /> and I desire to say that the officials of the Department here generally do the fair thing.  This is a matter I thought ought to be mentioned and I am glad to say that the line of action taken by this officer is not the line of action taken by pension officers generally.</P>

      <P>Deputies generally welcome a reduction in estimates for the public services.  But I think there is no estimate in which a reduction is less welcome to Deputies than the public service which is before us at present.  I think a reduction in old age pensions is very unwise economy. In the circumstances, it may have been impossible to avoid it and the Executive Council, in deciding that it was advisable to reduce this estimate, were probably controlled by circumstances. These circumstances, I should hope, are fast passing and we should expect that the Minister for Finance here to-day will hold out to us some hope that that road of economy is not to be pursued and that we may expect to revert to the normal as regards pensions for our aged people.  I find that for the year 1923-24 there was £3,180,783 paid in old age pensions.  The estimate was £3,270,000.  For the following year, 1924-25, the estimate was £2,912,000, and the estimate for the present year, 1925-26, is £2,600,000, which means, on the estimate of this present year, a reduction as compared with the actual sum paid in pensions in 1923-24, of £580,783.  Most of us who supported this reduction were led to believe that it meant only 10 per cent.  These figures show a reduction of something like 17½ per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so in some cases, but on the average, it works out at what I say.  While that is the case in regard to pensions, I find that the expenses of administration have increased from £7,365, which was the amount actually paid in the years I have referred to, to £7,700&mdash;an increase of £435.  There is a saving under one head&mdash;the amount given to the people in pensions&mdash;but there is an increase in the amount expended on the administration of the pension service. There are a great many hardships imposed by the Act that were never intended when it was passed here.  I think that the proof of age could be made a good deal more simple.  It could be made more easy for those poor people to discharge that duty.  The onus rests upon them, according to the law, to prove their age.  That is difficult for them to do when they are left without any records.  The onus of providing them with these records should rest upon the Government of any well-ordered country.  These records are not available to the people and, consequently, the people are not able to discharge the onus that rests upon them. They are left to suffer the disability of continuing without pensions in the majority of instances, having very little means of subsistence.  It should be the first duty of any Government to deal with this question and to say that, whatever may be the resources of the State, this is one service that is not going to be subjected to economy in the sense that the interests of these poor people should be subordinated to the other requirements of the State.  This is a service that should not be subordinated, in my opinion, to any other exigency.  Whatever credit we may expect in the eyes of the world, we will not get any credit by proving that we economised by a reduction of expenditure upon this particular service.  Undoubtedly, the times that we have passed through made the necessity. That necessity is passing away and very soon we should be back in normal conditions.  The first subject, then, to be dealt with should be the subject we are concerned with now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We realise, from the figures given by the Minister, that the proportion of old <Col N="2505" /> age pensioners to our population is very large.  I do not know whether we should consider that a misfortune.  I think we should rather consider it creditable that the duration of life here is so well maintained.  It is proof that our people live according to the rules of public health and that they lead, generally, a wise and moderate existence.  That should be rather to our credit, though it counts against us when we come to reckoning the expenditure on old age pensions.  There are other things that I hope will reduce, to some extent, the amount that will be required for this service in the future.  We find that for a considerable time back pensions have been given for other purposes.  A great many people will fall into a category in which it will not be necessary to provide old age pensions for them, because they will already have been provided with pensions from other sources.  Deputy Gorey, the other day, made a proposal that the small minority left without pensions should be provided with pensions.  I think it was a very sane suggestion.  I think we should shortly have a very small number to provide with old age pensions, if we pursue the road we are pursuing with regard to pensions generally.  While I am not a very strong advocate of pensions generally, I am a particularly strong advocate of pensions in cases where the old people have no other resources. I would ask the Minister when he is making his statement to hold out to us at least a hope of being able, at a very early date, to restore to those poor people what was taken from them owing to the exigencies and stress and difficulties of the times.  When we arrive at the time that that can be done, I hold that it should be the first duty of the Government to see restoration made to those people of what, I believe, has been wrongfully taken from them.</P>

      <P>The last speaker has alluded to the fact that we ought to go back to the previous conditions and restore the old age pensions.  It was admitted during the discussions last year that a great many people were receiving pensions who were not entitled to them.  If we have reached the <Col N="2506" /> stage when that abuse has come to an end, I think we might make a claim to have the amount of the pensions to those who are really deserving increased. I am quite sure that it was possible for persons with a certain amount of means to hand over the property they had to sons or daughters, and put themselves upon the pensions list.  I think the Minister had in mind that people of that class should not be encouraged to come under this scheme. At the same time I do not think a pension of from 4s. to 9s. per week is very much to an old person, and I would be glad to see people really deserving of pensions getting an increase.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey has alluded to one or two points that I was interested in. He cleared the matter up to some extent before he sat down, but I was rather surprised to find that an appeal had been before any court for fifteen months, and had not been attended to. I was surprised to hear that blind men had made claims for pensions for blindness, and that the matter was not attended to for seventeen months in one case, and for fifteen months in another case.</P>

      <P>That was a very serious state of affairs, and it should not have been allowed.  I admit that a great deal of care must be taken in establishing a claim to blind pension.  I am ignorant on the question of the appointment of the person who adjudges these appeals.  I would like to ask the Minister whether the medical officer appointed is one of the Local Government inspectors or whether he is a specially-appointed medical officer who has a special knowledge of this class of work. I think it is necessary that the man who is doing this class of work should have more than the ordinary knowledge possessed by the ordinary medical man in connection with these matters.  I hope that is the case.  I hope, in one sense, that the medical inspector is one of the inspectors of the Local Government Department, because I have alluded to the fact on previous occasions that I did not know how the medical inspectors of the Local Government Department employed themselves&mdash;there were so many <Col N="2507" /> officers in charge.  That is the reason why I say it was a disgraceful thing that these appeals should be from fifteen months to two years unattended to. The Local Government department had more inspectors than they could find work for.  Perhaps the Minister will clear up the point as to whether the officer appointed by the department to do this work has to do the entire work of the twenty-six counties, or whether, as Mr. Morrissey suggested, a second inspector has been appointed to do this work.  I am quite sure it requires as much care to eliminate people making absurd claims to blindness as it does to eliminate people putting forward claims  a certain age when they have not attained that age, and representing that they have no means at a time when they have sufficient means, without being placed on the pension list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one thing that I would like to call attention to.  It arises out of one remark made by Deputy Sir James Craig.  He referred to the fact that people who are in fairly comfortable circumstances make over their goods to their sons and daughters in order to become eligible for the old age pension. I heard that statement mentioned before on several occasions, and I think too much is being made of it.  I think Deputy Sir James Craig, or other Deputies who mentioned this matter, cannot know the circumstances as they exist in that portion of Ireland where this thing does happen; that is, very largely the West of Ireland.  The old age pension administration, in so far as that class of people is concerned, is particularly harsh.  There have been numerous instances throughout Galway and Mayo where old men and women, living in the house of a little farmer, were drawing the pension before the 1924 Act came into operation.  The effect of the Act, and the tightening up of the administration under it, resulted in the pension being taken away from those people.  In many, practically all, of these cases the valuation of the little holding is not more than £3 or £5.  Existing on this holding would be a man and his wife, and, perhaps, <Col N="2508" /> a few little children.  In addition there would be the old man, or the old woman, possibly the old couple, alive.</P>
      <P>In estimating the means of those old people, too much value is placed by the pension authorities on the maintenance they obtain from the son who is married on the little farm.  That is pushed to too great an extent in those cases. There are hundreds of those cases over the Connemara area and in the western portion of Mayo.  The net result of the administration will be that those people will come on the home help or on the local rates.  The present system of administration will bring about that result. It has been stated, often, that farmers especially have resorted to this kind of thing so as to get a pension for the old people.  I know that in connection with the class I am speaking of there is nothing else for them to do.  As a matter of fact, the pension was a great means of keeping them alive in many cases in the old days.  There is very great hardship in those areas now as a result of the tightening up process and the methods adopted by the pension officers in the administration of the Act during the last twelve months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to follow on the lines on which Deputy O'Connell has based his remarks.  The issuing of instructions for a tightening up has been interpreted to mean that the screw must be put on just as tightly as it possibly can.  The effect of putting on that screw has been very much on the lines of putting on a thumbscrew. Some people have been driven to distraction. The Minister gave certain figures at the opening of his statement. I would like if he could supplement those figures, which dealt with a comparison between 1912 and 1925, with figures relating to 1923, 1924 and 1925, preferably 1923, just before the last Act began to operate, or was contemplated.  We would then have a better idea of the effect of the Act and the number of pensioners receiving respective weekly sums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave us certain figures or percentages when referring to old age pensioners.  He stated that the total population ranged from 21.01 in Waterford Borough to 51.55 in Leitrim <Col N="2509" /> county.  Figures like that presented by the Minister are apt to be used for the purposes of comparison with figures in Scotland and in England.  On an earlier occasion I think the Minister did adduce figures of this kind and compared them with Scottish or English figures.  It is well to be warned that if there is going to be any fair comparison, the figure of old age pensioners to-day ought to be in relation to the population of 70 years ago.  If we are going to compare our figures with Scottish figures, we have to make allowance for the increase in population in Scotland and the decline of population in Ireland.  Except for the purpose of showing the relationship to the total population in Ireland to-day, which is a matter of interest, those figures are not of much value and they should not be used&mdash;as I am afraid they may be used&mdash;to suggest that the number of persons obtaining old age pensions in these districts is excessive, not by virtue of their rights under the law, but by virtue of their ability to deceive. That seems to be the suggestion that has been taken out of similar figures that were put forward in the past, and it is not right that such imputations should be made.</P>
    <P>In regard to a remark by Deputy Sir James Craig, I think he should bear in mind that before the applicant for a blind pension has his application considered it must be accompanied by the local doctor's certificate to the effect that the man is blind.  The only question then is whether that is fairly satisfactory or <i>prima facie</i> evidence of his blindness.  The doctor may not be a specialist in eye diseases, but no progress can be made until the application has been corroborated by the doctor's certificate.  There should be no question, when the pension is ultimately paid, that it should be paid from the date of the first application.  Wherever any departure from that policy has been made, it is due that there should be a repayment.  It is not fair that because of the fault or negligence or incapacity of the Department to do its work up to time, the applicant should suffer the loss of the pension from the time of the application.  As Deputy Morrissey pointed out, one or two years may elapse, and it would not be fair <Col N="2510" /> that in paying a pensioner that period should be overlooked.</P>
    <P>Deputies McGoldrick and Craig are pressing and pleading for a revision of the policy in respect of the amounts of pensions; they are pleading for a reversion to the pre-1924 policy and practice. The plea they are making now is that, instead of cutting the pensions, what should have been done was to tighten up the administration.  It would have been much better and more satisfactory if that pressure had been applied to the Ministry when the proposal for cutting the pensions was before the House.  Many opportunities were provided; but, unfortunately, they were not availed of by the Deputies who now say it was not right to cut the pensions and that a great part of the benefit might have been obtained, and a good part of the saving might have been made, by a reasonable tightening-up in the administration and an effort to correct what may be assumed to have been general abuses without being so rigorous as to create an injustice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHN CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we ought to have an authoritative announcement upon the right interpretation of the expression &ldquo;means&rdquo; in the Act.  We should know whether means must be accounted as actual cash or income in money, or whether the shelter of a room or the necessaries of life, given to an applicant for an old age pension, can be considered as means.  I will give a case in which I think a wrong interpretation has been given to that word.  It is the case of a homeless widow, admittedly without means of her own.  This woman was admitted to the house of another widow, who was a first cousin of the applicant's deceased husband.  The applicant was admittedly over the pensionable age.  There was no question whatever on that point.  Still, she was refused the pension on the grounds that she had means.  The shelter she was afforded and the necessaries of life she was afforded, not by any persons who had legal obligations to give her those things, but who merely acted on motives of charity, were taken into consideration.  Her means were estimated at £37 a year and on these <Col N="2511" /> grounds she was refused a pension.  I think that action not alone stretched the Act too far, but it went beyond the powers the Act gives the pension officer.  We expect a pronouncement upon that point from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I would like to say another word with regard to applicants for a blind pension.  I understand that medical certificates accompany each application.  If the Pensions Committee are not prepared to accept that, what is the use of a certificate at all?  I would like to ask the Minister whether there is a general setting aside of the medical certificate that has been given to the blind people by the local Pensions Committee, or whether it is only in certain cases that the Pension Committee take on themselves to override the certificate that has been given by the local medical officer.  It seems to me an extraordinary thing that there should be any number of these appeals made.  I grant that in my first statement I suggested that anyone dealing with the matter of appeals should be himself a specialist as regards eye work, or, at least, have a little more than the ordinary knowledge to interpret a very intricate case.  I do not think that there is any difficulty about the doctor in the ordinary sense of the term giving a certificate for cases in the ordinary way.</P>
      <P>I should like to say, with regard to what Deputy O'Connell stated, that it was from the statements made here in the Dáil that I learned that very much fraud had been perpetrated in the old days with regard to the number of pensions granted.  I think it was even suggested from the Ministerial benches that the people here thought it was no harm to get as much as they possibly could when the pensions were being paid from the other side.  At all events, I gathered that the general impression in the Dáil was that there was a considerable amount of laxity with regard to the giving of pensions to people who did not deserve them.  Deputy O'Connell may take it from me that I certainly have no objection to people who are deserving and who are poor getting some help in their old age.</P>

      <P>For the information of Sir James Craig, I can recount a case where two local medical officers certified as to the blindness of a certain lady in my county.  She also held a certificate from a specialist in Dublin&mdash;Doctor Connolly.  Still the pensions officers appealed in her case to the Local Government Department. She was brought up here and appeared before the Local Government medical inspector.  He certified that she had some vision in one of her eyes.  This old lady was 68 years of age at the time.  She was very feeble and practically unable to do any work, no matter what her sight might be.  The two local medical officers and Dr. Connolly, the eye specialist, certified that she could not do any work for which eyesight was essential.  In spite of that the pensions officer brought on the appeal and the pension was refused on the ground that the Local Government medical officer certified that she had some vision in one of her eyes.  It was rather a hard case.  She lost her Home Help on the strength of the Pensions Committee granting her a pension, and the only suggestion I received when I brought her case before the Minister for Local Government was that she should go back and have Home Help again.  If she were qualified for the blind pension I believe that he should not shirk giving her help from his Department. That was not the way to treat this old lady, to refer her back to the local rates for Home Help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another phase of the question was dealt with by Deputy McGoldrick.  That was the question of facilitating matters for those people who could not procure their baptismal certificates in their own parish or here in Dublin.  One pension officer has suggested some time that those people should have their ages proved by two older people.  Still when those witnesses go before a Peace Commissioner and make an affidavit that the applicants are up to 70 years of age the case is appealed in nearly every instance.  I do not see how those poor people can really prove their ages except through people in the district who are older than themselves.  If people who are older than them make affidavits that they are of the required age it <Col N="2513" /> should be sufficient for the pensions officer, and these appeals should not be brought on.  I think it is a matter that the Government should look into.  They should provide some way or means for those people to establish their age. Those poor people do not know where to go.  They cannot find baptismal certificates.  The records were burned or they were not kept, and they have no means of proving their age by documents. I believe the Government should find some way for those people to prove their age, and the way I suggest, I think, ought to be sufficient.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of certificates given by local doctors, which was referred to by Sir James Craig, as far as I am aware those certificates are not accepted.  Unless an applicant for a blind pension has a certificate from an institute for the blind the pension officer, as far as I know, appeals in all cases, even where the applicant has a certificate from a local doctor stating that he or she is blind.  There is an appeal in practically every case.  That is one of the reasons why people have to wait 15 months and two years before their appeals are decided. As a matter of fact, a number of these applicants have actually died while the appeals were pending.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Doyle has put his finger upon the blot regarding these pensions.  Undoubtedly the great difficulty lies in proving the question of age, and I think it will be found that the great bulk of the appeals are made upon that point.  It is a remarkable fact that previous to the loss of the documents in the Four Courts the census returns were available for this purpose and a large number of people who were placed on the pensions list at that time were placed on it from the information supplied by the census. The evidence supplied by the census returns furnished the evidence of age in the case of those who received the pension. It is a fact that the Government, though not willingly, actually and in fact destroyed these documents and they call on the old-age people to supply evidence from documents which they themselves destroyed.  I believe the President is particularly answerable <Col N="2514" /> for that.  I am aware from my own experience that the great difficulty in these questions is for poor people to supply evidence of their age.  Last year I suggested to the Minister for Local Government&mdash;I think on the estimates &mdash;that a leaflet might be issued instructing the poor people how they might furnish evidence and how it might facilitate them in making their claims.  That leaflet was issued last year, but I am told that the revenue people so revised that document that it is not understandable.  May I suggest, particularly in the presence of Deputy Morrissey, who is a vigilant member of the Committee looking into this question, that if simple instructions were issued broadcast, particularly in poor districts, directing what evidence should be supplied and how it should be obtained, and if a specimen were given on the back of the leaflet of the declaration that is required in these cases where there is really no evidence, it would help these people to make out their cases perfectly.  I understood last year that the objection to doing that was that it was no part of the Finance Minister's business to help people to take money from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to blind pensions, I have a good deal of experience of that matter, too.  There is no question whatever that many people on the certificates of local doctors were getting blind pensions to which they were not entitled by law.  The matter has been tightened up now, and the names of these people have been removed from the pay lists. The difficulty remains that those of them who are really eligible are not able to get attended to.  I do not think the difficulty there lies with the administration at all.  It lies with the Dáil.  They pass the Act and the regulations resulting from that Act prevent doctors, except in cases of actual blindness, from certifying for pension purposes. I believe there are two doctors dealing with this business.  I know one of them, and, for the information of Sir James Craig, I should say that he has experience of opthalmic work.  He does his work scientifically, and he is a very kindly man and a hard worker. The difficulty with him is this, that he is up against these regulations.  I think <Col N="2515" /> these regulations should be relaxed.  I think this blind pension should cover all cases of people who are so blind as to be unable to earn their livelihood. The Minister, in his short statement, read out some figures.  Deputy Johnson has already dealt with one side of these figures.  I would like an explanation, for, frankly, I do not understand what the second return is for.  The Minister gave certain counties, and he gave the poundage on the valuation of these counties, corresponding to the amount of money paid for old-age pensions. One of the counties that he gave was County Meath.  The old age pensions paid there would run to 1/9 in the £1.  He mentioned the County Mayo, in which Deputy O'Connell is interested.  He said the poundage there would be 14/-.  He mentioned Donegal County, similarly valued to Mayo, and he gave it as 12/-.  What do these figures prove?  I only mention these so that they might come up before Deputy Morrissey's committee, and so that he will keep a vigilant eye on the purpose to which these returns are to be applied. The valuation of a holding in Meath would be very high.  It is sparsely populated, and the valuation is extraordinarily high.</P>
    <P>The population and valuation of Mayo somewhat correspond with those of Donegal, but in districts where most claimants receive pensions the average valuation does not exceed £2, and generally does not exceed 30/-, so that I cannot see what comparison can be made between these counties and Co. Meath, with its 1/9 in the £.  If, as I hope, the Minister has in mind the extension of benefit to these counties, I hope he will remember that Donegal has smaller valuations than Mayo, and that he will at least bring Donegal up to the Mayo figure of 14/-.  I join in the appeal made by Deputy McGoldrick to the Minister to take into consideration, when his finances permit, the restoration of the shilling that was taken off these pensioners.  I think it would be money well spent, because in the poorer districts, and I am very familiar with them, I do not know any money that gives so much comfort to <Col N="2516" /> the poor as this.  In a city like Dublin, where the poor people have to pay rent, the 9/- is indeed very small, and very little is left for the comfort which this Act was intended to bring.  I have mentioned these things in the hope that the Minister will give us some hint as to what he will do when his finances permit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that a good deal of the discussion this evening ought to have been on the Local Government Estimate.  Perhaps a good deal more than half of it had to do with the side of the administration under the Minister for Local Government. With reference to the position in regard to old age pensions, I made a certain statement in connection with the Budget, and I have really nothing to add to it.  I have repeated that statement two or three times, and I do not think it is necessary to repeat it again. Delays in dealing with blind pensions were due to two causes: first, that the British authorities neglected to appoint an inspector to deal with the work during their period, and a great mass of what I might call fraudulent cases have gone through.  Long ago I explained to the Dáil that in some counties you had as much as one in every 400 of the population drawing a blind pension, and in others you had one in every 4,000.  You had all sorts of cases which should never have gone through. When the inspector was put on the work he was a considerable time in getting through the mass of arrears, and it was a long time before he could take up what might be called current work.  Where we were wrong was that we did not appoint a second inspector earlier.  I think we should have done so, and we should have recognised that it was impossible for one man to get through the work.  The officer who does this work is an inspector of the Local Government Department.  He underwent a special course of training before he undertook the work, and I understand he is a very good officer and deals with it in a very capable way.  Deputy Morrissey mentioned the case of a man who was seventeen months waiting for the visit of the medical inspector and then only received <Col N="2517" /> the pension from the date of his examination.  I have no information about the case, but I would hazard a guess that his complaint was something of a progressive character, and that when examined he was still a border line case.  Probably what would have happened if the doctor had seen him earlier was that he would have been refused the pension, and would have had to make a subsequent application to be re-examined.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the local doctors for various reasons cannot be trusted to deal with this work satisfactorily. You have to remember that nearly all doctors are soft-hearted people.  That is a fact; we discovered it, for instance, during the civil war, and when a miserable case comes before them they are inclined to certify blindness even if blindness does not quite exist.  Then there will be great variations so long as the wording of the Act is what it is, that the person to be entitled must be so blind as to be incapable of doing any work for which eyesight is essential, and different individuals will have varying views about that.  Apart from any departure from the letter of the Act on the part of a person giving a certificate there will be wide variations of view.</P>
      <P>Somebody asked whether shelter and the necessaries of life were to be counted as means.  They are, of course, to be counted as means, and they always have been.  The Act specifies what must be taken into account&mdash;the yearly value of property not personally held or enjoyed, or stocks and shares, the income which the person expects to receive, or may be expected to receive, in wages or profits from any business, the yearly value of any property in his personal enjoyment, and the yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed.  So that the position has not been altered by us.  It has always been the same, I suggest, and even if we were considering&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think so, but it is now easier to bring complaints to light than it was.  I think that that is the real change; if people feel a grievance they find it easier to get it voiced.  However, that is how the law has always been understood.  We have officers administering it who administered it in Great Britain.  There were in the past changes of officers from one country to another, and as far as I have been able to understand, the method of administration here and in Great Britain is the same.  If there was any laxity here in the past compared with the present system, it was perhaps during the years of keen disturbance. There may have been some laxity then; I do not know, but in the normal way there has been no change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question of establishing age is a very difficult one, in the absence of what would constitute anything like legal proof.  Instructions were given to officers to take as lenient and as favourable a view as possible.  But the position is that age must be proved by the applicant, and it would be very hard, when you are dealing with big sums of money and big departments, to instruct officers to neglect the law, not to demand proof.  That might lead to all <Col N="2519" /> sorts of abuses and, perhaps, fraud. When you are dealing with public officials, the only way is to insist that they carry out the law absolutely strictly so far as the question of bringing personal bias into the matter is concerned.  They must always be out to carry out the law, and even if the law seems to be unsatisfactory, that is not the business of the official.  It is the business of the legislation to alter the law.  If there is a defect in the law, you cannot expect officials to ignore the law or to stretch the interpretation of it.  We have done all we could, I think, to enable people to get pensions who cannot obtain legal proof of the fact that they are seventy years of age.  This is really a matter on which the Minister for Local Government should have been challenged, but I know that in the Appeal section of the Local Government Department they decide in favour of the applicant if at all possible.  It is obvious that if we are to receive affidavits as evidence, if we are to be certain, for instance, that the Comptroller and Auditor-General ought not to object to them, there must be some definite statement in regard to age, and it is no use for a person to say, &ldquo;I believe that Mrs. Jones is seventy years of age.&rdquo;  It is quite obvious that the affidavit must be drawn up in such a form as will lead anybody to believe that the person making it has really good grounds for thinking and believing that Mrs. Jones is seventy years of age.  It is obvious that there must be a certain amount of detail, relevant facts must be stated; there must be something to indicate that a neighbour is not swearing casually, &ldquo;I am seventy-four years of age, and I know that Mrs. Jones is seventy.&rdquo;  I do not know what could be done further in the matter.  Somebody has suggested that we should issue a book of instructions to people on how to make false affidavits.  It has been repeatedly said that affidavits will be taken if they contain matter necessary to constitute proof of the age of the applicant, and as I say, such affidavits are looked upon in a sympathetic manner.  I have myself <Col N="2520" /> got the papers to examine them, and if no certificate was available, and affidavits of the type I mention were put in by reputable people, they were accepted, and the pensions were given.</P>
    <P>That is one of the matters which this Committee, which is now sitting, is investigating, to find out if anything can be done to facilitate the dealing with these claims and appeals in a manner that would be fair and just to the applicants.  But there always will be some difficulty if you are not going to open the door so wide that you will have fraud on a large scale, because everybody knows that people who are not the required age are constantly attempting to get pensions.  There was the case, which I have already mentioned a couple of times, of a person who, to my own knowledge, supplied affidavits in four successive years and was refused, and then on the fifth year produced the certificate showing that he was seventy years of age.  Previously he was supposed to be unable to get a certificate.  There will be cases of fraud, and it is very difficult to strike a middle line between being too rigid and excluding people who, through no fault of their own, cannot prove age, and on the other hand being too lax and  in people who are not entitled to the pension.  However, I suppose I am really out of order in dealing with this, because it belongs to the Department of the Minister for Local Government.</P>

    <P>The amount asked for under sub-head (a) this year is £50,000 as compared with £107,000 last year.  The reason for the smaller amount being asked for is that only a small proportion&mdash;practically none&mdash;of the amount voted in 1924-25 was expended.  It was intended to be given largely in loans for drainage to individual farmers, but the procedure is rather slow and very little was paid out before the end of the year.  There was also before last year in the fund a sum of £20,000 approximately, so that there will be available, with the £50,000 asked for this year, a sum of £177,000 for the purpose of loans.  That would be available in some such way as follows:&mdash;For loans to farmers for land improvement purposes, say £100,000; for drainage works in connection with the drainage maintenance and restoration schemes under the Act of 1924, and for some possible expenditure in connection with the Barrow, say £50,000; for other purposes, like advances to local authorities and public utility societies in respect of balances of certain housing loans, say £27,000.</P>
    <P>Sub-head (b) represents payment to the British Government of sums due in respect of loans from the British Local Loans Fund outstanding from the Public Works Office at 1st April, 1922. About £500,000 is the approximate amount of instalments accruing in the year 1925-26.  The balance of £80,000 is the amount expected to be received in respect of arrears of loan instalments.</P>
    <P>Sub-head (c) is in respect of advances by the Land Commission under the Land Acts, 1881-1888, and outstanding at the date of the transfer of the Land Commission to the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>In connection with some Estimate last year I asked a question as to the likelihood of the Government making again available loans for the purpose of building teachers' residences under the Teachers' Residences Act, 1875, and the Minister said that as they were setting aside a loan fund&mdash;I think this is the fund he mentioned&mdash;it was possible that he would consider with the Minister for Education the possibility of again making loans available.  No such loans have been made available since 1914. In reply to a question put down by me some weeks ago the Minister, I think, definitely said that there were no negotiations going on between himself and the Minister for Education in connection with this matter.  Indeed, I rather took it to mean that he had definitely made up his mind that no loans would be available for this purpose.  I should like to know exactly what is the position with regard to this matter, whether there will be any further operations under the Act or what exactly is the intention of the Minister.</P>

      <P>That, of course, is a <Col N="2523" /> matter that I am not able to answer fully on, except to say that we do recognise the advisability of opening the Local Loans Fund for the purpose of making other advances than advances for land improvements, which we began to make available last year, and which we hope to make available to a considerable extent this year.  Of course, to make loans available out of this fund on the scale at which they were available during the British regime would be a very considerable matter.  Local authorities, for instance, might want loans for big amounts for housing, sewerage, or schemes of improvement. It is, no doubt, desirable that they should have them, as developments of the most desirable character are held back because money cannot be got on favourable terms from the banks &mdash;at any rate favourable from the point of view of the period of repayment. We are going into that matter, but I am not in a position yet to make an announcement, largely because the question is one of very considerable magnitude.  There is no doubt if there was a general re-opening of the Local Loans Fund that large sums would be required.</P>

I understand that this is a repayment to the British Government of sums paid into <Col N="2524" /> the revenue in one way or another, whether by deductions or otherwise, in connection with money advanced to local authorities, in the main.  £670,000 was voted last year.  Can the Minister say how much of that was collected, and what is the expectation this year? Will he by that means tell us what is the actual amount paid out of the Exchequer, leaving out the collecting from the local authorities?  I understand that, in fact, all this is due from borrowers in the past.  Some of it is collected, but not all of it.  That is to say, portion of this sum probably has to be paid out of the National Exchequer which has not been collected.</P>

    <P>This is a very miscellaneous type of Vote.  In part 3 of the Vote there are fairly full particulars.  There is, first of all, the Board of Assessors under the Military Service Pensions Act.  They have an enormous number of claims to deal with.  A great many of these will not be substantiated, but they will require investigation, and I believe that the work of that board will continue for a considerable time.  The chairman of the board is a district justice, and there are two other members.  I believe that <Col N="2525" /> a most careful investigation of claims is being carried out.  Not only is documentary evidence required, but attendance in person is necessary, and cross-examination is resorted to.  Every effort is being made to see that people entitled to the pension will get it, and that those disentitled will not get it.</P>
    <P>Then we have the Boundary Commission, which is set out very fully. The solicitor employed in preparing the case and generally supervising every activity in connection with the Commission for the Government will be paid his professional costs for the work as taxed by the Attorney-General.  The members of the staff travel to the various districts, assist people to put their evidence into order, see that all aspects of the case are fully represented, and that witnesses are procured to help the various considerations that should be brought forward.  As this is an international Commission, it has been arranged by the British Government that one-half of the estimated cost of the Commission should be defrayed by us.  This is the best estimate that we could get after an exchange of letters with the British Treasury.  It may be too much or it may be too little.  It is very much an open estimate.</P>
    <P>The Central Savings Committee is a body which has really done very useful work, and which, I think, will result in a very substantial amount of money coming into the Exchequer annually through the sale of Savings Certificates. For a considerable period after the army trouble of March, 1924, the receipts from Savings Certificates fell off very much, and, in fact, went down for a long time to a net amount of not more than £3,000 or £4,000 per week.  But in recent months they have gone up very substantially.  In six weeks of the present year they have amounted to some £50,000 or £60,000 more than the corresponding six weeks of the past year.</P>
    <P>The total amount invested in Savings Certificates up to 30th April last was £1,341,463.  A very big amount came from Dublin&mdash;£348,654, or £731 per thousand of the population.  In Cork, the amount was £219,050, or £559 per thousand of the population.  That went down in a county like Offaly to £12,726, <Col N="2526" /> or £224 per head of the population.  It is very satisfactory also to note that in recent months not only has the sale of Savings Certificates gone up very substantially, returning to something approaching the figure that it was before March of last year, but that the net amount got through the Post Office Savings Bank has also gone up.  In the case of the Post Office Savings Bank, there are very substantial sums being withdrawn week by week.  But every week the net amount of deposits has increased since the Post Office Savings Bank was opened.  In the last few months there was a substantial net increase&mdash;a very substantial increase. After the army trouble the amount went down to a few hundred pounds in some weeks, but we were never on the wrong side.  The propaganda of the Savings Committee will, we believe, in the course of the coming year, lead to very substantial purchase of Savings Certificates.  That, although not the cheapest form of borrowing, is one of the most desirable forms of borrowing. We pay 5¼ per cent. free of income tax on Savings Certificates, but they are spread out, and I think not more than £500 worth may be purchased by any individual.  That means that State liabilities are spread over a large number of people and that has an influence on stability, and it has also an influence on the possibilities of industry.  It is desirable that considerable numbers of people should be encouraged to have the foresight to amass and to put by in some remunerative way certain amounts of capital.</P>
    <P>The next sub-head deals with the Civil Service (Compensation) Committee. The work of that Committee was interrupted by the resignation of Mr. Justice Wylie, who had done a great amount of work for us, over a considerable period, and who found that he was not able to continue it.  A successor would probably have been appointed by him but for the fact that certain appeals were brought in the courts.  The view that we had held that the grant of pensions was in the discretion of the Minister for Finance, was challenged.  The whole committee scheme rested on the basis that the giving <Col N="2527" /> of pensions was within the discretion of the Minister for Finance, but as these were Treaty pensions&mdash;pensions which might be the subject of diplomatic negotiations and representations&mdash;we all along felt that the only satisfactory way of dealing with them was to have a committee, with a judicial chairman, to advise the Minister for Finance and on whose recommendations the Minister for Finance would act.  Our view of the rights of civil servants has been upheld by the Supreme Court.  It has decided that pensions are a matter of discretion with the Minister for Finance, subject to any legislation we have.  We still feel that the only satisfactory way of dealing with them is to have this committee, on which the Finance Department is represented and on which the staffs are represented, with a judicial chairman. I have already taken certain steps and I hope that very shortly we will be able to announce the appointment of a judge as a member of the Committee.  Deputies should know that pressure of work in the courts, to which any judge must, in the first instance, attend, is very heavy and that, in fact, no judge can do this work except during his vacation and at the sacrifice of his own leisure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter we can consider.  We thought it was more desirable, if possible, to have a sitting judge.  The other would be an alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next sub-head deals with the Commission of Inquiry into the Preservation of the Gaeltacht.  That Commission is one that was set up by the Executive Council comparatively recently, and it is carrying out work which we regard as very necessary.  It is definitely the policy of the Government, as it was the aim of the Constitution, that every possible step should be taken for the preservation and <Col N="2528" /> spread of the national language of the country.  It is very difficult to frame the type of consistent policy which is necessary&mdash;the well-planned, consistent policy that will gradually achieve the object that has been in view, in a more or less well-defined way, by the majority of the people of this country ever since the Sinn Fein doctrine was generally accepted in the country.</P>
    <P>Sub-head (f) deals with the Commission on the Relief of Destitute Sick and Poor, including the Insane Poor. It has, I think, just begun its operations. The notable item under that heading is £1,000 for travelling and subsistence allowances.  That large figure is put down because it is the intention of the Commission to sit in provincial centres.  If that is done, it will involve considerable expense under this sub-head.</P>
    <P>Sub-head (g) deals with the Committee on National Health Insurance and Medical Services.  The Committee has presented a very interesting and useful interim report, on which it may be possible to take action before very long.  It is a report which I look upon as of very considerable value, especially in view of the general lack of knowledge of the realities of the question of national health insurance in the country.</P>
    <P>Sub-head (h) deals with the Dáil Eireann Courts (Winding-Up) Commission, which has concluded its labours.</P>
    <P>Sub-head (i) deals with the Greater Dublin Commission of Inquiry.  This Commission has, so far, endeavoured to hold its sittings while the Dáil and Seanad were in session, so that expenses would be kept to the lowest possible level.  It is not possible, owing to the very wide scope of the inquiry which the Greater Dublin Commission has undertaken, to state when it is likely to conclude its proceedings.</P>
    <P>Sub-head (j) deals with the Intoxicating Liquor Commission, which has been sitting for some time.  I think it will not continue for very long.  This estimate was arrived at rather hastily, because the Commission was being appointed when the estimates were being prepared.  However, it is estimated that the amount provided will suffice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2529" /> Sub-head (k) deals with the NorthEastern Boundary Bureau, which did work preparatory to the sitting of the Boundary Commission.  It prepared matter which, I think, has been of very great value, and the results of which will be seen to have been of importance when the Commission comes to give its findings.  It is necessary to continue the work of this Bureau until a decision has been reached on the boundary matter.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head (1) the Old Age Pensions Committee is dealt with.  It has not, as yet, been able to present a report.  It is dealing with matters several of which are discussed here this afternoon&mdash;matters in which difficulties arise that are very hard to overcome when we wish to act fairly both to the State, as representing the general taxpayer, and to the applicants for old age pensions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put one or two questions on matters which the Minister has not covered, although his statement was very complete and ample.  The first question is with regard to the Boundary Commission.  Item (b) under that sub-head deals with fees to counsel. One of the counsel engaged has recently been promoted to the Bench, and I presume that somebody has been appointed in his place.  If anybody has been appointed in his place, I think it might be to the general benefit that a statement should be made as to who has been so appointed.  Allied with that is the question of the NorthEastern Boundary Bureau.  The Minister did state, and these printed Estimates do, in several cases, state when it is expected that these Commissions will terminate.  It is, of course, impossible to say when the Boundary Commission will terminate.  That is not within our control.  I suppose one may take it that the Boundary Bureau will continue as long as the Boundary Commission will continue.  I would like to have some knowledge as to whether it is considered that the Boundary Bureau should last as long as the Boundary Commission will last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I might make a suggestion&mdash;I do not make it for this year because a <Col N="2530" /> good deal of time has already been spent upon the Estimates&mdash;it would, I think, be desirable and  when dealing with these Votes in future, in cases where Chairmen of Commissions are members of this House, that they should let the House know exactly how their particular task is progressing.  If that were done, it might be very useful.  In one case, I think, we can get that information now.  That is in regard to the Gaeltacht Commission.  I am stirred to admiration by this report under sub-head (e). I think it is a most profound statement. Every other Commission, I notice, has got staffs.  Some of them have got judicial commissioners, and all of them have got secretaries.  This admirable Commission, for its entire staff, has got a cleaner at £25 a year.  I do not know exactly what the significance of a cleaner is in connection with this Commission or why it should be able to dispense with a secretary, which every other Commission requires.  I do not know either why it should want a cleaner when no other Committee or Commission wants a cleaner.  Why have we this substitution of a cleaner for a secretary?  I think we should have some information on that subject.</P>

      <P>I do not want to anticipate the Education Estimates.  I want to say another word on the subject of the Civil Service (Compensation) Committee.  I would urge the Minister for Finance to take into consideration the possibility of appointing someone with judicial experience, who is not now employed as a judge, to this Committee.  Its work is very much in arrear and the inevitable result is mistrust and suspicion.  I am constantly receiving letters, which I constantly turn down, stating that this Committee has been abolished by the Minister for Finance and that he is now dealing with every claim for compensation himself, and turning them all down in order to save the revenue.  I do not believe that is true, and I tell my correspondents that it is not true.  At the same time, there is a feeling of that kind abroad and it would be desirable to put an end to it by appointing another Chairman in the place of Mr. Justice Wylie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have pensioned at least half a dozen judges of the High Court; we have pensioned nearly ten County Court Judges.  I do not believe that those gentlemen who have judicial experience are so devoid of public spirit that if they were asked to do it, they would not take part in the deliberations of this Committee.  Probably you could find one or two who would be willing to do it without payment.  That <Col N="2532" /> is the practice elsewhere; it is the practice in Great Britain for pensioned servants of the State to come back and help the State in an emergency.  I refuse to think so lowly or so meanly of the Irish Bench and Bar as to imagine they would not do the same.  I refuse to think they would be so mean as to refuse help on an occasion like this. That would enable us to avoid the necessity, which is a very unpleasant necessity and which, I believe, is an avoidable necessity, of putting extra labour on a serving judge.  That is unfair. A judge ought not to be taken away from his ordinary duties.  When you are pensioning on the scale that has been adopted lately, you ought to be able to find one who will take part in a Committee of this kind.</P>

      <P>With reference to Deputy Cooper's statement, I might mention that there has been another cause for delay.  I am not quite sure whether we should regard it as being yet removed. So long as the whole matter was <i>sub judice</i>, it was impossible to get any person of judicial rank to take this office.  People who were concerned, when they were defeated in the Supreme Court, vowed very strongly that they were going to the Privy Council, and so forth.  I do not know whether the Privy Council would hear them.  I do not know what the result would be if they did, or whether there would still be a likelihood of the case being further tried.  It probably would be undesirable to proceed until we would know whether they are going ahead or not.  I do not know whether appeals are being taken; that matter has yet to be taken into account.</P>

      <P>I wanted to refer to that point.  Does the Minister intend to say that he will not set up this Committee to carry on the work because of <Col N="2533" /> the possibility that prospective applicants for a pension under the terms of the Treaty might not be satisfied with the procedure and might possibly go to the Privy Council, and, therefore, the work of this Committee cannot be carried on?  It amounts to that, with the exception that there may be a certain probability or a greater likelihood in view of certain legal action that may be taken.  Even though there was a decision one way or the other, there is always the possibility of persons taking action in the court.  If the fear of an action in the court will prevent the Committee functioning, then the Committee will never function.  I would urge that the Committee ought to be set up. Leave the question of the judicial decision entirely apart from the decision as to the setting up of the Committee.</P>

      <P>I want some information in connection with sub-head (a).  I do not know if the Minister has received any complaints as to the tardiness with which this body is doing its work.  I have received a score of letters.  I quite appreciate that there is a good deal of difficulty in deciding as to who is, or who is not, entitled to a pension.  Possibly if all the people who applied for pensions were to get them, or were entitled to get them, the thing would have been settled a good <Col N="2534" /> deal earlier.  I want to find out how many certificates have been issued, when the Board of Assessors intend to start on their circuit, or intend to travel to the different towns.  There is some dissatisfaction, I know, and it would, perhaps, allay some of that dissatisfaction if the Minister would let us know what arrangements are being made for dealing with this matter with expediency and dispatch.</P>

      <P>There have been very great numbers of complaints, naturally, and there will be complaints, because everybody thinks that his case should be dealt with first.  When you have thousands of cases you are bound to have a great number of complaints. The Committee has done a considerable amount of work.  I have not the figures at the moment, but I am sure that something in the nature of 252 actual pensions have passed through my Department, and have been sanctioned.  Probably double that number have been dealt with by the Committee, and are on the way.  After the Committee has issued its certificates, a certain procedure has to be gone through before the award of a pension can be made out and sent along to the Finance Department. A great number, probably 500 cases, have been dealt with fully by the Committee.  The Board is about to go out and visit various centres in the country.  It will go to other centres in the course of, or inside, a month.</P>

    <P>There are certain increases in this Vote due to the extension of the work of the Commission.  The increase in staff shown in sub-head (a) is one lower executive and two lower clerical officers. Certain other appointments of a higher executive officer, a staff post, and a typist were made last year.  They took effect only towards the end of the year, and provision was included for only part of the salary in the estimates for last year, which means that there <Col N="2535" /> is a greater increase in the amount required for salaries this year than would be the case if there had been simply an addition of three members to the staff. The one cleaner that is mentioned is a cleaner employed at 33 St. Stephen's Green, where the Civil Service Commission is situated.  The cost is shared with other offices in that building, including the Endowed Schools, the Central Midwives Board, and General Nursing Council, etc.  In connection with sub-head (b), the provision is approximately the same as last year, and it is, of course, based on the experience of last year.  There is the question of the fees for examiners and superintendents. In certain cases papers are set, without any special fees being paid, by inspectors in the Department of Education. In other cases fees are paid.  For instance, in the recent examination for Junior Administrative Officers, the fee paid for setting a paper was £5.  In the last Customs and Excise Officers examination there was a fee of £5 paid for the setting of a paper.  For the Junior Executive Officers examination, held last March, a fee of £3 was paid.</P>
    <P>The question has arisen from time to time as to the fees charged candidates at examinations.  For a county surveyor's examination the fee was £3 3s.; for the junior administrative examination in March and the examination of last year for assistant inspectors of taxes the fee was £3; for officers of Customs and Excise examination&mdash; salary £120 to £250 plus bonus&mdash;the fee charged was £2.  In the case of junior executive officers, where the salary is £90 to £350 plus bonus, the fee for sitting at the examination was £1 10s.  In the case of clerical officers, £70 to £200 plus bonus, there is a fee of £1.  That goes down to the case of clerical officers' examination for ex-service men, where there is a fee of 5s.  A shorthand typists' and typists' examination was held, for which the salary is 24s. to 38s. per week, and there was a very small fee&mdash;2s. 6d. in one case.</P>
    <P>It might be asked why the cost of printing is borne under sub-head (c) of this Vote and not borne, as in the case of other offices, by the Stationery <Col N="2536" /> Office.  The reason is that special arrangements have to be made for the printing of examination papers, to prevent leakage of information as to their contents.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Commission held, during the year 1924-25, the following examinations for the Civil Service generally: 25 examinations for the police and the courts, for the police largely; 2 examinations for local authorities.  The total number of examinations held to date for the Civil Service generally has been 37.  The number of competitors was 4,018.  The number of successful or qualified&mdash;of course in certain cases the number who qualified was perhaps treble the number of places&mdash;was 1,140.  They held eight examinations for the Department of Justice.  Those were really police examinations.  There were 1,107 competitors, and 622 qualified.  They held three examinations for the Local Government Department.  There were 34 competitors, and 21 were successful.</P>
    <P>In addition to examinations, the Civil Service Commission arranges for appointments through the medium of selection boards.  There have been set up for Civil Service appointments 54 selection boards, of which 43 have so far completed their work.  The number of applicants was 2,278.  The number of applicants who were interviewed after a certain number had been weeded out, on examination of their papers, was 453, and the number of appointments made was 76.  That is, for 76 appointments, on which selection boards were held, there were 2,278 applicants. There is a certain number of examinations in view in the coming year, and the work of the Commission will certainly be no less than it has been in the past.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of Irish for the examinations, out of 48 examinations there were 11 in which Irish, though not compulsory, was the major subject, with the result that the candidate who did not take it had little chance of success in the competition. There were 10 out of 48 in which Irish was compulsory for all candidates.  In most of the others Irish was a minor subject and only served to enable the <Col N="2537" /> candidate to qualify, or to secure a higher place.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of Army candidates, two examinations were confined to Army candidates, a Customs and Excise examination in 1923 and a Clerical Officers' examination in 1924. In the case of two other examinations, half of the vacancies were reserved for Army candidates.  These were Customs and Excise examinations in March and October, 1924.  In a Junior Accounts Clerks' examination in March of the present year entrance was limited to Army candidates and to certain existing civil servants.  In addition to these there were four examinations held in which candidates got special privilege by way of service marks.</P>
    <P>The work of issuing actual Civil Service certificates caused delay for a considerable time, because a staff had not been procured and the organisation of the office was just being set up.  That has now been gone ahead with, and a very considerable number of certificates have actually been made out and issued, and others are in process of being issued. I think in a very short time the work of the Commission in that respect will be up-to-date.</P>

      <P>I would just like to ask the Minister for an explanation of the large increase in bonus.  The bonus has increased by £983.  The increase of staff is only 4.  Earlier in <Col N="2538" /> the evening the Minister, in reply to Deputy Hewat, said that it was only in very rare cases that the bonus was more than £200 a year.  Presumably it is due to the fact that this Department was only in embryo before, and has now taken its permanent form, but we should like to have some sort of explanation of an increase of this kind.</P>

      <P>I have not made any calculations in the matter, but, in addition to the three members of the staff who were actually added this year, there were three from last year who were only paid for a portion of the year.  There would also be a certain increase in the bonus, through its being paid at a higher rate.  But I cannot at the moment explain to the Deputy the full difference between £429 and £1,412. The facts that I have mentioned seem only to provide a partial explanation.</P>

    <P>Under sub-head (a), the sum asked for this year is £1,700,000 for compensation for pre-truce damage.  That is less than half the amount asked for last year.  It is, however, more than was actually spent last year.  The amount actually paid out under that sub-head last year was £1,970,001.  A good deal of the cause of that was the holding up of the work of the Commission, owing to a question that arose as to the meaning of its terms of reference.  There has been delay in discharging some of the awards of the Compensation (Ireland) Commission because of reinstatement conditions being attached which have not yet been fulfilled.  Our practice is  make payments of instalments in such cases according as the actual work of rebuilding proceeds.  We act on the certificate of the Commissioners of the Board of Works.  They are moved to inspection by receiving the certificate of the architect in charge of the actual work.  It is estimated that a sum of £880,000 remains to be distributed in this way.  It is believed that the Compensation (Ireland) Commission will finish their labours this year and it is hoped, consequently, that the present year will see the end of payments in respect of pre-truce periods unless some unforeseen obstacle occurs.</P>
    <P>Sub-head (b) deals with the expenses of the Compensation (Ireland) Commission. Heretofore we have only borne part of the expense of the Compensation (Ireland) Commission.  As a matter of fact, our charge was 45 per cent. The British paid 55 per cent.  But a new arrangement was reached, in the first instance, in October, 1924.  This new agreement arose out of a dispute as to the terms of reference, and the British Government entered into an agreement to pay us a lump sum of £900,000 to discharge all their further liabilities in respect of this damage.</P>
    <P>It was provided that we should be entitled to issue, through the Governor-General, fresh terms of reference to the Compensation Commission so as to bring in classes of cases which either were not included in the original terms of reference, or where there was doubt as to whether or not they were included. These new terms of reference were issued by the Governor-General early in the year.  As a result of the change of this agreement as to the £900,000, the entire expenses of the Compensation (Ireland) Commission are now borne by us except the expense of Mr. Howell Thomas, who was the British nominee, and who is, I think, a Government official.  The personnel of the Commission remains unchanged. That was also part of the agreement.  That change explains the increase in the cost of running the Compensation (Ireland) Commission.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head (c) the amount asked for is £1,750,000, that is, half the amount asked for last year, but it is considerably in excess of the amount actually paid last year, which was £875,309.  When the Estimate was being framed last year there was comparatively little information on which we could go.  Only a small proportion of the claims had been heard, and we had no idea of the rate at which progress would be made with the hearing of the cases for compensation under the Damage to Property Act.  Also we had no experience of another matter which caused that much smaller sum to be paid out than was anticipated, the delays which have necessarily elapsed between the hearing of the claims and the lodgment of the decrees or the reports with the Department of Finance.  The total number of claims lodged is, as I have said in another connection, about 26,000.  Roughly two-thirds of these have been heard: 12,500 have been paid and about 3,000 have been dismissed.  The aggregate amount <Col N="2541" /> of awards earmarked for reinstatement notified to the Department of Finance up to the present is £850,000, and £170,000 has been paid.  The balance merely awaits compliance with the conditions attached to the awards.  On the receipt of an award to which a reinstatement condition is attached the applicant is notified of the conditions with which he must comply; that is, to send in the requisite certificate as the work of reinstatement proceeds, and when an inspection has been carried out by the Board of Works payment is made.  About two-thirds, from the numerical point of view, of the cases heard in the courts are report cases under Section 15 of the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923. The reports are made in respect of losses, such as looting or commandeering by the Irregulars.  Of course they are not two-thirds in value.  These reports are in the nature of recommendations to the Minister for Finance, who is responsible for acting on them or rejecting them, in whole or in part, and there is no appeal, either by the Minister for Finance or by the individual. In these circumstances it is essential that the recommendations should be scrutinised in the Department of Finance before payments are made. Amongst other things, different judges adopt different standards and different interpretations of the law.  Any case in which a legal matter arises is referred to the legal advisers of the Government.</P>
    <P>Very many questions have been addressed to me in the Dáil from time to time in reference to delay.  Delay arises from a variety of causes.  First, there may be delay in hearing the claims; congestion in the courts has caused great delay in many cases.  Then, even when the claim has been heard and decided upon, sometimes a very considerable period elapses before proper steps are taken by the applicant's solicitor to have the decree made out, signed by the Judge, and forwarded to the Department of Finance.  When it reaches the Department of Finance there is also a certain amount of delay in making the investigations that are necessary in respect of claims against the decrees, <Col N="2542" /> liability of the holder of the decree to income tax, the question of claims against him by the local authorities, and so forth.</P>
    <P>Sub-head (d) is compensation for damage to railway property between the 12th July, 1921, and the 12th May, 1923, inclusive.  I do not think that any further provision will be asked for under this sub-head.  The payments are made in pursuance of an agreement that was entered into with the railway companies about the time that the Damage to Property Act was passed. Payments are only made on the certificates of the Government's consulting engineer.  Payments already made to the railway companies to the 31st March, 1925, under that agreement, amount to approximately £546,000, of which £230,000 was paid in 1924-5.  The provision under sub-head (e) is for the purpose of defraying expenses incurred by the Government in connection with the investigation, defence and discharge of property claims, both before and after the Truce.  It includes fees and salaries payable to counsel, architects, valuers and engineers, other than the Government consulting engineer, whose salary is borne on the Vote of the Department of Finance.  It also includes the cost of advertising in the Press awards which are proposed to be discharged, and the publishing of notices. It includes the expenses of the staff employed in the office on work exclusively in connection with property losses, compensation claims, and the travelling and incidental expenses of such of the permanent staff as perform compensation work.  The provision of £20,000 shows a decrease of £5,000 on last year's figures.  That is not a very large reduction, but it has to be borne in mind that as building progresses, the expenses in connection with applications for advances on foot of decrees will increase, and while the expenses of investigation in connection with pre-Truce claims will decrease very considerably, it is anticipated, on the other hand, that similar expenses in connection with post-Truce cases which are now being rather rapidly disposed of, will increase.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2543" /> Under sub-head (f) provision is made for a contribution towards the expenses incurred by county councils prior to the 12th May, 1923, in investigating and opposing claims for damage to or loss of property after the 11th July, 1921.  In certain cases councils did not take up the attitude that was generally adopted, where they have made up their minds from the beginning that no part of the damage then being done would be borne on the local rates, and refused to take any steps towards defending or contesting claims that were put in.  A few councils did decide to oppose the claims, and incurred expense in having them investigated with a view to opposition in the courts if changes in the law had not been made by the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, and if they had still been liable under the Malicious Damages Act.  It is felt that the action of these councils did save the State considerable sums by preventing bogus and inflated claims being got away with, and it is proposed to give a contribution towards meeting the costs that were incurred by two or three county councils in that regard.</P>
    <P>Sub-head (g) is for compensation under the Indemnity Act, 1924, for damage to or loss of property.  The committee set up under the Indemnity Act had not been able to get to work to any extent before the end of the last financial year.  A sum of £90,000 is now asked for the purpose of paying reasonable compensation to persons who incurred loss during the national struggle.  The committee has now made very considerable progress with its work.  It is felt that this provision will be ample and that the work will be completed, or almost completed, in the present financial year.  The expenses incurred by the committee are not very much; they are confined practically to the salary paid to an investigation officer whom it was considered advisable to appoint for the purpose of reporting for the information of the committee his opinion on the merits of the cases referred to him and of submitting estimates of the compensation which might  be paid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2544" /> The Supplementary Estimate which has been circulated is for £15,000.  It arises out of a settlement with the British Government on outstanding matters in which various claims were put forward and admitted on each side. There are considerable numbers of cases which have been extremely difficult to settle.  For instance, in connection with liability for personal injuries, and for liability where it was difficult to determine which side did the damage, we came to an agreement whereby we were to take on directly the outstanding liability for property losses in 1916 amounting to £45,000.  As far as £30,000 of that is concerned, the British Government will recoup us as payments are made.</P>
    <P>As regards £15,000 of it, it was set off against a claim of the British Government to an additional contribution of £13,000 in respect of personal injuries compensation, and another claim for a refund of £2,065 in connection with personal injuries.  The net result of the bargain roughly is that we are the better by about £65 on the transaction.</P>

      <P>I fear that it is not within my province as a private member to move an increase of this Vote.  That being so I shall have to fall back upon the device of moving its reduction by £100.  The reasons that prompt me to do that are many, but I intend to deal mainly with one.  In regard to the whole question of compensation, pre-Truce and post-Truce, compensation for property, and for personal injuries, I desire to say that I give all credit to the Government for passing laws, setting up tribunals, and endeavouring by these methods to secure compensation to just and deserving cases.  I am not going to deal now, as I should be out of order, with the personal injuries aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the compensation for loss of property, allow me to say at once, echoing, I think, the statements made by the President earlier in the afternoon, that no fair-minded person could in all justice find fault with the working and the administration of the Wood-Renton Commission.  That dealt with a certain period.  But the period <Col N="2545" /> that I want to confine my remarks to is covered by the Damage to Property Act of 1923&mdash;the period between the 12th July, 1921, and the 12th May, 1923.  That Act dealt exclusively with damage to property.  The Minister has correctly stated the law in regard to certain forms of claims, namely, reports. That Act passed by the previous Dáil set up tribunals consisting of judges, and gave those judges authority to make recommendations&mdash;as the Minister truly said, only recommendations in certain cases, mostly cases of loot&mdash; to the Minister for Finance, for what I shall candidly admit is an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment.  To my mind that was a most iniquitous procedure.  I am not now going into detail about the Act, because the Act is there, and we have got to take it.  I should like to say, however, in passing, that the proposal to set up judges, to call them judges, have cases tried before them, and then when they decided those cases, to have no appeal for the applicant, but to have the whole award of a judge made the subject-matter of the will and the whim of the then Minister for Finance, is an iniquitous procedure.  However, there it is.</P>
    <P>What we have to investigate now is the administration of the Act.  I cannot question the amount of the awards made.  The cases came before the judges, and the judges used their discretion and judgment.  As the Minister said, they varied.  What judges never did vary upon any question, either of law or fact, I should like to know? However, the fact remains that they made their awards.  I do not quarrel with these awards.  There have been grave complaints about the delay in paying them.  I am not now going into that question.  Those awards were made after the cases were fought out, on one side by the applicant, and upon the other by the State solicitor&mdash;fought, let me say, openly and candidly, in my experience, fairly and squarely by the State solicitors.  The awards were made and, according to what I call this iniquitous law, the Minister for Finance has a perfect right to pay all or nothing of the awards in report cases.  So far so good.</P>
    <P>Now I want to come to another class <Col N="2546" /> of case that I dealt with yesterday in a question to the Minister.  I want to come to a case that was not fought out, as far as the amount of the award was concerned, before the judge, but where the State solicitor and the State valuer&mdash;in many cases not a local valuer but a man sent down by the Public Works Office specially for these cases&mdash;on the one hand, and the applicant, his counsel and solicitor upon the other, come to an agreement.  An agreement as to what?  An agreement as to the amount that the award shall be, not as to the law as to whether there should be an award or not; that is a matter for the judge.  They come to an agreement as to the amount of the award, subject, of course, to the judge deciding that the case lies within the four corners of the Damage to Property Act and that the applicant is entitled to an award.  In my own small experience I have known hundreds of cases of that description and thousands of them have occurred.  If those consents had not been made very few awards would have been made, because the business would not have been able to have been gone on with.  What is my complaint?  It is this, that in numerous instances&mdash;instances that I am not going to go into detail on, as the Minister for Finance said yesterday that he required further notice&mdash; where that agreement had been made by the applicant&mdash;thinking naturally and properly that the State solicitor and this accredited State representative were the spokesmen of the Government&mdash;and the judge decides that the application came within the Damage to Property Act and makes an award of the sum fixed upon, those agreements have been repudiated and dishonoured by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I am not bandying words about this matter.  I quoted a case yesterday, and I am going now to give the name of the gentleman concerned.  It was a case from Charleville, County Cork, and the applicant was John Coleman.  He made an application for the sum of £86 under the Damage to Property Act.  Before the case came on in court the State solitor and the Government valuer came to his counsel and solicitor and suggested that they should come to an agreement <Col N="2547" /> as to the sum to be awarded, provided the judge said that the case came within the Act.  After the greatest reluctance&mdash;I can say this with authority, and I think in some cases counsel have some persuasion&mdash;on the advice of his counsel the applicant consented to this agreement, believing, as he was entitled to believe, that the State solicitor and the Public Works Office valuer spoke for the Department of Finance and the Government.  The case was heard by the judge that this Government set up to hear the case.  The applicant did not put the judge there.  The judge decided that the case was within the four corners of the Act.  He said that the applicant was entitled to compensation, whereupon it was stated that an agreement had been come to and, according to all justice, fair play and custom, the judge awarded the sum of £51, which was the amount arrived at between the two parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean that he reported in favour of it, or was it a decree?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>The judge reported in favour of £51.  If the Minister thinks he is going to ride away on that point, he is making a great mistake. As I said before, where the case was fought out fair and square between one side and the other, the Minister for Finance has a right to turn down the report, but where the Minister for Finance and the Government have their State solicitor there, and send down a State valuer, and they both agree to a sum, then the Government should not, at any rate, go back of and dishonour that agreement.  There is a great difference between the two cases.  The amount reported for was £51, and the solicitor received a cheque for £1 from the Department of Finance and £12 12s. costs.  I want Deputies to listen to this. What do they think of that?  £12 12s. costs!  What does that stand for?  I leave Deputies to draw their own conclusions. I can tell them that the solicitor sent back that £1, and also the £12 12s. costs.  It is said that there is no appeal by the applicant in a case that is fought out.  That is true.  The Minister for Finance has a right to <Col N="2548" /> turn it down where the case has been fought, but I say he has not a right to turn it down where his representatives have agreed to a fixed sum.</P>
      <P>It may be said, as the Minister very glibly said to me yesterday: &ldquo;Oh, but it has been discovered subsequently that these were fraudulent cases.&rdquo;  I ask him is he to be the judge or is the judge to be the judge as to whether they are fraudulent or not?  What is the good of going through this farce of putting a judge upon the Bench and then having a gentleman from the Department of Finance stating afterwards that it was a fraudulent case?  Is the judge to be a judge, or what is he to be?  Is the judge to be the judge, or who is to be the judge?  Further, I asked the Minister yesterday whether he was aware that the judges not only of the Circuit Court but of the High Court&mdash;his own judges, the Free State judges, who are supposed to be, and who, in this case, are showing themselves to be, independent of the Executive&mdash;have treated appeals from agreed cases with contempt and kicked them, out of court.  The Minister did not know that yesterday.  I told him so. Perhaps I should inform him a little more about it now.  I will quote him a case:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Albina Walsh, from County Cork, was applicant; the Minister for Finance was respondent.  The applicant was granted £105 by consent&mdash;</P>
      <P>mark you, sir, &ldquo;by consent,&rdquo; that is, the State agreeing, through their solicitor and valuer, to £105&mdash;</P>
      <P>in respect of damage to dwelling-house, and offices attached, at 98 Blarney Street, Cork.  Mr. Joseph Healy, who (instructed by Mr. O'Connell, Solicitor) appeared for the State, applied to have the case re-opened.  Mr. George Daly, B.L., who (instructed by Mr. Julian, Solicitor) appeared for the applicant, said that no right of appeal lay, as a consent had been entered into.</P>
      <P>That, sir, is my case this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original decree was for £135, and Mr. Julian, applicant's solicitor, consented to accept £105.  The Recorder ruled accordingly.  Mr. Healy, in reply to his Lordship, said <Col N="2549" /> he wanted to appeal.  His Lordship: &ldquo;Appeal against a consent!  I am not going to allow any such thing to be done, because it would be contrary to all principles of justice and of honesty.&rdquo;  His Lordship affirmed the decree for £105 with costs.</P>
    <P>That is the way that the Circuit Judges are treating appeals taken by the Minister for Finance against consents entered into by his own officials, acting on behalf of the State.  I will give another case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>The President is not going to draw a red herring across my path.  The Shaw Commission does not give any compensation for loot, and I gave credit to the Government, when they introduced the Damage to Property Act, for the provision they made in this regard.  The Damage to Property Act does give <i>ex-gratia</i> payments for loot.  I said before that they were <i>ex-gratia.</i>  I said before that if there was no consent, they would have a perfect right, under the Damage to Property Act, to give all or none of the amount reported. But I do draw a distinction in a case where there has been a consent, where a State solicitor and a Government valuer have consented to a sum for the applicant, subject to the judge's decision as to whether the case came within the four corners of the Act.  I cannot <Col N="2550" /> follow the Minister's line of argument, when he says that he took legal advice upon the matter.  If a judge decides a case, the Minister for Finance thinks he has got a right to come along and take advice from his legal adviser.  Is that the way the law is going to be carried out in this country?  Is that the way the judges are to be independent of the Executive?  If that is the way, we may shut up shop, so far as justice, equity and judicial authority is concerned.  I say the Minister for Finance has got no more right to take legal advice as to a judge's legal decision than he would have to take legal advice as to whether the resolutions passed or the speeches made in this House were in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt with the Circuit Court. I am now coming to the High Court. A case came from Cork recently.  I have not got the name of the case, but I am perfectly satisfied that I am giving the facts.  I will give the name of the solicitor.  A case was brought from County Cork in which Mr. Anthony Carroll appeared for the applicant.  In that case, also, a sum had been arrived at by consent, and the judge had given his report or decree&mdash;in this matter I do not care whether it is a report, an award or a decree.  The point is that the State consented to it, and there is no use in quibbling about reports or awards or decrees.  This case came before the High Court in Dublin quite recently, and the High Court treated it in precisely the same manner that the Recorder for Cork treated the other case.  He told them that he was not going to entertain any appeal from the Government or from the Minister for Finance on a matter on which their own accredited representatives had given their consent.  This is a matter that, perhaps, has not occurred to the minds of city Deputies.  I am certain it has occurred to the minds of country Deputies.  But it may not have occurred to members of the Executive Council or to city Deputies before.  I tell them that, throughout the country, the Government will be utterly discredited if they are going to allow it to be said&mdash; and said with truth&mdash;that they sent representatives down to the country to strike bargains with applicants under <Col N="2551" /> the Damage to Property Act, after the judges decided&mdash;their own judges&mdash;on the point of law which they should be the judges of, and not the Minister for Finance, because the Minister for Finance is not a judge, and that when those cases have been duly awarded, reported or decreed&mdash;I do not care which &mdash; the Government dishonour them.  That is what it has come to.  It is all very well for Ministers, perhaps, to treat this in cavalier fashion, as the Minister for Finance seemed to treat it yesterday.  But I can assure him that the people in the country do not treat it that way, and that if he is going to pursue this policy of going behind the backs of his own judges and of inquiring into their decrees or awards or reports, so far as the law is concerned &mdash;which he suggested here this afternoon&mdash;I tell him that there will not be much respect in the country either for his Government or for his law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Redmond has made a great deal of noise about a very small matter.  These report cases are investigations by a judge with a view to recommending a sum to the Minister for Finance to be paid in respect of damage done or property taken by way of loot.  They were made <i>ex-gratia</i>, because loot is a matter for which you ordinarily would not give compensation at all.  There can be a tremendous lot of fraud in connection with loot.  It is impossible to know what is taken.  If it is a case of destruction of a building, it is easy to get evidence of what the building was.  It is easy to get evidence of what would restore it.  You have something very firm to go upon. A reasonable estimate can be made and a judge can give a decision.  On the question of loot, especially with many people having all sorts of views in the country, some people not knowing which side was going to win and being willing to give goods to one side and to claim for loot afterwards, if the side they were taking did not succeed, there was every opportunity for the State being defrauded out of large sums.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There were great opportunities for defrauding the State. Consequently, the matter was put on an entirely <i>ex-gratia</i> basis.  If the Minister for Finance receives a report, it is his duty, if any suspicious circumstances are reported to him in connection with the case, to have it investigated further.  That is done.  It is my duty to do it.  I am the guardian of the public purse.  I have to see that the money of the taxpayer is not paid out to people who are not entitled to it in law or in equity.  The question of a consent being entered into in any <i>ex-gratia</i> case is of no consequence whatever. The entering into a consent by the applicant does not prejudice his rights in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will allow me to finish, it will be more satisfactory. This frothing at the mouth, on the part of Deputy Redmond, is all right in court but he need not do it <Col N="2553" /> here.  Perhaps he will get many briefs as a result of frothing at the mouth here but I think he might spare us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The right of a person who has a claim in respect of loot, or something else, for which only a report can be made, is not prejudiced in any way by the case not being heard out in full by the court.  The matter is at all times fully in the discretion of the Minister for Finance.  The fact that some State solicitor or some valuer may have entered into a provisional agreement, which is subject to confirmation by the Minister for Finance, does not relieve the Minister for Finance of the right or the duty of going into the case. If circumstances are reported to us, as they were in a very large number of Cork cases&mdash;I do not want to pursue that matter further, and I will only say that in a very large number of cases in a certain district information came to us which showed, to our mind, collusion and fraud.  I do not know whether this case was one of them or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did you not remove your representative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>When we got that information we certainly were not going to act on agreements made fraudulently by some underling of our own.  I do not know whether this case was one of the number or not.  There are many thousands of cases and I cannot possibly know anything about a particular case. But I know that such things have occurred.  I know that consents being fraudulently entered into does not in any way affect my duty to have the reports examined when they come from the judge.  We do that.  We will always do that.  Our entire duty in the matter is to see that the right thing and the fair thing is done.  It is of no interest at all to me or to anybody concerned to refuse people payment that they are due.  On the other hand, it is clearly our duty to see that the money of the taxpayer is not wrongfully paid away.  There is no parallel between a report case and the case of an award. There is a definite legal procedure laid down for dealing with awards.  The <Col N="2554" /> procedure laid down in regard to reports is entirely different.  There was never any intention that the discretion of the Minister for Finance should be limited.  If there had been any such intention it would not have been left entirely optional with him whether he would pay a report in full, in part, or at all.  Now, I think it is not necessary to say any more about the matter than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will believe that I am not foaming at the mouth or endeavouring to impute any corrupt motives.  It seems to me that what he has said now is rather serious.  In the first place, he has talked about provisional agreements being entered into by representatives of the State.  The local State Solicitor and some representative of the Board of Works made it clear to claimants that those agreements are strictly provisional. If the State Solicitor actually seeks out a claimant&mdash;I have no particular knowledge of that, but it has been said that in some cases the State Solicitor has actually approached a claimant&mdash;does he make it clear to the claimant that any agreement reached is a provisional agreement and may be overridden?  If that is so, no sane man will enter into any agreement.  Will anybody enter into an agreement which is final as regards himself, but is not final as regards the other party?  I do not think the Minister himself has fully thought this matter out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says it is his duty to examine the reports when they come from the judge.  Is it not his duty to examine the particulars of the case before it ever goes to the judge?  If there is a suspicion of foul play, treachery or something fraudulent, surely that ought to be investigated before the case is laid before the judge. If any subsequent facts arise, I agree that the Minister may be justified in again examining the case; but the normal procedure should not be an examination by the Minister after the judge has dealt with the case.  There should be a very careful examination before the case is sent to the judge at all. Such procedure as the Minister has referred to is bad.  It creates suspicion and ill-feeling if it is generally believed <Col N="2555" /> that after a case has been tried in court, and after both sides have been heard before the judge, any decision arrived at can be overruled in a Ministerial office.  I am not a lawyer, but I believe that to be contrary to the spirit of the law.</P>
    <P>I am basing my remarks more on the Minister's reply than on the subject-matter of Deputy Redmond's attack. The State is very powerful and the individual applicant is very weak.  The State has resources, it has finance, it has power to provide counsel far beyond the power of any individual claimant or applicant.  The Minister's power should be exercised with moderation. It is excellent to have giant strength; it is tyrannous to use it like a giant.  I hope the Minister is not in this regard being tyrannous; but I have apprehensions.</P>

      <P>I am not going into this matter with any heat at all.  I am outside the whole matter of what Deputy Redmond has said, and I am quite willing to leave it at that. I have no knowledge of the facts with which he is dealing.  It is the Minister's reply that has made me apprehensive. In his reply he stated one thing in connection with which I do ask him to remove the impression he may have made.  He certainly made a definite impression on my mind.  He said that where his representatives in a particular case had come to an agreement which he afterwards believed to have been a fraudulent agreement, he repudiated that agreement.  I suggest that is contrary to all accepted practice. The agreement was made in his name.  It was made by a person who at that time had not been repudiated by him.  Whatever disciplinary action he might subsequently find it necessary to take in respect to the person who so wrongly acted at that moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not dealing with the question of whether he took it or not.  Whatever disciplinary <Col N="2556" /> action he might have found it necessary to take afterwards, the agreement made at that time in the person's name should have been recognised by the Minister as his act and should have been honoured by him.  The Minister stands here&mdash;I put it to him quite steadily&mdash;and says that certain persons were sent down on a certain occasion to have a certain consultation.  They were persons acting, to the belief of the persons on the other side of the table with whom they were negotiating, as the Minister's representatives, and as persons who were authorised to act on his behalf, and they made that agreement. If the Minister subsequently should find that the persons then acting on his behalf were acting in a disorderly or corrupt or fraudulent fashion, he would be entirely within his rights in taking the severest measures with regard to such persons.  The acts done by them on that occasion were done by them in his name, and I suggest they should be honoured by him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, sir, I am not going to imitate the Minister for Finance.  I am not going to sling back mud at him or use personalities.  I have never indulged in these things all through my political career, which has been a little bit longer than his.  I wish to deal with his argument that consent, as he said, was of no consequence in regard to a report.  Here is a responsible Minister getting up, speaking as a Minister&mdash;it does not matter whether he is the smallest or the greatest Minister of the lot&mdash;and stating that a consent entered into on behalf of the Government, no matter what the consent was about, whether it was about a cow or about a contract, whether it was about a report or a decree, is of no consequence.  Very well; I leave it at that.  He said that in a certain part of Cork it was known for some time&mdash; those were the words he used&mdash;that these fraudulent consents were being made.  My goodness!  And what was being done with the Government representatives when they were making these fraudulent consents?  Was the State solicitor in the district guilty of the fraud, or was the accredited Board <Col N="2557" /> of Works representative a party to the fraud?  If not, were they duped, were they made fools of?  Was it a fraud, were they made fools of, or was it a proper and outright and decent bargain? Which was it?</P>
      <P>If it was a fraud, why was not the gentleman responsible removed?  Evidently he was not, because it lasted some time.  To my knowledge, no State solicitor has been removed, and I do not subscribe to the Minister's description of these gentlemen as hirelings.  If it was a fraud, why were they not removed? If they were duped, and if they were such fools as that they were not able to act on behalf of the Government, why were they not removed? They were not removed because I tell you, sir, that they made very good bargains on behalf of the State with the applicants, and I have some knowledge that they made hard bargains with the applicants.  They acted well for their masters.  They beat them down and down and down until they got them to a certain figure, the applicants believing, as they were led to believe, and as they had every right to believe, that these people were acting <i>bona fide</i> on behalf of the State.  They beat them down, and when they had beaten them down to the limit that they would take, then the bargain was sealed, and subsequently dishonoured.</P>
      <P>Words the Minister has also used are collusion and fraud.  It takes two to make a collusion.  The applicant could not collude; there has to be some other party.  Who was the applicant in collusion with?  Was it with the judge, or was it with the State representatives who were such dupes and frauds that they were allowed to stay on, and who were such splendid officers of the State that they would not be removed?  We are told that there is no parallel between reports and awards.  I suppose if the State made a contract for one commodity in one part of the country through their representatives, there would be a question as to whether that contract would be honoured; but if they made another form of contract in another part of the country, we would be told: &ldquo;Oh, this is a different matter; the consent does not here apply.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2558" /> I notice the Minister has disdained to allude to my remarks as to his judges.  He has not referred to, or contradicted, the statement that the Judges of the High Court and the Circuit Court have refused to entertain these appeals from these consents, and they have spurned them and treated them with a contemptuous and a proper treatment.  Let him take an example from his Judges.  Let him be a man, and do not let him come down here as a whimpering popinjay, and say the consents in one case are not to be regarded as <i>bona fide</i>; they are in another.  The Minister may laugh it off, as he is endeavouring to do to-night; but I can assure him, if this is the way the law is going to be administered, if this is the way that he is going to treat the people and their representatives, the laugh will be on the other side of the cheek very shortly.</P>

      <P>I have seen a great deal of correspondence with regard to compensation claims for pre-Truce damage.  The matters I wish to refer to are claims which have been made by creameries throughout the country, particularly co-operative creameries.  I think the majority of those claims did not come under the old terms of reference, but they do come under the revised terms of reference. They are mostly for semi-consequential damages due to the closing of the creameries by orders of the British military, and at other times the staffs were removed and kept a considerable time from their duties.  The complaint I have to make is that the hearing of those claims has not been expedited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the pressure which has been brought to bear on the Commission and on the different Departments of State, the majority of these claims are still <Col N="2559" /> unheard, with the result that many of these creameries are in a bad financial condition.  Some of them are on the verge of toppling to financial ruin.  As the Minister must know, a great many of these creameries are depending for their finance on loans from banks, and the banks have been pressing them very urgently to pay off their loans and in a good many cases are threatening to take the usual legal proceedings against the guarantors and the shareholders of the creameries.  I do not know if it is within the power of the Ministry to cause these particular types of claims to be expedited.  I would say, if it is within his power, and if the claims are not being heard as they are on the list, that some effort should be made to expedite them.  They have been hanging over in many cases since previous to July, 1921, and the creameries are under a great loss.  As I said, many of them are on the verge of ruin owing to the delay in the settlement of these claims.  I would certainly urge on him the necessity for getting them dealt with as soon as possible.  I have a list here of thirty-one claims which have not yet been heard.  A very large sum of money is involved. Some of the claims are as high as £13,000.  I need not say that a loss of £13,000, or the proportion of it that they will get, is more than any ordinary creamery is in a position to bear.</P>

      <P>I think A of Vote 14&mdash;Pre-Truce Damages.  I want to ask the Minister a question with regard to reinstatement.  I have heard in certain cases where the people who have got compensation are subject to the reinstatement clause that arrangements have been made with the Ministry whereby, on the acceptance of a smaller sum, they are allowed to forego the reinstatement obligations.  I do not know whether that is a fact or not, but it is a fact that there are a great many houses that were damaged in the Black and Tan time and which are still derelict, no effort being made to rebuild them.  The Government ought to take some steps and, if necessary, they ought <Col N="2560" /> to pass some law whereby these people who have got reinstatement grants will be liable to lose the award if they do not rebuild.</P>
      <P>With regard to sub-head G&mdash;Compensation under the Indemnity Act of 1924&mdash;I have got no exact information, but my memory of it is that there was a date fixed after which applications could not be received for compensation in regard to losses under this Act, and as well as I remember the date was fixed a comparatively short time after the passing of the Act.  The difficulty has arisen that a great many people did not have any knowledge of this Act.  I know that there are a great many people who would have put in claims under this Indemnity Act if they had information.  The Minister must remember that a great many Acts are passed by this Dáil, and it is not the fact that everybody reads the Parliamentary reports in the newspapers, or finds out what Acts have been passed. It is also a fact that a great many people do not read ordinary advertisements, particularly Government advertisements, which are very uninteresting reading.  A number of them did not know that they had the right to claim compensation under this Act, and some of them had been told previous to the passing of the Act, by different Government Departments to which they had written, that they had no redress. They did not know that an Act had been passed which gave them power to claim.</P>

      <P>I might tell the President that a man came to me with a claim for a motor car which was taken from him in pre-Truce days.  He did not know anything about the procedure and he would not have made his claim in time only that I told him the last day for lodging claims and how to go about getting his claim.  I have heard of other similar cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to claims for compensation under the Damage to Property Act in respect of losses and damages since July, 1921, I want to tell the Minister that the feeling down the country, as <Col N="2561" /> far as I know, is that sufficient enquiries are not being made, and that in a great many cases the State Solicitor has not at his disposal, when defending these cases, a sufficient amount of information. There is a feeling that in a great many cases very excessive compensation has been granted.  Local people very often can make very shrewd estimates of what the losses are.  The State Solicitors very often are flooded with these cases and they do not always get the assistance that is due to them.</P>
    <P>There are a great many cases in which it would pay the State to take some steps whereby very close investigations could be made locally.  Local people, although they may know about these things, are slow to come forward. Sometimes they are not asked to come forward, and very often the information they have is information which really could not be dealt with in the courts, though very often it is true information. The result is that some very large grants have been made in the courts, particularly in regard to some large mansions.  A feeling exists that the owners of these mansions have got better terms in proportion to the losses suffered than people who had smaller houses and places which were very much less pretentious, destroyed. A mansion may have been built 70 or 80 years ago at a cost of £100,000, and I need not point out to the Minister that if placed on the open market now it might be a white elephant; it might not be worth anything.  The only other point to which I wish to call the Minister's attention is that creamery proprietors complain, in connection with the investigation of their cases, that they are not given an adequate chance of stating their cases.  Investigators are sent down to the creameries.  They are trained men who have become accustomed to this form of enquiry, and they deal with people who have no local knowledge or who are not, perhaps, the most competent to state their cases to the best advantage.  Having made a number of enquiries those investigators go back and report to the Compensation Commission, and the Compensation Commission make their award.  Once the award is made there is no possibility, as far as I know, of <Col N="2562" /> getting the case reheard.  When the Shaw Commission originally started it did hear cases in open court, and I understand that the party on the opposite side to the State were allowed to be represented by counsel.  I would suggest to the Minister that there should be some method devised that would give those people a chance of stating their cases in a more adequate manner than they are allowed to do at present.  If they are dissatisfied with the awards there should be some method of appeal.</P>

Are they to be allowed to leave these derelict sites there for an indefinite period? We are going into another summer and, as far as I can see, half the owners have made no effort to commence rebuilding. I would ask the Minister to bring some pressure to bear on them to start the work and give much-needed employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say first, with reference to the point raised by Deputy Cooper, that every effort is made to have cases fully investigated before they go into court, and after the matter has been fully brought to light in court, and the report of the judge is made, we would not vary it simply of our own will.  We would pay very great attention to the report.  I would like to say in regard to the State solicitors that they have done their work extremely well in connection with this matter, and that no sort of suspicion has arisen in connection with their work.  I wish to say no more about it, because the whole thing is being dealt with in a way that is appropriate at the present time.  I do not think it will be found generally that the power of reviewing report cases has been exercised in a way that was harmful.  I do not know whether Deputy Cooper has any definite information about any considerable number of cases, but I do not think he will find that it has been unduly harsh.  A considerable number of people have succeeded in getting reports where we were able to get very substantial evidence afterwards, very <Col N="2563" /> often as a result of the actual hearing of the cases in court and the publicity that was received for them, that goods alleged to have been looted were actually supplied to the Irregulars by people who were friendly with them, and were supplied in anticipation of payment. Cases of that nature have occurred very frequently, and it certainly was the clear intention of the Act that anybody who was actually sympathising with and in collusion with the Irregulars, and supplied goods to them, should not be able to get paid by the State afterwards. But we have not exercised the powers of revision of report cases in a way that could be regarded as unduly rigorous.  I have not really heard that alleged.  We realise the need for expediting the claims of the co-operative societies through the country.  We have put that point of view to the Compensation Commission.  Of course, the Commission has a big mass of work, and, no doubt, all sorts of applicants are pleading that their cases should be heard as soon as possible.  I believe that very rapid progress is now being made by the Commission in the hearing of cases, and it is anticipated that a great number of the co-operative cases will be dealt with very soon.</P>
      <P>A great number of advertisements were issued in connection with the Indemnity Act, and quite a considerable number of public notices.  I remember the section itself was issued as an advertisement, and people who might have claims were asked to apply.  There were subsequent notices also and a very big number of claims&mdash;I have not the figures now, but running into many thousands&mdash;were put in, so that a great number of people must have been aware that they could lodge claims under the Indemnity Act and the discussion must have brought it home to their neighbours. I do not think it would be possible, unless we get more detailed information than Deputy Heffernan has given, to contemplate opening the lists again.  This matter must close some time.  We cannot have our compensation tribunal sitting for ever.</P>

      <P>I think it will require a very strong case indeed to cause us to consider further legislation in this matter.  People had ample time, and really if we did extend the time by legislation we would have a further spate of claims, probably many of them of a rather frivolous nature.  I know that when any sort of tribunal runs too long there is a tendency for more claims of a very trifling character to come in.</P>
      <P>The difficulties of the State Solicitors in getting evidence is very fully appreciated.  That is one of the reasons, for instance, why we are making provision to repay to some counties sums they expended in the early stages in getting evidence.  We feel that the action they took made the whole thing easier and really saved sums from being paid out.  Deputy Heffernan talked about a mansion that cost £100,000 to erect.  It might be worth very little now.  Great care was taken in drafting the section of the Act to meet that case, and a tremendous amount of time was spent on it.  If the Act is too loose, I am afraid it cannot be helped now. Nothing can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne raised the question as to whether pressure could be put on the owners of spaces in O'Connell Street to rebuild.  Of course there is pressure that could be put on, and it was considered, but the idea of putting that particular pressure on the owners was rejected owing to the feeling that it would be harsh and unjust.  We were urged from certain quarters, and we did consider whether we might not say to the owners: &ldquo;If you do not take steps to rebuild, your award, which is an <i>ex-gratia</i> award, will be reduced by 5 per cent.&rdquo;  We could do that, but we had to bear in mind the fact that this Compensation Act was very rigidly <Col N="2565" /> drawn and that as a matter of fact in many cases the awards under it were necessarily on the side of being short. I think the President would say they were very short.  We felt as that Act was drawn that no award in respect of a building could really be sufficient to reinstate the building or put up a new building.  We heard very general complaints, and it was felt, therefore, that we could not justly say to people in O'Connell St. who have not got sufficient awards, owing to the way the Act was drafted: &ldquo;Reinstate or put up a new building.&rdquo;  It would be harsh and unjust to impose a penalty, and that by way of a reduction on the award.  It is true the owners would have a better and a new building instead of the old one that was destroyed, but that does not make it easy for them to find the cash as they go along. We feel at present that we cannot well do anything in the matter of O'Connell Street.  There are, of course, certain powers in the Corporation Act.  We have urged them in every possible way but we feel that the only pressure we could apply would be pressure that we ought not apply.  It may be taken that we have definitely decided that we will not apply it.  On the other hand, and while perhaps it is irrelevant, we have made provision in this year's Estimates for considerable alterations in connection with the Post Office and the Four Courts, so that an amount of employment will be given in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he would like to encourage rebuilding in O'Connell Street.  I am sure he is not responsible, but will he use his influence to restrain the discouragement of rebuilding?  I know one firm who rebuilt at a cost of double their award. They were awarded £5,000 and rebuilt at a cost of £10,000.  The reward they <Col N="2566" /> got is that their valuation was increased by £120, and the only notice they got of that was when the demand came for the rates.  I suggest that is not the way to encourage rebuilding.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>We gave a little consideration in that respect.  We had that in mind in the Local Government Act.  The Minister cannot really exercise any discretion over that matter. There is a scale, and any interruption of the scale means starting from somewhere. The basis of the valuation is taken as the 1914 basis.  When I was Minister for Finance, and afterwards, I had a very exhaustive examination made into this whole question, and I was satisfied that any interruption of the ordinary administration of the Department would lead to such chaos that I do not believe a succession of Governments for the next 100 years would be able to remedy it.  The only way to remedy it would be by revaluation of the whole country, and that would remedy it only to an extent, by reason of the fact that a building that was a new building would bear an unduly high valuation.</P>

      <P>Under sub-head B, I wish to call attention to the practice that prevailed in the early stages of the Wood-Renton Commission. Their inspectors down the country put on valuations on the destroyed property in a haphazard manner.  I would like to know if their methods in this connection have improved, or is the old system still prevailing?  A case was brought to my notice where a hay rick was burned down by the Black-and-Tans, and some years afterwards an inspector was sent down and with due gravity he went out to see the site of the hay rick.  I submit that is bringing law and the principles of equity into contempt.</P>
      <P>When things are being valued they should have some regard to facts.  It was, furthermore, the practice in assessing houses damaged, for instance, by the Black-and-Tans, that the inspectors for the Wood-Renton Commission would make small offers in the beginning, and gradually advance.  I do not think that that is the correct and proper method to employ.  There should be but one offer, I fancy.  A fair offer should be made in the first instance, and it should not always be increased. I have to protest against that method of giving compensation to people. People suffered very severely in these instances, and it is scarcely fair, I think, that there should be a deliberate attempt made to beat them down.  They should get the fair value of their premises that have been damaged, and they should get that at the first offer.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies here have raised the question of the discontent that undoubtedly prevails in the country.  I think that is due to a great extent to the fact that various people all over the country, from time to time, write to the Ministry of Finance or to the Department that deals with cases of compensation, and I want to say that this Department, or Ministry, more than any other Ministry, has a habit of not answering correspondence.  I do <Col N="2569" /> suggest that when people who seem to be in a quandary as to what they should do, or when they should be paid compensation, write to the Ministry, the Minister for Finance himself would, in future, see that the correspondence was answered.

It is possible to arrange, easily, for a mere acknowledgment of these letters, but to get a reply sometimes is another matter, because you have a whole series of cases.  Some have to be dealt with by the Army, some by the Compensation (Ireland) Commission; some of them are in other Departments, and considerable delays, perhaps, will occur. Delays in dealing with these cases are caused because the letter very often goes to different Departments than those dealing with that section.  However, I am having that complaint, which was made here very strongly by the Deputy some time ago, investigated, with a view to remedying it.  With regard to complaints made by Deputy Connor Hogan, these investigators are appointed by the Wood-Renton Commission, which is a Commission of a judicial character.</P>

      <P>An arbitrator has a judicial status.  A person who is acting as judge has a judicial status.  It is the duty of the person who is acting <Col N="2570" /> as judge of that Commission to conduct its court and to see that the facts are brought forward and that a fair hearing is given to each person.  I do not know whether anything can be done in the matter, or whether anything needs to be done.  It is extremely difficult to come to a decision on a case without a considerable lapse of time.  I also think that the investigators have gained by the experience they have had, and that they will be able to do their work in a more satisfactory way.</P>

      <P>Under sub-head (c) I should like to draw attention to the fact that many complaints have been received as to the inadequacy of the compensation given, and in contradiction to Deputy Heffernan I have received many complaints.  A very considerable delay occurs before payments are made.  I wonder is there any means of expediting the payments? It was a very serious loss, in the first instance, to suffer the damage.  But the damage and loss is aggravated, perhaps a hundred-fold, by the long, and, I submit, the unnecessary delay that takes place before payment is made.  I ask the Minister is it possible to expedite payment in any way?  I readily admit that, of course, there are quite a number of technical points that have to be looked into.  But still, I think the Dáil and the country would consent to find the money to pay an increased staff to deal with these cases and to dispose of the burden of those cases that have been hanging over so long.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. MURPHY Mr. T. MURPHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice to-day that I would raise, on the adjournment, <Col N="2571" /> the question of the contemplated closing down of portion of the Timoleague and Courtmacsherry Railway. In doing so I have to apologise to the Dáil for bringing on the matter at such a late hour, and I have also to apologise to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for bringing on this matter just now, having regard to the very arduous work he is getting through at present.  My reason for doing so is that the matter is very important, and that the principle that underlies the action of the railway company is, I believe, and many others believe, going to affect many more people in the future.  The Great Southern Railways have given instructions that two and three-fourth miles of the railway between Timoleague and Courtmacsherry is to be closed down from the 1st June.</P>
      <P>Courtmacsherry is a village with 400 inhabitants, and it is one of the important seaside places that we have in Cork.  The people of the village are entirely dependent for their livelihood on the number of tourists who come to the place during the summer time, and on the number of people who come there in the excursion trains that are run to that seaside resort in the summer. Practically every person in the village accomodates visitors during the summer time.  In addition to that there is a matter of some importance in connection with the shipping of coal and maize from that town to the neighbouring towns.  In addition, sand is sent from Courtmacsherry Harbour to a number of places in West Cork.  That sand is used for agricultural purposes, and in that respect the loss will be very great to the farmers, because the only other source from which sand has been sent to the farmers along the Cork and Bandon line has been closed down, so that people who were getting sand for agricultural purposes will be put to much inconvenience owing to the closing down of this line.  All the sand that was used for agricultural purposes along the Cork and Bandon line practically came from Courtmacsherry.  I think the closing of this line will very seriously affect the people of that place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is another aspect.  A <Col N="2572" /> number of persons will be unemployed, and a number of people, who are dependent for their livelihood and their employment on this railway, will now lose their employment, owing to the closing down of the line.  The few railway employees who are at present working on that line will be thrown out of employment.  The excuse given by the railway company&mdash;if it is a genuine one&mdash;is legitimate enough.  That was that the line is in such a condition at the present time that it is necessary to close it down in order to carry out some repairs.  But a very significant fact in connection with this excuse is that the permanent way men who would be employed at repairs to the line have also got notice of dismissal.  The result is that the people have come to the conclusion that the excuse of the railway company in this matter is not honest. I submit that there is a good deal to be said for that view.  Considering that the men who would naturally be employed on the repairing work that is to be done to the line have been notified that their services will not be required from the 1st June, it looks as if the excuse was not a genuine one. These men believe that the closing down of this line is part of the policy of the company to get rid of their obligations, and to evade these obligations that they entered into under the Railway Act. It is feared by many people that in other parts of the country where there are similar railways this policy also will be put in force in the future.  Now, this railway is a baronially-guaranteed railway, and the position will be that, even though the line is closed down, the people who are paying the baronial guarantee will have to pay their share of the money guaranteed for that undertaking.  It will be an extraordinary thing if the people have to pay for the next ten years the interest on the baronially-guaranteed stock, and, at the same time, be deprived of the services of the line.  Just now, when we are hoping to go forward and do big things in this country, and when we are expecting to have a headline of progress set up all round, the closing down of this railway line is depressing. It will mean that thirty men who have permanent employment in one capacity <Col N="2573" /> or another in connection with this railway will be deprived of that employment altogether.  We in Cork have enough unemployment already.  The hopes of those who are not employed at present are not very bright, as the unemployment benefit may not be forthcoming for these people.</P>
    <P>In that respect also the matter is important. I ask the Minister to look into the whole question and to see that what is possible will be done to avert this calamity, because it will be a calamity to the people.  I am certain the Minister, with his usual courtesy and ability, will do what is possible in the matter and that the railway company will be compelled to adopt a more reasonable attitude.  It threatens the very existence of the people there, and realising the importance of the matter I felt it my duty to raise a question in the House.</P>

      <P>This relatively grave matter was one of which I have got very little notice.  I do not mean notice from the Deputy, because he gave me notice early to-day.  The whole matter arose very suddenly.  I do not think there are any grounds for the belief in general in the vicinity of this railway that this is an evasion of the obligations put upon the company in the Railway Act, or that there is any question of their getting out of their responsibility for a period of years.  It was represented to me that the line was closed because at the moment it is unsafe for traffic to run over it, and the Deputy, in answer to that, has made <Col N="2574" /> the point that the permanent way men have got notice of dismissal.</P>

      <P>If the general manager of the Southern Railway Company thinks it will not be possible to have the permanent way put in order this summer he is within his rights in dismissing those permanent way men. The Department's permanent way officials have gone down there and their report should be in my hands by Saturday.  I do not say I will be able to defend dismissals on the 1st June, but I certainly will have the matter looked into as soon as I have determined what my own rights in the question are.  A Legal point is involved and the question that arises is the impact of the four Railway Acts as modified by the Railway Act of 1924, and all these have to be considered.  It is a doubtful legal point as to what powers I have in this matter.  We have notified the company as to our doubts in the matter.  We have sent down an official inspector to make his report.  That report will be in my hands before Saturday.  The Deputy can rely on the fact that we are aware of the hardship to Courtmacsherry, not merely to railway officials but to the people who depend for their living on tourists.  Nothing will be left undone to see that the line will be put in order and that the ordinary services will be started with the least possible delay.</P>
