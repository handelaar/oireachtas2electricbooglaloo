      <P>This accident occurred on the 2nd December, 1922, at midnight, after a Crossley tender had passed two other carts without any untoward results.  Exhaustive inquiries have been made in connection with the claim which is for £9 4s. 6d. in respect of upset to a cart containing cases of whiskey, wine, etc.  Whilst the tender did, apparently, touch the cart slightly, it appears that the fact is that the horse took fright at the approach of the tender, and got into a dyke on the side of the road.  Even so, it seems that no damage was done.</P>

Certain representations have been made to me in this matter and, while I think I can say that their rights are preserved, I would like to have some assurance from the Minister that he has had these considerations in mind and is satisfied that the rights of fishermen have been conserved.</P>

      <P>The point had been raised with regard to fishery rights where the people concerned at the moment are not actually owners but are merely tenants holding from the owner.  Just as there might have to be an allocation of sums given by way of compensation as between an owner, say, of landed property, and the tenant who holds a particular portion of it, under this section there is room for and there will be an allocation of compensation money as between the owner of the fishery right and the tenant.  I am assured that the section does cover the type of fishery rights of which Deputy Johnson speaks.</P>

      <P>(1)  The amount of the price or compensation to be paid by the Minister for lands and premises compulsorily acquired (whether permanently or temporarily) by him under this Act to the several persons entitled thereto or having estates or interests therein, or for or in respect of easements, way-leaves, water-rights, and other rights compulsorily acquired (whether permanently or temporarily) by him to the owner thereof or the several persons entitled to or having estates or interests in the lands and premises over or in respect of which such rights are so acquired shall, in default of agreement, be fixed under and in accordance with the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.</P>

    <P>(2)  The amount of the compensation to be paid by the Minister on account of the compulsory termination, restriction, or other interference (whether permanent or temporary) under this Act of or with any easement, water-right, fishing-right, or other right existing over or in respect of any lands, premises, or water, or the compulsory diversion, closing, removal, or other interference (whether permanent or temporary) under this Act of or with any private road, way, or bridge or any canal or other artificial water-way or any artificial <Col N="1733" /> water-course shall, in default of agreement, be fixed under and in accordance with the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, in like manner as if such compensation were the price of land compulsorily acquired.</P>
    <P>(3)  When any price or compensation is being assessed in pursuance of this section in respect of any property, corporeal or incorporeal, which is occupied, used or enjoyed with or forms part of any other property, regard shall be had to any benefit in the nature of drainage or improvement of water supply which may reasonably be expected to accrue to such property by reason of any works executed or in course of execution or about to be executed by the Minister under this Act.</P>
    <P>(4)  All claims for price or compensation in respect of any land, premises, or right compulsorily acquired or any right, way, or other property compulsorily interfered with under this Act shall be made within one year after such land, premises, right, way, or property is first entered on, exercised, or interfered with by the Minister or a contractor under this Act, save that in the case of compensation for the permanent interference with a fishery right the claim may be made at any time within ten years after the completion of the works by which the fishery right is so interfered with.</P>
    <P>(5)  Section 69 to 83 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, shall apply to any price or compensation payable by the Minister under this section and to the conveyance to the Minister of property, corporeal or incorporeal, compulsorily acquired by him under this Act, and for the purpose of such application the Minister shall be deemed to be the promoter of the undertaking.</P>
    <P>(6)  No action shall lie at law or in equity against the Minister or any contractor or any officer or servant of the Minister or any contractor for or on account of any act, matter, or thing in respect of which compensation is payable by virtue of this section.</P>

      <P>The amendments which I have put down fall into two classes.  One class is intended to harness the Minister as tightly as he is harnessing the Shannon. The Minister and the river have something in common.  They are both capable of producing energy, light, and occasionally, heat, and if their channels are allowed to flow in wrong directions they may do a vast amount of damage. This, however, is not a harnessing amendment.  It is designed to make the Bill more workable and, possibly, fairer to all parties concerned.  I include among these parties, the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section is one that deals with the price or compensation that is to be paid, not only for the acquisition of land, but also for damage to land in consequence of the scheme.  It is not very difficult for an arbitrator to fix the price for the actual acquisition of land.  He will not fix a price which will satisfy both parties, but he will fix a price which will satisfy himself.  To fix a price, however, in the case of consequential damage is very difficult.  If this amendment is not well drafted I am prepared to withdraw it, if the Minister can concede the point of giving a longer period of appeal to the arbitrator in the case of consequential damage.  At present the situation is that everyone whose land is damaged, except in the case of a fishery right, must put in his appeal within one year after the land is entered on.  That puts the arbitrator in a very awkward position.  The scheme, owing to its nature, may not be carried to such a point that material damage is done.  Yet the owner may feel compelled, as there may be some damage done in certain circumstances, to appeal <Col N="1735" /> for a grant for compensation for damage that may never happen.  If the period is extended to five years in cases of consequential damage, the arbitrator may say: &ldquo;Go away and do not come back until some damage has been done, and then I can estimate the amount of damage.&rdquo;  I am putting this as an amendment that may save the State some money.  It would place the arbitrator in a stronger position than if he had to say: &ldquo;It is possible there may be a little additional flooding, or that your land may be deprived of water for your stock and, therefore, I must give you something.&rdquo;  This will place the arbitrator in the position of saying: &ldquo;Show me the exact damage that has been done, but do not ask me to act on hypothesis.&rdquo;  If the Minister would consider this amendment it would possibly be a sort of protection against the men of Portumna, as it would make them confront him with facts instead of with theories.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment.  I think the period of five years in the amendment is too long, but the Deputy is willing to have it reduced.  I think the period in the Bill is too short, as I can foresee that certain consequential damage may arise which may not be known at the actual time when the original entry takes place into the land.  I am quite sure that the Minister would be willing to give the people affected every opportunity of putting their claims, if such claims are proper and just.  I would suggest a period of, at least, two years being given for appeal, as one year is too short in view of the complicated works which will take place and the difficulty of estimating the consequential damage that may result upon the entry on the land.</P>

      <P>It would leave people a period of five years to make <Col N="1736" /> up their minds as to whether they have sustained any damage by reason of the compulsory interference with lands, premises, right, way, or property.  It is put up that this would be a safeguard for me against Portumna.  It would, as a matter of fact, completely demoralise Portumna.  It would mean that the inhabitants of Portumna would have to become parasites upon this scheme for five years, and they would have to exercise their wits, having got compensation for consequential damage, to try and prove that there was further damage, and to see, therefore, that further compensation would have to be paid.  It is a matter of opinion as between the one year and five years, suggested by Deputy Cooper, and two years suggested by Deputy Heffernan. I do not see why any person should not be able to judge, within twelve months after the property has been interfered with, as to what is the actual extent of the damage.  I should say, of course, that the period will ordinarily run beyond the twelve months' period, because applications for compensation on that basis would be made not earlier than the twelfth month after the land was entered on, and when the whole question was tried on the facts that will be laid before the arbitrator, I think that that additional safeguard is one which will protract the period almost to, at least, a further six months and probably to the two years as desired by Deputy Heffernan.  As to the fishery rights, they are in a different position and are protected by later clauses.</P>

      <P>I would like to know, with reference to Section 8, if any estimate has been formed of the effect of the proposal of deepening the Shannon on the city of Limerick.  The river, I gather, is being completely diverted from its bed and being put through two subsidiary channels in the centre of the town.  This work has to be <Col N="1740" /> carried out with the greatest possible speed.  I would like to know what the effect of the drainage would be on Limerick, and whether the drainage is to be conducted clear of the town.

      <P>In line 19 to delete the words &ldquo;either generally or.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now arrived at what to my mind is the most controversial section of the Bill.  The section reads: &ldquo;Subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance given either generally or for any particular case, the Minister may contract to supply&rdquo; electricity.  In other words, the section as it stands may make it possible for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to ask the Minister for Finance to give him a blank cheque without any further information. I venture to think that that is an unsound principle constitutionally. The finances of this country are centred in the Minister for Finance. He is the responsible authority, and it is he who will have to provide a sum of at least one quarter million annually to pay the interest on the loan necessary for the carrying out of this work.  Therefore I suggest that the Minister for Finance ought not to have the power to sign away his control over the contract made under this scheme.  Deputies know as well as I do that in practically every Bill that comes in here the words occur, &ldquo;The Minister shall with the sanction of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;  Under this large and extensive scheme one Minister for Finance may give his sanction to arrangements without knowing the details, or asking for information, or exercising control, and, so far as I can see, that binds every subsequent Minister for Finance, and no provision is made in this Bill for a revocation of that consent.  I suggest that is not a principle you ought to adopt in legislation of that kind, or of any other kind. A consent of that kind is not good business, and is not good finance.  The Minister for Finance must be the responsible authority in dealing with the Dáil in matters of finance.  It may happen under another Government that the Minister for Industry and Commerce may become an External Minister.  In that case he would be given this enormous asset of making and <Col N="1742" /> supplying electricity without any control on the part of the Executive Council at all.  I am curious to see how that can be defended, and I have no doubt it will be defended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the explanation is very simple.  The section enables the Minister for Finance to give sanction to a scale of charges, or to some tariffs which the Minister for Industry and Commerce may propose to give in a particular case.  The position will be the same as in the case of the telephones.  We sanction a scale of charges under which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs allows people to have telephones in their homes, or more telephones than one.  In the case of the Post Office, the whole thing is worked out on a scale of tariffs to suit different cases.  The proposal in this Bill is the same, except that specific power is taken to give sanction in particular cases.  You might have people taking large quantities of electricity, and it might be desirable in special circumstances to give them more favourable terms than they would get under a general tariff.  I think the section does not bear the interpretation that Deputy Cooper has given to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give us any guarantee that a subsequent Minister for Finance would not take that interpretation, or that he would have power to make a revocation of the consent of the first Minister for Finance?  Would he consider the advisability, considering the word &ldquo;generally&rdquo; has such a wide expression, and might give general powers to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, of moving in the Report Stage to put into this Bill words similar to those in the Telephone Act?  I do not want to limit the Minister for Finance, or the Minister for Industry and Commerce at all, but I think this power is too great to be given without check on the part of the responsible financial Minister of the State.</P>

      <P>If it were to appear that it was impossible to revise any arrangement that had been come to, in so far as it had been made use of, I certainly think <Col N="1743" /> that the Bill would have to be amended; but I have no doubt at all that it would be quite possible at some stage for the Minister for Finance to say: &ldquo;We gave you sanction on such a date to make contracts on such a basis.  In view of the facts that have come to light since then, that sanction is withdrawn, and you can make no other contracts except on some other basis that we may lay down.&rdquo;  It is quite general to revise arrangements that have been made, and revise final sanction, and we have not the slightest reason to think that it would be impossible in this case.

      <P>The Minister, on Second Reading, informed us that the contracts referred to in this section were to be provisional contracts.  If that is so I see no objection to saying so.  The Minister is aware that many rumours are circulated, and it is just as well to quell them. I am not associated with them; I do not agree with them, but while you are dealing with a matter in an atmosphere such as has been created, it is necessary to deal with it carefully, just as if you go into a coal mine after an explosion you have to take a safety lamp.  I suggest, therefore, that this amendment, which only conveys the sense of the Minister's own words on Second Reading, is one that he might reasonably accept.</P>

      <P>If the basis of this amendment, therefore, is only to <Col N="1744" /> do away with the type of rumour that the President dealt with the last day, that this amendment is rendered necessary by the fact of these rumours being there and that only to quell them we must accept this, then I will not argue the point.  I do not think I said that I would accept an amendment to limit this to provisional contracts.  I said it was intended to enter into agreements for contracts during the period of the building, so that we would be in a position to know firmly and fixedly what the demand for electricity in certain areas was, and I said I would be prepared to accept an amendment that would limit me, if the Dáil thought it necessary to limit me, because the tariff Bill, the Electricity Supply Bill, would be before the Dáil in the intervening period.</P>
      <P>This amendment does not limit me in any way that I can accept.  It says: &ldquo;make a provisional contract.&rdquo;  To some extent the word &ldquo;provisional&rdquo; meets the situation, but of course it may be interpreted in another and a completely different way.  It might mean that I could not make any binding contract within margins, which was rather what I was aiming at doing&mdash; that is to say, within the limits of leave to be given afterwards, within the terms of whatever measure the Oireachtas may think fit to decide on later, and within a whole number of other restrictive clauses.  I feel I should have liberty to enter into binding contracts, say, with local authorities, as to supplying them with electricity when they have stated to me what their needs are, when they have examined those needs and are in a position to state definitely and clearly what they are.  To accept this amendment would, I think, completely bar any binding contract, even a binding contract within a margin, and that, I think, is necessary for the carrying out of the sales policy during the three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>But &ldquo;provisional&rdquo; was the Minister's own words.  He defined on Second Reading the contract he proposed to make as a provisional contract.  It now appears that he does not mean what he said on Second Reading, that the phrase was not sufficiently <Col N="1745" /> comprehensive.  No doubt his desire to save the time of the Dáil misled me. I do not see how he can make a binding contract, because the essence of such a contract is time, a contract for the supply of power or light, or whatever you intend to supply, from such and such a date to such and such a date.  Until this work has progressed a considerable distance you will not be able to make any progress of that character, and by that time you ought to have the tariff Bill.  Does the Minister still see an objection to inserting &ldquo;provisional&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>Decidedly.  The word &ldquo;provisional,&rdquo; subject to what Deputy Cooper has said, is not what would appear in the Bill; it would be merely the word &ldquo;provisional,&rdquo; and that would debar me from making the type of contract, with the assurance behind it of a tariff period, of being subject to revision by the Dáil and of having the sanction of the Oireachtas, which it is necessary I should have in this period.  It will not be fixed with regard to the price nor will it be fixed with regard to the time; it ought to be binding within certain limits, certain margins, and if that idea can be expressed in some phrase I would accept it for that particular purpose.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister would have to invent a phrase, because I never heard of such a contract in my life.  This is such a new type of contract that I think the only phrase we could use to describe it would be &ldquo;The McGilligan Contract.&rdquo;  However, I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I was simply arguing on one point, the sales policy during the period.  There is a second point to be considered.  It may be necessary to supply right of way power during the course of the undertaking, for purposes of the undertaking itself. That may necessitate going into places like Killaloe, or even into Limerick, and making a certain contract for a limited period, for the three years' period of the scheme, so that electricity can be supplied, so that we can make use of the distribution at Limerick for the purposes of the scheme, and also that electricity may be installed in <Col N="1746" /> Killaloe.  That is a different thing from the first thing which I dealt with, and there the word &ldquo;provisional&rdquo; would be, of course, much more inappropriate, because it would have to be a very definite binding contract which would probably terminate at the end of the three years' period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is quite clear that the Minister has in his mind contracts of a certain special class, which are proper, no doubt, in a way, and I do not want to suggest that there is any possibility of the Minister committing himself to something which will turn out foolish.  But he must be aware that it has been commonly said&mdash;I do not associate myself with the rumour in the slightest degree&mdash;that this particular clause gives him power to do what was originally said was going to be done, that is, to bind himself to sell to the Siemens Company a large quantity of this power at a specially low rate, and that that was the reason why they were prepared to undertake this contract in this way.  I do not think that the Minister has that in his mind in this clause, but I think this is an opportunity for him definitely to dissociate himself from that sort of thing.  It would be, to my mind, obviously a foolish thing for the Minister to make a contract to sell, say, 80,000,000 units to the Siemens Company at a very low price, particularly if this 80,000,000 were to be spread out over the whole period, because if it were given in that way it would seriously damage the whole proposition, which is based on the fact that for a certain demand there would be only a certain supply.  I do not suggest for a moment that the Minister has that in his mind, but I think it comes under the wording of this clause.  I have put down no amendment, because I do not see how it could meet it.  Probably he would say himself he only secures in this clause the powers which he wishes to secure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to understand more clearly what the limitations of this section are. It does not seem to me that if the section passes in its present form it is going to limit the <Col N="1747" /> Minister's power in any way.  If it were only intended to do what Deputy Thrift suggests I am not yet able to see any objection to that, if that sale of power during the course of construction, for the purpose of construction, is going to cheapen construction and facilitate its speed, but there is no limitation in the section or the Bill. According to the period for which the Minister will have those powers, as the section stands, it would be quite possible, in ten or fifteen years' time, for the Minister to make such contracts in such terms as he wishes without any limitation at all, except such as may be imposed by a new Act.  That, surely, is not intended?  Nevertheless, I think the section will allow of that.  I do not think the term &ldquo;provisional&rdquo; meets the wishes of the Deputy, because a provisional contract seems to me to be one which is subject to final sanction, and until it is finally sanctioned it is really not effective.  There is not only that, but I cannot understand why the Minister is reluctant to put a limit to time if the powers sought here are merely for the purpose of construction during the period of construction.  I should think the limit of time would meet the case, and be a more strict definition of the intentions of the Minister in this section.  Supposing by some extraordinary accident there was no second Bill passed, the powers to distribute the energy and the powers the Minister has of utilising electricity, and supplying it on such terms as he thinks fit would remain, and it would require a new Act to annul this section.  I think the Minister will require to particularise in some way what his intentions are under this section.  It is not clear to me.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson has put in another way the very same point I wished to put forward&mdash; namely, that the Minister might under the powers conferred by this clause make contracts.  I do not think he wishes to, but he might make contracts which would very seriously hamper him when the scheme came into operation, and when it was found in a few years how it was working out.</P>

      <P>It seems to me hard that I should have to disown all the things which malevolent people have invented in order to damage the scheme.  The rumour has been put about&mdash;Deputy Thrift is not associated with it at all, and has only raised it here for the purpose, I assume, of having it contradicted&mdash;that there is a secret consideration to the German firm for coming here and taking up the scheme at a cost which most Irish contractors seem to think an impossibility and understated.  That secret consideration is said to be that they are to get a contract to have supplied to them certain units of power at a very small rate, and that afterwards the stranglehold on Irish industries, which has been put forward so vehemently by some people, will follow.  There is no intention whatever of any sale to the German firm of power after the contract period.  I make that limitation because&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Or in respect of anything outside the construction. That is from the German point.  There will be a small power plant erected, I believe, on the Shannon for the purpose of generating power for use in the constructional period.  That power plant, erected by the contractor, will be to a certain extent for supplying the contractor's electricity.  He will be working under and in contact with the engineer sent by my Department, and the contracting firm will be completely under control.  There may be electricity supplied through my Department, say to places in the neighbourhood which require electricity, or to Limerick.  Limerick will require an extension of its electricity supply for the purpose of providing light, say, in workmen's canteens and in the additional buildings that are, without doubt, going to become necessary during the three years' period.  I must have power to enter into a complete, fixed and binding contract for the supply of that power to Limerick for certain purposes. That is one side of this amendment. Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert will have no <Col N="1749" />&mdash;let me put it, say, after 1929&mdash;contract whatever with this scheme. There will be no contract made with them which will give them any right to have anything whatever to do with the purchase or sale of electricity after that period.  There have been many rumours&mdash;I think the matter was raised in this House by Deputy Heffernan&mdash; about a secret agreement with Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert.  There is no agreement with the firm of Siemens-Schuckert outside the White Paper. The White Paper is the sum total of our obligation towards that firm so far. What I am now speaking of is our intentions, say, from this to 1929.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of this section and of this amendment.  Once the work is started somebody dealing with the sale of electricity has to get busy in the country to see where transmission lines are to be laid, and what money is to be expended on the erection of transforming stations either of a house or of a pole type.  It must be that those should be put up with due regard to the future.  It is necessary that that sales manager should have power to enter into contracts limited in this way, and that there will be contracts limited from the supply point as to units, limited from the purchasers' point as to margin of price, contracts, say, on the part of the Department that it would supply not less than so many units of power, and from the purchasers' point of view at not more than so much per unit.  Only on some basis of that sort can a real contract afterwards be entered into, or can we proceed to lay down lines which will make it easy and possible to have a definite contract afterwards entered into.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be provisional in that way.  Let me take a Town Clerk in some of the areas in the country.  No Town Clerk, contracting on behalf of the local authority, would enter into a contract with me if he thought that at my own sweet will I could tear up the document. There will have to be some binding <Col N="1750" /> force about it.  It will be binding within those limits if the object of the amendment be what was aimed at in Deputy Thrift's amendment which we discussed the last day or a later amendment of Deputy Cooper's.  If individual contracts are to be supervised by Deputies and Senators, then I am going to fight against that.</P>
      <P>That is not a matter for Deputies or Senators; to revise or supervise the placing of single contracts.  There will be a general tariff policy that will come before the Dáil for review.  As Deputy Johnson said, it is quite possible that, even with the limitations of the £5,000,000, the sum of money set out in the finance section in this Bill, I could proceed to make contracts which would bind some successor of mine with regard to supply.  I do not believe that within that limit of £5,000,000 I could make a contract, and could thereafter, without any further addition to the sum in this Bill, fulfil the contract.  There would be certain monetary obligations which would not be backed by a return until after that contract had been some time in operation.  So that I am not concerned to give myself such freedom that I could afterwards operate this Bill as if it were a supply Bill.  If there is an amendment that will give me the necessary powers to make a pending contract for the supply of electricity to such places as Limerick for the purposes I have mentioned over the period of construction, and, secondly, to have the sales policy properly developed, so that when the Sales Bill comes before the House Deputies will have a clearer indication of what the actual demand&mdash;no longer an estimated demand&mdash;is within certain margins, then I think it is necessary and right that there should be this power to make what will not be provisional contracts in the sense that a court would look upon that word, but contracts limited, inasmuch as they are within the margins I have stated: the margin of quantity from the suppliers' point of view, and the margin of prices from the purchasers' point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that this amendment <Col N="1751" /> does what Deputy Cooper has stated to be his intention.  I think it goes further than what he stated, and I think also that he will admit that it binds me in relation to prices.  As to whether he thinks that I should be bound in that way is, of course, a matter for his own judgment.  If there is any other alternative phrase which can be got and which will give me the powers that I speak of, and at the same time would render it necessary to have the Organisation Supply Bill brought forward, then I will consider that with a view to its acceptance.</P>

      <P>I hardly think so. Let me take the case of the town clerk again.  He has agreed, say, with the sales operative after making certain investigations around his own area.  He came to the conclusion that there would be so many units required for power and light.  He then found himself, when he came to make the contract with somebody acting on my behalf, that the contract was only valid during the three years' period.  He was looking forward not to the three years' period, but beyond the three years' period, when adopting the contract to which I referred, the contract entered into for the three years' period, but which is not intended to become operative, and cannot become operative, until the power is actually generated and ready for sale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me take it then from the longer point of view&mdash; that is to say, five years after the supply started.  Would any local authority, having to make investigations and inquiries, let itself in for a certain burden of expense in a case where a contract might be abolished, wiped out and declared invalid five years afterwards?  Or take it from our point of view.  Could I, with any conscience, incur expense to lay a distributing line to a certain town and incur all the other costs of putting up a transforming house station if I thought that the local authority could slip out of its contract five years after I had begun to give the supply and five years after the whole expense had been incurred?  I think it is going to be very difficult to get any phrase which will put the limitation that the Dáil may seem to think necessary on the Department in this matter, and at the same time that will give the powers which I think, and which the Dáil has already recognised are necessary for the proper implementing of the whole scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>In the matter of the implementing of the scheme, I suggest that the Minister should consider whether a plan that is not explainable might not have the effect of prejudicing the decision of the Dáil in respect of his No. 2 Bill.  If it is possible to make these contracts, which will be binding for a period of five years, and to compel the local authority to make contracts that will be binding on the Ministry, that, in effect, is going to ensure that whatever Bill is produced with respect to supply must contain provisions which at least will satisfy all these contracts. The proposal of the Minister is, I am inclined to think, apt to prejudice the decision of the Dáil in twelve <Col N="1753" /> months' time.  If the contractor, or the prospective contractor, be not prepared to make a provisional agreement which will be subject to ratification by the Dáil or be subject to the passage of the later Bill, then I submit that the powers which the Minister is looking for are altogether too great, because they are all limited within the rates or periods that he has mentioned.  There is no limitation at all suggested here, and therefore the Minister may make contracts with the city of Cork, or with Limerick or Dublin to the prejudice of other cities.  These powers are implicit in the section, and they may be for twenty years.  That is too great a power, I suggest, to give to the Minister without any question, and it is certainly going to prejudice the decision of the Dáil when the later Bill comes forward.  There would really be no necessity at all for the later Bill if this section were passed in its present form.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to a statement I made&mdash;I think, on the introduction of the original motion giving the Minister power to make the preliminary arrangements necessary for the carrying out of this work &mdash;in regard to secret agreements.  My statement had no reference to any secret agreement as to the supplying of electricity.  If the Minister put it that way, I may tell him that is not the way I meant it at all.  It was with regard to contracts for the carrying out of the scheme.  If further explanation is necessary, I may say that I was in no sense reflecting on the honour of Ministers, or of the Cabinet.  I was simply dealing with it from a political point of view.  I did not intend to insinuate that there was any monetary consideration possible or that such might be considered by anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this particular question of contracts, I confess I am not very clear on the matter.  It is possible that the matter is one that I am not in a position to understand fully.  But I am rather inclined to think that any contracts entered into by the Minister should eventually be subject to some form of supervision by the Dáil and that the prices arranged should, in <Col N="1754" /> some way or other, come before the Dáil for supervision.  A question may arise, any day, that certain firms were being granted supplies of electricity under cost.  I believe that such a thing may be even financially a feasible proposition in certain cases.  There may be a surplus supply which it would be better to sell under cost than not allow to be produced at all.  I do not think that the further Bills which are to be introduced as regards organisation and supply will give the Dáil any real information. What I want to find out is whether any contracts of that kind, entered into with some corporation or company that intended afterwards to re-sell or redistribute the electricity will be available for scrutiny by the Dáil, and that the actual prices stated in the contract will be the actual prices charged. The Minister may have made it clear, but I do not fully understand it yet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>One point I would like the Minister to make clear in connection with this clause.  The clause gives him power to sell on such terms and conditions as he may think proper to any person, whether for his own use or resale.  I would like the Minister to make clear that it is not his intention to enter into a contract under this section with an individual who will then become a sort of middleman and sell to somebody else, adopting the system unfortunately in vogue to-day in Turkey and other places.  If the Minister has in mind selling direct to local authorities they will then become the distributing local authorities, and in that case this section will have to be amended, because at present it only gives him power to sell to an individual. He pointed out that that individual might be the Town Clerk, but, as the Minister knows, that is not the way to contract with local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a valuable point about the terms of the contract, because the Minister rejects five years as too short a term.  No doubt, it is if you expect to convert your factories from what they have been to be worked by hydraulic power. It must be borne in mind that the State in the past has given terminable contracts. In an earlier amendment the Minister for Finance quoted the tariffs that will be charged for telephones. Telephone contracts are quarterly.  I give a quarter's notice to the P.M.G., or he gives me a quarterly notice, to terminate the contract.  There is no precedent up to the present for the State granting long contracts.  I think we have gained a great deal from the statement of the Minister.  I hope we will hear more from him as to two difficulties of granting away any State assets for a prolonged period on the one hand, and the insecurity resulting from short time contracts on the other, and how these can be reconciled, which is one of the big problems in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather agree with the Minister as to the difficulty of getting a proper form of words.  I do not think he has gone quite far enough in his reasoning on the point of view of the local authority, on the one side, and the Government on the other.  I think there may be as great reluctance on the part of the local authority to make a very long contract, as Deputy Cooper pointed out, but I do think there will be the same reluctance in making short term contracts, because they know that as favourable rates as can possibly be provided will be given. They know the power will be there and is to be sold, and that it is in the interest of the State to sell it.  They will not have any reason to anticipate any great change in the terms of the contract which will be renewable, whereas they may very well be reluctant to bind themselves to take electricity at the rates specified over a long term of years.  I do not think the Minister went sufficiently far in his argument on that point.  Possibly the whole thing might be secured in the way the Minister indicated. His objection was to put in <Col N="1756" /> words which would limit these contracts and make them stop immediately after the constructional periods ceased. Why not secure that by embodying it in the powers the Minister is to get? If he wishes to enter into the contracts that will start during the constructional period, why not say so?  Apparently all that was necessary was to secure the power by which he can sell current as soon as the construction begins, whereas the clause gives him power to set the whole thing in operation as soon as it is complete.  Then he would not require to come for further power to contract and to sell.  The clause as drafted gives the Minister a great deal more power than he seeks to get from the Dáil.  The Minister is quite clever enough to put to us some form of words that will give him the power he wants without going further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying that this, if worked to the full by some Minister who set out to work it to the fullest extent, would give him more than I have asked for, or that would be necessary for my purpose.  He asks me to put up some formula that would reconcile these two points of view.  Deputy Cooper made the same remark.  I am asked to reconcile the granting away of State assets for long periods with the insecurity that will be brought about by short term contracts.  That was found so impossible to reconcile that we had to draft the clause here in a general way.  I do not think we are going to get much further by Deputy Professor Thrift's suggestion.  It seems to me to be limiting this clause to contracts within the three years period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It limits the contracts for the start of the supply during the constructional period.  That would only meet one of my difficulties. It might meet the supply for Limerick during the three years period, but that does not meet every town.  How am I to enter upon the construction of the transmission systems to small towns? Let me leave the 100 kilo volt lines out <Col N="1757" /> of consideration and let me take the ten kilo volt lines to the villages.  How am I to enter on the provision of a transmission system to a town of ten kilo volt lines if I do not know that the people at the other end will take the supply?</P>
      <P>I will not have any absolute security until I have some sort of a contract entered into.  Deputy Thrift's suggestion was that I should have unlimited power, during the first period, with regard to contracts.  That apparently was intended to meet my first point.  It does not, however, meet the other point, and I am not quite clear that what Deputy Johnson says is perfectly accurate&mdash;that I am going to prejudice the decision of the Dáil in regard to the second Bill by something which must necessarily be done under this clause.  Again I come to what is intended, and what power is given under the clause.  I think it would be quite possible, if we are going to neglect all thoughts of a second Bill, to make such contracts under this as would leave the Dáil in a hopeless position in connection with the second Bill. I might, for instance, arrange with Kenmare for a supply at .8 of a penny, and I might arrange with some place else at another figure, say .3 of a penny. I might have the whole thing so definitely tied up, and actually in operation, that the Dáil would really have nothing to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want power for is to make certain arrangements within certain margins that would not prejudice the Dáil's decision.  One of the points that will come up on the second Bill will have relation to the two tables given on pages 103 and 104.  They are two of thousands of alternative methods of charging, and they are methods which are based on certain calculations.  Possibly arguments may be brought forward to justify them.  If you take the town connected with the 35 kilo volt transformer station, there would be one instance where current can be delivered at .74 of a penny; that would be one case.  Then, in the second case, current could be delivered at 1.2 of a penny.  If I were able to enter into a contract with a local authority in some town included in the <Col N="1758" /> 35 kilo volt system, that I would supply not less than x units at prices ranging between twopence and a penny, or between twopence and a halfpenny, I surely would not prejudice the Dáil in its decision as to what is going to be decided upon in regard to the flat rate for the whole country, the small rate for Dublin, Cork, and Limerick, the slightly higher rate elsewhere for the 35 kilo volt towns, and then the other rates.  As long as I keep within the margins set out in pages 103 and 104, I do not prejudice the Dáil.  I admit to Deputy Johnson that, under that clause, I could arrange a system to deliver at Kenmare at .8 of a penny.</P>
    <P>If I had binding agreements for that rate, with a sufficient number of towns on the 10 kilo volt line, it might amount to a decision that the flat rate policy was going to be the one in the country. That is not what I am looking for, and, seeing the Dáil does not give any trust to my successor, the whole difficulty is that there has to be some limitation put on this, and there has to be some definite security that somebody is not going to go out through the country and operate so as to preclude the Dáil from a further decision on that point. Deputy Thrift has suggested that if we divided the clause into two, and arrange it that during the constructional period the contracts should be unlimited, it would be an advantage.  The suggestion was that contracts for supply, not beyond the construction period, could be unlimited, and as binding and fixed as any contracts might be.  Then afterwards, leaving out the constructional period, and that type of contract, I could stipulate for a guarantee of consumption before proceeding to the expenditure connected with the erection of a transmission system.  If that would seem to Deputies to get out of the difficulty that we apparently have got into, I could have it considered and brought up on Report.  I would like to have the suggestion discussed that there would be unlimited power to make binding contracts for power to supply within the building-up period.  I cannot get a proper formula for it at the moment.  The general idea would be that I would have power given to me by the section to stipulate with local <Col N="1759" /> authorities for a certain guarantee of consumption before proceeding to erect the transmission system to a particular place.  We could get that matter discussed in a moment.</P>
    <P>As regards the point raised by Deputy Good, I think we could better deal with it on the next amendment, in the name of Deputy Cooper.  Deputy Good has made for me the answer that I had intended to make to Deputy Cooper.  If you cut out the phrase &ldquo;for his own use or,&rdquo; you bind yourself to a middleman.  I would like to refer to what Deputy Heffernan said about these contracts, in order to correct a thing I previously said.  Deputy Heffernan said on the 2nd April: &ldquo;We have no ties or obligations with this firm, so far as I know, or so far as the Oireachtas knows, and I do not see why we should be bound to them or why any secret agreements or arrangements should exist, if there are such arrangements with this firm.&rdquo;  There are none now except the White Paper, and there is one letter from the firm, in which they state that no fees will be payable under Clause 13 of the White Paper.  To that extent the White Paper has not been modified or has not been amplified.  That is the only agreement there is with the firm of Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert.  If the Dáil would be agreeable to let this come up on Report Stage on the lines I have suggested&mdash;making the clause divisible more or less on a time basis, giving unlimited powers within the three years' period, and that I could be in some way empowered to stipulate for a certain guarantee in the way of consumption before the transmission system would be entered upon&mdash;it might be found more suitable.</P>

These are the only agreements that have been entered into.  He apparently accepts this letter as part of the agreement that is contained in the White Paper.  For the information of the House and the public, would the Minister be agreeable to let us have that letter that forms part of the agreement, the same as he let us have the White Paper?</P>

      <P>Amendment 16 is standing in my name.  It reads: &ldquo;In line 21 to delete the words &lsquo;whether for his own use or.&rsquo;&rdquo;  The necessity for this amendment was partly removed by the Minister's statement, and, if I move it, it is only to extract from the Minister a certain statement. And I am to congratulate Deputy Johnson on his convert.  I never expected to see Deputy Good turn Socialist and to see him arguing in favour of State supply of electricity rather than ordinary commercial methods.  I do not want to hamper the Minister in supplying direct to a large user of power.  I conceive it would be well for the Minister to make contracts direct with say, the Dublin Tramway Co. or the Railway Co., or with any large factory, but I wanted to find out whether it is his intention to enter into every house in the country as a contractor, contracting for the supply of electricity for lighting and heating.  Is he going to enter into emulation with the Minister for Posts <Col N="1761" /> and Telegraphs, who enters wherever he is invited to make contracts for the supply of telephones?  If so, that means an enormous government department. That opens up the prospect of long debates in the Dáil and bitter complaints that a higher price is being charged in one place than in another; also, perhaps, a cry from Tirconail that their county is neglected, and all those other inconveniences that come from governmental control of industry.</P>
      <P>I do not say that the Minister might not in a very isolated place enter into a direct contract where there was no other means of getting the thing done, or getting other agencies to do it, but I think it would be wiser to work through existing agencies in Dublin, say through the Corporation, and in Pembroke and Rathmines through the municipal authorities.  I do not know if there is an urban council in Dundalk.</P>

      <P>I will not definitely object to the amendment for the reasons mentioned by Deputy Good.  If you cut out the words &ldquo;whether for his own use or,&rdquo; the result of it must be that in every case there must be employed a middleman to redistribute the profits that may accrue to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to my intentions, I have very few intentions under this Bill.  I have the main intention to bring in a Sales Bill&mdash;a Supply or an Organisation Bill&mdash;which will regulate all these matters. Where we would get a town supplied on the 10 k.v. system, round about it there may be an area of rather far-flung, widely-scattered farm houses, and the sales manager might then, if he came into these particular houses, see what was the possibility of power being taken in that area.  That has been so much commented on by reason of the fact that Siemens-Schuckert <Col N="1762" /> worked out the prices for the area around Mallow rural district.  It may be necessary, therefore, simply as an experimental test, to try out whether anything more than 1,300 out of the 3,000 habitations take in electricity if the lines were brought to them. Another thing, they might go into the ordinary houses and see what guarantee can be given, or what approaching to a guarantee might be made, by the owner of the household.  Generally speaking, that question as to whether the Department is going to construct the lines and extend them into the country, following on the lines of the Post Office, or whether it is going to be done through a local distributing agency, or whether there is to be a State organisation is a matter for the second Bill.  I cannot state the intentions or plans at the moment.  There are really no intentions and very few plans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has brought upon himself some misunderstandings. In the course of the discussion we have all been interested, and some of us enthused, from the consumer's point of view, with the whole idea of the wide distribution and use of electrical power.  A large number of people have assumed that this Bill is the only Bill.  Now the Minister has had in mind all the time a second Bill which is going to deal with problems of distribution. Nevertheless, this is the Shannon Bill that is under consideration, and in the Shannon Bill there are sections, like Section 13, which would, within the limits of finance, give all the powers that we imagine as necessary, not only for the production but for the distribution and sale.  That, I think, is the cause of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that until the revised section that the Minister has now suggested is brought in, on Report, and is before us, we cannot consider with any profit this amendment by Deputy Cooper, because the amendment is based upon the assumption that this section is going to make contracts or possibly might make contracts with the actual consumer in any part of the country.  It is clear that that is not <Col N="1763" /> the intention of the Bill, although powers to do that are in the Bill.  If I may suggest it, it seems to me that the amendments to this section would be better discussed when the revised section has been brought to our notice, but we are not going to be very profitably engaged in discussing these amendments which were drafted on the assumption that within this section the powers of sale and distribution were contained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tells us that the question of the policy that is to be adopted in connection with this Bill has not been settled and not thought out really.  I put it to the Minister that it is very necessary, at this stage, that these things should be considered and settled as far as they possibly can.  The Bill before us, and the clause in it that is referred to in the amendment, give very wide powers, indeed extraordinarily wide powers, in connection with the generation and distribution of electricity.  The question that arises in one's mind straight away is what is the Government going to do with these powers? It is clear, as far as electricity is concerned, that there are two phases, generation and distribution.  If the Government are going to combine both, and to do both, I think that is a very large and important question for undertakings that are at present operating. If we are giving these large powers in this Bill to the Government, we are practically anticipating the Bill that is to come before us as far as distribution is concerned, because the Bill that the Minister will bring forward in due course must be either adopted or rejected. The provisions of this Bill do give him power for distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I think a matter that will concern a great many people is the attitude of the Government in connection with the working of municipal, or private, or other companies that are at present in existence.  The Minister says that he may go into a district and explore and exploit the possibilities of the supply of current to individual consumers. Where that is new ground, <Col N="1764" /> where electricity is not at present being generated and supplied, there does not seem to be very great objection to their doing that, either for information purposes or for other purposes of guarantee before extending distribution stations in that district.  It certainly would be objectionable, unless the policy be adopted that the existing generating stations and the existing suppliers are to be superseded when the Shannon scheme is in operation, that the Government should go into an area already supplied by an authority or company and go round to individual customers.  We cannot get very far unless we have some idea as to what the intentions of the Government are.  The Minister will say that this Bill is founded upon giving him powers which he cannot define at the present time, but I do think that the time has been reached when the Government are bound to say that they have a distinct policy in this matter, one way or other. That policy should be open to criticism at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that the matter is not quite so simple as the Minister would appear to think.  As I understand the position at the moment, with regard to the sale and distribution of electricity, such sale is vested under a particular Act&mdash;I do not know at the moment what Act it is&mdash;in the local authority and nobody else has any right in that particular area except through the local authority.  That would appear to cut across this proposal. In view of what Deputy Johnson has said, I do not think, until we know exactly the form in which the Minister proposes to put what is contained in Clause 13, that we would get much further by discussing the matter. That clause, as it stands, opens up quite sufficient difficulties, and until we see the new clause which it is proposed to introduce I do not think there is much use in discussing the matter.</P>

      <P>It would be well to get one matter clear.  Deputy Johnson made reference to discussing an amendment under this section again when the revised section comes up.  We have already defeated an amendment to <Col N="1765" /> take out the words &ldquo;either generally or&rdquo; and I do not know that anybody has yet argued for this&mdash;I am afraid I will have to call it again &ldquo;very badly drafted&rdquo;&mdash;amendment, to delete the words &ldquo;whether for his own use or.&rdquo; I have not heard anybody argue for that proposal.  There were speeches made on the section but not on the amendment.  I think we ought to dispose of that amendment&mdash;I do not know if it is to be persisted in&mdash;and, if we are going to have any further discussion on the section, let it arise on the section in its new form.  I must say this in advance, however, that I cannot agree that now is the time, or that even when the new section comes up that will be the time, to discuss the Government policy with regard to its attitude towards present distributors or matters of that kind.  Those are matters that are going to wait for the Shannon No. 2 Supply Bill, if I may put it that way.  I am afraid they may be discussed, but I would rather hope that they will not fail to be discussed even on the revised section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 17, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section to add new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Where the Minister proposes to make a contract for the supply of electricity under this Act he shall lay before each House of the Oireachtas a statement showing the person with whom such contract is proposed to be made, the amount of electricity proposed to be included in such contract, the payments proposed to be charged for the supply of such electricity, and any covenants, conditions, and agreements proposed to be inserted in such contract.</P>
      <P>(3)  No contract shall be made under this Act until either&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  each House of the Oireachtas has by resolution authorised the making of such contract either with or without modification of any <Col N="1766" /> of the proposed provisions of such contract, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the expiration of whichever of the following periods shall be the longer, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  twenty-one days after the first day on which either House of the Oireachtas shall sit next after the statement in accordance with this section shall have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  twelve days on which either House of the Oireachtas shall have sat after the said statement shall have been so laid before the Houses.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where a resolution of either House of the Oireachtas authorises the making of a contract under this Act subject to any modification of the proposed provisions of such contract, such contract shall not be made save with and subject to such modification of its provisions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We now come to two things we have not had this afternoon&mdash;a well-drafted amendment and a question of principle. I am vain enough to call it a &ldquo;well-drafted amendment,&rdquo; because I did not draft it.  I only adapted it.  The amendment is taken, word for word, with the alteration of &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; for &ldquo;lands,&rdquo; from the State Lands Act, that we passed ten months ago.  The Minister was good enough to make his case against this amendment in advance. He said the supervision of individual contracts is not a matter for Senators or Deputies.  I think those were his words.  Yet, as a member of the Executive Council, ten months ago he was responsible for an Act which laid down that we are to supervise every individual contract for the letting of State lands, that every contract for the letting of State lands down even to the letting of a coastguard's cottage at 4/6 per week, should be laid on the Table of the Dáil, and be open to discussion, if anyone wishes to raise a question with regard to it.  That is all right for coastguard cottages or small things like that; the Dáil can exercise supervision over them, but when it comes to contracts for an electric undertaking, <Col N="1767" /> which runs into tens of thousands, it is not in the province of Deputies and Senators to supervise them.  This is not State socialism; it is State despotism. The Minister puts it to the Dáil that we should, once and for all, dispose of this power to him and should, thereafter, except within the limits laid down in a succeeding Bill, which we have not yet seen and may not see for some time&mdash; apparently the principles on which it is to be based have not been agreed upon yet&mdash;not have any control whatever, or knowledge whatever, of the contracts the Minister has made.  I must say that I shall be curious to see if the Labour Party will stand for that as a proposition. State socialism I can understand. That is based on the supervision of some body representing the State. Here the whole thing is to be thrown into the hands of the Minister, except an amendment similar to this is accepted.  This is a moderate amendment. It is an amendment which last year, when proposed in the State Lands Act by the President, did not satisfy Deputy Johnson.  It is the most moderate amendment I could frame.  It follows the Government's draughtsman's draughtsmanship to meet one of the Minister's usual objections and, finally, it does assert the definite principle of the control of this House over any financial transaction of any kind whatever.  That control is not a vague or illusory thing.  It ought to be a real and active check on any contract of any kind whatever.  Therefore, I earnestly ask the Committee to agree with me in this amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the idea contained in this amendment, but I am not quite sure that the amendment, as drafted, is quite workable. I also would like to see supervision of the charges and of the contracts.  So far as I understand the intentions of the Minister, the Dáil and the Seanad will have no real supervision over the prices to be charged. There will be certain difficulties if the Minister decides to make contracts with individuals and not to confine himself exclusively to contracts with large distributors. <Col N="1768" /> It may not be out of place at this stage to say that, in connection with distribution of electricity in the rural areas, it would be advisable to try and get the people to form cooperative societies for the purchase of the current.  That does not arise under this Bill, because, so far as I can see, the intention is, under this measure, to supply only towns of 500.</P>

      <P>I think it would be very difficult for the Minister to carry out a system of individual contracts with people throughout the rural areas.  I do not suppose it is his intention to make a contract with each individual. It would be impossible to have such contracts laid on the Table of the Dáil and subject to alteration. But if the Minister makes contracts with corporations and large distributors, and people of that kind, they should be controlled, to some extent, by the Dáil.  We should have some control over the prices.</P>
      <P>The objection I see to the amendment is this, that under clause (a) the Dáil would have the power of varying the contract.  It seems to me that that is not a thing that could be done by the Dáil.  There must be two parties to the contract, and if we vary the contract in so far as we are concerned, it invalidates the contract so far as the other party is concerned.  I would suggest that that clause is not workable, and that the alternative clause be adopted.  That would mean that the contract would be laid on the Table of the Dáil, and if after a certain period had expired no objection had been raised, the contract would be taken as having received the sanction of the Dáil.</P>

I support the amendment as far as the alternative is concerned, but I maintain that the original proposition is not workable, because the other party would naturally repudiate the contract if we made any change in the contract to that person's disadvantage.  I certainly maintain that the Dáil should have some control over the prices to be charged, and I think if the second portion of the amendment is accepted in principle it would provide for that important supervision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cooper that we should be very careful in dealing with public lands and public property, but I do not see that there is a fair analogy between the two classes of property.  In the one case we were dealing with the property of the State, lands which it was proposed to hand over to the Minister to sell and to dispose of in any way he thought fit.  I will not argue the merits of that case. Once the land is handed over nothing can be said in regard to that except in a case that would be considered a revolutionary act of confiscation.  What is proposed here, I take it, is that the power which is produced periodically, year by year, month by month, or day by day, will be sold at a certain price, and a contract will be entered into.  As I said on the last amendment, if this section were likely to be embodied in the Bill in its present form with the powers it gives to the Minister, some such proposition as this of Deputy Cooper's would be necessary, though I do not think quite in the same form in which it is set out here.  But if the section is going to be limited in the manner in which the Minister has described, I think that the form of the amendment or the demand that the terms of the contract, such as they are to be, should be laid on the Table of the Dáil, is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think whatever is to be the intention regarding the supply of electric power there must be sanction given by the Dáil in respect to the terms, the rates, the periods, and so on.  I take it from the Minister's statement that that is involved in the general scheme, which will be fulfilled when No. 2 Bill is brought forward.  I say that an amendment in relation to a section which is not being pressed, a section that is to be revised and brought forward <Col N="1771" /> in a new form, limiting the powers of the Minister, is not appropriate. It is not appropriate to the proposal which we understand is in the Minister's mind, but which most of us are agreed is exceeded in the section as drafted.  I think that the question involved in Deputy Cooper's amendment should be deferred until we see the new form which the section will take.  I will support the idea in Deputy Cooper's mind and press it as far as I can, that there shall be no power given to a Minister or Ministers, now or henceforward, to do as they like with State property, whether that State property be land or electricity.</P>

      <P>I was not present to hear the Minister's statement on Clause 13.  Before we have an indication of what is the policy which the Minister will pursue in connection with the distribution of electricity, it is difficult to say whether the amendment will be found necessary.  I had in mind that something in the nature of the contract by the Minister with the county council or a body in an area would be the right policy to pursue in connection with the distribution of current.  That particular body would be in a position to see that the price paid for the electricity and other matters affecting the residents of that area would be safeguarded, and we would not therefore be compelled to investigate every little agreement for supplying electricity to a farmhouse.  I am only throwing out the suggestion that if a particular body had the right of making a contract it would be the better means of bringing this about.</P>

    <P>&mdash;&ldquo;shall belong to the Irish Free State, subject to any trust, grant, leases, or concessions then existing in respect thereof, or any valid interest therein, and shall be controlled and administered by the Oireachtas in accordance with such regulations and provisions as shall be from time to time approved by legislation, but the same shall not, nor shall any part thereof, be alienated, but may in the public interest be from time to time granted by way of lease or licence to be worked or enjoyed under the authority and subject to the control of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the Constitutional doctrine that Deputy Johnson was expounding on the 22nd July last year.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think that the effect of this Bill&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>which dealt with lands, as the present Bill deals with certain forms of energy</P>
    <P>&mdash;&ldquo;will be practically a renunciation of the powers of the Oireachtas over lands the property of Saorstát Eireann.  It is handing over to the Minister too much authority.  I think Ireland has suffered very, very much from the action of Ministers and Kings in handing over State property to private persons.  We are confined to 99 years in this, but 99 years is time enough to do a great deal of damage, and very much more recent experience of other countries has shown that Ministers have been able to do certain things with State lands, at least minerals or oil, which have caused a great deal of trouble, because they are done by the Minister, and not by the legislature.  I think we ought to guard very earnestly against the possibilities of any future Minister doing things that he ought not to do.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on later:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We may have the utmost faith in the wisdom, not to speak of the integrity, of the Minister for Finance, but at least we are supposed to have a certain responsibility, and while the Constitution says that the Oireachtas <Col N="1773" /> must retain control, we are to hand over to the Minister the powers the Oireachtas is supposed to have, and to say that for six months he may do anything he likes with these lands.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course that is in the State Lands Act.  There is no six months mentioned in this Bill, nor six years.  Deputy Johnson continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This is revolutionary if you like. Some times people are twitted with being revolutionary.  I say this is a revolution, a retrogressive revolution. I do not know what these properties enumerated in the schedule may be. I do not know what their values are, and we do not know what the terms of the lettings may be.  It may be we are handing over to certain syndicates or private individuals property valued for a million pounds at a penny a year for 99 years.  Does any Deputy in the Dáil know whether that is so or not?  We do not.  Yet we are asked to see that the Minister for Finance is to have power to do that sort of thing for six months without any control whatever.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is Deputy Johnson's doctrine as regards lands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say one or two things that are relevant to the discussion, if not to the amendment. I want to get Deputy Johnson's attitude clear.  I want to get the attitude of the Farmers' Party clear.  I understood on Second Reading that the attitude of that Party was that this scheme required more examination, more consideration, more care, before we embarked on it.  Well, whenever anybody puts down an amendment intended to give more examination and consideration, up gets Deputy Gorey or Deputy Heffernan, like the Queen in &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland,&rdquo; and shouts &ldquo;Off with his head&mdash;I do not agree with this amendment; at least I do not agree with it at all.&rdquo; Why do they not put down amendments themselves?  If they have a policy, why do they not let us know it.  I took this form of amendment simply and solely because it was the form already embodied in an Act, the form that had been proposed by the President, and that is actually working. There may be better forms.  I tried two or three other drafts myself, but I find, on the whole, that the one tying the Government to a principle already adopted was the best.  Still, I hope on the Report Stage that we shall see the fruits of further consideration on the part of the Farmers' Party, and I hope I will be able to help their amendments and not get up and damn them with faint praise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is, to a certain extent, irrelevant, but the principle is not, and the question is whether the Minister accepts the principle that the Oireachtas should have some knowledge of the contracts entered into in its name.  That is a principle I never quarrelled with in the State Lands Act.  I quarrelled with the manner in which Deputy Johnson attempted to assert it, and possibly I phrased my words somewhat unguardedly.  I admit that.  I never quarrelled with that principle when the President brought in the proposal embodied in the amendment&mdash;I supported it.  If the principle that we are to have some knowledge is accepted, then this amendment is quite irrelevant. <Col N="1775" /> If not, I am afraid that the amendment, with all its sins and imperfections, will have to go to a division.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with Deputy Cooper in criticising the Farmer Deputies in this matter.  How are the Farmer Deputies going to secure a better examination of the Siemens scheme through this amendment?  This deals with contracts after the scheme is completed&mdash;contracts for the sale and supply of electricity.  Then it has nothing to do with the scheme.  The dams may be built so weak that all the water will flow away and there will be no electricity to supply, and yet that amendment may be accepted.  So that as far as the Farmers' Party wanted the scheme to be considered in greater detail and with more caution, accepting this amendment would not advance them one inch further on that road.</P>
      <P>I want to take Deputy Cooper as he has taken Deputy Johnson.  On the 22nd July he said that we should be very careful in dealing with public lands, public property.  Having that as his main principle, he also said that it was impossible for the Oireachtas to control them, that we could not have a joint sitting of the Dáil and Seanad to discuss the terms of a lease.  I presume it was not the joint sitting that was criticised.  A sitting of the Dáil to control the terms of the lease would be equally bad.</P>

I want Deputies to note what Deputy Cooper went on to say, as Deputy Johnson already quoted: &ldquo;That would be reducing Parliamentary Government to an absurdity.&rdquo; That is Deputy Cooper's proposal&mdash;to reduce Parliamentary Government to an absurdity.

Now, apparently we are going back on that.  Deputy Cooper was converted by the President, and after the reading of the quotations by Deputy Johnson he never stopped to inquire whether Deputy Johnson had been converted by the President.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is really a construction Bill.  The supply one comes along later.  The amendment may be entirely relevant there, but it is out of the question here, and decidedly out of the question if my explanation is taken into consideration, and the point that is to be brought forward on the Report Stage is attended to.  That is to say, that the section is to be split into two, and that for power to be supplied in the three-year period I ask for unlimited powers; outside that, all I am stipulating for is some guarantee in the matter of consumption before I incur the expenditure of the transmission system.  Despite all that, we are going to have this amendment prosecuted to a division, that every contract in connection with the management of the sales should come before the Oireachtas. Previously we had an amendment by Deputy Thrift to have all contracts in connection with cement and building material laid on the Table of the House <Col N="1777" /> to go through much the same as this.  Here we have a more technical matter still, the question of the tariff system, and that is not attended to by Deputy Cooper.  He thinks that every individual contract with every person who is going to get any power from the scheme will have to come before the House to be discussed before it is passed.  I think that is one of the fruits of not really believing that the experts who have examined the scheme are experts, and that they are people whose guidance it is wise to trust.  It simply puts it in the impossible position&mdash;I say it openly&mdash;that by a less competent body of people than the experts all these technical matters are going to be insisted upon&mdash;by Deputies&mdash;that reference should be made here.  I do not think it is workable.  I do not think it will be workable under a tariff Bill to have a general proposition of this kind.  I think, just as in Post Office contracts, certain lines may have to be laid down by the Oireachtas. Beyond that I am not ready to assent.  I do not know if Deputy Cooper had the building of the scheme of things according to his own desires, he would now insist on that for Post Office contracts&mdash;that every time the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs wants to enter into a contract for a telephone installation to any private householder it should be put on the Table, argued about, and be subject to ratification or rejection by either House of the Oireachtas.  I think it is not merely irrelevant to the present Section 13 as it stands, but even still more irrelevant to Section 13, as I have indicated it is likely to be revised.  I would plead with Deputy Johnson not so much to defer it to the Report Stage, but to defer it until the second Bill is brought in.</P>

      <P>If I could model the scheme of the world according to my desires the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would have nothing to do with telephones, as they are worked much more efficiently and cheaply by private enterprise.  With regard to the irrelevancy, I think I must have infected the Minister.  He now talks of experts.  Is he going to consult experts <Col N="1778" /> with regard to contracts he may make under the scheme?  I understood the experts had finished their work.</P>

I want to meet the Minister as far as I can.  I see the difficulty of trying to amend a section which has been virtually withdrawn for another section that the Minister has not yet drafted.  If the Minister can give us his proposed amendments, say, two days before the Report Stage, in order that we may draft amendments to the amendments, or additional amendments, I would be quite prepared to withdraw this one. It would only be giving us a fair chance of considering them&mdash;at any rate this one amendment.  Otherwise we shall be at a hopeless disadvantage in dealing with it.</P>

I can visualise the position of the Oireachtas if that view was given expression to.  The Oireachtas would be continuously in session for three, four or perhaps five years doing nothing but supervising contracts.  I can see the debate that would arise over every contract or sub-contract.  The Oireachtas would be engaged on business that it knew very little about.  Speaking as an average man I do not claim to know much about it.  I would object to a section of that description.</P>

      <P>The Farmers' Party have not put down any amendment in connection with this section, but I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to a matter that is of considerable importance from their point of view.  The section says that lands benefited by drainage are to be charged with a certain payment.  By sub-sections (1) and (2) the benefit to the capital value will be decided by an arbitrator appointed by a Reference Committee under Section 6 of the Act.  The Reference Committee consists of the Chief Justice of the Irish Free State, the President of the High Court and the Chairman of the Surveyors' Institution (Irish Branch).  Our principal concern here is to see that the arbitrator so appointed shall be a man with firsthand knowledge of land value and improvements. I suggest that in the case of lands benefited by drainage, one of the members of the Reference Committee, or an additional member of it should be the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.  The idea is to ensure that the man appointed will be one who understands land valuation and who will be able to give a decision that will be just to the State and to the people who occupy the land.  I think that is a matter for consideration by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty about the proposal is that this all refers back to Section 6, and the whole basis and foundation of ascertainment of damage and assessment of compensation is under the Acquisition of Land Assessment Compensation Act, 1919. In that there is a special Reference Committee established, which is pretty well the Reference Committee talked of <Col N="1780" /> in Section 14.  There is a slight change but that change is really one getting away from the terms the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls and changing it to the Chief Justice of the Irish Free State, the President of the High Court and the Chairman of the Surveyors' Institution.  To incorporate such a suggestion as the Deputy made, that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture should be brought into consultation would, in effect, change the Acquisition of Lands Act of 1919, and I would have to give further consideration to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the whole, I do not know, if I may put it to the Deputy, that that is worth pressing.  What is it going to attain?  It is not these three people who are going to determine.  They are going to appoint an arbitrator, and I should imagine that if the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, and the Chairman of the Surveyors Institution were approached in regard to, say, the appointment of an arbitrator &mdash;let me get away from land&mdash;to ascertain the damage done to fisheries, I think they would naturally look about and get into consultation with certain people interested in fishery matters, and would have certain names put up to them or have informal consultations with them.  Here again I cannot say they would do it, and I do not know that it would be right to insist that they should do it.  I think it is not reasonable to say that they should consult with certain people&mdash;it might be the Minister for Lands and Agriculture or it might be, say, Mr. Justice Wylie who is concerned with land administration&mdash;before selecting an expert in land arbitration and land valuation to act as arbitrator.  I do not see how you are going to get much further by putting an obligation on certain judicial people to confer with the Minister before they make the appointment. I think that is bad, and I do not think we should insist on it.  Let me put it to the Deputy in another way. There will be a question of land, taken, say, for the purpose of the excavation of the canal, and, in the first instance, there will, I think, be an offer to the owner of the property.  Clause 6 will <Col N="1781" /> operate in default of agreement.  Somebody will have to advise the engineers in charge of the scheme, or my Department, as to what is a proper sum to offer, and I should say that the people to whom I will turn most naturally will be the land valuers under the Land Commission.  In other words, they will probably be my witnesses as against the land owner who is claiming compensation. The Deputy's amendment would mean that the arbitrator would be appointed after consultation with people who are actually my witnesses as against the land owner.  If there is anything human in the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, he may come down in that case against the land owner, and the sort of arbitrator appointed after consultation with him may be an arbitrator very much after my desires, but not the sort of arbitrator whom the Deputy might think fit. If these three were to be the actual assessors of the damage, there would be great value in the point which the Deputy urges, but when they have to appoint the arbitrator, I think we might leave it to their good judgment, if they deem it desirable, to consult with certain people to see who would be the best arbitrator.  If the Deputy sees no danger in it and wishes to press the amendment, I will defer the consideration of it until the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has met me very fairly.

I think the Minister has met the matter fairly, but this might get over any criticism there may be in the country in regard to this Committee.  I need not point out that the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, and the Chairman of the Surveyors' Institute are not men who might be considered to be very much in touch with land values, and, unconsciously, these men might be somewhat biassed in regard to the particular type of men whom they would select.  It is still open to us to have some other men appointed on this Committee of Reference. Perhaps the Minister would consider whether that is possible.</P>

I think it is rather an advantage that the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court should not be what are described as technical experts in land matters, and the fact that they are not expert but judicial, will lead them to make most careful enquiries before appointing an arbitrator.  Would Deputy Gorey prefer to have consultation with the Minister for Lands and Agriculture rather than the other suggestion which I threw out, that the Reference Committee should be added to by putting on say, Mr. Justice Wylie?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I see a difficulty there. The analogy which the Minister made was not quite right.  He envisaged a situation where you are going to take <Col N="1783" /> away land for a canal.  The State has an interest in the land, because there is an annuity there.  The analogy is not quite apt.  In this case the idea is that you are going to value an improvement and the State has no concern in that as a land owner, but, in the case which the Minister made, the State would have to see that their interests in the land taken for the purposes of a canal would be secured, and, therefore, their interest would lie alongside that of the man who owned the land or the occupier. Therefore, I think we ought to take time and see who would be the proper person.  I do not think that the Judicial Commissioner would suit us either.</P>

    <P>When constructing works under this Act it shall not be obligatory on the Minister or any contractor to comply with the Fisheries (Ireland) Acts, 1842 to 1909, but the Minister shall take and make or, in the case of works executed for him by a contractor procure that the contractor shall take and make such precautions and provisions as the Minister, after <Col N="1784" /> consultation with the Minister for Fisheries, shall consider adequate for the protection of and avoidance of injury to fisheries during or in consequence of the construction of any works under this Act, unless the Minister after such consultation as aforesaid is satisfied that such protection cannot be afforded or such injury cannot be avoided without substantial detriment to the works or substantial hindrance to their construction.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 4, after the words &ldquo;as aforesaid&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;and with the consent of the Minister for Fisheries.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intended that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should have not only to consult with the Minister for Fisheries, but also to convince him that the works he proposes to do in connection with inland fisheries are necessary.  At present, as far as I can see, it is open to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to go to the Minister for Fisheries and lay down a certain scheme.  The Minister for Fisheries says: &ldquo;I cannot agree to that.&rdquo;  The Minister for Industry and Commerce says: &ldquo;What do you want done?&rdquo;  The Minister for Fisheries says: &ldquo;I want this, that, and the other thing done,&rdquo; and the Minister for Industry and Commerce says: &ldquo;No.  I have consulted you, but this scheme has now become law, and we are going straight ahead.&rdquo;  I suggest that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should not only consult his fellow-Minister, but convince him.  The Minister is capable of conviction.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has succeeded in convincing him that it would be inadvisable for him to open his mouth in connection with this particular Bill.  I suppose that is general consent, and not consent given in any particular case.  Seriously, it is not only the individual position of the Minister for Fisheries, but the position of an external Minister who may be outside the Dáil.  It is not as if the Minister for Fisheries were responsible for his actions to the Executive Council. He is an independent Minister, <Col N="1785" /> and might belong to some other party, or be outside the Dáil altogether. Therefore, it is the duty of the Dáil to safeguard his position as far as they can.  This section hands him over tied and bound to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister for Fisheries has no effective means of making a case against any proposed alteration.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, the objection is that where electricity interests and fisheries conflict, the fisheries have to be the loser.  Before we place the powers given in this section in the hands of the Minister for Industry and Commerce we ought to have some statement of the case from the fisheries' point of view.  We do not know, for instance, how far it is calculated that sufficient compensation is provided for. £10,000 is provided, I think, in the scheme as compensation for fishery interests. So far as my information goes of the value of the fisheries, £10,000 is less than the capital value.  At present, without guidance of any kind, we are asked to provide that the Minister for Industry and Commerce need only consult the Minister for Fisheries, and need not be guided by his advice.  I suggest that is not a sound principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect the Deputy appreciates that the alternative to the picture he has drawn would be in effect to give the Minister for Fisheries a veto on the proposals.  The Deputy makes play with the point that the attitude of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is that where electricity interests conflict with the fishery interests that the fishery interests would go to the wall, and yet the suggestion is that the onus should be on the Minister for Industry and Commerce, not merely to consult but to convince the Minister for Fisheries, which, translated, means that the Minister for Fisheries ought to have a veto on the proposals put forward in connection with the electricity undertaking.  It is just one of those positions that perhaps it is impossible to meet absolutely satisfactorily by the phrasing of a section or subsection, but one knows that where that expression is used, &ldquo;after consultation,&rdquo; or &ldquo;having consulted,&rdquo; and so on, that everything humanly possible <Col N="1786" /> will be done as between the two Departments and the two Ministers to reach agreement.  But if the Deputy asks in the event of a conflict between the fishery interests and the interests of this scheme, which is going to prevail, then unquestionably the interests of the development of the water-power are going to prevail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the force of the Minister's argument.  I think there is a certain difference in principle between consultation with an External Minister and a Minister of the Executive Council.  In most cases of consultation between an External Minister and a Minister of the Executive Council there is bound to be a certain amount of give and take; only on a subsequent occasion if the Minister's wishes are not met in some way in the Executive Council he might make matters unpleasant later on in connection with other proposals.  The position of an External Minister is different technically as to status.  The working of his Department is not always so intimately associated, I should say, as is that of Lands and Agriculture with the other Departments of State.  I think the fisheries are not so closely connected with the Departments of State represented in the Executive Council.  I would be quite willing to agree if it were suggested that there should be some third party to whom appeal would lie.  I think the Minister for Fisheries needs a better opportunity of putting up his case than is given under the section. If it were possible that an appeal might be heard by the Executive Council that might suit the case, and ease the difficulty. Consultation might work well between members of the Executive Council, and might not work equally well between a member of the Council and a non-member of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is quite right, that the amendment as worded would mean giving a veto on the whole scheme to the Minister for Fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to preserving the fishery industry in the Shannon, I think it is pretty well admitted that the scheme involves the destruction of the salmon in that river, and nothing that could be done would <Col N="1787" /> be really effective in preserving the fishery.  The only way of preserving the fishing industry would be to breed land-locked salmon above the dam.  I do not think the amendment, as it stands, would be effective, as the Minister for Justice has already said that the fishing industries must be sacrificed. I think the amount of money involved is larger than Deputy Cooper suggested.  I believe there are over 2,000 people who make their living one way or another by the fisheries on the Shannon, and that the sum involved in the Shannon fisheries is somewhat over one quarter of a million.  As it has been already decided that the fisheries must be sacrificed, I do not think that the amendment would do very much good.</P>

      <P>I would like to hear the Minister's view on that statement put forward by Deputy Esmonde.  Unless the Minister confirms it, and I should be astonished if he does, I do not think it should be allowed to go out on the authority of the Deputy that it is conceded and accepted that the Shannon fisheries are liable to be destroyed, and not merely that they are liable to be, but that they will inevitably be destroyed by this scheme, and that the whole industry will have to be sacrificed.  That is the statement of the Deputy, and I think it should not be allowed to pass without contradiction, if it can be contradicted, because it will cause a great deal of consternation amongst many people.  I have seen nothing in the reports which would justify me in thinking that there was any good foundation for that statement.</P>

      <P>I do not support this amendment.  I wish to impress on the Minister the necessity of doing everything possible, even if it entails more expense, to see that the fisheries of the Shannon will not be injured.  Deputy Esmonde has suggested that the salmon interests in the Shannon are worth one quarter of a million pounds.  I do not think that is right.  I do not think they are worth that sum annually.</P>

      <P>I took the figures from the publication of the Department of Agriculture.  Last year, I think it was, there were between £300,000 and £400,000 worth of salmon.  I think the actual salmon caught in the estuary of the Shannon amounted to about £100,000.  I think the figure of a quarter million pounds included the money obtained from salmon in the river, the money obtained through tourists, and that kind of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has the figures and the facts before him, and I leave him to deal with this figure of a quarter million pounds.  Deputy Johnson has asked for information on one point, and I ask for information on it also, with regard to Deputy Esmonde's statement that the salmon fisheries would have to be sacrificed because of this scheme.  I got no impression like that at all from the discussion on the Bill or from the reading of the report. But what we did accept was that where the fishery interests came up against the interests of this scheme and where that could not be avoided the fishery interests would have to give way.  I did not assume that the salmon interests were to be sacrificed. I believe that with careful consideration of the whole subject, with the assistance of some experts, a fishery authority, very little would need to be sacrificed.  I can understand with regard to the raising of the depths of the lakes and the raising of the depths of the river that where you have at present currents you will be creating flats. I can understand particular portions which were good for rod fishing before not being good for rod fishing in the future perhaps, but you might have better net fishing, or equally good <Col N="1789" /> net fishing.  Taking the fishing value of the Shannon as a whole, it might very easily be quite as good as it has been.  But this is a case in which the best fishery authorities available might be consulted, and I think it would be good business from the national point of view if the best experts in America or in Scotland were consulted.  I know that such experts have done wonders for the propagation of fish in America; they have thought out the questions of propagation and breeding of fish in every direction, and they have overcome difficulties in their own rivers. Scotch experts, perhaps, could also give valuable information on this question, and I suggest to the Minister that in the carrying out of this scheme the Minister for Fisheries, or perhaps he himself should take the advice of the greatest experts in the world, and that the fishery interests would thereby be preserved.  I am sure that that is the intention of the Government, and it is certainly the intention of the Minister. We did not form the impression that the fishery interests were to be sacrificed when they come in contact with this scheme, but that the fishery interests would give way to the interests of the electricity scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Gorey's speech makes it perfectly clear how absolutely in the dark we are about this matter in the absence of any statement from the Minister for Fisheries, or from his Department.  It is really not fair to the Dáil.  The Minister for Fisheries ought to be in the Dáil during the discussion on a section of this character which concerns his Department very vitally, and we ought to hear his views on it.  We ought to have had on Second Reading some information of the general effects of the scheme.  He is an extern Minister responsible to the Dáil, and he ought to explain to the Dáil in this matter what are the interests involved. Deputy Esmonde's figures were somewhat too high, but not very much too high.  If the salmon are disinclined to go up these long ladders to the spawning beds Deputy Gorey knows that the fisheries will be ruined.  I should like to have the Minister here to assure us <Col N="1790" /> that consultation with fishery experts will take place.  At present we know nothing except the bald statement that the fishery interests are to be sacrificed to electrical power, and we ought to know more.  Has the Minister for Industry and Commerce any statement from the fishery point of view?  I do not want him to communicate it to the Dáil, but to give us the gist of it if he has.</P>

      <P>I have had consultation with the Department of the Minister for Fisheries on this matter. At the time that I had that consultation the Minister himself was absent, as he is at present absent, owing to the illness of a relative.  The experts of the Department of Fisheries never advanced to the point of saying that the fishery interests would be destroyed. That statement has been made for the first time in my hearing by Deputy Esmonde.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The salmon fisheries.  No one of them said that.  I did get a statement from one of the officials of the Department that if you anticipated in the future that the fish would be as contrary as possible and that they would not adapt themselves to the new conditions a certain percentage loss in the value of the fisheries might be looked for.  I am speaking of the salmon fisheries the whole time. But never was it suggested anywhere that the entire salmon fisheries of the river, or even of the lower reaches of the river, roughly, from Athlone down, would be destroyed, that there would be complete destruction of the salmon fisheries.  The question of value is another matter that comes into consideration. Deputy Esmonde says a quarter-million pounds yearly.  Deputy Cooper introduced his statement as to our compensation figure by stating that he believed the salmon fishing was valued at at least £10,000 a year. There is a big difference between £10,000 a year and the £250,000 which Deputy Esmonde's imagination has taken him to.  I am very glad to get from Deputy Cooper now&mdash;it is only <Col N="1791" /> on his individual responsibility and it will not bind the fishery folk afterwards&mdash;his estimate that £10,000 a year would keep the fishery interests there.  There are certain ways, of course, of getting at what is the value of these interests.  Might I suggest one?  The income tax returns for the last three years might have a very definite bearing upon this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Take what is really the effect of the clause, that&mdash;</P>
      <P>When constructing works it shall not be obligatory on the Minister to comply with the Fisheries (Ireland) Acts, but the Minister shall take and make, or, in the case of works executed for him by a contractor, procure that the contractor shall take and make such precautions and provisions as the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Fisheries, shall consider adequate for the protection of and avoidance of injury to fisheries during or in consequence of the construction of any works under the Act.</P>
      <P>That is to say, in the very forefront we set out that warning to ourselves that we are to do a minimum amount of damage.  Only in the end we see&mdash;</P>
      <P>Unless the Minister, after such consultation as aforesaid, is satisfied that such protection cannot be afforded or such injury cannot be avoided without substantial detriment to the works or substantial hindrance to their construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without getting near the region of complete destruction of salmon fishery on the River Shannon, we say <Col N="1792" /> the Dáil has already taken a decision. I emphasise the point over and over again that if this injury cannot be avoided, in the carrying out of the work, the works cannot be impeded for that reason.  To that extent the Dáil has already committed itself a couple of times that as between the Minister for Fisheries and myself in the last eventuality the electricity point of view will have to prevail.  From the Fishery point of view, if I am to accept &ldquo;after such consultation and with the consent of the Minister for Fisheries,&rdquo; that means that the final decision as to the carrying out of the Shannon scheme rests with the Minister for Fisheries. That is a position in which the Dáil does not want to put either the Minister or myself.</P>
    <P>I do not think it will be seriously urged that we should look forward to such a conflict between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Fisheries, that there must be an arbitrator such as the Lord Chief Justice, or the President of the Executive Council, to give a decision in the event of a conflict arising.  Two members of the same Government are not going to be outrageous in their decision for the simple pleasure of being at variance with one another on a point which is going to benefit or prejudice materially the State.  It is only a question of conflict as between the two, and the Dáil must come to the decision that either you have the Shannon scheme or throw overboard the Shannon scheme and have the fisheries.  The effect of those words would be&mdash;I do not think Deputy Cooper disagrees with the analysis given by the Minister for Justice&mdash; that the Minister for Fisheries, as a last resort, is to be the arbitrator as to whether or not the Shannon scheme is to be proceeded with.  That is not a solution to which I can look forward with any enthusiasm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister's statement has borne out that it is really true that the fisheries will be destroyed&mdash;his admission that this amendment would involve the final decision as to whether there was to be a Shannon electricity scheme or not and <Col N="1793" /> that it would depend upon the Minister for Fisheries, if we were to choose between electricity and fisheries.  The Minister's statement can have no other meaning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke very generally.  He spoke of the destruction of the fisheries.  I do not say that is a disastrous state of affairs.  The Dáil and the country have accepted the scheme.  If it is inevitable, I am not objecting to the Minister's decision, and I do not think that this amendment of Deputy Cooper can do any good at the present stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel it is necessary to say that notwithstanding Deputy Esmonde's conviction, that the Shannon electricity proposal inevitably means the destruction of the Shannon fisheries, it is not by any means a fair presumption from all that has been written and said about this scheme.  Had it been the inevitable consequence of the acceptance of this scheme, I have no doubt there would have been more questions raised and more hesitation in approving of it.  I am surprised that Deputy Esmonde, if he had this conviction, did not raise this point at an earlier stage, because he will realise, especially if he has a sum of £250,000 a year in mind, and if that sum has to be added to the annual cost to the country, that it would be a very important factor.  He has failed lamentably in his duty if he believed that, on the Second Reading Stage of the Bill, and did not bring it forward.  I think his statement should not go abroad without opposition and a counter statement that there is nothing in the scheme which would imply any such conclusion as he has come to.  He is entitled to his opinion and to express it, but he is not entitled to have it go out from the Dáil that it is inevitable <Col N="1794" /> and that we all agree on it.  We are not all agreed on it, and I have no reason to think that there is any foundation for the statement.</P>

      <P>I am giving the figure as the export from the Saorstát of salmon and trout.  I am prepared to admit that a considerable amount of that is made up of salmon, and trout will enter into the total in a rather small proportion.  It may be £10,000, or £15,000, or perhaps more.  I am prepared to admit that salmon is a big item.  The total value is £225,000 for the whole of the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe, having some knowledge of rivers and fishing, that, with the aid of the best experts, it is possible that no injury at all will be done to the salmon industry of the Shannon, and unless it is proved to the contrary I am prepared to say that this scheme will do no harm unless some expert comes along and tells us it will.  The matter is so important that the Minister would be well advised, from the national point of view, to have the best advice that American or Continental experts can give him on this subject.  With that advice, I see no reason why fish cannot ascend to the higher waters of the Shannon as easily as they have done in the past.  With proper provision I think it can be done.  Until some expert tells me it cannot be done, I am prepared to continue in the same opinion.  With all respect to our Department of Fisheries, I say you have not an expert with that experience in Ireland.  This is a new matter.  Hitherto you have left the passage of the rivers to the fish themselves without artificial assistance. That has not been the case in other countries.  They have assisted the fish <Col N="1795" /> to reach the higher waters.  We had not occasion to do it, and, therefore, we are inexpert in the matter.  The experts are to be found in America and Canada.  With all respect to our fishery Department, I do not think that they have that expert knowledge, and it is not putting them in a minor place to suggest that the best experts we can get should be brought into consultation. Some of our electrical engineering experts found fault with the fact that outside experts were taken in to consult with our officials.  I hope the same thing will not apply to the fishery experts and that they will not be huffed to the same extent.  I think too much precautions cannot be taken, and I believe, having some knowledge of fisheries and rivers, that no injury will be done to the fish if the best advice be obtained from experts and their recommendations carried out.</P>

The reaches of the Shannon near Castleconnell will certainly suffer considerably. In that connection I hope the Minister for Industry and Commerce will take into consideration the large number of people who will be thrown out of employment there, and that when this scheme is carried to completion some kind of alternative employment will be provided for them.  I have not been able to think of any satisfactory arbitrator who could act between the two Ministers, but I accept the statement of the Vice-President <Col N="1796" /> that it would be an impossibility to have the Minister for Fisheries imposing a veto on the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I therefore withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 10 to delete paragraph (c) and to substitute a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  where the Minister constructs a permanent new bridge and such bridge confers substantially greater advantages on the public of any county or urban district than the original bridge, by affording an improved means of communication or otherwise, the Minister shall certify the cost of such new bridge, and the Minister for Local Government and Public Health shall certify what part of such cost in his opinion ought reasonably to be borne by the council of such county or urban district, and thereupon a sum equal to the part so certified of such cost shall be raised by such council as part of the expenses of the maintenance of such county or urban roads (as the case may be) and shall be paid by such council to the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a rather long amendment, but it merely means that the Minister who shall certify the proportion of the cost of a new bridge to be borne by the local authority shall be the Minister for Local Government, and not the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

Apparently they are going to be made abolish old bridges and build new bridges.  In ordinary circumstances they would not think of interfering with the old bridges.  They would regard them as quite good enough for the ordinary requirements of the county.  The Parliamentary Secretary apparently has forgotten that ratepayers in counties where this expenditure will have to be undertaken are accustomed to cutting their coats according to their cloth, and that they are quite content with things as they are.  Now you are going to force the expenditure involved in building new bridges on them.  I suppose they will be told that some wonderful advantages are going to be conferred on them by these new bridges, and that the advantages will be so great that they will have to pay for them.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the point of view put forward by Deputy Gorey, because it does seem somewhat arbitrary where a bridge is quite sufficient for existing requirements, to compel a local authority to contribute a considerable amount of money for the erection of a new bridge and to meet alterations required under this Bill.  In view of the proposal to alter the course of a river, it may become necessary to have a new bridge erected in the county.  The bridge is not required for the ordinary needs of the people in that county, but it is required for the purpose of advancing the interests of this particular scheme.  In such a case I say it is quite unreasonable to compel the ratepayers in that county to bear the cost of the erection of that new bridge which they do not need for their local requirements. Therefore, I think the Government would be well advised to accept the proposition put up by Deputy Gorey.  The tribunal that the Deputy suggested would, I imagine, look at this question from a different angle to that at which the Minister for Local Government would look at it.  The Minister for Local Government owes his appointment, probably, to the Executive Council.</P>

I say that these things are discussed by the Executive Council, and seeing that this scheme is put forward by the Executive Council <Col N="1800" /> through one of its Ministers, I think it is important that the person who is to settle this question should be nominnated by a body altogether outside the control of the Executive Council.  I would suggest, in the general interests of the scheme, that the view put forward by Deputy Gorey should be given serious consideration by the Government.</P>

      <P>You had Ballsbridge and Cross Guns Bridge, and at present there is under consideration the extension of Annesley Bridge, and I believe that even Butt Bridge has been the subject of a good deal of consideration and of recommendations from various sections of the commercial community.  Now, should it happen that the Liffey had to be developed in the direction of these bridges, and that their reconstruction had to take place, I suppose Deputy Good, in the interests of the Dublin ratepayers, would take exactly the same side and say, &ldquo;But for this great Liffey scheme and the diversion of the river the people of Dublin would be quite content and well satisfied with the old Cross Guns Bridge, with the old Ballsbridge, as it was known, and with the old Annesley Bridge, as it is at present,&rdquo; which everyone hopes to see extended as well as Butt Bridge, which has been the bane of the commercial men of the city.  There is proposed to be a charge here for which substantially increased advantages are to be derived. Only in that case will a proportion of the cost be raised.  What are the exact circumstances?  They are that you get some value for the old bridges.  The old bridge is taken into account in assessing the substantially increased advantages that are going to accrue to the local authority by reason of the newly-constructed bridges.  These will be more graceful than the old ones, and <Col N="1801" /> will be much more suitable for the needs of the country.  When Deputy Good goes down to the country on holidays with his family he will not get that extraordinary jolt which motorists sometimes experience when going over these donkey-back bridges, and he will say that the county councils were well advised to pay for these enormously increased advantages derived by reason of the Shannon scheme.</P>

      <P>We have again been treated to the usual application of what the President calls soft solder. It was nice and soft and all that, but very little value to the people, to whom it is applied.  The position is this: It is quite possible that if you change the line of a bridge it may be of great benefit to certain districts in a county; it might be a great benefit to one particular district, but it might be a loss to somebody else.  I might say: &ldquo;Here is a bridge crossing the Shannon; it gives a direct line of communication, and is easy of access to people living in the neighbourhood. If you alter it considerably it may be good for the county at large, but it may not be good for any other individual, and there, again, your arbitrator would come in.&rdquo; I say that the Minister for Local Government ought not to be made the final authority. You are altering your machinery. You deliberately set up machinery, and now you are altering it in this particular instance.  I hope that the Minister will give us business, and not the soft solder that the President has served out to the Dáil.  I want to know why the machinery set up and acted upon is departed from in this case and at the eleventh hour.  A reference committee is set up here with power to appoint arbitrators.  Why is not that availed of instead of the suggestion made now?</P>

I think it is placing the Minister for Local Government in a false position, and it is decidedly not good business from any point of view that he should be asked to say what he thinks is of benefit and what is a loss. Such a course of procedure is not going to inspire confidence: that the old machinery should be reversed, and that the reference committee should not be allowed to appoint men to deal with this question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>True, but there are many things that people never ask for, yet they get them, and have to pay for them.  It is to be decided by a third person at any rate whether there is a benefit or not, and if there is it is to be paid for.  Then the clause says that in determining the amount of the benefit the value of the benefit shall be the value of the benefit which the local authority has received.  Deputy Gorey referred to the Bill.  If there had been no amendment, I take it he would approve what the Minister for Industry and Commerce certified as the value of the improvements.</P>

      <P>It is in the Bill, and the Minister proposes to do in this matter what the recent amendment, which was withdrawn, proposed to do in regard to the value of the fisheries.  It proposes to give to the Minister for Local Government a veto in regard to the amount of the value.  I am inclined to think that there is more likely to be consideration given to the requirements and demands of the local authority by the Minister for Local Government than by an outside arbitrator.  I suggest <Col N="1803" /> that Deputy Gorey should consider the position of that Minister. At the present time the Minister, of course, is an extern Minister appointed by the Dáil and responsible to the Dáil, but that may not be the permanent position.  The Minister for Local Government is likely to be in all cases concerned with the affairs of local government, and to be concerned with conserving the interests of Local Government Authorities, and as such I suggest, would be very likely to be in favour of reducing the amount chargeable against the local authority rather than increasing it.</P>

You are practically asking one of the parties to the dispute to make a decision and I suggest to the Deputy that he has got his point of view very well cared for in this amendment.  I think the Minister for Local Government will have to be satisfied of the amount of improvement conferred on the local authority by the new bridges, and what he has to decide next is what is the amount to be charged against the local authority.</P>

      <P>Before the President replies might I say one or two words in regard to the President's statement. The President is usually very logical, but in the argument he advanced this evening he has departed from that very wise precedent.  It should be scarcely necessary to remind the President that in the case of Ballsbridge, to which he referred, and in the case of O'Connell Bridge, to which he referred&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and Butt Bridge, to which he referred, the conditions there rendered the rebuilding of all those bridges necessary where altered circumstances, the increased amount of <Col N="1804" /> traffic, had to be dealt with.  He quotes these as parallel cases with the Shannon. What are the circumstances in the case of the Shannon?  The river is diverted, and a new bridge is constructed by reason of the diversion of the river, not by reason of circumstances of traffic, as referred to in the other case.  Then he urges that we have a distinct benefit, and the benefit that is in his mind is the removal of the camel's hump which added a great deal of beauty to some of our older bridges notwithstanding all that is argued in many cases against them.  The point is that where the bridge exists at present it is sufficient in the minds of everybody to meet the requirements of the Shannon.  Where such a bridge exists and where, in the carrying out of this scheme, the course of the river is altered and a new bridge is necessitated, then the Minister can claim that that new bridge confers benefits on the district, and consequently makes a claim for these benefits against the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The words are &ldquo;substantially greater advantages.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  I think the Minister and I will be in agreement on this, when I state that it is only natural to expect that the local authority will object to make any such payment, or will refuse to recognise that it has any advantages by reason of the altered bridge.  That being so, a condition of affairs arises in which it is necessary to bring in a third party to settle the differences.  Under the original proposition the Minister involved in the scheme was to consult with the Minister for Local Government, and as a result of the consultation the local authority was to pay so much.  The Minister, I think, wisely came to the conclusion that it was unlikely that a proposition of that character would go through the Dáil, and so, having anticipated the objections, he now puts forward what, from their point of view, is an arbitration clause.  The arbitration clause is that the Minister for Local Government will be the party who will be the arbitrator. I think that even at the back of the President's mind he is very doubtful as to the wisdom of that appointment, <Col N="1805" /> and certainly, from the experience I have had on local authorities, extending over seven years, I am satisfied that it would be inadvisable to bring in the Minister for Local Government to arbitrate as between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the local authority.  I think if we were to consult the Minister for Local Government on the subject, he would say at once: &ldquo;It is a position that I do not like to occupy.  It is a position that it would be undesirable for me to occupy. I have to deal with these local authorities every day, and I do not want to be brought into conflict with them more than is absolutely necessary.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would urge that, from all these points of view, it is not in the interest of good government to adopt the course proposed, and it would seem to me to be a very simple solution of the difficulty to accept Deputy Gorey's suggestion. I would urge the Minister, in the interests of all concerned, to adopt that course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that there is a point of view involved which has not yet been thought of.  I put it forward because it may be a solution of the whole matter.  Deputy Johnson has put forward two points which appear to have been discussed in a mixed way.  The third point is, should the old bridge be rebuilt or should a structure be put up which would confer &ldquo;substantially greater advantages.&rdquo;  If it meets Deputy Gorey, I would put in from sub-clause (b), Section 17, at the top of page 10, the words &ldquo;either restore the road or bridge to its former condition or after consultation with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health construct a new permanent road or bridge,&rdquo; and so on, so that there would be, right at the start, consultation with the Minister for Local Government, as to whether the old structure should, in so far as it can be done, be put back to its old position, or whether a new bridge giving substantial advantages to the community should be put up. The Deputy may retort that he still objects to the Minister for Local Government being put in there, but I assume <Col N="1806" /> if I do get the Minister for Local Government he would have some consultation with the local authority, the people who are afterwards to be charged, and in that way we would arrive at what Deputy Gorey seems to be agitated about, that those who have to wear the coat should have some say in the way it ought to be cut.  If that would meet the point, I would undertake, at a later stage, to insert something which would mean consultation with the Minister for Local Government before a new bridge conferring greater advantages would be constructed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I could accept that.  The way I viewed this question from the outset was: the Minister for Industry and Commerce was actually maintaining and guaranteeing to the local authorities that nothing would be interfered with, and that anything that would be interfered with would be replaced. We took this clause to mean a protection for the local authority, and not a source of revenue for the Shannon scheme.  I could very easily understand, where the course of the river is changed, and where a new bridge is to be put up, that the old bridge will have to remain in the very same state, and that the new bridge will have to be put over the new canal. I cannot visualise this improvement at all.  I do not know how it is to come about.  At the moment I cannot visualise it.  I do not like in a Bill suspicious and unnecessary sections which might mean anything.  If you replace a bridge that you take down, the question would arise as to whether the bridge put up was better, and whether it was an absolute necessity. Of course, if it were an absolute necessity you would be justified in charging for making a bad thing good. But if it were good at the moment, I do not see how you can make it better. If you are going to divert the course of the Shannon, the old bridge will have to remain, and it will be of no benefit to the community.  I cannot visualise where there is to be any improvement. If I could be assured that the Minister for Local Government will express the view of the local authority <Col N="1807" /> I would be quite satisfied.  If he is the mouthpiece of the local authority, and he decides a matter with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I am satisfied.  I cannot see any instance where you will be conferring any benefit at all upon the local authority, except in a case where the present bridge is in a bad condition, and you improve it.</P>

      <P>As regards Section 18, there is a minor point on which I would like to make a suggestion. I think notices should be served by registered letter rather than by the ordinary prepaid letter.  In connection with one or two other Bills which were passed here, I introduced a similar amendment, and it was accepted.  Possibly a letter might go astray and the man might never get a notice.  I would ask the Minister to accept the principle and to embody the idea in a further amendment, if necessary.  If not, I would introduce an amendment on Report.</P>

    <P>Amendment 7:&mdash;In page 3, before section 4, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  The number of members constituting the Appeal Board shall be twelve, of whom three personally present together at a review of a film picture shall form a quorum.</P>
    <P>(2)  Sub-section (1) of section 3 of the Principal Act is hereby repealed.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal submitted in this amendment has reference to the principal Act.  There it is enacted by Section 3, sub-section (1):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There shall be established a Censorship of Films Appeal Board consisting of nine Commissioners, of whom one shall be Chairman.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (6) of the same section it is set out:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four members of the Appeal Board personally present shall form a quorum for the hearing of appeals and the decision of the majority of the members present shall be the decision of the Appeal Board, save that, whenever such a majority is less than four, or the members present are equally divided, the appeal shall be re-heard in the presence of not less than seven members of the Appeal Board and the decision of the majority of the members present at such re-hearing shall be the decision of the Appeal Board, but if, on such re-hearing, the members present <Col N="1812" /> are equally divided, the decision of the official censor shall be affirmed.</P>
    <P>My amendment is in essence a proposal to increase the number of the Appeal Board from nine to twelve, and then it deals with the quorum&mdash;that three shall be personally present together at a re-view of a film picture. By the way, &ldquo;review&rdquo; is what is printed on the Order Paper here.  By my mistake it was written thus, and not as it was intended, &ldquo;re-view.&rdquo; In sub-section (2) of the amendment, I propose on the Paper to repeal sub-section (1).  What I should have written was sub-section (6), which is a wholly different matter.  If you, sir, would allow me to make that correction now, clause 2 of the amendment would read: &ldquo;Sub-section (6) of Section 3 of the principal Act is hereby repealed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In his last observations on Friday, the Minister hinted to the Dáil, in unmistakable terms, that he would resist this amendment&mdash;or at any rate, part of it.  That came as no shock or thunderbolt to me.  I was aware of that in an indefinite way since the beginning of January.  The House is probably not aware that a year's experience of the working of the Act gave to some of those who were concerned in it practically new lights on certain aspects of it, and prompted them to suggest alterations.  Since the discussion on Friday I looked up my correspondence with the Ministry and I find that so early as the 4th November I was making representations as to the necessity for certain changes.  For example, here is a letter from the Department of Justice, dated 4th November, 1924.  It says, in part:&mdash;</P>
    <P>As regards your remarks concerning the need for censorship of posters displayed outside cinemas, I am to say that the Censorship of Films Act, 1923, does not make any provision for such censorship.</P>
    <P>Of course it did not.  That was the reason why the need for new legislation for the purpose was pointed out.  Then again, I have a later letter in November, which states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Justice to state that he has carefully <Col N="1813" /> considered recent representations made by you regarding the difficulties in connection with the working of the Censorship of Films Act, 1923. He is making arrangements for a draft amending Bill to be prepared for introduction in the near future.</P>
    <P>That is the present measure.</P>
    <P>The amending Bill will prescribe penalties for any breach of regulations,</P>
    <P>And then the letter concludes in this courteous fashion:</P>
    <P>The Minister would, however, be glad to receive any further observations you may care to offer on any points that may have occurred to you.</P>
    <P>On December 23rd&mdash;a most inopportune date&mdash;I wrote to the Minister:</P>
    <P>In regard to the amendments to be effected in the Censorship of Films Act by your proposed Amending Act, I should be glad to have an opportunity of putting you in possession of various matters that experience of the actual working of the Act has brought under our notice.  One thing especially I desire to emphasise&mdash;the number of the Board and its composition make it very difficult to comply with Section 3, sub-section (6):</P>
    <P>That is the section I propose in this amendment to repeal&mdash;</P>
    <P>namely&mdash;four members of the Appeal Board personally present, shall form a quorum for the hearing of appeals and the decision of the majority of the members present shall be the decision of the Appeal Board save</P>
    <P>I would ask the attention of the House to this exception:</P>
    <P>that whenever such majority is less than four or the members present are equally divided, the appeal shall be re-heard in the presence of not less than seven members of the Appeal Board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This was the difficulty with which the Chairman of the Appeal Board was confronted.  Members of the Dáil are probably not aware that under the regulations of the Department of Justice, when a renter has failed to <Col N="1814" /> receive a certificate for his film-picture from the censor, he is, within the meaning of the principal Act, an aggrieved person, and he notifies the Chairman of the Appeal Board that he proposes to appeal against the decision of the censor, and he thereupon lodges with the Chairman of the Board a fee of £5.  The Chairman then notifies the Secretary of the Appeal Board and, with his assistance, proceeds to try to get together a quorum within the requirements of sub-section (6).</P>
    <P>That is where the difficulty begins. It is certainly not where the difficulty ends.  There are nine members.  I do not think that on any occasion the nine were together.  They are all very busy people.  They have other occupations, and despite the fact that they are all, I presume, persons of public spirit and interested in serving the State, it is very difficult for them to reconcile their own professional obligations and to regulate their time to suit the special requirements of this situation.  I say &ldquo;the special requirements of this situation,&rdquo; because it not infrequently happens&mdash;not infrequently in proportion to the total number&mdash;that a film renter informs me that he desires to appeal, and begs of me to get the appeal heard at the earliest moment.  Believing that his film was irreproachable, spotless, he has already booked it.  Possibly the best I can do to get together a meeting of the Appeal Board is to have them to meet on Saturday.  That film is advertised to be displayed in a cinema on Monday and in some other place on Friday, let us say.  It is of the utmost concern to the renter of the film, and to the exhibitors, to get the appeal heard but how are they to be expedited?  The trouble all falls on the one member of the Board, the Chairman of the Board.  He is obliged to convene the meeting.</P>
    <P>I had better state, perhaps, who the members of the Appeal Board are, and then the House will realise this is a very natural difficulty.  First of all, there is a Catholic clergyman who, on the days that most of the others are free, is occupied with his religious duties.  He is in a very busy and a very difficult parish, Marlboro' Street. <Col N="1815" /> Then the other clergyman, Canon Drury, is a Professor of Theology in the Theological School in Trinity College, and for a large part of the academic year he has lectures on Saturday morning.  Then we have two professional men, doctors&mdash;Dr. Gogarty, and a member of this House, Dr. Myles Keogh.  During the forenoon they are completely occupied.  It is out of the question to hear the appeal then.  There are two representatives of the feminine judgment in these matters, Senator Mrs. Wyse-Power and Maire Ni Chinnéide.  There is also the Chairman.  Now, I notified the Minister to the effect that the number of the Board and its composition made it very difficult to comply with Section 3, Sub-Section (6).  On one occasion I waited from the hour appointed for the meeting&mdash;that is, 10.30 a.m.&mdash;to 1.30 p.m., and had to send away the film renter's representative, who was in despair, because he had the picture booked for a few days later.  I got each member of the Board to state which day of the week and which hour would suit best.  The result proves the impossibility of ever having the nine members together.  It simply could not be done.  The only remedy is either to increase the number of members of the Board or do away with this requirement.</P>
    <P>Observe how Sub-Section (6) works out.  We will suppose there are four members present.  They must be unanimous if there are only four.  If there are five members present, and one will not vote, or, as is sometimes the case, goes out to avoid the responsibility of voting, then the other four must vote the identical opinion.  Suppose there are seven present, and one of them will not vote, and that the six others are equally divided.  Again there is no decision.  The Chairman has no casting vote, naturally enough; he has sufficient responsibility without that.  Now, that is really how it works out.  I do not want to press the point that the Board is an unpaid Board, because I do not believe that has actually any appreciable effect upon the difficulty of getting a full meeting.</P>
    <P>But as I pointed out in dealing with <Col N="1816" /> the first amendment, it is a very responsible position.  It is worse; it is a thankless position.  I do not want to indicate any difference of opinion among the existing members, but we will suppose a case.  The principal Act very rightly gives no indication in specific terms as to what sort of film must of necessity be refused a certificate. In other countries there are such regulations.  I brought the Film Year Book of the United States several days during the time when the measure was on the Orders of the Day for Second Reading.  I had hoped to have an opportunity to show some of the very strict and very rigid requirements of Australia, Canada, Maryland, Virginia, Alabama, Oregon, etc.  But we in the Free State have what I believe is a much better method.  There are broad indications in the principal Act.  If the film, it says, &ldquo;is indecent, obscene, or blasphemous,&rdquo; and then each film is dealt with on its own merits both by the censor and later, if it comes before the Board of Appeal, by the members of the Board.  But the view generally entertained by the Board is that we have nothing whatever to do with vulgarity, as such, or with the artistic or inartistic character, as such, that we are merely to consider the probable effect of the exhibition of this picture to a general audience upon a miscellaneous set of spectators.  We conjecture as to what would be the probable effect in regard to morality, whether or not it would lower the standard of moral judgment or exhibit bad example, or whether it would be in any vague way subversive of public morality.</P>
    <P>We will suppose I hold the view that there are certain forms of vulgarity in what are known in the trade as the slap-stick type of comedy, and that by debasing the taste these inevitably affect the moral standards as well. Assume I take up that attitude, and another member of the Board says: &ldquo;No, this is only vulgar fooling; it is clowning, and it will please a very large number of audiences, especially of children; let it go.&rdquo;  Or again, another member of the Board says:&mdash;&ldquo;I object to this picture; there is a <Col N="1817" /> great deal of suffering exhibited in it, barbarity to animals or to women or children; it is hideous, it is horrible; I will not permit that.&rdquo;  Then another member of the Board contests that view, and says that that has nothing to do with morality, it is merely concerned in what is painful to the feelings, and so on.  We can well appreciate how long a discussion of that kind could occupy, and how difficult in the end it would be to get a unanimous verdict from four.  For the most part, at the end, when the real verdict comes to be pronounced, there are very rarely more than four present.  The differences of opinion are almost infinite in certain regards.  I could give actual cases of that, but I do not like to delay the House.  I feel that if I did give concrete examples, I could make a better case.</P>
    <P>I do not really care whether the Minister refuses to increase the number of the Board or not, provided that he will abolish this stricter requirement as regards re-hearing.  I purposely introduced new phraseology in the amendment, where I refer to a re-view, because the House will notice that in the principal Act what is spoken of is &ldquo;hearing an appeal.&rdquo;  Hearing an appeal is very easily understood in the case of a contention or dispute, either with regard to law or facts or both. But what is in question here is the seeing of a story, exhibited by means of photography&mdash;photographs of actors &mdash;and what is to be discussed is: should this picture be given a certificate entitling it to be exhibited in public? So what is absolutely requisite is that the members of the Appeal Board should see the picture and it is also necessary that they should see it at the same time.  Although that seems a petty point, in practice I can assure you it is not, because the speed at which the film is exhibited by the operator makes an important difference.  For instance, sometimes the censor or the Appeal Board will stipulate that as regards what is called the sub-title&mdash;that is the written matter&mdash;there is something in it which ought to go out.  Yet if much of the scene to which it belongs is not there and is not understood, the whole development of the story is unintelligible. <Col N="1818" /> What is agreed upon is that some of that acting situation shall be cut out and the reading matter shall be shown at a rapid speed&mdash;as a mere flicker.  I will return to that later, with your permission.</P>

      <P>The effect of the amendment would be to increase the number of the members of the Appeal Board from nine to twelve, and to diminish the quorum to three.  When the principal Act was first introduced the Appeal Board consisted of five members.  Largely on the representations of the Deputy that number was increased to nine, and we inserted a special provision to secure that in cases of doubt, a Board consisting of at least seven members would re-view the picture.  I quite understand that a difficulty has arisen from time to time in getting a sufficient number of members of the Board, but I doubt if the amendment will meet that situation. As a fact, there is this evil about a large Board.  Take a Board of twelve with a quorum of three, as suggested, and any kind of continuity of policy on the part of the Appeal Board goes, or can go, because you could have, for instance, in a given month four entirely different Boards, not one member of the entire Appeal Board having been present at more than one sitting in the month.  If it is difficult, as the Deputy tells us, to get a sufficient attendance from a board of nine, it is not going to be easier from a board of twelve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be prepared to consider a reduction of the quorum but not an increase in the membership of the Board.  I do not think any real solution or improvement lies in that direction. If it would meet the Deputy, say, to adopt half of his suggestion, that is a reduction of the quorum to three, and dispensing with re-hearing when there is a clear majority of three one way or the other, either in favour of or against <Col N="1819" /> exhibition of a film, possibly that would meet some of the difficulties experienced by the Board.</P>
    <P>The Deputy treated us to some historical matter, and read portions of correspondence which passed between himself, in his capacity as Chairman of the Appeal Board and my Department. He might have completed the history when he saw fit to begin it.  The Bill we are at present considering was in course of drafting in December last. Copies of the draft Bill were furnished to the Deputy on the 11th of that month.</P>

      <P>On the 23rd, as he states, he wrote and explained that he had had difficulty in getting seven members of the Appeal Board to be present for the re-hearing of an appeal. On the 2nd January he was written to and asked to make any suggestion he might care to offer either for a reduction of the quorum or to dispense with the necessity of re-hearing, where the majority for or against rejection was less than four.  I have no record of any reply to that communication, and really this amendment on the Report Stage of the Bill is the first indication of the Deputy's views that I have, or the first indication of the method by which he considers the administrative difficulties might be got over.  However, that is merely a matter of historical accuracy. If the Deputy thinks a reduction of the quorum to three, and dispensing with re-hearing where there is a clear majority of three, would meet the case, that is something I would be prepared to put in, and I will put it in in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied with that result, but I would like to stipulate that the wording of this, with regard to the quorum, should be adopted, because, as I was about to explain, there is special justification for these words: &ldquo;of whom three personally present together at a re-view of a film picture, shall form a quorum.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is one of the difficulties, and they are very many.  The Act stipulates <Col N="1820" /> that an aggrieved person, on payment of a fee, shall receive from the Censor a written statement of his reasons for rejecting the film.  Then it would appear that the aggrieved person is entitled to be present at what is called the hearing of the appeal.  What we have never been able to determine satisfactorily is: Is the renter&mdash;that is the technical term for the trade representative&mdash;who comes along and offers a film picture to those who either own or manage a cinema, and who want to exhibit it for profit&mdash;to be present at the deliberations of the Appeal Board? To make the thing as fair as possible, I have always insisted&mdash;and was in the beginning a minority, I may add, in holding this&mdash;that the renter must be present during the time the picture is being exhibited to the Appeal Board to be able to assure himself that the Board have seen the entire picture, and that it is being done justice to and that the Board are in a proper position to form an estimate of it, but when it came to be a question of debate amongst members themselves as to the reasons why they were in favour of or against the recommendation of a certificate, that he should not be present.</P>
    <P>On one occasion a film renter was present, and a humorous account of the cranky views, as they were alleged to be, of different members of the Board was the staple of conversation, I am informed, at the various hotel bars of the city.  I introduced the word &ldquo;re-view&rdquo; to stipulate that a member of the Appeal Board, along with his colleagues, shall see the entire picture and shall then deliberate with them, and that the verdict shall thus be arrived at.  Only in that way can we be in a position to know whether or not the renter's rights under the principal Act extend so far or not so far.</P>
    <P>As regards the history, the Minister is evidently not aware that I began making this series of recommendations by telephone.  I telephoned on two occasions and found that his secretary was absent, but the official with whom I dealt on the telephone was very good, listened to me very patiently and made a very careful note of what I said, so that the secretary was able to deal with it on his return.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1821" /> As regards the letter of December 23rd, of course, it was very thoughtless of me to send a letter on what was practically Christmas Eve, but I received a reply to it after the holidays. I do not wish to dwell on the character of the reply.  I had a personal interview afterwards with the writer, and explained to him that the dialectic point he was making against me was baseless, and that there was no inconsistency between the letter and the speech I made on the Second Reading of the original Bill, because in both cases I had stood for a large number of members on the Appeal Board in order to secure what is secured in a jury, that diversity of view and that variety of experience without which a verdict of that kind from laymen on matters of fact on decisions in regard to opinion, is not of the highest standard. My lack of reply, of which the Minister complains, is merely that it was not in writing; it was oral.</P>
    <P>I would not have dealt with this matter at all but for the fact that the Minister used as a powerful weapon against my amendment, the plea that he had been in consultation with the Censor, and that the Bill had been prepared in consultation with the Censor. I desire to bring out the fact that his Department had been in consultation also with members of the Board of Appeal.  However, as he is meeting me on the important point, I do not think it is of any value to indulge in a controversy on things which are more or less impertinent.  That out of a membership of twelve there should be a quorum of three would leave a loophole for want of continuity in policy, is, undoubtedly true; but the fact is, in practice, there would not be what the Minister anticipates.  Practically, it is the same membership of the Board of Appeal on every occasion, and it is the same people who are doing the work, so that if the Minister retains the membership of nine, but reduces the quorum and abolishes this re-hearing by seven members, I am perfectly satisfied to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I had better make sure that I am at one with the Deputy. My proposal is to reduce the quorum <Col N="1822" /> to three and to dispense with the re-hearing where there is a clear majority of three, either for or against the exhibition of a particular film.  The principal Act, sub-section (6), of section 3, provides that four members of the Appeal Board personally present, shall form a quorum for the hearing of appeals, and the decision of the majority of the members present shall be the decision of the Appeal Board, save that whenever such majority is less than four when the members present are equally divided, the appeal shall be re-heard in the presence of not less than seven members of the Appeal Board. My proposal is to reduce the quorum to three for the hearing of appeals, and lower down, in line 11, to make this amendment: &ldquo;Save wherever such majority is less than three or the members present are equally divided, the appeal shall be re-heard in the presence of not less than seven members of the Appeal Board.&rdquo;  Does the Deputy agree that the change from four to three, in line 11, is sufficient to meet his point of view, or does he want the total abolition of the re-hearing by seven?</P>

      <P>The situation occurred only once where it was deemed necessary to get a meeting of seven.  What I was obliged to do was this.  As Chairman, I saw the film with three others.  Then with two, and on another occasion with two others, so that seven had seen it and I was a sort of bond of union between them.  We discussed the film and, fortunately, the renter was satisfied with the decision so that no one raised any point as to whether that was strictly the letter of the law.  That is one of the requirements of the principal Act with which it is most difficult to comply.</P>

      <P>In page 3, section 4 (1), to delete from the word &ldquo;either,&rdquo; line 14, to the word &ldquo;or,&rdquo; line 15, inclusive, and in line 16, after the word &ldquo;informed&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;in writing.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>The person who displays a pictorial poster, etc., which has not been authorised will be technically guilty of an offence.  He may plead in defence that he was not aware of the fact, and then there would be an inquiry as to whether or not he knew.  I propose to put the onus on the film renter who supplies the pictorial advertisement, to make it necessary in letting out the <Col N="1824" /> film to the exhibitor, that he notifies the exhibitor in writing of the fact. Consequently, instead of there being a dispute as to whether on a certain occasion notice was given and received, the thing will be decided, and it may be decided in a court of law, as to whether or not a verbal or written notification was given.</P>

      <P>Amendments eight and nine would be safeguards to the interests of the exhibitors.  If they are adopted, every renter hiring a picture must give to the exhibitor a written guarantee that the official censor has not forbidden the exhibition on any poster of the exploitation sheet, other than those indicated.  I would like to have the opportunity, but I have not had the time up to the present, to consult the trade as to the effect of these two provisions, but I will undertake to do so before the Bill is taken in the Seanad, and probably, unless a very substantial case to the contrary is urged, I would have an amendment inserted on the lines of these two.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 6 the Minister is authorised to make regulations to do all or any of certain things.  I propose to add to the list as proposed in the amendment. In the principal Act, Section 12, it is laid down, that the Minister may by order make, vary, or revoke regulations carrying into effect the object of this Act, and in particular for regulating the conduct of the office of the <Col N="1825" /> official censor, to make all applications to him on the granting of certificates by him, and the bringing of appeals to the Appeal Board.  I desire to have regulations made by the Department of Justice, not merely to regulate the bringing of appeals, but the hearing of appeals.  I have already dealt with this incidentally.  I wish it to be clearly understood what procedure is to be followed.  On a re-view or appeal is the renter to be present personally or by representative; is he to hear the reasons discussed; is he to take part in the discussion; or is he to be a silent onlooker, or is he to be called on to withdraw?  In other words, we want the situation set out clearly and authoritatively.</P>

      <P>I have not quite seen the effect of the Deputy's amendment. I do not understand by it that he wants regulations made actually laying down the procedure of the Board as to its decisions, whom they would admit on the hearing of the appeal, and whether or not the persons so admitted would be entitled to express their views, or to defend the renter or agent, or whether the agent or renter would be permitted to defend a particular picture.  If the Deputy considers that is necessary, or if his experience shows him it is necessary, it is something, of course, we would be bound to take notice of, but I would like an opportunity of looking into the Bill to see whether, in fact, the amendment is necessary, and to see whether we have not got the power of making regulations to cover points of that kind.  If the draughtsman, or the Attorney-General, considers that, for the giving of such powers, this amendment would be necessary, I will undertake to insert it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I would direct attention particularly to Section 8, of the principal Act, &ldquo;Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Official Censor refusing to grant a certificate&rdquo;&mdash;and so on.  (2) &ldquo;When notice of appeal under this section has been given the Official Censor shall furnish his reasons in writing to the Appeal Board for the decision appealed against.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1826" /> There is part of the procedure laid out specifically in the original Act&mdash;&ldquo;and shall furnish, on payment of the prescribed fees, copies of such reasons to every person who is entitled to appear and be heard at the hearing of such appeals.&rdquo;  Who is entitled to appear and be heard?  I have always contended that the hirer, the film renter, who has appealed against the Censor's decision, is entitled to be present at our sitting as an Appeal Board, to discuss the Censor's reasons with us and to discuss our reasons in turn, but, so far as I am aware, I am alone in that interpretation.  Yet the words of the section which I have just read would point to that as the intention of the Act&mdash;&ldquo;copies of such reasons to every person who is entitled to appear and be heard at the hearing of such appeal.&rdquo; Section 12 of the original Act deals with the making of regulations, and you have in sub-section</P>
    <P>(1)  &ldquo;The Minister for Home Affairs may, by order, from time to time, make, and when made vary and revoke regulations for carrying into effect the objects of this Act, and in particular for regulating the conduct of the office of the Official Censor, the making of applications through him, the granting of certificates by him, and the bringing of appeals to the Appeal Board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am willing to admit that possibly the Minister has the power in the first part of that sub-section, namely, &ldquo;to make regulations for carrying into effect the objects of the Act.&rdquo;  But, inasmuch as the sub-section goes on to name the particular steps and stages of a process, it is in the interests of exhaustiveness of enumeration and to prevent discussion that I propose to add to the list prescribing the methods of procedure.  That sub-section that I read will make it clear to the Minister why I am returning so frequently to the point that the words used are &ldquo;hearing an appeal.&rdquo;  I submit that it is not hearing an appeal unless the reasons are discussed.  Some members of the Board of Appeal do not desire to be aware of the Censor's reason for rejecting a picture, so that they may approach it, as they say, dispassionately. Yet the requirements of the Act <Col N="1827" /> would seem to be that they must be aware of the reasons, and they are to keep these reasons in mind when viewing the picture so as to determine the worth or otherwise of these criticisms of the Censor.  It will save a great deal of trouble, and remove, perhaps, opportunities of friction&mdash;not that friction has occurred&mdash;if the Minister were to add to his other regulations not merely that the appellant is to pay a fee of £5, and so on, but that the appellant shall, if he desires it, be entitled to be present, and to canvas the reasons, and so on.</P>

      <P>As I say, if the draftsman, and possibly the Attorney-General, if the point is of sufficient importance to refer it to him, consider that they have not in Section 12 of the principal Act, power to make such regulations as the Deputy indicates, I will ask to have the amendment inserted in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3 to insert before section 7 a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Censor shall have authority in any case where he deems it advisable in the public interest to impose conditions on the exhibitor as to the circumstances under which the film picture shall be exhibited for which his certificate is sought and where such conditions so imposed are not accepted, or if accepted are not actually observed, the Censor shall be at liberty to withdraw his certificate.</P>
      <P>(2)  An appeal shall be permitted from the imposition of such conditions, or any of them, on the same terms as an appeal in the ordinary way from a decision of the Censor.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of these amendments are dictated by the desire to bring under the notice of the Minister and of the House the flaws, the shortcomings, that experience has revealed in the principal Act, and to try to arrive at some remedy, not necessarily the remedy as indicated in the amendment.  Anyone who is superficially acquainted with the original Act would hastily conclude <Col N="1828" /> that my proposed new section is unnecessary. It would appear that all the power that it proposes to give to the Censor is already given, either through Section 6 or through Section 7 of the principal Act, so that to make my intention clear I will argue against my own amendment to that effect, bringing out all the powers that are embodied in Sections 6 and 7.  There are two types of certificates which, under the Act, the Censor is permitted to issue.  One is a general certificate and the other is a limited certificate, and these words are well understood in other countries, particularly in Great Britain.  Elsewhere there are theatres for film picture exhibitions which are restricted to adults, to people above a certain age, or are open at certain hours, and a certificate may be granted entitling the exhibitor to show a picture to such an audience under these requirements, while a general certificate is refused for the same films.  That is a practice followed in Great Britain: it has not been followed here.  There is no cinema, so far as we are aware, which is reserved exclusively for children, though undoubtedly education and the public necessity could very well be served if such a thing were provided.  The Censor, I believe,&mdash;I hope I do not misrepresent him&mdash;and some of my colleagues on the Board of Appeal, believe that if it became known that a restricted certificate had been granted to a film it would advertise it and that the queues waiting for admission to the house would require the whole Gárda to regulate them.  That is the opinion; at any rate, so far, this distinction has not been drawn between a limited and a general certificate. In Section 7, sub-section (3), these words occur: &ldquo;If the Official Censor is of opinion that any picture in respect of which an application is made to him under this section is not fit for general exhibition in public&rdquo;&mdash;there the essential word is &ldquo;general&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;but is fit for exhibition in public in certain places in Saorstát Eireann or under special conditions&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;or under special conditions,&rdquo; the words which I appear to have echoed in my proposition&mdash;&ldquo;or in the presence of certain classes of persons, he shall grant a certificate that <Col N="1829" /> such picture is fit for exhibition in public subject to such restrictions and conditions (which shall be expressed on the certificate) in regard to the places at which or the special conditions under which the picture may be exhibited or the classes of persons who may be admitted to an exhibition of the picture as in the opinion of the Official Censor are necessary to prevent the exhibition of the picture in public being subversive of public morality.&rdquo;  That authorises him to lay down conditions and restrictions as conditions precedent to his issuing a certificate, not for general exhibition, but for limited exhibition.</P>
    <P>Section 6, sub-section (1) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>No picture nor any part of a picture in respect of which the Official Censor has granted a limited certificate shall be exhibited in public by means of a cinematograph or similar apparatus at any place not authorised by such certificate or under any conditions inconsistent with the special conditions specified in such limited certificate or in the presence of any person who is not a member of the class in whose presence such picture is by such certificate authorised to be exhibited.</P>
    <P>It might seem that those two sections and their respective sub-sections give all the power to the Censor that I seek to confer on him by the amendment. What is in view in the amendment, however, is this situation, that the Censor will grant a general certificate, that is, one authorising exhibition in the usual places to the usual miscellaneous audiences at the ordinary times of exhibition.  But it prescribes as part of the price for this that both the renter and the exhibitor shall give him a written undertaking that requirements that he lays down will be met.  I have a specific case before me. A great deal of money has been put into the production of pictures of late which do for audiences to-day with the help of photography what was done in the middle ages by the monks, by way of educating the public in Bible History or in stories of men who figured largely in the history of the Jewish and the Christian religions.  These <Col N="1830" /> pictures may be fit for exhibition to an audience composed of children, youths, adults, all kinds.  But suppose it is felt, either by the Censor, or later by the Board of Appeal, that such a picture is not conducive to reverence and in that way it would be productive of ill-results if it were to be shown and the audience smokes and is treated to light music, or perhaps another part of the programme at the same sitting is one of these slapstick comedies, these vulgar atrocities to which I have already alluded, the Censor should be at liberty to say:&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, I grant you a certificate for this, but you give your undertaking in writing that what I specify you will comply with.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Censor has no such authority at present; all he can do is to grant a limited certificate, and there is, as I have indicated, this objection in practice to the granting of a limited certificate, that it may be prurient in its suggestion for some unhappily-minded people who will think that there is something in it that will give them a sensation or a thrill, and accordingly the granting of a limited certificate would be rather in the nature of an advertisement, defeating its own purpose.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made clear that what is in view is that the Censor should have authority to give a certificate for general exhibition without its being stated either on the front or the back of the certificate that that shall be accompanied with the undertaking that the requirements set out by the Censor will be met, and if they are not met, that the Censor will be at liberty to withdraw his certificate.  As I put it before, this is the price of the grant of the concession.  A little while ago a renter brought along a sacred picture. When I heard the title, and he approached me about the matter, I said to him, &ldquo;I am afraid there is a general prejudice not merely amongst the public but amongst ourselves, members of the Board of Appeal, against the exhibition of such a thing.&rdquo;  Will you guarantee that during its exhibition there will be no smoking, waltz music, or jazz?  I have had the experience of seeing Dante's &ldquo;Inferno&rdquo; exhibited in <Col N="1831" /> the Camden Street Picture House and followed by the &ldquo;Merry Widow.&rdquo;  It would be possible to have miracle plays and mystery plays followed by some stuff of the same kind, so that the audience would get the impression that they were all modes of entertainment, exactly like the child's idea who, when he is disillusioned about Santa Claus, frequently comes to the conclusion that all he has heard about the good Lord Jesus is exactly of the same kind, that they are stories told to him by his mother in his childhood, and are frauds and delusions.  It would be necessary, if the Censor thought it desirable, to have pictures of a sacred character exhibited. It should be possible to exact that this picture should be exhibited by itself, with all due reverence, and that it should be treated not as an amusing thing, a mere entertainment or a pastime, but as something educative, instructive, or even edifying.  I suggest that the powers sought for in amendment 11 are not in Section 6 and Section 7, and yet it is desirable that the Censor should have them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the case Deputy Magennis made on this matter might be acceptable, but I can see possibilities in the other direction, and unless one has the view that the Censorship is desirable in itself, in any circumstances not, as it is in my view, rather something which we must utilise because of danger that we realise, unfortunately, is present.  Unless one had the former view, that a censorship was good in itself, I think there is a danger in allowing the Censor to use his authority in such a way as is suggested in this amendment.  It may be in the principal Act, which the Deputy has read, that the Censor has very great powers, but I surmise in this amendment we are going to give him powers not merely to segregate the religious sacred picture from jazz and the &ldquo;Merry Widow,&rdquo; but to segregate the &ldquo;Merry Widow&rdquo; and such-like, and to make it a condition that nothing else but that kind of thing shall appear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other possibilities that a censor will not have good judgment, will not be a guardian of public <Col N="1832" /> liberty, or will not have due regard to certain individual freedoms.  If you give him this power to impose conditions as to circumstances under which the film shall be exhibited, etc., general conditions regarding the character of the picture, I am inclined to think it is possible it will be abused, not merely possible, but it is rather suggesting that he may exercise powers which have not yet been enacted in the principal Act as desirable.  I think we ought to be careful not to hand over to the Censor too great power in such a matter as this.  I would like the Deputy to make a better case for it, than he has done before I can support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is rather too subtle for me, not that I did not try very hard to follow the Deputy's explanation of the way in which it differs, say, from sub-section (3) of Section 7 of the principal Act. I submit that that difference is too fine a hair to split in legislation for the purposes of an Act which, after all, has to be administered and understood by many people who have not Deputy Magennis's capacity for the finer shades.  Sub-section (3) of Section 7 of the principal Act reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;if the Official Censor is of opinion that any picture in respect of which an application is made to him under this section is not fit for general exhibition in public but is fit for exhibition in public in certain places in Saorstát Eireann or under special conditions or in the presence of certain classes of persons he shall grant a certificate that such picture is fit exhibition in public subject to such restrictions and conditions (which shall be expressed in the certificate) in regard to the places at which or the special conditions under which the picture may be exhibited or the classes of persons who may be admitted to an exhibition of the picture as in the opinion of the Official Censor are necessary to prevent the exhibition of the picture in public being subversive of public morality.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Deputy stated that he shared the opinion that certain <Col N="1833" /> of his colleagues on the Appeal Board held, that is, they considered that a limitation, or restriction, or condition expressed on the face of a certificate would be in effect an advertisement of the picture.  That, unfortunately, may be true to some degree and as an alternative the Deputy suggests that the Censor should be allowed, as it were, to impose secret conditions that will not appear on a certificate, conditions known to himself and the exhibitor and unknown to the public and that in the event of a breach of such conditions it shall be open to the Censor to withdraw his certificate.  An Act may be very finely drafted but it is the administration of it which matters, and if you insert in legislation fine-spun, subtle distinctions of this kind it is necessary to go a step further and see how they work out in practice and in administration.  In practice, I, as a prospective exhibitor, come along to the office of the Official Censor in Molesworth Street and show him a picture.</P>
    <P>He says:&mdash;&ldquo;That is a very fine picture, but from the nature of it I would object to its appearing sandwiched between some of those other pictures to which Deputy Magennis has made reference, and if you so treat it, I will cancel my certificate, or, let us say, if you allow smoking in your picture house, I will cancel my certificate, or if there is anything in the behaviour of the audience in the picture house where it is exhibited that may cause me to regret having allowed this picture for public exhibition, I will reconsider my decision.&rdquo;  But, who are to be the eyes and ears of the censor? Who is going to administer this Act for the censor in Dungarvan, Cork, Galway, and in all the towns through the country.  If it is said that the censor, like other people, must work through the agents of the Government, through the Gárda Síochána, then they must know the conditions, but the conditions will not appear upon the certificate. The condition is something that has been imposed in Molesworth Street, Dublin, as between the censor and the exhibitor, and I submit that the amendment would be impossible of administration, because you cannot <Col N="1834" /> have emissaries in every picture house in the country seeing whether the conditions the Censor imposes on the face of the certificate are, or are not, observed. I hope I have done justice to the amendment, and that I have not misunderstood the Deputy's advocacy of it.  My objection to the amendment is, that if it were incorporated in the Bill it would be impossible of administration in practice, and that is a serious objection to any amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>My attitude to the amendment is indicated sufficiently, I think, when I say that like the Minister I, too, regard the distinction between it and Section 7, sub-section (3), and Section 6, sub-section (1) of the principal Act as rather fine.  It is open to that objection.  The question however, is, is this refinement necessary, and on that plea also there is the further question which I am very grateful to the Minister for raising in connection with this matter, namely, the feasibility of working it.  Now, I will give you some instances of what can happen.  In the discussion of the proposal to regulate the exhibition of pictures that were in the nature of photographic enlargements from the original negative from which the film picture was printed, we had occasion to take note of what in the trade are called &ldquo;stills.&rdquo;  When a picture is exhibited&mdash;I take it for granted, by the way, that members of the Dáil are aware of this&mdash;it takes so many feet of the actual film picture to produce one visual impression of a scene.  For instance, there is a provision in the Act that the certificate of the Censor should be pre-fixed to every film picture, and its visibility depends on not having less than 15 feet of the film devoted to it. Otherwise it will not be read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in the case of the Censor or the Appeal Board, they can prescribe that portions of certain pictures shall be cut, that part of the development of the scene is to be eliminated, but that the opening of it may be flashed.  What is permitted is what is called a flicker, just enough to suggest to the imagination of the spectators that something is about to happen, but that he is to be given no opportunity of dwelling upon <Col N="1835" /> it.  The incident is not shown to him actually in detail.  Now, it is possible to make a &ldquo;still&rdquo; or a photograph from the portion of the negative that is permitted to be shown in the filmed picture, and it is then that the effect of the picture becomes wholly different, because in the picture-house, when it is shown, it is merely observed in the thousandth part of a second, whereas in the other case it is prominently on view in a frame outside the cinema, so that any member of the public can stand and gaze at it so long as he is so disposed.</P>
    <P>The Censor may say, &ldquo;Remember, I am granting you a certificate for this picture, but such and such things are to be cut, and only the flicker is to be shown.  I stipulate now that, in the provision of &lsquo;stills,&rsquo; you act in accordance with the spirit of that reservation.&rdquo; What I have mentioned just now is an actual case.  I saw the other day in a beautiful film, a masterpiece of photography and of admirable acting, a &ldquo;still&rdquo; outside one of the Dublin houses, and I recognised in it a scene which we had cut out.  I went to the Censor's office and made inquiries. I found that it was printed from the first portion of the rejected scene, but there is no power in the present Bill to deal with an exhibitor who, in doing that, was quite within his legal rights.</P>
    <P>In another case we stipulated that a certain film, quasi-historical, should be permitted exhibition provided that the introductory original matter was expunged and new matter introduced which we prescribed.  The producer and the exhibitor consented to those terms, and the result was a picture the whole spirit and interest of which was completely altered, and the effect of which upon the public was one which we calculated would be wholesome, whereas with the original introductory matter, and without our substituted matter, it would have been objectionable.  Now, I discovered a little later that the purpose of these excisions and alterations was defeated by the production in the picture-house of a spoken prologue.  There was a man dressed in costume as the chief agent in the story.  He explained the picture, and read back into it what <Col N="1836" /> had been cut out from it.  I draw the attention of the Minister to that.  Of course the Minister is quite well aware, as we are all well aware, that there is no censorship over theatres, over the drama, over recitations, or over anything in the nature of dramatic action except it is photographically rendered. Consequently, there is no power to deal with such a case as I have just referred to, but the Censor could very easily prevent it by stipulating that there should be no such thing as spoken prologues.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I had in view.  It is with respect to printed advertisements as distinct from pictorial advertisements.  More than once a picture has been given a new character by the &ldquo;cuts.&rdquo;  It has been reconstructed in fact; it has come before the Censor as a new picture, and has got a certificate although, originally, without its reconstruction and without the alterations prescribed, it was universally rejected.</P>
    <P>Now, what happens?  The bowdlerised and acceptable version of the film is shown, the advertising paragraphs called technically &ldquo;teaser&rdquo; and &ldquo;punch&rdquo; paragraphs are provided to the newspapers, and appear in the newspapers. Then the audience is aware, on reading the paragraphs, of the particular point at which it was cut, and, therefore, out of their imagination they are able to reconstruct the original objectionable picture.  By the present Bill there is no power to deal with that, and will not be unless this amendment is accepted.  The Censor is able to prescribe that if it comes to his knowledge that these practices are indulged in, he will withdraw his certificate. I quite agree with the Minister that the carrying out of this regulation would be very difficult, but the same criticism applies to his own amending Bill with regard to pictorial advertisements, for who is to inform the Censor, in his office in Dublin, that, at Ballymaglunnin, a poster is on exhibition not authorised by him?  That would be work for the local Gárda; so would this.  I quite admit, however, that in the case of a poster it is easier than it is in this case, but I would like to say, after all this criticism I <Col N="1837" /> have been making for two days, the trade in this matter, in Dublin, especially, is really now educated to this method and would not attempt to evade these requirements.  What I am stipulating for is what I know the trade would not object to.  They would enter into this undertaking and honourably observe it.  As a matter of fact, the difference between the picture-houses, since the censorship was set up, is very remarkable.  That is one of the reasons I paid tribute to the original Bill the other day.  Some members of the Appeal Board only see the type of film that the Censor has rejected, because they are not film frequenters.  Others, to keep their eye in, so as not to be prejudiced, do frequent picture-houses when the opportunity presents itself.  They go there to see for themselves, and to get a fairer view.  I myself have made it a practice to go to picture-houses when leisure allows, and see the general tenor of them, and I am aware that the level of pictures shown in Dublin cinemas is very much better in quality and in character than it used to be formerly.  During the Easter holidays I was in Bristol, and I noticed that in three cinemas drawing huge audiences films were exhibited that were rejected in Dublin.  The picture-houses are very clean in Dublin, and I am endeavouring to show that the exhibitors here are as keen as the Minister or the Censor in keeping them so, and this amendment that I am stipulating for is to arm the Censor with an opportunity that he has not got now of allowing films to come before the public that otherwise technically he would be obliged to refuse a certificate to.</P>

      <P>I feel in this matter we have to guard ourselves against the possibility of giving to the Censor powers, by excision, and imposing conditions, to create propaganda of his own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this matter, generally, we are thinking of the prevention of indecency, but there are other possibilities such as imposing conditions on renters and exhibitors which would have the effect of giving a propaganda value to certain <Col N="1838" /> pictures, on a certain side, and I would urge the Minister to be a little bit careful and have this consideration in mind: that, while it is desirable and necessary to guard against indecency and blasphemy, we do not desire to put into the hands of the Censor or the Board of Appeal power to create its own propaganda through films by imposing conditions so as to change to what is another current of propaganda. I can imagine that if the Censor has the powers that this amendment suggests it might place in his hands an instrument not to be the guardian of public morals but the creator of a current of propaganda in a particular direction.  I would also draw the attention of the Minister to a particular fact that has come under my own notice.  I cannot explain it, but I notice that the certificate spoken of as being an indication to the public that possible conditions have been imposed on the exhibitor by the Censor have to be exhibited on the film, but the only certificates now shown are flashed away in the thousand part of a second and no one has time to see the certificate or read it.  You know it is there but you cannot see it, or read it, and for some reason or other, the certificates are exhibited for a much shorter period than the old ones that used to be signed by T. P. O'Connor.  That is a consideration which I hope the Minister will take note of.</P>

    <P>There is no limit in the resolution, or in the Bill, as to the contributions that may be made from the Exchequer in the carrying out of any particular scheme of drainage.  That is a matter that will be decided in each particular instance, and it will in every instance come before the Dáil by way, either of a supplementary estimate, or will appear in the annual Estimates, unless the scheme were to be a very small one indeed, and might be covered by some general heading in a provision for minor drainage works.</P>
    <P>It is provided that only two-thirds of the expenses incurred in connection with any scheme not fully carried out, shall be defrayed by the Commissioners of Public Works.  As the Parliamentary Secretary explained, the purpose of that is to ensure there will be some scrutiny of schemes by the county councils, and that we will not have bogus schemes, or schemes that are not worth any consideration, sent forward, with the consequent expense of inquiring into and examining them being cast upon the central authorities.</P>

      <P>I want just to put in a word here on behalf of the future. I would not like it to be thought that the Financial Motion would be used, or that at least opportunities would be taken, to restrict the discussion of any part of the Bill, or anything brought up in the Bill.  It is very important that we should safeguard the right of Deputies to discuss anything that arises out of a Bill on a Financial Motion.  While I do not want to do it, I would like to utter a word of warning, and for Deputy Conlan's sake I would point out that unless there is something in the amendments which would enable him to discuss the point, he ought to take advantage of the present occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. CONLAN Mr. CONLAN">

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is very important, and it would not be right that we should let the Minister for Finance off so easily as that, without making him clearly understand that we first want to know his intention in moving this Financial Resolution, and <Col N="1842" /> whether his intention is to cover the drainage of land and of bogs.  There are hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of acres now coming under the control of the Land Commission, and what is in Deputy Conlan's mind, and in the minds of the other Deputies is, will money be provided by the Minister for Finance for the drainage of these bogs that are the property of the Land Commission and that presently may pass over into the hands of the tenants, or are they left out of consideration altogether in the measure?  That is the point I want to raise on the discussion now, because if the Minister is not moving for enough money to do that work, we would like to urge upon him the necessity for allocating a sufficient amount in that direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The measure provides for certain machinery by which drainage can be perfected, and the Minister knows it is necessary that six rated occupiers are to petition the county council to get the scheme through.  There is no such thing as that in the case of a bog.  You could not get six rated occupiers in a bog. That is the point Deputy Conlan wants to get settled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. CONLAN Mr. CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very well known to everybody with a knowledge of the country that the people who use the bog do not live in the bog or on the bog.  They live outside of it, and they are not rated for the bog at all. Therefore they cannot pose as rated occupiers of land proposed to be improved. Hitherto the drainage was attended to by the landlord, who derived certain rents from the setting of the turbary.  Now that it has gone out of the possession of the landlord, and in some cases it is vested in the Land Commission, or is about to be vested in the Land Commission, there is nobody to attend to this work, with <Col N="1843" /> the result that some of these bogs, one or two of which I have personal knowledge of, are nearly inaccessible to the people who use the bog.  That is what I want to remedy.  I want some machinery set up by which the drainage would be effected and maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not really know what the position is about the rating of people in connection with certain bogs.  There are bogs for which people are rated.  There may be bogs in connection with which the people who use them are not rated.  In any case this Money Resolution puts no difficulties in the way of dealing with the matter. If it is necessary to set up machinery, or to make some special provision that is not in the Bill, to enable drainage of bogs to be carried out, that provision can be inserted.  This is to make provision for the drainage and improvement of land and it authorises the payment of monies in connection with that work.  What may not be provided for is the setting of the machinery in motion in connection with certain lands, such as those with which the Deputy has dealt.  There is nothing in this Resolution to prevent the Bill being amended, and the necessary machinery provided.  When we contemplate the provision of money out of the Exchequer to assist the drainage of land, we have in mind the making of arable land or the prevention by drainage of damage to land. We have not contemplated, nor do we contemplate, the giving of an Exchequer grant for the purpose of enabling the drainage of bogs to be carried out; but the machinery can be put into the Bill to enable the work to be carried out.  This work may well be done at the expense of the people who benefit.</P>

      <P>Does not the Minister recognise that that will involve an alteration of the wording of Section 2, which reads: &ldquo;Any six or more persons being rated-occupiers of lands which are liable to be flooded,&rdquo; and so on?  What I maintain is, that you cannot get six rated-occupiers to apply to the county council for the improvement of this land, because a bog is land, and, therefore, the wording of Section <Col N="1844" /> 2 will have to be altered, or something will have to be added, bringing in machinery for the purpose of effecting drainage.</P>

    <P>(1)  Any six or more persons being rated occupiers of lands which are liable to be flooded or injured by water or which are capable of being improved by drainage may apply to the council of the county or to the respective councils of the several counties in which such lands are situate to have drainage works executed for the purpose of draining or improving such lands and to have such lands, either together with or without other lands in the neighbourhood thereof, constituted to be a separate drainage district.</P>
    <P>(2)  Every application to the council of a county under this section shall be made by petition presented to the council and every such petition shall be in writing in such form as shall be prescribed by the Commissioners and shall state in general terms the drainage works which it is thereby proposed should be executed and shall have annexed thereto a map showing the lands thereby proposed to be constituted a separate drainage district.</P>

If six rated-occupiers desire to lodge a petition with the county council to have a drainage scheme carried out, they can do that on a sheet of ordinary notepaper. My opinion is that this sub-section will cause delay.  The getting out of these forms by the Commissioners, sending them down to the secretaries of the county councils, and then having petitioners writing in sometimes thirty or forty miles from the extreme end of the county, in order to get these forms, will mean long delays.  An ordinary sheet of notepaper would do as well.  The names of the six rated-occupiers who want the scheme brought into operation could be written on a sheet of ordinary notepaper. It is merely to notify the council that they want to have a drainage scheme originated in their district, and they request the council to take action. I presume that is all it will contain.  I cannot see any necessity for getting out standard forms, for sending them out to councils, and for causing the unnecessary delay that would be occasioned by such a procedure.  I suggest all that is not required.</P>

      <P>Deputy Baxter's purpose in moving the amendment is to gain time.  That is one of the principal purposes he has in mind. Our principal intention in having this precise form is to save time.  We think that if you have a prescribed form ready, with only the blanks to be filled in, and if it can be got from the Board of Works by merely writing for it, it will save a lot of time.  The people <Col N="1846" /> who intend to put forward a scheme will know immediately on receiving those forms what kind of information will be required if they read the particulars relating to the blanks that will have to be filled in.  Though the scheme is only described in general terms, still there is a certain amount of information that will have to be given to the county council.  If the people rely on their own initiative, it is quite possible and likely that they may omit information that might be necessary, through pure chance, and they will have to be asked again to give that information, thereby causing delay.  There is another advantage and that is that by sending for forms of this kind, when they want them for the purpose of promoting a scheme in a certain district, it will be an early intimation to the Commissioners that such a scheme is in contemplation, and that is no drawback.  The expense, of course, is practically nil.  They will be printed forms, with blanks, and all that is required is that the people interested in the scheme should fill the blanks.  If the Deputy considers it, taking ordinary human nature as it is, I think he will agree that the plan of having printed forms will probably in the long run save more time than if you had not them.  That is why we did suggest definite forms of this kind.</P>

    <P>(a)  approving of the proposals contained in the petition, and</P>
    <P>(b)  requesting the Commissioners to examine such proposals and to consider whether a drainage scheme should be prepared and a separate drainage district constituted to give effect to such proposals, and</P>

      <P>I move amendment 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 49, page 2, after the word &ldquo;surveyor&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or other qualified engineer.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience of conditions in the counties leads me to believe that it is not possible to take a county surveyor or assistant surveyor off his present work and send him to make inspection of areas where drainage schemes are contemplated.  I see the Minister for Local Government and Public Health beside the Parliamentary Secretary, and I would like to hear his views as to the condition of our roads.  How much of the responsibility for that can be laid on the shoulders of our county surveyors and assistant surveyors, I am not going to say.  I think it will be generally agreed that there is more than enough work for county surveyors and assistant surveyors at present.  We hope that there will be even more work for them to do on our roads in future. If there is much additional constructional work or much more money spent on the roads, I do not think we could afford to take these officials away for one day from road work.  If they are away for a day or a week, there are bound to be complications.  Somebody will have to be put in charge of their work.  If it is a case that the county surveyor will have to bring in a man to do his work, or get one of his assistants to do it, it will not be done well, and the county councils will be in difficulties. We will have strikes here and there, and there will be a lot of complications that will not make for the efficiency of our road administration. As I know the conditions of my own county, the section will be absolutely unworkable.  We will have so many areas calling for visits by the county surveyor or his assistant, that the work <Col N="1853" /> in this connection will occupy weeks, when the preparation of reports is taken into consideration.  Then we do not know how many further visits, after the preliminary visit, will have to be undertaken.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to give power in the Bill to a county council, where necessary, to appoint a qualified engineer to do this work.  As the section stands, the county council are, as far as I can see, tied to their county surveyor or his assistant.  If, on the other hand, the county surveyor has to call in an assistant to do this work he must, in some form or other, supervise the work of this assistant.  Reports must be made to him, and the assistant must be given directions as to where he is to go.  That is going to put additional work on the county surveyor, and that additional work will handicap him in carrying out the work which is his present responsibility. I suggest that the county surveyor should not be handicapped in his effort to improve the standard of our roads.  That will be done if the county councils are not given power to appoint a qualified engineer, leaving the county surveyor to continue his own work.  Let this drainage work be done outside the county council and by another man, where the conditions in a county demand that it should so be done.  I move the amendment.</P>

      <P>We were rather desirous that the county surveyor should have the responsibility for any drainage schemes under this Bill in the county.  We were of opinion &mdash;I am not saying that the opinion is absolutely wrong&mdash;that even in the Bill as it stands the county council has the power that Deputy Baxter now suggests.  However, it is a matter that is open to doubt.  Reading the section in the ordinary way, it might seem as if they were excluded from exercising such a power as Deputy Baxter suggests.  On the whole, I am inclined to accept the idea in the amendment, but it involves, of course, the appointment of an official of the county council for this particular purpose, and possibly some slight changes might be necessary in the wording of the amendment, <Col N="1854" /> so as to provide for the sanction of the Minister for Local Government being necessary.  I would agree to bring forward an amendment containing the idea in this amendment, but modified, more or less, along the lines I now suggest.</P>

      <P>At the end of the section to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If, on examination of a petition presented to a county council, the council decide against the petition, the petitioners shall have the right to appeal to the Commissioners for an examination of such petition.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously an injustice might be done in originating a drainage scheme in some counties, for a particular district <Col N="1855" /> that might not be particularly well represented on the council.  A decision has to be come to as to whether that ought to be accepted or not, and there is a decision at the same time as to whether certain money might be made available out of the county funds for the carrying through of that scheme. Such a proposition would not, perhaps, be sympathetically received by the council if the district concerned was not very well represented on the council. Prejudices that we cannot very well foresee might be responsible for turning down a scheme that would have reason and justice behind it.  I am asking that where a petition is presented to the council and a decision taken against that petition by the county council, the petitioners should have the right of appeal to the Commissioners. We know that, unfortunately, it is true that when some parties are seeking something that is to benefit them, seeking it at what perhaps may seem a temporary cost to certain other bodies of ratepayers, those who have nothing to gain from the benefits accruing from that scheme, will not receive a petition of that kind very sympathetically.  A remote district in a county may suffer in such circumstances, and I think that they have a right to be heard where such a situation would arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather sorry to see this distrust of local bodies coming at this particular stage after such lengthy discussions on the Local Government Bill.  If the amendment is inserted, you might as well eliminate the county council as the preliminary body under the scheme.  If you give a right to every petitioner or to every set of petitioners to appeal to the Commissioners from the decision of the county councils, that practically means an appeal in every case.  Therefore, the advantage gained by having the county council acting as a body that could give an opinion on the general merits or the general outlines of the scheme, and deciding that it was not absolutely absurd, would be immediately gone.  Every scheme would have to be practically <Col N="1856" /> investigated by the Central Department at a rather serious cost. Then, of course, there is a further grave disadvantage from another point of view, from the point in view, if I may say so, of fairness to the county council.</P>
      <P>They are being asked to undertake rather serious responsibility under this Bill in connection with schemes.  It would be hardly fair that after a scheme of this kind had been put before them and had been turned down by them it should be forced upon them whether they liked it or not and that they should be asked to administer it against their will and possibly with a certain amount of bad will.  Furthermore, I cannot quite follow the contention of the Deputy when he speaks about contributions from the county funds.  The contribution from the county funds will be altogether independent of this first step that the council takes. The mere fact that it lets the scheme through does not mean that it will have to subscribe a penny.  There might be some preliminary expenses, but they would be very slight.  Beyond that they are not committed to subscribing a penny.  They may contribute if they wish, but they need not, if they do not like.  The very most we could do in all fairness from the point of view of the proper working of the Bill and also from the point of view of the councils, would be to insert some proviso that if the county council rejects this scheme, it should send on an account of the scheme to the Department with the reasons for the rejection.  Beyond that I do not think we are prepared to go.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think such a thing as Deputy Baxter fears is not likely to arise, because, as the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out, the county council lets itself in for no expenditure by passing a resolution, except the scheme should be such as will be ultimately turned down by the Public Works Office.  In that case the county council will have to pay one-third of the costs incurred.  But if the scheme is reported on favourably by the county surveyor, I do not think it is likely that there would be rejection by the county council.  If the county surveyor reports favourably in any sort of definite terms, it may be assumed that the scheme is not one that is going to be rejected, and in that case the council has undertaken no liability.  On the other hand, if you oblige the Public Works Office to examine every scheme that six people can be found to father you will delay the carrying out of the work, because there is no doubt that some limits will be placed on the amount of staff that the Public Works Office will be given for carrying on this work.  They will not be given an unlimited number of engineers or other staff.  Some attempt will be made to restrict the staff.  If you put unnecessary work on them by allowing every &ldquo;dud&rdquo; scheme that anybody wants to promote to come up to the Board and force the Board to send a staff down to examine it, you are going to delay the real work.  In any case, if you have this provision, the county councils and the county surveyor will know at once whether a scheme is any good or has any possibilities, and you will strain out the bad schemes, and the good schemes will be sent to the Public Works Office.  The whole business of drainage will be carried on more rapidly.  But if there is an appeal all these schemes will come along and the work will be thrown on the Public Works Office.</P>

      <P>I believe this amendment should be accepted.  As <Col N="1858" /> one who has experience extending over a long period of the working of county councils, I know that there is a necessity for it.  We should have an appeal board in connection with such an important drainage scheme as this.  In order to avoid bogus appeals, I suggest that a fee should be paid by the parties wishing to appeal to the higher tribunal.  That would prevent the &ldquo;dud&rdquo; schemes that the Minister speaks about.  If you have a fairly high fee, those contemplating appealing will not pay such a fee if the scheme is not a sound one.  Local jealousies may arise in connection with such schemes, and for that reason there should be an appeal to a higher tribunal than the county council.</P>

If a drainage scheme only affects a little corner of a county it is not at all outside the bounds of possibility&mdash;rather the other way round, it is quite probable&mdash;that the majority of the county council, if they are full of the idea of false economy that both Farmer Deputies and Ministers preach sometimes, may say: &ldquo;We are not going to put ourselves to the burden of this possible charge upon the county at large for the sake of this little corner.&rdquo;  Thereby a very good scheme and a very necessary improvement to a locality may be lost, because the county council has not sufficient interest in the locality, but is going to be economical in the way that word is used, going to be mean in regard to expenditure over the whole county, because the scheme is not going to benefit the greater portion of the county but only a small portion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that a case has been <Col N="1860" /> made for the consideration of the claim of small drainage schemes by an authority which can bring some kind of pressure to bear upon the county councils.  If the county council is not really considering the interests of the locality primarily affected, then somebody has to be in a position to look after those interests, and as there is no provision for that, then the Minister or some other authority must be appealed to.  I think that a case has been made for the amendment.  It is not correct to suggest that it shows lack of confidence in the local authority.  It is because there is no local authority in respect to the particular interests concerned that somebody must be made to take charge of these interests as against the county council.  If the county council area is too large and the county council is not interested in local drainage schemes, then these drainage schemes may be unjustly dealt with.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to deal with this amendment to Section 3 in relation to Section 2.  I mentioned, when dealing with Section 2, that necessity could be shown for drainage where 500 or 600 acres are involved in the possession of five people, while a very small area of 30 or 40 acres in the possession of six people might receive attention.  Some of these applications might be turned down for technical reasons owing to the peculiar construction that the county council might put upon them.  Six or more persons may make an application, and some of these may only benefit to a small extent or may not benefit at all, but are simply put in to make up the number.  The necessity for an appeal board will be apparent to anybody.  It will certainly be apparent when the Act is working.  Do the six persons mentioned in Section 2 mean six persons living at a certain point near a river?</P>

      <P>I am assuming that in practically every scheme that comes before a county council, and that ought to go through the necessary resolution, will be passed.  I do not believe that the county councils are going to look on every scheme with prejudiced eyes.  This Bill is going to be passed, and will be the law for all county councils that will come into existence in future.  If six rated occupiers can lodge a petition with a county council they may not count for very much, and they may be living ten miles from a county councillor.  What would these six men count for with the county council?  Not even one of them might be known to a county councillor. There is also the possibility that one or two of these rated occupiers&mdash;big men we might say&mdash;might not be <i>persona grata</i> with certain members of the county council, and the county council might simply turn down the scheme. That would be manifestly unfair where there is a necessity for drainage.  Before <Col N="1863" /> this Bill goes through, the Dáil should make provision for dealing with an injustice of that kind, and should see that there was a right of appeal.  I want to be clear with Deputy Egan and to say that I believe the county councils will pass resolutions in favour of schemes that come up, but there is a possibility, which is known to Deputy Egan and to the Parliamentary Secretary, that the personnel of the councils may change.  We are not able to manage that.  I do not think that any extra work, or at least very little, will be imposed on the Board of Works.  I think that most of the schemes that will be put up will be passed, and that there will be very few appeals to the Commissioners.  I think, however, where there are good reasons for appealing, the work ought to be left over, say, for five years, as otherwise you are making it impossible for certain rated occupiers to be catered for under the Bill.</P>

      <P>Without being prejudiced against the point which Deputy Baxter raises, and without denying that there may be necessity for an appeal against both the county council and the Board of Works, it seems to me that Deputy Baxter's amendment will hardly provide sufficient machinery to deal with the point which he raises.  Take paragraph (c) of sub-section 3, and consider it from the point of view of the amendment. Suppose an appeal is made to the Board of Works and that the Board of Works accepts the appeal, is the Board of Works to compel the county council to undertake the expense in connection with the upkeep of the drainage scheme?  I suggest that this amendment will knock a fairly large hole in the Bill.  You are giving power to the Board of Works to override the county council.  It may be right to do that, but, if you do it, you should do it in set terms.  I notice that everybody who has spoken has almost invariably spoken about the county council rejecting schemes.

      <P>Yes, but a county council may turn down a scheme for all sorts of technical reasons, whereas a petition that such and such a river should be dealt with is a much simpler matter.  The likelihood of a county council turning down a petition is less than it would be in the case of a scheme.  I submit that you are introducing a good deal of confusion into the question if you talk about a scheme when you mean a petition. I suggest also, if you pass this amendment, and, unless you are very careful, you will be introducing a new element in the Bill, and you will not be doing it in the proper way.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Professor Tierney has read Section 13, for, if he did, I do not think that he would make the point which he tried to make.  In the case where a county council accept a petition there is no financial obligation on them.  They may contribute money for the construction of the scheme. The point he makes with regard to the appeal does not hold, or, at least, his argument is not consistent under that head.  I think that the Minister must recognise that some form of appeal ought to be given.  I think he has partly assented to that, but, if he has not, I cannot see any reason why he rules it out and makes an appeal impossible. He can imagine cases in which petitions come before the county council but if they are in the position to say that owing to the law these petitions have to be ruled out, and if these people cannot make a further move and are deprived of the benefits of drainage, I say that the law is not fair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this suggestion of Deputy Baxter is ridiculous.  The county council must refer it to the county surveyor, and if he reports in favour of the scheme, I can hardly imagine circumstances in which the county council will refuse to pass the necessary resolution.  Deputy Baxter says that there will be hardly any appeals, because he realises that in 999 cases out of 1,000 the county councils will pass the resolution.  That, however, does not mean that there will be no appeals, because people who want drainage schemes think that their area affords a splendid opportunity to carry out works that will be remunerative. If you ever come across people whose suggested schemes have been turned down, they generally tell you that the engineer was bribed or that something else happened, and so they will send forward their scheme.  You would have scores, perhaps hundreds, of absolutely &ldquo;dud&rdquo; schemes coming forward, and you would have the engineers of the Board of Works going down and examining such schemes and spending their time, which could be better spent in carrying out practical schemes.  You would add expense to the State and a good deal of other work would be delayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in saying that the county councils and the Board of Works might turn down good schemes. It is not proposed to appoint an appeal tribunal from the Board of Works.  The Board of Works would probably have far greater reason for turning down schemes.  A great number of schemes are bound to involve some expense to the State.  On the other hand, schemes recommended by competent county surveyors are unlikely to involve any expense on the county councils unless they voluntarily desired to contribute something.  It is unlikely that a local body, which sees the possibility of work being carried out in the district and an Exchequer contribution being paid, will turn down such proposals.  It is more likely that the central authority <Col N="1866" /> which would be involved in the expenditure would be inclined to view the thing in a strict way and turn it down if there were sufficient reasons for turning it down.  You may argue about every possible form of appeal board, but we are not going to set up a multiplicity of appeal boards, as we assume that people are going to act in a reasonable way.  I think there is no ground for thinking that the county councils will act unreasonably.  There may be one case in a thousand in which the county councils turned down a scheme which ought to have gone through, but there will be new county councils, and the matter could be rectified. Such work has remained for hundreds of years without being done, and surely, it can wait a little longer.  It is better that you should have one such case in a thousand than that you should have unnecessary expense thrown on the Exchequer and other work held up.</P>

      <P>The points which I desire to make have really been made by the Minister and by Professor Tierney.  It is not really the case, as Deputy Gorey thinks, that this amendment is rejected because it comes from the Farmers' Benches.  Such remarks are in full keeping with the amount of reasoning bestowed on this amendment, reasoning which I was unable to follow.  That, however, is a limitation for which I am sorry.  As Deputy Cole and Deputy Baxter stated, we are dealing with practically one case in a blue moon, and, in return for an opportunity of dealing out justice in that case, you cut across the whole idea of the Bill, which is, co-operation between the county councils and the Central Board here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the appeal is successful, certain heavy duties are imposed on the county council, and to impose these duties on them against their will would be, I think, cutting across the whole idea in this Bill.  If the appeal is allowed in this case you might as well, in my opinion, cut out the preliminary stage so far as the county councils are concerned, for it is inevitable that you will have an appeal in all these cases if you allow an appeal where there is <Col N="1867" /> a rejection by the county council, and an investigation will have to be made if the appeal is to be a reality.  It will mean whether they are &ldquo;dud&rdquo; schemes or not they will have to be examined by an engineer sent down by the Board of Works.  That, as I say, would cut across other schemes, and it would not be for the benefit of the county.  If there is a grievance or hardship in one particular case that, as the Minister has pointed out, could be remedied in the course of time.  The real thing is that you do impose obligations on the county council.  They should, in the first instance, be given the opportunity of rejecting or approving, but if this amendment is accepted it will impose on them a responsibility against their will, and they will have no option but to undertake it, not because they think it ought to be undertaken, but that we who are further away from the circumstances in the locality think it ought to be undertaken.  That is why I am opposed to the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did not deal with the suggestion made by me.  I desire to repeat it again, because if this amendment is put I think it will be defeated. I dealt with the possibility of an isolated case, where the county council may possibly turn down a genuine petition which lays the basis for a good scheme.  I agree with Deputy Baxter that such a thing is unlikely to happen, but there is a slight possibility that it may.  There may be some bodies with a bad reputation in some district, and there may be people on the council with a political bias.  That happened in the past, and it may occur again in the future.  It is possible that a scheme which is sound may be turned down by a biassed county council.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that if he does not accept this amendment he should accept another amendment to the effect that where a county surveyor reports favourably on a petition that the petitioner shall have the right, in the event of the county council turning that petition down, to appeal to the Commissioners of Public Works.  I think that is not an unreasonable <Col N="1868" /> thing to ask.  It is simply a safeguard in regard to a state of affairs which may possibly occur here and there.</P>

Mayo (Lynch-Blosse Estate) for which he signed a purchase agreement several years ago, and whether a refund, or credit, will be given to Mr. Dunne for payments made in excess of his annuity, amounting to 18/6 per annum for the past thirteen years.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether he is aware that Michael Gibbons and four other tenants in the townland of Kilnagower, Claremorris, Co. Mayo (Lynch-Blosse Estate) which the Congested Districts Board purchased 16 years ago, signed purchase agreements five years ago in respect of their holdings; that their holdings are not yet vested, and that they are still paying interest in lieu of rent, which amounts to £5 per annum more than their annuities would be if such lands were vested; and if he will state what steps, if any, are being taken by the Land Commission to have those lands vested.</P>
