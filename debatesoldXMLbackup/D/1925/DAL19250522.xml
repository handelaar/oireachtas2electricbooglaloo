    <P>Deputies have already heard something with regard to Vote 61.  As regards Vote No. 14, this is really necessary in consequence of an arrangement that has been made with the British Government.  For the future we will pay direct to people who have got awards in connection with the destruction done during 1916.  The money will come into us from the British Exchequer, and there will be no loss to our Exchequer as a result of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister now says that this Vote will not be introduced for a fortnight.  What I am anxious to know is&mdash;are we likely to have a further statement of policy as to the intentions of the Ministry with regard to solving the problem of the losses that have been sustained by farmers in the country?  If the Minister has nothing better to offer than the proposition already put up by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, in conjunction, I presume, with himself, to meet the losses that have been sustained by the owners of sheep and cattle, and if he thinks that getting this Vote for the establishment of these credit societies accepted by the House is going to solve the problem, then I want to tell him that it is not.</P>
      <P>The mere introduction of this Vote for the purpose of finding a solution of the problem that we know exists is, I fear, a waste of time.  The proposition that has already been stated in the House by the Minister for Agriculture will not solve the problem that exists. I may tell the Minister for Finance that, unless he is prepared to amend very considerably the offer that has already been made, the motion that he is now introducing will certainly not solve this problem.  At the same time I do not want to be taken as saying that the principle itself is not sound. I believe it is, and I believe, further, that we should have these credit societies in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be a possibility of establishing these societies in counties where farmers have not suffered anything more than normal losses by the loss of cattle from disease or otherwise, but I suggest there is no possibility whatever of establishing them in the poorer districts in the Saorstát where farmers have sustained very great losses.  The Minister may get leave to introduce his motion and it may be agreed to by the House, but that, I say, will still leave the problem unsolved if the Executive Council be not prepared to do a good deal more than was indicated in the statement of the Minister for Agriculture some weeks ago.  If nothing better than that can be done, this, I suggest, is merely playing with the problem, and it will continue to exist.  I would like to hear from the Minister if he has considered the magnitude of the task that he is setting himself.  If the Minister thinks that, by the establishment of these credit societies and by the Government giving £1 for every £1 <Col N="2101" /> put up by farmers in the districts concerned, this problem is going to be solved, I may tell him that he is very badly informed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to discuss the matter at all on this resolution. All I will say is that we are still satisfied that it is necessary to assist in the establishment of credit societies.  If the Dáil does not want to assist in the establishment of these societies then it can reject the Vote. I am not going to discuss the general question at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Baxter in the statement he made.  From the opinions we get from all parts of the country it is clear that this arrangement for credit societies does not meet the emergency in any way.  The general opinion is that the estimate of the Minister for Agriculture as to the losses that have taken place is very much below the actual state of affairs.  When the original motion of Deputy Baxter was before the House, I said that there were no losses of any consequence in my country, but I was very much surprised since to find out that I was wrong, and that even in my own county there have been very serious losses.  This credit system, as proposed by the Government, will not meet the emergency.  We do not oppose the system; on the contrary, we have been advocating such a system for a long time.  But what we want now is to meet a special emergency. This will not meet it, particularly in the poorer districts where the greater losses accrued, and where it is generally believed it will be quite impossible to get the farmers to put down a £1 in order to get a £1 from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must take this opportunity of impressing upon the Minister for Finance, and upon the Government generally, that this problem is a real one, and that they will have need to meet the contingency in a much quicker fashion than this.  I have here a letter from a constituent of mine who, speaking of the losses he sustained, says that he lost twelve yearlings out of seventeen, and three two-year-olds out <Col N="2102" /> of thirteen.  We could multiply that by many instances in my county, and my county is not as badly hit as a number of other counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. COLE Mr. COLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to this Vote at all, but I quite agree with the Deputies who have spoken.  Unfortunately, I have to go further than Deputy Heffernan when he said that the farmers are not willing to put up the money.  They are not willing to put up the money because they have not got it.  I know farmers that were supposed to be well off who are living on the verge of starvation.  I could give instances where we had to raise subscriptions for farmers and their families who were threatened with starvation, and if they cannot get money for food where are they to get money to put down pound for pound with that put up by the Government?  The loss of cattle in most cases was really much worse than was supposed, or than Deputies have stated.  I know a man who lost a large number of sheep.  My county (Cavan) is not a sheep-raising county, but a few of the farmers keep sheep and small cattle, and most of these sheep and cattle died.  It would be utterly impossible for the farmers in that county to put up pound for pound with the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not intervene at all at this stage in the matter were it not for what the Minister seemed to convey a few moments ago, and that was that we did not want this estimate at all.  We really do want it.  We do not want the Government to be committed to a certain scheme but that they should make up their minds to look at this matter in a bigger and a broader way than they suggested here on a previous occasion.  I want to impress upon the Minister for Finance that there are more aspects of this question and that these should be dealt with in a different way to that which the Minister proposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a communication from the Kerry County Committee of Agriculture upon this matter.  That is not a communication coming from our Union, or coming through committees of farmers, but it comes through the <Col N="2103" /> County Committee of Agriculture of Kerry, and they say that the proposal of the Minister will not meet the situation. We know personally that it will not.  The question of fifty-fifty, or pound for pound, will not meet the situation. It will mean this: that there will be no pound at all contributed by the Government, because there will be none forthcoming from the farmer, for the simple reason that he has not got it. This scheme cannot be based on a hard and fast rule; it will have to be elastic. Laying down the principle of fifty-fifty, or pound for pound, is only really tinkering with the question.  I impress upon the Minister that he should reconsider this whole matter and deal with it otherwise than he proposes.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister recognise the urgency of this problem? A fortnight may mean a great deal.  It may mean two months before anything can be done in the country and that may lead us on to the harvest.  I think the Minister should have the Vote taken at the earliest possible date, and I believe the House would consent to forego other Votes, because both the House and the country recognise the urgency of this matter.  I press the Minister to take it at the earliest possible moment, say Wednesday next.</P>

      <P>The argument which I have to advance in favour of this amendment is that, in the case of the rejection of schemes, it would be of considerable value if county councils were fully informed of the reasons for the rejection. It would be a guide to them in considering future schemes if there was some indication made to them of the imperfections or of certain technicalities that might have led to the rejection of the scheme.  It would enable them to arrive at a proper decision in connection with any future schemes they might have before them.</P>

      <P>To add to sub-section (2) a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(h)  the amount to be paid out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would be prepared to accept this amendment.  I think that on the Second Reading he indicated that when a scheme is being prepared, if the people concerned are to know exactly how they stand, they should be made aware of what moneys are to be contributed by the Oireachtas towards the scheme.  Without knowing what is going to be contributed by the Oireachtas many people would be placed in a doubtful position as to what money it would be necessary to contribute on their part.  There might, for instance, be a scheme that would cost a couple of thousand pounds.  The area to be drained might be very small, and the cost of that scheme would probably have to be borne by the land drained. If there is not some indication as to what money is to come out of the Central Fund towards the construction of such a scheme, it will be impossible for people to contemplate their contribution. I think it is necessary that the words I suggest should be included in the section.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in the short space of time at my <Col N="2107" /> disposal on Second Reading&mdash;I think it was mainly in reply to an objection put forward by Deputy Johnson&mdash;I fully realised the fairness of people having before them, when they were asked to vote for or against a scheme, some indication as to what the Government is prepared to contribute.  Consequently, I am in full agreement with the idea that is at the back of Deputy Baxter's amendment.  There is, however, some slight difficulty about the drafting.  Really, it is a matter of the Commissioners putting up the scheme before it goes to the Minister for Finance.  What I would suggest is that the Commissioners of Public Works would make up their minds as to the recommendations they will make to the Minister, and then, before the publication takes place, the Minister's consent and the amount that he will consent to will be determined.  That is, the contribution by the Government will be determined, and will be published. That is what the people will have before them.  Do I make my meaning quite clear to the Deputy?  There is nothing really between us.  It is only a question as between a subordinate Department of the Government and the Minister.  If the Deputy's amendment were inserted where he suggests, it would mean that what we have to do with here is not the Minister's decision, but the Commissioners' recommendation, whereas the Minister and I are both anxious that the people should know, not what the Commissioners recommend, but what the Minister is prepared to sanction for the scheme.  I will accept the principle of the Deputy's amendment, and I will see how the idea can more appropriately be embodied in the section.  I will put the matter before the Parliamentary draughtsman.</P>

    <P>The intention of the amendment is that the preliminary expenses incurred <Col N="2108" /> by the petitioners should be included in the general expenses of the scheme and that they will be eventually defrayed in the same manner as that in which the general expenses are defrayed. It was my intention originally to put down an amendment governing the payment of preliminary expenses in cases where schemes were not accepted; but as this would involve a charge on State funds, I would not be entitled to put it down.  I would suggest, if the Parliamentary Secretary sees fit to accept my amendment, that I would be permitted to incorporate a similar idea in regard to sub-section (4).  It is only reasonable, I think, that the preliminary expenses, such as preparing the petition, the cost of convening meetings, the preparation of any maps that may be required, and, possibly, the expense of employing an engineer to make a report to the petitioners, should be included in the general expenses of the scheme.</P>

      <P>I see rather grave objections to the acceptance of this amendment, because it proceeds on an assumption that I am anxious to avoid and that I should not like to give any countenance to, that is, that the preliminary stages will cost a considerable amount of money.  As I explained in reply to Deputy Morrissey, my view of the situation is that the maps to be used will simply be ordinary Ordnance Survey Maps&mdash;one inch maps.  The price of them would be something in the nature of a half-a-crown each.  The other expenses will be very slight, and I wish to keep them very slight so that they will not be a burden on the scheme.  Any encouragement you give to extra expense&mdash; and you may give encouragement if this amendment is accepted&mdash;will affect the scheme.  I do not wish that people would be under the impression that it would be necessary to employ an engineer to draw up a sketch map for the preliminary stage of the scheme. That is one of the reasons I am against the acceptance of the amendment.  It implies considerable trouble and expense in the preliminary stages and in the presentation of the scheme to the county council.  That is an impression that should be discouraged in every <Col N="2109" /> possible way.  No substantial expenses are involved in the preparation and presentation of a petition as we understand it under this Bill, and people should not be encouraged to employ, in the preliminary stage, engineers to draw up an elaborate map and an elaborate scheme and submit it to the county council.  If this amendment is accepted that will, in many cases, be the inevitable result.  I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to press the amendment, as I also saw the difficulties involved in it when I was putting it forward, but possibly some kind of compromise might be made, as I think there may be cases where the employment of engineers in the preliminary stages may be necessary. Farmers and others interested in the scheme may not be in a position to know the engineering problems, and to know whom they should, and should not, include in the petition.  I suggest that something in the nature of a minimum, which might be placed very low, could be arranged, but, of course, it might also happen that the minimum might be a maximum.  There will, however, be preliminary expenses incurred, and, possibly, some man, who is keener on drainage and more alive to its necessity than others, will have to defray these expenses out of his own pocket, and he may never be refunded for the money so expended.  While I am not anxious to press the amendment, I think that something might be done so as to allow the payment of such expenses, and at the same time keeping them down to an absolute minimum.  I agree that large expenses ought not to be allowed and that expenses should be kept to the lowest possible amount. The problem is there, however, and it ought to be met in some way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in line with similar amendments which I proposed recently in regard to other Bills.  It means that there will be a certificate of posting and a certificate of the receipt of the letter.  I think it is right, where certain obligations are imposed <Col N="2111" /> on people, that there should be an absolute proof of posting and receipt of letters.  There is always a possibility that something may go wrong.  The office boy may, for instance, lose the letters or fail to deliver them.  Similar amendments were accepted in regard to other Bills.  In the Enforcement of Law Bill, I think, the Minister for Justice accepted a similar suggestion.</P>

      <P>No, it would hurt me considerably.  I do not think that there is anything practical to be gained by the amendment, and it would add additional and unnecessary complications.  In most contracts, when things are going through the post, the Post Office is, or at least it used to be long ago, recognised as an agent, and the posting of a letter was more or less regarded as acceptance of a contract. I do not see why a practice which holds in ordinary contracts should not hold here, especially as regards the preliminary stages of a scheme.  It is unlikely that a letter will go astray, and, if it does, it is unlikely that a man would not hear about it from his neighbours.  He could then send in and ask why he did not get notice. There is really no occasion for registered letters, and I do not think that any good purpose would be served by registering.</P>

If a man were living in parts of Kerry, where the people see the post only once a week or once a month, and where, without any reflection on the Minister for Posts, a postman may keep a letter in his pocket on the chance of meeting the man at Mass next Sunday, there would be a necessity for registration. <Col N="2112" /> In a matter of this kind, which involves individuals in obligations to do certain things, it should be made certain that information is conveyed to such people through channels which cannot be questioned.  Where there is a registered letter there can be no doubt about delivery, and where a man may have a complaint to make, proof that he received the letter can be easily given.</P>

      <P>No.  My contention is that where a man should receive notice from the Government imposing certain obligations on him he has an absolute right to insist that there will be no possible chance of that notice not reaching him.  There is such a possibility, as things stand at present, and a man can say that he did not receive notice.  The idea of a man getting notice, which he is entitled by law to get, through the medium of general rumour in the district is not a proper way for a Government to act.  I am sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary has taken this view, because I think it is a very small thing.  The question of expense is absolutely ridiculous; it would probably not involve an expenditure of more than £20 for the whole State in a year.</P>

      <P>(1)  The Commissioners shall in due course examine the communications received by them from rated occupiers of lands proposed in the drainage scheme to be drained or improved and shall ascertain the number of such occupiers who in the manner and within the time specified in the notices served on them by the Commissioners have dissented from the scheme (which occupiers are hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;dissenting occupiers&rdquo;), and shall further ascertain the aggregate value of the lands occupied by dissenting occupiers which are proposed in the scheme to be drained or improved, and, if such aggregate value is more than half the total value of all the lands proposed in the scheme to be drained or improved, the Commissioners shall take no further steps in regard to the drainage scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2115" /> (a) delete from the scheme the holdings of any dissenting occupiers which they may think fit, and if the deletion results in showing that the aggregate value of the land of dissenting occupiers remaining within the scheme is less than the aggregate value of the land of occupiers in favour of the scheme they shall refer the amended scheme to the occupiers of the land to be drained under the amended scheme and if the aggregate value of the land of &lsquo;dissenting occupies&rsquo; under the amended scheme is less than the aggregate value of the land of occupiers in favour of the scheme the amended scheme shall be accepted as a new scheme and shall be proceeded with;</P>
    <P>(b) shall decline to proceed further in regard to the scheme;&rdquo; and to delete line 2, page 6.</P>
    <P>In my opinion this amendment is of considerable importance.  Where a petition has been lodged, a scheme made out by the Commissioners, and notice of that scheme sent to the different rated occupiers who are concerned, and it is found that a majority of the rated occupiers object to the scheme, it will be turned down, under the provision at present in the Bill.  The intention of the amendment is in such a case to give the Commissioners power to amend the scheme&mdash;that is, to take out of the scheme certain persons who are objecting, such people as outlying farmers, who would only be very slightly affected by the scheme.  There would then be a very good chance of having the amended scheme accepted by those proposed to be retained within it. The amendment provides that notice again should be given to those concerned in the new scheme, and if the majority are in favour of the scheme, that it should be accepted.  The amendment gives a good deal of power to the Commissioners, but the idea is to prevent people who would be on outlying portions of an area proposed to be affected by a drainage scheme, who might be very slightly affected by it, and who would not be anxious to take advantage of it, from making the whole <Col N="2116" /> scheme abortive.  In such a case the only alternative would be to form a new scheme, leaving out those who objected. The amendment is to get over this difficulty.</P>

      <P>There should be a provision in this section to deal with obstreperous people or obstructionists. You do get that type of individual, people who oppose everything, even if it will benefit themselves.  By being excluded from a scheme they might wish to escape paying for the work, and be free of any responsibility afterwards. You meet that class of individual, and you may meet them in some numbers. No matter what the position is, when the Commissioners are satisfied that drainage is necessary and feasible in a district, they should have power to put a proportionate charge on everybody who will benefit, because there are people&mdash;and anybody who knows anything about Irish life knows this&mdash; who are obstructionists, either from private motives or to escape paying for benefits they will derive, or they oppose schemes out of spite for their neighbours. I have known the purchase of estates to be held up because certain tenants would not agree with the other tenants to accept any terms on account of spite or through a peculiarity of temperament.</P>

      <P>I quite agree that there is much force in what Deputy Gorey has said, that there are people who will naturally object to everything, even big schemes, and even schemes to the general advantage.  I might almost say that they do so because they are to the general advantage. I have not the slightest doubt about that.  On the other hand, in reference to the last portion of the Deputy's speech, namely, with regard to the motives that operate in causing them to object, I am quite ready to believe that in a number of cases it is a desire to save their own pockets, not to contribute anything to the general good which the scheme will help to promote; and, secondly, spite against their neighbours.  These things will operate.  If for one reason or another, the bulk of the people whose land is to be improved vote against the scheme, <Col N="2117" /> it is dead, but of course that does not militate against Deputy Heffernan's amendment.  He does not propose that a majority of the people whose land is proposed to be improved should be compelled to enter into a scheme.  What he does propose is that if, from the engineering point of view, it is possible for the scheme to be remodelled, that the remodelled scheme should be put before those concerned.  Of course that might make a difference in the incidence of charge.  It is a rather important point, and on the whole I think it is a matter that could be provided for. If the Deputy would withdraw the amendment I will agree to have one drafted for the Report Stage to give expression to his idea.</P>

      <P>My reason for putting down this amendment is that I realise the Commissioners would be fully informed as to local conditions, and that they would be in a position to advise the Minister as to the proper proportions of the moneys necessary for the carrying out of the scheme, to be advanced by the Minister for Finance.  I suppose I might take it for granted that he would act on their advice.  No hard and fast rules can be laid down as to the proportion which should be advanced, because local conditions vary.  With regard to one scheme, the owners of the land benefited might be in a position to contribute a fair proportion of the costs, and in others they might not be in that position&mdash;the reverse might obtain. For that reason I move this amendment.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear from the general purport of the Bill that, of course, one of the things on which the Commissioners will advise the Minister will be the amount of money that the Minister will be asked to sanction.  That, I have indicated already in dealing with Deputy Baxter's amendment, is one of the things actually put forward.  They will have that before them, and that, of course, would be acting on the advice of the Commissioners.  If the amendment simply means that these words are to be taken at their ordinary, everyday face value, that the Commissioners will advise the Minister in any decision he will come to, the Minister will have that advice before him.  That is provided in <Col N="2119" /> the Bill.  But I am very doubtful whether the legal effect of the words, &ldquo;acting on the advice of the Commismissioners,&rdquo; will be limited to that.</P>
      <P>I should not care to bind the Minister who is responsible to this Dáil for the finances of the Government to sanction anything that a subordinate department puts before him for sanction. Either that is the aim of the amendment or it is to achieve that the Minister shall act on the advice of the Commissioners.  That is provided here in the Bill already.  That is the practice and the intention, and in that case there is no necessity for the amendment. If the force of the amendment &mdash;I do not say that is the intention&mdash;is that the Minister is bound to accept that advice, then, I think, it would be highly objectionable.  In either case I feel constrained to object to the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Deputy has ignored the second portion of the dilemma, if I might so call it.  The first is that if the amendment means one thing it is not necessary, and the amendment I have accepted from Deputy Baxter shows that it is not necessary, because a paragraph will be introduced into Section 6, as a result of which the Commissioners will make that recommendation to the Minister.  The Deputy will remember that I accepted an <Col N="2120" /> amendment from Deputy Baxter.  As a result of that the Commissioners will make a recommendation to the Minister and they will give advice to the Minister.  There is no necessity for the amendment in that case, but if the amendment is capable of being construed, as I believe it is, that the Minister is bound to follow the advice of the Commissioners, I think that would be an impossible position to take up.</P>

His reading of the amendment is that the Minister would have to act on the advice of the Commissioners of Public Works, and as he is not prepared to accept that I would suggest a new amendment might be formulated to the effect that before deciding on the amount that he would give, that he would get advice of the Commissioners.

The possibility exists that the Minister might&mdash;I would not say that the present Minister would, but a high-handed <Col N="2121" /> Minister may&mdash;act on his own initiative and might not seek the advice of the Commissioners, and the result would be disastrous.</P>

      <P>Under Section 6, when the Commissioners are putting forward a scheme before the Minister, one of the matters that they will put forward to the Minister, as I have already indicated in accepting Deputy Baxter's amendment, is the amount to be contributed out of the Exchequer.  I cannot say what precise form the draft of Deputy Baxter's amendment, the principle of which I have accepted, will take, but it will probably mean that in sub-section (2) we will have a new paragraph (h) regarding the amount, if any, which the Commissioners will recommend to the Minister. That comes before the Minister, who accepts, cuts down, or increases that amount, and then the amount that he approves of will be indicated to people when the scheme is put before them and when they are asked to vote on it.</P>

      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 13 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 14, SUB-SECTION (4).</P>
      <P>In fixing for the purposes of the draft award or a final award the proportions in which any sum or rate is to be borne by the several quantities of the lands so drained or improved the Commissioners shall have regard to the extent to which such lands are respectively benefited or improved by the carrying out of the drainage scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the points that are to be taken into consideration when the award is being made out.  I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (4) the words &ldquo;and to the rent and local rate which has to be met out of the entire holding of which the lands so improved form part.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the award is being made out I want consideration to be given to the rent and the local rate that is to be met out of the entire holding.  I think <Col N="2122" /> it is essential that that should be taken into account in the making out of the award.  I have experience of a holding bought out under the 1903 Act.  The landlord was paying the drainage rate until then.  The tenant's rent was about £28.  When he had purchased his holding his rent was about £23, and he then took over the landlord's responsibility for paying the drainage rate, which amounts to over £7.  I see demand notes for amounts like that, leaving the tenant with an annual rental charge of £30.  I think there are many cases like that.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows cases like that in my county.  It is essential that when the draft award is being made out you will take into account what the charges on the entire holding are. Obviously you might have a farm in a low-lying part of the country where the greater part of a man's holding would be along the river and subject to flooding.  The rent and the valuation might have been fixed at a time when flooding was not nearly so considerable as at present and when the damage done was not nearly as considerable as it is now.  The cost of construction and of maintenance of drainage works in that district to that man would be considerable indeed.  A farmer like that might be called upon to pay, to maintain such works, a sum out of proportion to what his holding would be able to carry, taking into account his rent and rates.  I think that the award cannot fairly be made out if the rents and the rates of the holding are not taken into account.  If the greater part of a man's land is subject to flooding and if it is, at the same time, valued and rented highly, there is no doubt whatever that if that man has to pay what might be considered a fair proportion of the award for construction and maintenance of drainage works it would saddle him with a sum he could not pay.</P>

      <P>I wish to impress on the Minister the importance of this amendment.  I know many cases the same as this one to which Deputy Baxter referred, where the award should be in proportion to the other payment that a tenant has to make in respect of the holding.  Some are excessive for <Col N="2123" /> the reason he has given.  If this is not taken into consideration when making an award, it will cause undue hardship on the tenant.  Therefore, I press on the Parliamentary Secretary to accept the amendment of Deputy Baxter if possible.</P>

      <P>It is undoubtedly a very complicated matter, but I hope it is quite clear to Deputies that when we come to this final award anything that comes off one man must go on to his neighbour.  The State contribution is already determined and also the county council contribution. What remains to be determined is what portion of the amount that has to be paid back, by way of terminable annuity in the shape of drainage rate, must fall on each of the individuals. Supposing the cost is £1,000.  The question is what part of the £1,000 should fall on A, and what part on B. It must be quite clear that, so far as the State is concerned, taking it off A does not put it on the State.  We are beyond that particular stage, when the settlement of the final award comes.  Taking it off A puts it on to B, C, D and all the others.  You would, under this amendment, have to take into account not merely what the charge on A is, and what the other charges on A, besides the drainage rate, are, but also what the other charges are on B, C, D, and down to Z. You would have to do that in respect of all the others whose lands are benefited and who have to pay their fraction of the terminable annuity that goes to pay back that portion of the expenses of creating a drainage district which is not provided by the State or by means of a grant from the county council.  It is necessary to make that clear.  The Deputies will see how very complicated the procedure becomes on final investigation.  Not only that, but probably it is admitted that the person whom you want to benefit by this amendment has lands which are benefited up to a certain extent. You are not charging him up to that extent.  You propose to charge his neighbours for that extra benefit he has got.  The proposal in the Bill is that <Col N="2124" /> each man is to be charged in proportion to the benefit, in comparison with others, which he is adjudged to have received from the scheme.  That being so, you can easily understand the ill-feeling there would be if it got abroad that one man was not paying a fair proportion of the benefit he received and that his neighbours were paying it.  I am not denying that there is something to be said in favour of Deputy Baxter's amendment.  I am not denying that, but I do say it would complicate the scheme at this particular stage of the final award tremendously. It would hit other people who would be benefited&mdash;they would probably not admit that they were benefited once the scheme is through&mdash;but who have to pay in proportion to the amount they have been held to have been benefited.  There are these two objections&mdash;the tremendous complications you would introduce into what on the whole ought to be a fairly simple matter, and then undoubtedly the feeling of injustice that neighbours have to pay for the benefit this man has got.</P>

      <P>While I recognise the difficulties my amendment would cause, I think, on the other hand, there is no doubt whatever that there is a problem.  I have personal experience where men's drainage charges are out of all comparison with the rent they have to pay.  Drainage Acts in the past imposed on men an obligation that was too heavy to carry.  That would not have been imposed on them if the other charges on the land had been taken into account.  We may now again put other tenants in exactly the same position.  I cannot see in the Bill safeguards that would prevent a recurrence of this.  While I agree that it would be unjust to put on to one man what another man should pay the truth is that you might carry through a drainage scheme which would put some men out of existence altogether. The Minister for Finance shakes his head.  Many tenants have property in my county who, when they bought out their land, took over drainage charges paid by the landlord.  These leave them paying a rent much higher than <Col N="2125" /> they paid before they bought their land out at all.  You can put a charge on a tenant under this Bill, not, perhaps, as serious as that, but serious, nevertheless.  While I see the difficulties of pressing the amendment, I see, on the other hand, that there are no safeguards in the Bill that would prevent our doing the same thing and putting a charge on a tenant which his land will not carry.  I would like if the Minister would consider the provision of some safeguard against what I have referred to, in some other part of the Bill, because I fear a recurrence of what I have alluded to.  I ask the Minister's consideration for this amendment, because there is reason for it.</P>

      <P>As regards what has happened in the past and what may happen under this Bill, the situation is somewhat different.  Originally, the men affected in this way were never asked to consent.  There was no opportunity given them to accept or reject the drainage scheme. Under this Bill they have, at least, an opportunity given them to accept or reject the scheme.  I appreciate the point raised by Deputy Baxter, but I cannot see any means of meeting it.  I do not see how you are going to saddle other members of the community with what really is this particular man's fair share of responsibility.  I cannot see how that can be done without injustice and also without causing a great deal of ill-will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only two ways of meeting this point.  If you are going to make discrimination between people benefited under these schemes, and if each person is not going to bear his fair share of the cost of the scheme according to the benefit derived, then the other occupiers will have to bear, in addition to their own share, the share of the privileged person, or the State or county funds will have to bear it. We had better make up our minds whether the individual benefited, the rest of the body of occupiers, the State or the local authority will bear the share of the cost in regard to which discrimination is made.  The county rates could not bear this cost, and it would fall on the State.  I would certainly object to the rates being made responsible, and I should more particularly object to having the occupiers of drained land paying for the benefit derived by somebody else.  If that idea is going to get about, it is going to knock the bottom out of the whole scheme. If everything is not going to be done above board, and if everybody is not going to pay their proportion of the benefit derived, the whole scheme is at an end.  If the idea is advanced that tenants will not meet the charges, then the thing for occupiers to do is not to <Col N="2127" /> enter into the scheme at all but to ascertain beforehand what the charges are.  If the game is not worth the candle, do not have the game.</P>

      <P>When a draft has been prepared by the Commissioners under this Act, the Commissioners shall publish by advertisement in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and one or more newspapers circulating in the district to which the final award when made would relate a notice stating that the draft award has been prepared and the townlands to which it relates and naming a convenient, place where the draft award (with all maps and other documents annexed thereto) or a copy thereof can be inspected, and further stating that a public inquiry will be held in relation to the draft award at the time (not being less than three weeks after the first publication of such notice) and place specified in the notice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In putting down this amendment I had in view the urgency that is demanded for setting the work of drainage on foot.  We have had two years of abnormal rainfall and, as far as this so-called summer season has gone, it bids fair to surpass previous seasons in respect of rainfall.  That being so, anybody with any knowledge of the country must know that drainage was never so much required as it is at present. There is also a great deal of unemployment throughout the country, and if these works could be undertaken in this season it would relieve unemployment <Col N="2128" /> and, at the same time, relieve the ratepayers of the burdens which they have to shoulder on account of unemployment.  It seems strange that any local inquiry should be required when there is no objection to, or dissent from the scheme.  One would think that the draft award having got due publication, as provided, in the local newspapers, everybody would be aware of the nature of the scheme and how it would affect them.  Holding a local inquiry will involve expense, and it will also delay the scheme considerably. I cannot see any reason why this scheme should not be gone on with, without further inquiry, if there is no objection to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy's time-table is a little wrong.  This draft award only enters into the question after the scheme has been completed and after the engineering work has been done.  Therefore, it cannot hold up any scheme, nor can it delay the relief it might prove to the unemployed.  It is after the scheme has been carried through&mdash;after the work has been done, and the lands have been drained&mdash;that the question of the draft award comes in.  There is no loss of time, so far as drainage is concerned. Any little loss of time after that does not count one way or another. There might be some very slight expense saved, but Deputy Conlan is a very optimistic man if he thinks that a draft award will be accepted by all the people whose lands are being improved, or are alleged to have been improved. Experience teaches that the complaint will be made by most of the people&mdash; and, in some cases, by all the people&mdash; that no benefit has come to their lands from the drainage scheme, that the drainage scheme has done them more harm than good, and that, therefore, they ought to pay nothing.  That is the experience, and it is, of course, in accord with human nature.  It is useful, too, that opportunity should be given to the people who fixed the final award of having a last examination of the lands to see how far the benefit has been carried through.  Nothing would be saved in the way of expense by this amendment, and it is altogether too <Col N="2129" /> optimistic to assume that any scheme or any draft award will get through without objection.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I also want to know if it is possible under this section to do anything by way of reviewing the charges under previous drainage schemes?  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware of the conditions that exist in part of County Cavan, where the charges are far beyond what farmers can pay, while at the same time they are getting no value for their money, as practically no maintenance work is being done.  Farmers are paying £6, £7, £10, and even £15 yearly for drainage maintenance, while no work is being done, and hundreds of acres of land are being flooded.  Portion of that drainage district may come in to a new scheme.  There may be some constructional work necessary on the old scheme in order to make it capable of carrying a larger volume of water coming from the new scheme.  I want to know the possibility there is for reconsideration of the old charges under this section.  If farmers are at present paying a drainage rate that is manifestly too much, is the State going to do anything under this Bill to relieve them?  If men are paying a drainage <Col N="2132" /> rate and practically no maintenance work is being done, what will be the attitude of the State in regard to them? I do not know if the conditions I speak of exist in other counties, but I should like to know if it is the intention to reconsider the charges already in existence in the rearrangement of the drainage districts.</P>

      <P>In a good many cases, in fact in the great bulk of them, the only thing collected at present is simply the maintenance rate.  What I mean is, the only thing that an attempt is made to collect is in most cases the maintenance rate.  I will not say it is collected.  To do so would be a mis-statement.  In a good many cases it is not collected.  It is the maintenance rate that is assessed that an attempt is made to collect.  Of the 160 schemes in the Saorstát there may be a certain number in which the original amount has not yet been paid by means of the terminable annuities. I am not quite clear which of the two charges the Deputy has in mind.  The provision in the Bill is that where there is an existing drainage district we can take that, or portion of it, into a new drainage district.  In the bulk of the cases there would probably be no annuities to be paid, as the original sum advanced has already been paid back.  In that case, the district comes in, of course, on a perfectly new footing. The Bill enables us to do that. The whole district, including the old and the new district, will be examined as to the amount of benefit to be charged to that extent, and that alone. <Col N="2133" /> As I indicated before, £3,300,000 has been spent on arterial drainage.  That has been paid back with the exception of £70,000 or £80,000.  Where that money has not been paid back&mdash;and I think that refers to the whole of Ireland&mdash;there is a provision here that either the old drainage district or portion of it still remains liable for that particular charge.  It is not being relieved of the charge already there.</P>

      <P>With regard to my first question, there is a river in the constituency of the Minister for Finance, and there is a feeling that it ought to be opened up so that the water would be carried down through part of my constituency and on to Lough Erne.  If the river is at present capable of carrying away the volume of water in Cavan, and if in order to carry off the bigger volume that may come down, further constructional works are carried out and the river widened and deepened, who will be responsible for payment for the constructional work?  Assuming that the present drainage district is sufficient to carry off the water from a certain area, if further water comes down by the widening and deepening of a river, what body will be responsible for paying for the new constructional works?  Will those who live alongside the river and who are satisfied have to pay, if those who live on the higher reaches want to have the water from their part of the country taken off by this river?</P>

I think the Deputy will fully agree with me in that.  In that case we cannot do anything under this Bill before the Bill becomes law.  Then, so far as the precise rivers that he has in mind are concerned, the attempt to treat them as portions of the existing old districts would in some cases be a very unwise thing to do, and I think he would be the first to acknowledge that. It is only under this Bill that they can be dealt with at all satisfactorily.

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I look upon this section as one of the most important of the whole Bill.  On this section depends the success or failure of the whole Bill and the life of the schemes put through under it.  If the machinery set up under this section will work efficiently there is no reason why this drainage scheme which the Parliamentary Secretary has launched will not be a success for all time, and I am just wondering if the machinery set up here under the county councils will work well.  What is it suggested that the county council now should do to maintain the drainage? Does that mean that it will set up whole-time or part-time officers, or does it mean that it is going to set up special officers?  Because I think it would be very expensive for a county with very few drainage schemes, perhaps, to set up whole-time officers.  I dare say in some counties the whole main outlets of a drainage scheme could be examined perhaps in a fortnight or in a month.  A part-time officer does not give very much satisfaction if he is engaged in other duties. To hand over the supervision of these drainage schemes to a part-time officer is generally not found to be satisfactory.  These do not always give proper attention to the work.  I can understand a county area being too small for a whole-time officer and a part-time officer not being satisfactory. Would it not be better to have a State officer or several State officers sufficient to supervise all the schemes in the Saorstát?  I am prepared to admit, no matter what the cost would be to the occupiers, that the most efficient machinery that the State can provide is necessary in order to have these drainage schemes maintained in a satisfactory condition.  We had lessons in this matter in the operations of the Land Act.  In these cases before the sales to the tenants the drainage had been given a good deal of attention from the principal landlords, but, when the lands had passed into the hands of the tenants, proper provision was not made by the Land Commission itself to see that the security they had taken over was <Col N="2138" /> properly safeguarded, and that the drains had got proper attention.  The result in nearly all the districts that I knew of, where the drainage was an absolute necessity to maintain the full value of the security, was that this drainage was neglected.</P>
      <P>In the 1923 Act I got a clause inserted that proper provision was going to be exercised, and that all drains, canal-ways, and water-ways would be maintained.  I think that would work out as one of the most important and valuable provisions, from the security for the State point of view, that you could possibly have in the Bill.  The position that we are in is this, that one individual, if he lives on the lower reaches of the river, could do a great deal of harm.  He could block the whole scheme right away.  The Bill, as it stands, says that the final award shall operate and be expressed to charge, impose and confer on the council of the county in which the drainage district is situated, or where such districts are situate in two or more counties, that they shall bear the cost and expenses of maintaining the drainage works pursuant to a final award, and so on.  Does the Minister think now that that would be the best machinery?  This section might, perhaps, deserve more attention. It probably already has received a good deal of attention, but still the matter is of such importance that more attention should be given to this section between this and the Report Stage to see if it can be made more effective.  We are perfectly satisfied as regards the cost.  The cost cannot matter in comparison with the proper maintenance of the drainage schemes.</P>

      <P>It is always open to us under the Drainage Maintenance Act, if there is a complaint that a district is not properly maintained, to get an inspection by one of our engineers.  I am not yet quite clear, however, as to whether the Deputy means that the official he has in mind should not merely inspect the districts in the sense of seeing they are being maintained, or whether he should supervise the actual work of maintenance. When the drainage scheme is completed there would be no work in connection with it, except the removing of weeds or other obstacles that may be thrown up by the river.  To that extent a certain amount of work is necessary every year.  Does he mean that the official he has in mind should supervise that particular work, or would he be satisfied if there was an inspection generally to see that work of that kind was properly done?</P>

The conditions under the old Drainage Act as regards the way the works are <Col N="2140" /> maintained were anything but satisfactory, and that really explains to a great extent the breakdown of the scheme.  In many cases I know local engineers were appointed who had no engineering qualifications.  The contractors were local men, as were also the workers.  Very often the work was not half done, and it was passed by the engineers of the local drainage board.

If the county council think they are capable of doing the work efficiently we do not want to put upon them the duty of appointing such a committee.

      <P>Suppose the county council imposed that duty on the committee, and that the committee failed in its duty, who then is responsible?  I think if the Minister reads the section there is a loophole in it.  If you say that the duties shall be performed by the committee, the county council then relieves itself of responsibility by putting the duty upon the committee. That is one of the possibilities of the section as it stands.  &ldquo;Where the duty and power of maintaining drainage works is charged, imposed and conferred by a final award on one county council, such duty shall be performed, and such power shall be exercised by a committee appointed by such county council.&rdquo;  So that as it stands, the county council has a vague authority to transfer its responsibilities to a committee.

I think the section is wrong, because it does not make it obligatory on the committee to report back to the county council, or be responsible to the county council.  As far as I can see, the responsibility is thrown on the committee, and, as Deputy Johnson suggests, <Col N="2143" /> the committee might refuse to do this work.  I still think it should be obligatory on the county council to appoint a committee, because work in the way of supervising drainage cannot be done by a whole county council, and if the supervision was badly attended to a great deal of harm might be done. I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the amendment be withdrawn, and that, on the Report Stage, an amendment be substituted providing that the county council shall appoint a committee, and that the committee shall be responsible and report to the county council from time to time.</P>

      <P>The county council cannot devolve its responsibility, because other sections in the Bill keep the responsibility, in very important matters at all events, with the county council.  This simply deals with the power, as you can see by the marginal note, of the county council to appoint committees, and that, I think, is the meaning of the words &ldquo;shall perform.&rdquo;  As proposed by the amendment, the section would read &ldquo;may perform and such power may be exercised.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Duggan, I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (3) and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health may by Order make regulations prescribing the time of election (including the first election) of members of committees and joint committees appointed <Col N="2144" /> under this section, the period for which such members shall hold office, the method of filling casual vacancies in their number, the disqualification of members who cease to be or become disqualified to be members of the council by which they were appointed, and the conduct of the business of such committees and joint committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I would like to bring to the notice of the Minister.  As far as I can discover from reading the section, there is no provision made for representation on these committees from the rated occupiers of the improved lands.  At present there appears to be no provision for the election of anyone on these committees except members of the county council.  I think that some of these rated occupiers should be given a position on these committees.  If they are not given that representation the position will be considered unfair, as far as they are concerned, and there will be cause for complaint.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit there is something in the argument that the Deputy has put forward. There are two possibilities before the county council, so far as the number of committees is concerned.  I take it that in the Bill as it stands it is optional with the county council to appoint a committee for each particular drainage district, or, on the other hand, to appoint one committee to manage the whole district.  Supposing the county council adopt the latter alternative for several drainage districts, then you would have to get an outside member, that is to say, a non-county council member, for each of the drainage districts if there were a number of them.  Such a thing as that might happen in a county like Cavan, and, therefore, I am afraid it would be found impossible <Col N="2145" /> to do what the Deputy suggests. In this particular case, the member of the committee that is to be a rated occupier according to Deputy Baxter's suggestion is not to be elected by the rated occupiers themselves. He is to be appointed by the county council, and he might be quite as objectionable to the bulk of the rated occupiers as an outside person would be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the powers conferred on the drainage boards that we have at present, the rated occupiers have the right to hold a meeting and elect trustees for the purpose of having drainage work carried out.  Here, being members of the county council themselves, they might select men who are not concerned with drainage work at all.  The question of a man having an interest in the drainage works ought to be a consideration with the county council when they come to make a selection, but it is quite possible that it may not, and therefore the position created would be that you would have men paying rates for the carrying out of these works who would have no voice in the selection of the men who would constitute the committee controlling the execution of the works.  There is every reason why these men would complain if they were not given representation, and I think some machinery ought to be provided as to the manner in which they should get that representation. I have not given sufficient consideration to the matter to suggest how that machinery should be provided, but I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should bring in something himself which would meet the point that I have been urging.</P>

He is going to make regulations which may say that one member of the drainage board shall be a member of the county council and that eight shall not.

      <P>As the Bill stands at the present time the whole drainage scheme may be managed by the county council.  I would suggest that the Minister should still make it obligatory that a committee should be appointed to look after drainage and that that committee should consist of a certain number of members of the county council plus a certain number of outside members, portion of whom shall be rated occupiers.  It stands to reason that if rated occupiers within the scheme are not included on the committee the scheme will not receive the attention that it ought to receive, and as the Bill stands at present it is quite possible that they would be altogether excluded.  An amendment has already passed with regard to the committee being obligatory or not, but I suggest in view of the things that will come up before the committee that it is only right and fair that the rated occupiers who benefit from the scheme and are within the scheme should be included on the committee.  I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should reconsider this matter and introduce an amendment on the Report Stage making it obligatory that the committee should be appointed and that it should consist of so many outside members, a proportion of whom should be rated occupiers within the scheme. I am prepared to introduce that amendment myself, but I would sooner have it taken up by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>To add at the end of sub-section (3), page 15, the words &ldquo;Provided always that the word &lsquo;construction&rsquo; may be construed to mean the construction of adequate protection of the embankments from cattle or other animals consistent with affording <Col N="2153" /> proper facilities for drinking places for such cattle or other animals.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>An offence of the type set out in sub-section (3) may render a man liable to a fine of £50, or he may be sent to jail for six months.  My idea is that in the work of construction steps should be taken to protect the embankments from the possibility of damage.  Anyone who has experience of cattle grazing on the banks of a river in summer time knows that, if the weather is hot, there is no question but the banks will suffer very considerable damage.  That might happen and there is need for protection.  The only way the object of the section can be carried out is by the erection of a fence.  I emphasise that at the outset.  You cannot keep cattle or horses off the banks of a river if the banks are not fenced off with wire or by some other means. Otherwise the animals will break down the embankments.  We have to accept it that there must be a fence.  I want to put the responsibility for the erection of it on the people who do the work of construction, and who should bear the cost of the work of construction. The only way to ensure that an offence will not be committed is to insert the amendment that I propose. It will save more in the end.  Perhaps a man might have a small farm, or might have a considerable portion of his land alongside a river.  It may mean a lump sum of £2, £3, or £4 to that man for the erection of a fence. He must do that, or else render himself liable to prosecution.  I cannot see any other way out than that the Commissioners should include in the work of construction the safeguarding of the embankments from trespass that would do harm to the whole works.  I cannot see any other way to remedy the matter.</P>

      <P>I desire to support Deputy Baxter's amendment, which, I think, is a very necessary one. It would be a most unjust thing to visit owners of cattle with such drastic penalties as are provided in the Bill, and there are no means suggested of preventing trespass.  Any farmer knows it is impossible to prevent trespass on the banks of a stream, especially <Col N="2154" /> in summer time, except a proper fence is put up that will keep out cattle.  I know that in one particular drainage work carried out under the Board of Works fences were erected, and they do prevent trespass from cattle grazing on adjoining land.</P>

The amendment might mean that we are going to have a series of embankments and fences on every subway.  It might mean a tremendous amount of unnecessary fencing, perhaps, if it is made obligatory. It would be a good thing, I suggest, if the matter of erecting fences where necessary was left to the discretion of the engineer, or whoever would be responsible.  I would not approve of the idea of having fences erected at every place.  Fences may be necessary in some places, and they may not be necessary in other instances.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gorey has really given expression to my views on this matter.  There are cases where fencing may be desirable; but then there are other cases where fences would be entirely unnecessary.  If you have easy access to the river for drinking purposes fences may be necessary; otherwise no fences would be necessary, possibly.  If you make this thing obligatory, however, you not only increase the cost of the scheme, but you also give a handle to litigation. You will do that still more if you make the provision applicable to proper drinking places.  As a rule, in schemes of this kind, the practice has been to make proper facilities for cattle getting at the water.  Engineers have these instructions, and sometimes the instructions are most elaborate.  In some cases much simpler contrivances would do.  As Deputy Gorey says, it is a matter that must be left to the discretion of the engineer to a large extent. The difficulty is that if you put this into an Act of the Oireachtas you will undoubtedly give rise to an enormous amount of unnecessary litigation, to the detriment of the scheme, and, <Col N="2155" /> perhaps, to its general effectiveness in the long run.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister is prepared to say that he will put up something else.  In the Bill, the Minister has power to prosecute and fine a man up to £50, or send him to prison for six months for committing a certain offence.  It is our responsibility to see that precautions should be taken by the Minister, that he will not, so to speak, leave the gate open and so let a man walk into danger.  That is what it amounts to.  It is our responsibility to see that the farmers will have safeguards. I know men&mdash;small farmers&mdash; who live along the banks of rivers and whose land extends over a quarter of a mile, perhaps.  Practically their entire holding lies along by the river bank.  That is the place where their cattle graze all during the summer months and there is no fencing done. It would be no trouble for an engineer to say: &ldquo;These cattle are breaking in on the banks of this stream.&rdquo;  The man might be taken to court and possibly fined.  His only alternative is to put up a fence.  He is poor and he cannot possibly do that.  What is he to do in such a dilemma?  I do not want to make it absolutely compulsory in every case that protection would be made.  I am prepared to leave that to the Minister to provide for in whatever words he considers suitable.  If works are erected, I think there is a responsibility on the Minister to see that certain protection will be afforded to the people whom I have instanced.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would see his way to do away with the penalty of a fine or imprisonment.  If he did so, it might go a long way in obviating the difficulty. During the summer months cattle break down the banks of rivers and streams, not alone for the purpose of getting water but also to get away from flies.  As Deputy Gorey pointed out, it would be creating a very dangerous precedent to begin fencing subways.</P>

      <P>May I point out to the Deputy who has just <Col N="2156" /> spoken that in a good many cases there is gross neglect by people who live along rivers allowing damage indirectly to be done to works?  Any damage that will be done will have to be paid for by their neighbours and not by the State.  I would also suggest that we are not prescribing minimum but maximum penalties, and the judge who tries the case will naturally take into account how far there has been culpable neglect, and how far reasonable precautions have been taken to prevent damage being done.  If the amendment suggested by Deputy Baxter is put in, it will make it compulsory to do a great deal of unnecessary work&mdash;seven-eighths, perhaps, might be unnecessary &mdash;the expense of which must be borne by the scheme.  Moreover, if I put in a modified form of words, in attempting that modification there would probably be left all sorts of loopholes for litigation of different kinds.</P>

      <P>In my opinion the only difficulty would be in regard to sub-sections 3 and 4.  We do not object to the other section, which refers to an act of an individual.  The damage referred to in sub-sections 3 and 4 is generally done in the months of June and July and in the first two weeks of August, and, after that, injury done by cattle, except breaking and trespassing in the ordinary way, ceases. The damage done in those summer months would do no actual harm until September or October.  Discretion will have to be exercised by whoever is the responsible authority in the district, probably the Committee's inspector, as to the interpretation of the wording of the sub-sections.  If the damage is done, say, in June, and if it is repaired by September, I say that there has been no offence.  It depends a good deal on the method of administration and also on the manner in which the persons in authority interpret the sub-sections. I take it that a magistrate or Peace Commissioner, as the Bill stands, would feel it his duty to inflict a fine if the damage was done, say, in June and was not repaired by the following week.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="2157" /> consider the withdrawal of this sub-section? A farmer will be put to the responsibility of trying to protect himself and in doing so will be put to considerable expense.  I have definite districts in mind where there is no possibility of farmers keeping cattle off the banks of rivers otherwise than by erecting a paling.  The farmer will find himself in court regularly for such offences.  There is no alternative in this.  There must be some protection put up and the question is, will it be put up by the farmer or by the people constructing the work?  It is impossible for small farmers to put up protective palings.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the sub-section should be withdrawn and that it should be changed to read that where the damage done was repaired by the occupier of the land at his own expense within a specified time, no offence would be deemed to have been committed.  As the sub-section stands, it seems to me that the occupier of lands who immediately repairs any damage done by his cattle would still be liable to punishment. That suggestion might meet the difficulty to some slight extent.</P>

      <P>We will have to have some method of dealing with that.  I may be able to consider the point raised by Deputy Heffernan. <Col N="2158" /> It may mean the re-drafting of the sub-section to some extent, but at the moment I cannot see how far I could fully meet the wishes expressed by Deputies. It does seem rather hard, but, probably owing to the fact that the law has not been enforced, there has not been a large number of prosecutions.  I am quite aware that this is a new Bill, but this is not a new idea.  It is the existing law, as far as that is concerned; the Act of 1863 has this provision about cattle doing damage.  We are not introducing anything revolutionary in this.  How, on the one hand, you will not come down too hard on the people whose cattle graze along the river, and, on the other hand, how you will preserve the drainage as a whole from what is one of the most serious causes of its falling back, is another matter.  I am quite ready to consider it and to see how far I can meet the wishes of Deputies, but I cannot make any promise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Deputy Gorey in his statement with regard to the charges for delivery of telegrams.  The extra cost is causing a great deal of annoyance, expense and inconvenience to people living in rural districts.  I live within four miles of a Post Office, and I have to pay 1s. 6d. on every telegram I receive. I do not know how the scale is fixed; I think the first mile is free, the second mile is 6d., the third mile is 6d., and so on.  At one time the charge was only 6d.  This is adversely affecting any business carried on in rural districts; it is causing a diminution in the number of telegrams sent, and is causing a great deal of annoyance, because one frequently gets telegrams of very minor importance and one finds oneself faced with a charge of 1s. 6d. on the green envelope.  That has to be paid <Col N="2162" /> or else the telegram goes back.  To a certain extent this is acting to the detriment of the service.  It is preventing people from sending telegrams and possibly what is made by the charge is lost by the fact that fewer telegrams are sent.</P>
      <P>This has to be taken in conjunction with other things; it has to be taken in conjunction with the fact that since the Government took over postal affairs rural deliveries have been considerably curtailed.  In a great many cases people only get three deliveries a week, and in view of that it is often essential that telegrams should be sent where letters would otherwise have done.  That leads to another thing, the question of telephone installations and the improvement of telephone facilities in country districts.  The Minister has told us that these facilities are being extended, that new exchanges have been opened in many parts of the country.  I think he said that something like forty had been opened during the year.  I commend the Minister for his enterprise in that respect, but I would ask if he has given any real consideration to the installation of telephones in country districts, real rural districts, and not small towns. It is hardly necessary to point out that much use is being made in other countries of telephones in rural districts. In America and in Canada, I believe, it is quite common to have an installation in almost every farmhouse.  The same thing applies in many continental countries, possibly in Denmark.  It has been found a great convenience, and it saves a great deal of time and expense to farmers and others.  I might point out that a very elaborate or expensive system is not necessary, and that poles and wires which need not be of a very costly type could be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister should consider employing what are known as party lines, which are in use in rural districts elsewhere.  I am not quite sure exactly how they are worked, but I understand they can be erected much cheaper than the ordinary variety.  All I know about them is that when one person on the line <Col N="2163" /> speaks all the others can hear what he says, so that in addition to being cheap such a line would also provide a good deal of amusement to people who listen-in to others talking.  At any rate, this system permits of the installation of cheap telephone lines.  So important for the furtherance of business and the improvement of conditions, socially and otherwise, in rural districts is this matter that I would be inclined to support a system which might in the first instance involve a certain amount of loss to the State, but which might afterwards pay.  I want to press this matter on the Minister's attention, particularly in view of the existing rather poor postal facilities.  One ought to be made to balance the other to a certain extent, and undoubtedly a retrograde step has been taken as far as country districts are concerned; business has been made very difficult, and, generally speaking, conditions have been put back.</P>
    <P>With regard to bank holidays and deliveries in the rural districts, I think the Minister should give some consideration to the question of giving extra deliveries on days before and after bank holidays.  I find that in cases where bank holidays intervene, letters often take six and sometimes seven days from the time of posting to the time of delivery.  It may happen that the usual day of delivery is Friday. It may also happen that the following Monday is a bank holiday&mdash;bank holiday usually fall on Mondays.  The result is that letters posted on the Thursday, or perhaps the Wednesday, will not be delivered on Friday or on Monday, which is the bank holiday. They will not be delivered until the following Wednesday.  That means that it takes a week from the time of posting to the time of delivery.  A great deal of inconvenience is caused in that way.  I, personally, have suffered a great deal of inconvenience owing to this arrangement.  I have had persons wiring to me asking why I did not take a certain course of action, at a time when I had not received the letter they had sent me previously in regard to the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2164" /> With regard to the sixpenny tax on parcels, which, as far as I remember, is known as the statistical tax, it was imposed, not for the purpose of making the parcel post pay for itself, but for the purpose of placing the parcel post on a level with the system obtaining on railways and in other carrying companies. I strongly protested against this and I think still it is a great disadvantage to the country and hampers business.  I am not aware that any number of houses have been opened in this country for the purpose of distributing goods which formerly came from England.  The only effect of this tax is to hamper people and prevent them from getting things which they could otherwise get cheaply from England.  There are many things which could be got through the post by means of advertisements in the daily papers which are not and cannot be manufactured in Ireland.  Owing to the conditions which exist in England they can be got there at a cheap rate, probably on account of being manufactured in bulk, and because they are sold in large quantities.  I am not aware that any business men in Ireland have taken advantage of the opportunity, which was supposed to be created by this tax, to establish depots for the purpose of distributing these goods.  Many Irish people took advantage of this postal system to enable them to buy articles cheaply which they cannot get at all now.  There are many things of considerable use in ordinary life, including articles of wearing apparel, which could be got by this system.  The imposition of this statistical tax has very seriously impeded people in getting these articles.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the parcel system is not a paying one and that it is run at a very serious loss to the Department.  I only want to make a suggestion&mdash;I do not know what it is worth or whether it would be practicable in this country but it is a system that is in vogue in other countries&mdash; that we should consider the question of a zone rate for parcels.  That is, that a varying charge should be made for parcels according to the distance they <Col N="2165" /> are to be sent.  I am not recommending it at this stage.  I do not know that it would be suitable under the conditions existing in Ireland, but I would suggest that the Minister should give it his consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, before we begin to criticise this Vote, there are two things that need to be said.  The first is that some acknowledgment should be made of the fact the Minister is invariably courteous and accessible to Deputies, whatever party they may belong to, who come to him with any grievances on behalf of their constituents.  He does his best to meet us, no matter what part of the House we sit in, so far as he can consistently with the policy of his Department, and I think he should know we are grateful to him. Secondly, he is entitled to praise for his active, progressive policy with regard to the utilisation of motor transport. I think that there, a very great and a very important departure has been taken by the introduction of light motor vans, motor cycles and sidecars for postal purposes.  My only point of complaint&mdash;it may seem to be somewhat churlish&mdash;in that connection is that the Estimates do not tell us enough about it.  I would like to know what has been spent on the purchase of motor vehicles and how much they cost for upkeep and running.  That does not appear very clearly in the Estimates. I do find one item in Stores, sub-head (G), (1):&mdash;&ldquo;Miscellaneous stores (including cycles, motor cycles, string stamping machines, etc.).&rdquo;  Now, since the days I read &ldquo;Alice through the Looking Glass,&rdquo; and read of &ldquo;shoes and ships and sealing-wax,&rdquo; I never met quite such a miscellaneous collection in my life.  To parody that, one might say:&mdash;&ldquo;The time has come, the Minister said, to talk of many things, of cycles, stamping machines, of motor vehicles, and strings,&rdquo; and I would like to have more details given on this point. I think a comparison between, say, the cost of upkeep and the cost of running of motor vehicles in the Post Office and in the Army might be instructive, and the more facts we can get on points like these, the better equipped we are to criticise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2166" /> I leave the path of eulogy, possibly modified eulogy, and come to the path of criticism.  The Minister told us, with regard to postal rates, that on the whole, except as compared with Great Britain and Northern Ireland, our postal rates were low, that they were about the same level as other countries and in many cases lower.  I am only going to make comparisons with the countries I know something about. The postal rate for a letter from France to this country is 75 centimes.  At the present rate of exchange, that is a little over 2d.  It is certainly less than 2½d A letter from this country to France costs 3d.  Coming to Switzerland the rate is more favourable to the Minister. From Switzerland to Ireland a letter costs 3d. and from Ireland to Switzerland it costs 3d.  There we are on the same level.  In Switzerland, however, the user of the Post Office gets a far better service than he does in this country.  I was in a suburban place in Switzerland last month, something like Dalkey, where I live.  I found that there they had four deliveries a day where in Dalkey we have only two.  I found that they had six collections a day, where in Dalkey we have three. For the same price you get double the service, and in addition, the Post Office was much less tied down by rules.  You were not tied down, for instance, to any particular size in sending parcels.  The general endeavour to give good service is greater than in this country.  I am afraid that we have a minimum service at a maximum cost.  If the Minister will compare not only the cost of postage but also the facilities given by Post Offices in foreign countries, he will find that the comparison is not favourable to ours.  I do not want to underrate the difficulties he has to contend with.  He has had simultaneously to increase efficiency and to decrease expenditure and that is not an easy thing to do.  At the same time, if he carries his comparison beyond postal rates into postal facilities he will find that we are not getting all we might expect.</P>
    <P>I want to touch on a point which Deputy Heffernan mentioned.  Deputy Heffernan spoke of a zone rate for parcels.  I would not confine it to <Col N="2167" /> parcels.  I would make it a question of giving lower rates for local services. In France and Switzerland local letters go at a small cost indeed.  In Switzerland, in an area which may be compared with the Dublin Metropolitan Police area, you can send a letter from one end of it to another for the equivalent of a penny.  You pay 2d. here.  In Continental countries it has been found profitable and helpful, generally, to cultivate the short local delivery by giving a lower rate which does not cost the Post Office much.  Has that matter been considered here at all, and if so, would the Minister tell us the reason which induced him to turn it down? At present not only does the local Post get no better facilities than the distant Post, but it actually gets worse facilities. I was looking at a circular which, I think, was issued by the Minister on the first of the month.  It is to be seen in the Post Office at the bottom of the stairs.  There you find that for letters for the district between Dublin and Greystones the latest time for posting at the College Green Office is 5.30.  If you are sending a letter south of Greystones, further away, at the same cost, you have up to 6.30 to post it.  That seems to me an extraordinary state of affairs.  If you send a letter to Brí Chualainn it has to be posted at 5.30. If you send it through Brí Chualainn to Arklow you have an extra hour to post it.  You pay the same 2d. for sending that letter to either place.  I ask the Minister how can that be justified?</P>
    <P>The Minister raised the question of a direct exchange for parcels.  He told us arrangements have been made for a direct parcel post to various countries. I think the Minister did not enumerate France amongst those countries, and I suggest it would be desirable to extend that direct exchange of parcels to France for this reason.  A considerable proportion of the parcels imported from France are silk or materials into which silk enters.  Those being wearing apparel would be taxable here and also, as containing silk, they would be taxable in Great Britain. If you add the whips of the <Col N="2168" /> Chancellor of the Exchequer to the scorpions of the Minister for Finance you will find that trade will be killed. There will be great advantage, therefore, in getting a direct postal service with France and thereby escaping the British duties.  I hope the Minister will bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to raise on this amendment is what you call headquarters costs.  We find in this estimate, generally speaking, a reduction. There is a reduction on metropolitan offices and a reduction on provincial offices.  There appears to be a certain reduction of services.  In this Department, as in other Departments, as in the Department of the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Finance, and possibly other Departments, there is a tendency for the administrative costs to increase, while the services rendered do not increase.  That matter wants to be looked to.  Headquarters office increased by £8,000, and stores branch by £20,000, while there are no additional services, and while the cost for the various other offices, metropolitan and provincial, have fallen.  There may be, and I daresay there is, an excellent explanation for this, but the Dáil ought to have it.  There is this apparently general tendency to put up the cost of the Minister's own administrative offices, while the services which those offices supervise and control are being decreased.  I think it is a tendency that wants to be watched, and it certainly should be justified.</P>
    <P>Now, I come to my last point, a point which was made also by Deputy Heffernan regarding the parcels tax. The Minister justified it&mdash;what is commonly called the statistical tax&mdash; on the ground that those parcels were, at any rate, uneconomic for us to deliver, and that, therefore, it was desirable to get back some of the additional costs.  That doctrine varies according to place, and varies very much.  I do not think the Minister would tell us that it costs 6d. to deliver a parcel from Great Britain in Dún Laoghaire or a parcel from Newry in Dundalk. Therefore, you are making the people in those areas pay the cost of delivery in Kerry or Clare, which is not, perhaps, <Col N="2169" /> entirely equitable.  Again, I should like a little fuller information about the reduction in the number of parcels.  The reduction was from 54,000 to 39,000 taken over typical weeks.  The Minister admitted that the book post has increased.  What proportion of that reduction has been transferred to the book post?</P>
    <P>A point was made by Deputy Heffernan, in an interruption, that the number of parcels is, to a certain extent, misleading.  It may be that two or three or more parcels, which were sent through the post in the past, are now being bulked and sent in one parcel.  We ought to know all these facts in order to form a true estimate as to the effect of that duty.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he intended to retain this tax.  That is a very different voice to that of the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance, dealing with a similar tax&mdash;a tax dealing with goods sent by rail and sent by sea and so on&mdash;said that in view of the fact that the tax only came into operation in September of last year and that they had only had six months' experience of its working, it would be continued for the present year.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is much more emphatic.  He says, &ldquo;We intend to retain it.&rdquo;  Who are &ldquo;we&rdquo;?  The Minister is not a member of the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>On the only Votes on the subject in the Dáil, the Dáil refused either to approve or disapprove of this tax.  It has never been definitely affirmed or approved of by the Dáil. I put it to the Minister, without undue hostility, that this tax is bound up, to a very considerable extent, with the statistical tax on goods imported otherwise&mdash;that one of its justifications, at any rate, is the fact that goods coming <Col N="2170" /> in by other channels pay a 6d. tax and that it would be inequitable for goods coming in by post to compete with them, free of this tax.  The statistical tax has not been put forward at all as emphatically as the Minister has defended this tax.  The Minister for Finance has admitted that he wants more information, that he is continuing the tax for this year, but that he may be open to reconsider it in the light of further information.  I suggest that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs might not unreasonably adopt a similar attitude.  There may be advantages in this tax.  But I must say that I fail to see them and I am going to put down an amendment to the Finance Bill, dealing with this particular tax, so that we may have an opportunity of discussing it.  But if the statistical tax goes, this postal parcel tax should also go.  The two were imposed on the same grounds and for the same reason and if the Dáil decides that the statistical tax on non-postal parcels is to be removed, then, logically, I do not think we can retain this tax on postal parcels, unless the Minister can put up a very much stronger case than he has put up, up to the present, as to the cost of conveying those parcels and the inconvenience caused by the handling of them.  I suggest that it would be wiser to follow the example of the Minister for Finance and to admit that there is not yet full knowledge on the subject and let the Dáil know that the matter will be investigated again in September of this year, or such later date as seems to the Minister desirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hewat made reference to some queries I put to the Minister, in the course of his speech, regarding the profits or losses in different departments.  He appeared to interpret that as a demand on my part <Col N="2171" /> for what may be called a &ldquo;profit and loss account.&rdquo;  That is certainly not my desire or demand at all.  I do not think it is practicable, in such a Department as this, or in any other State Department, to produce a profit and loss account, in the ordinary commercial or accountancy sense.  When the Minister was speaking of telegraphs and parcels, he referred in round sums to the losses in particular years.  I thought it would be very helpful if we could have a round figure indicating the loss or gain in respect of each of the main Departments of the Post Office.  I realise that, as the Minister pointed out, if you take the ordinary postal service&mdash;the letter delivery&mdash;so many departments intermix and overlap, it is impossible to detach the different costs, without an expense which would be probably greater than any advantage that would accrue.  But it would be helpful if some kind of rough estimate could be made.  However, the Minister has shown that that is not practicable within anything like accurate limits.</P>
      <P>I think it is generally admitted that the Post Office service&mdash;particularly the collection and delivery of communications in the form of letters and written messages&mdash;is not a service that is going to be profit-making in this country.  The more thickly populated areas, having the greater amount of correspondence&mdash;that is to say, the cities&mdash;will have to bear some of the cost of delivery in the sparsely populated areas in the country.  We have to regard it as a public service, the cost of which is borne by the general community, with such limitations in the way of charges as may be considered fair in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that in this country the system of &ldquo;zones,&rdquo; which has been suggested&mdash;that is to say, making a lower charge upon a Dublin citizen for communicating with a Dublin citizen than would be made upon a Dublin citizen for communicating with a citizen of Galway&mdash;would be fair and equitable.  A Galway citizen writing to a friend in Dublin would be mulcted in charges disproportionate to those of <Col N="2172" /> his friends who might be writing from Dublin.  So far as the general postal service or letter delivery is concerned, I think the present system is perfectly sound.  But when we are told that the loss on telegraphs and parcels is so very heavy, it does raise a question as to whether the whole community has a right to bear losses in respect of service to particular sections of the community.  It will be admitted, I suppose, that the telegraph service, for instance, is disproportionately used by the distributive trading element in the country as contrasted with, say, the farming community and the general working-class population.  We have reason to believe that a particular section of that business community&mdash;I use the term for want of a more courteous designation&mdash;a fraternity which depends for a livelihood upon betting, and a large number of the general public who think that their chances of prosperity will come through betting, make disproportionate use of the telegraph service by sending and receiving telegrams relating to bets.  We have fairly general knowledge of that, but it may not be quite accurate.  The Minister may, perhaps, be able to assist us.  I wonder whether it is fair to the general community that this big loss on telegraphs should be borne by the general public, having regard to the unprofitable facilities given for this particular kind of business.</P>
    <P>As regards parcels, I suppose there are abnormal losses on parcels, and one sees that the parcels delivery is mainly on behalf of the distributive trades. That is much more easily defensible. But it is a question whether this kind of public subsidy to the business community should be borne without recognition. I am rather inclined to call attention to the fact that the distributive section of the business community is being subsidised by the general community in this matter.</P>
    <P>I was astonished at the doctrine preached by the Minister yesterday afternoon regarding his duty in respect of productive work at the Post Office stores factory.  Last year, I think, the Minister told us that this factory was moving ahead prosperously.  This year <Col N="2173" /> we are told that there has been an increase in the number of employees from 126 to 250.  The Minister has told us that much of the work that is being done there is being done more economically and more satisfactorily than it could be done by any contract system&mdash;that, in fact, he has established a productive factory which is supplying the public services&mdash;not the Post Office service alone&mdash;with material more economically than similar goods could be purchased.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that that will continue. That is the Minister's position.  The country has been saved certain charges because of the economy with which these stores have been produced as compared with the position if they had been bought from contractors.  But then we are told that in time, when this institution has developed, when it is put on a sound basis, when the State has proved the practicability and the profitableness of the processes, trained the employees in methods and management and so on, it is intended to hand the whole business over to private enterprise&mdash;to a company or to an individual&mdash;to carry on.  It is an extraordinary view to take of the functions of a department: that the risks incidental to the establishment of such an industry should be undertaken by the community and that when it has proved to be profitable and satisfactory in supplying the public service it should then be handed over to private enterprise to take advantage of all the developments and of the experience that has been gained.  There are departments of the postal and telegraph service which, no doubt, could be selected and proved to be profitable. One might say that once you proved them to be profitable, once you have stood the losses and turned the corner financially, then you are to hand them over to private companies and let them make what they can out of them in the future.  That is an inversion of every idea of social development that I am familiar with.  The charge previously has been the other way round; that these undertakings are not run profitably by the State and therefore they should be handed over to <Col N="2174" /> private enterprise.  Here we say: &ldquo;We will continue this business which no private enterprise has undertaken; we will make it profitable, and then we shall hand it over, having proved it profitable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will enlarge upon this matter and give us some clear explanation of his policy and how far he would go in that direction.  Deputy Hewat, I think, suggested that the telephone service would be more efficiently carried out by private enterprise. Does the Minister visualise that when the telephone service becomes even more satisfactory than it is&mdash;and there is still room for improvement&mdash; and commercially profitable, it will be handed over to a private company; that as each Department is turned from being a losing to a profitmaking department he will then suggest the handing over of the department to a company, leaving the community to bear all the losses?  A little elucidation of his views on this matter would be helpful and interesting.</P>
    <P>There was an omission from the Minister's statement which I would press him to supply.  He made no reference to the policy of the department respecting wireless broadcasting There have been occasional questions raised and answers given to the effect that the matter was in the hands of the Minister for Finance, but I think we are entitled to some statement from the Minister as to what the policy of his Department is.  Perhaps if we knew the proposals of the Minister or had a general outline of them, we would be entitled to press upon the Minister for Finance that he should give sanction to these proposals.  The Minister has stated publicly, and I think in the Dáil, that he is bound by the resolution of the Dáil, which generally approved of the report of the Wireless Broadcasting Committee.  That committee made certain recommendations. It made alternate recommendations regarding the position of the postal department in regard to broadcasting. One was that the installation and working should be a department of the postal service.  The alternative was that the installation and working <Col N="2175" /> should be undertaken by the postal department and that the programmes might be provided by boards or associations specially set up for the purpose. The Minister's general proposals regarding the carrying out of the recommendations of the committee, which he says were approved by the Dáil, should be presented to the Dáil. We should know exactly what the position is in regard to this matter. There are people who have a definite business interest in the question as to whether there is to be a business associated with broadcasting or not.  If there is not to be, then these people will know how to carry on their own business operations.  Certainly, some decisions are due to them, as well as to the remainder of the community who would desire to enter upon the enjoyment of broadcasting, or, shall I say, suffer some of the tortures that &ldquo;listening-in&rdquo; creates.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is to be congratulated on the very able statement he made last evening.  We all know that he has a very difficult task in carrying out his duties.  I am sure it would be very pleasing for the Minister to come here as head of his Department and show that he was making a profit.  Instead of that he comes here loaded with huge losses in some branches of his Department.  He pointed out, I think, that he was losing something like £240,000 on the telegraph services.  In face of that figure he is called upon to lose, perhaps, £50,000 or £60,000 more on the same service.  The people who ask him to do that have a grievance, perhaps. Deputy Cooper congratulated the Minister a few minutes ago on his courtesy.  When the Minister tries to effect an economy he is told by some Deputies: &ldquo;This is a hardship; do not inflict this hardship on such a person.&rdquo; The Minister, being a Cork man, falls into the trap with that good nature which characterises the whole people of that county.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister has a very difficult task, and while we are all entitled to question him in the discharge of his duties, we should be all &mdash;and I believe we are&mdash;ready to do our best to help him.  I was pleased when he said that, even though by the use of motor-bicycles he could dispense with the services of some of the workers, he did not like to do so as they would only have to join the ranks of the unemployed.  I firmly agree with the Minister in a great many of the things he has done; for instance, the tax placed on parcels.  That pleased some people and displeased others.  As a <Col N="2177" /> result of it we thought that industries would be helped and that goods advertised in the &ldquo;Daily Mail&rdquo; would no longer be brought into the country but would be purchased in Dublin, Cork or some other centre.  When we congratulated the Minister on that tax I believe we did so because we thought the tax would be a safeguard for Irish industries, and that the idea was not to make a profit for the Post Office.  I believe if the Minister thought that the tax was not doing good and was not helping industries he would abandon it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is, I am afraid, more than any other of the postal services what we might call an abused service. It is used very largely, as was pointed out, for betting and other purposes that cannot by any means be looked upon as national assets.  To withdraw charges about which complaints have been made would mean that the service would be more largely used for these particular purposes, and that larger use would create very much larger losses.</P>
      <P>Deputy Heffernan pointed out that it costs 1/6 to deliver a telegram a distance of four miles from a post office. His idea appeared to be, and I think to some extent it is Deputy Johnson's, although he did not express it very clearly, that there should be a flat rate for telegrams.  The Deputy advanced in the argument he put forward a little along that road, but he did not go quite as far as Deputy Heffernan.  We know that in the West there are places eight, ten or fifteen miles from a post office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>In many cases the telegraph service is made use of for purposes that could be dealt with by ordinary letter post.  In fact, it would be desirable in some cases if information did not reach these places at all.  Let <Col N="2178" /> us look at it from that view point.  If we are to have a flat rate for telegrams does anyone suggest that a telegram should be delivered ten miles from a post office without an excess charge being made?  That system does not exist anywhere else.  Deputy Johnson has pointed out that the business community is being subsidised by the general community.  I wonder if we were to establish the flat rate that he proposes in this particular case for telegrams&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that anything I said would bear the interpretation Deputy Good has put upon it.  I had no thought of making a flat rate for telegrams at all.  My inclination is rather the other way, so far as telegrams are concerned, as I do not think they are in the same category as the ordinary postal services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the explanation. II do not know that Deputy Johnson, when he was making his statement, was quite clear that it did not include telegraphic services.  Therefore, it is quite obvious that that is not a proposition that will meet with any general support, even from Deputy Johnson.  We have now what is known as the flat rate for postal service.  There, I think, he was talking about the business community being subsidised by the general community.  I am not at all satisfied that the argument that applies to the telegraph service should not apply outside a certain zone to the postal service. I do not think we are quite justified in making deliveries of letters ten, twelve and fifteen miles from the Post Office without some extra charge.  However, that is a matter that I think has been possibly engaging the attention of the Minister, not from the point of view of making a charge, but from the point of view, possibly&mdash;an equally desirable one&mdash;of seeing how the expenses incurred in connection with those letters may be reduced considerably.  We should get this service down to the charges that exist at the other side. Because when we stand in the position that we are in, it becomes a burden on business, and it is desirable from that <Col N="2179" /> point of view, at all events, to be put in the same footing as the business men in the North of Ireland and elsewhere. That being a desirable object, I think the matter of creating zones for letters ought to be one to be considered.  And when you look at the latter point of view I doubt if even the postal service will justify Deputy Johnson's contention that the business community is being subsidised by the general community. I think possibly the reverse is the case, because I think if any branch of the service pays it is that branch in connection with the cities.</P>
      <P>Now, in regard to the question of this statistical or parcels tax, we were hoping that that tax might have been in some way modified.  It is a tax that has created an immense amount of trouble.  But there is a suggestion that has been made in connection with this that, I think, ought to be considered by the Minister.  The suggestion is this: Round about the festive season at Christmas, as we know, a great many presents are sent from friends in distant parts to relatives and others in this country; and I have known a number of hard cases where these poor people had parcels sent to them by relatives at Christmas and where they found that these parcels were chargeable with a considerable amount on delivery.  Where the heads of the families were unemployed, and through other causes, these people were unable, in many cases, to pay these charges and the parcels were taken away.  I understand that in other countries where a similar tax exists, around the festive season power is given to relax the tax. If something on the same lines could be done here, by way of relaxation of this tax, there would be no serious loss to the Post Office.  I think the Dáil would possibly be inclined to agree with that principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other point on which I would like to say a word would be on this question of workshops that has been referred to by the Minister, and also by Deputy Johnson.  That, I think, we all agree, was a desirable enterprise on the part of the Minister. He pointed out to us on several occasions that he had difficulty in getting <Col N="2180" /> the quantity and class of material that he required for delivery in a short time in many cases, and in other cases he found owing to the high charges that he was able to manufacture these different commodities at a lower rate. That was particularly desirable during the period when he was extending, or, in other words, when he was laying down a great deal of new works.  But there comes a time, of course, when capital expenditure of that kind comes to an end, when there is not sufficient work to maintain a factory or workshop of that dimension on ordinary maintenance work.  If the Minister were to retain the workshop for the purpose of ordinary maintenance, it is quite obvious that he would have to part with a great many of his skilled hands who had been trained in the workshop.  Therefore, from his point it is eminently desirable, in order that these men should continue at the work at which they had become skilled, that he should hand over that workshop to others who could take orders from outside Government departments, and from other countries, and so continue those hands at that particular work.  I am sure that when Deputy Johnson comes to consider the proposal of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, knowing that he, like other Deputies, is in favour of finding continuance of employment for workers, will agree that the policy of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is a very desirable one.</P>
