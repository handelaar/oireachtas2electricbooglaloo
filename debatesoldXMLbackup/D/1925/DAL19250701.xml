      <P>I beg to move that the leave of the Dáil be granted to have printed and circulated the Dublin Reconstruction (Emergency Provisions) (Amendment) Bill, 1925.  It is a Bill to amend the Dublin Reconstruction (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1924.

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two or three points which would appeal to Deputies if they had the measure before them.  It is intended, as the Minister says, to expedite the building on sites where property was destroyed either in 1922 or, in certain cases, in 1916.  It also remedies a certain infirmity which was not foreseen and which only recently came under notice in connection with the compensation paid to, or advantages to be derived by, persons who held leases in respect of certain property.  What has happened is that in a few cases landlords got paid rents and rates in one amount. Under a recent provision of the Local <Col N="1848" /> Government Act it was intended to give the benefit of the lower rate for a few years to the tenant in occupation. In the case of this measure provision is being made for the tenant to get that advantage which, in the ordinary way, would have accrued to the landlord.  As the landlord was not under any exceptional expense in connection with the matter, it was thought only fair to make the position of the tenant secure.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move that permission be granted to introduce this Excess Vote.  It is unlikely that any discussion or controversy will arise in connection with it.  The Minister for Finance, in placing it before the Dáil, is doing so in accordance with the recommendation of the Committee of Public Accounts, as expressed in their first report, which has been placed before the Dáil.  The circumstances under which the excess occurred have been fully explained in that report, being fully set out at the end of the statement. The sum of £10 specified in this Vote is a token figure.  The actual excess on sub-head D (3) of the Fisheries Vote was £7,448 19s. 6d.  This is more than off-set by savings from other subheads and a surplus on the estimated Appropriations-in-Aid.  The authority of the Dáil is necessary in order that the excess may be made out of the surplus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>After the moderate and dispassionate statement made by Deputy Johnson on this matter, I should be very slow to offer any contribution to the debate if one or two things did not emerge very clearly from the contributions made by Government supporters yesterday evening. One thing was the evident want of knowledge of the condition of affairs in the country.  That emerged very clearly from the debate and it shows that the Government and its supporters are entirely divorced from the realities of the situation throughout the country as controlled and operated on by the unemployment problem.  I feel sufficiently my responsibilities to think that it is the duty of every Deputy in the Dáil to put before the Government the knowledge at his disposal so that the Government may have no claim to be able to say that they were not fully aware of the situation, and to warn them that they are not dealing with a situation which may develop, and develop quicker in a more serious fashion than they seem at the present time to anticipate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy said some very remarkable things yesterday evening in his contribution to the debate.  I know he is engaged elsewhere.  Otherwise, perhaps, I would deal with his remarks in a more lengthy fashion. But he said in effect that the Party of which this Government is the spearhead had in effect dropped the democratic programme.  He said that this Government took over responsibilities from an alien Government, and that in the administration and the necessary administrative machinery at their disposal there were certain defects and he said &ldquo;we are a young Government and we must study these problems.&rdquo; The studying of problems will take <Col N="1850" /> time to resolve them into their constituent parts and to show how to meet them.  But while we are studying problems, and while Deputy Mulcahy and the Government are studying problems, does he realise that there are tens of thousands and scores of thousands of people on the verge of starvation?  This is not a flourish of rhetoric.  It is hard, cold fact, and the Government can verify it for themselves. It is no use for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to come here with tables of figures showing that there is a decrease in the number of people registered at the Labour Exchange or at the Unemployment Exchanges. These do not represent a true state of the country at all.  The Labour Exchange is no index of the unemployment problem in the country. The table of figures given, no doubt, in honesty and fairness by the Minister in making his case, is not an index of the problem that has to be met.</P>
    <P>The Government said that they gave this country amounts of money in grants, that they did this, that and the other thing.  In effect the President acted as the figure in Scripture and said: &ldquo;I thank God we are not like other men, we did this, that and the other thing.&rdquo;  He said &ldquo;we gave important grants to unemployment insurance.&rdquo; True.  But was there not a need for it?  Was there not a need there?  What has happened since to do away with that need?  Have your tariffs increased employment sufficiently to do away with the need for unemployment benefit for the thousands who are unemployed and starving? I suppose I would be told it is not the duty of the Government to provide employment.  I suppose I will be told that the Government has other functions to perform, and is carrying them out.  If the owner of millions of money in the Irish banks to-day was in danger of having his deposit receipt taken from him, and he made a representation to the Minister for Justice, he would send a body of the Gárda Síochána to protect him.  If there was any danger to the community the Minister for Defence would send a body of his military to protect it.  But <Col N="1851" /> here you have a body of citizens who have rendered good service to the State for perhaps 20 years or more, men who have given of their best to the State, and they find themselves at the moment faced with a situation that they have services to offer, and there is nobody to buy these services.  They find that they are capable and willing to do work, and that there is nobody to employ them.</P>
    <P>The Minister says: &ldquo;No matter what demonstration is made before us the Minister for Justice will protect property and the Minister for Defence will protect your country.&rdquo;  But here are thousands of people whose lives are in danger and there is no Minister to protect their lives.  We have been told that we hammered our way through the civil war to settled conditions.  But in this case you are striking men not in their political convictions but in their most vulnerable points.  Wherever a revolt was brought about in the past history has always justified the men who revolted because of the starvation of their women and children, and history will always justify it.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the condition of affairs that existed when the Unemployment Insurance Funds went into debt, reverting to the conditions that existed after you had relief schemes brought about, I have gone through some of these districts.  I have been through my own town of Ennis at Christmas, when I saw people having to wade knee deep through floods in their houses in order to get into their beds, that were raised on boxes so as to keep them from the damp.  And these men were not working for six months previously. They could not get work.  Yet the Minister says: &ldquo;Because you did not work for six months previously we are going to penalise you.  We will not give you Unemployment Insurance.&rdquo;  John Stuart Mill, or somebody, said something about robbing the poor because they are poor.  Evidently the Minister for Industry and Commerce has read his John Stuart Mill with effect, and intends to put it into practice.  The President talks about balancing the <Col N="1852" /> Budget, that it must be done, that there are burdens to be met which you cannot go and impose upon the people. We are accustomed to hearing such phrases bandied about.  One might say that the present Government is a Government of phrase-makers.  &ldquo;Balancing the Budget&rdquo; is one of the phrases. &ldquo;The will of the people&rdquo; is another; &ldquo;the work of the nation&rdquo; is another; &ldquo;the bond we put our hand to&rdquo; is another. As the Government has given a lead in phrase-making, possibly the unemployed may take the lead and start phrase-making.  You may find phrases flung about very soon like these: &ldquo;The hungry cannot steal&rdquo;; &ldquo;the homeless cannot be in illegal possession&rdquo;; &ldquo;the needy cannot take illegally.&rdquo; They may translate these phrases into action and the recoil of the scourge may be more serious than you think.</P>
    <P>We were told that we were getting the dole.  It is no such thing as a dole. The Government, under the Unemployment Insurance Act, contracted to do a certain thing, if the employer and employee did a certain thing.  That was part of the Government contract. The Government is simply fulfilling its part of the contract. It is the difference between, in some cases, the cost of production and the price of the finished article finding its way through devious routes back to the person who gave the greatest amount of labour in the production of it.  This is no such thing as dole.  You might as well tell me that the remission of rates is dole, that the increased Agricultural Grant is dole, that the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act is dole. It is not dole.  This is a duty imposed upon the State&mdash;the duty of keeping alive, for the service of the State, a certain number of people, who have no means of preserving themselves except what they get for their labour.  This is not a time for emphasising what is obvious.  This matter ought to be obvious to members of the Government. You have thousands of people, with their dependents, in danger of starvation, and you are pricking a sore that may cause more trouble than you imagine.  Our complaint is not that you have not realised the seriousness of the <Col N="1853" /> problem at other times.  Our complaint is that at present when the need is most acute&mdash;at a period of transition, if you like, between absolute need and partial or comparative comfort and prosperity &mdash;that you decline to take action, that you decline to do what is the obvious duty of a Government, to protect the lives of its citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. JOHN DALY Mr. JOHN DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHN DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a large amount of unemployment in the country, but I believe it could be remedied in great measure if Deputies would, in the first instance, recommend useful works in their districts to the Executive Council and if the Ministers of the Executive would, on their part, agree to carry out those works.  We all know that forestry is a very useful work, and a work that, at some future period, perhaps in thirty years, will pay a big dividend.  At the present time, there is a considerable amount of land which is unused and which could be acquired for this purpose very cheaply.  If the workmen engaged on this work got thirty-five shillings per week, out of that thirty-five shillings, ten shillings would go back to the Government by way of taxation on the pint of stout, tobacco and the other requirements of the workman.  I think it would be much more useful to deal with the workman in that way than to force him to degrade himself&mdash;many workmen regard it as degradation&mdash;by standing outside an office in the town, waiting for what he thinks is due to him, but waiting very often for disappointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often we forget that there are many people not entitled to this unemployment benefit at all.  I assure you they have just as good appetites as the chap who draws his benefit from the unemployment office.  Their children, too, are just as needy.  There is, for instance, the agricultural labourer, but there are also trades people in the country who should be on the dole, and there are a great many shopkeepers who should be on the dole, on account of recent legislation.  There is another useful work that could be carried out. There is not a Deputy here who does not represent a constituency in which there are a lot of dangerous corners. To deal with these corners would give <Col N="1854" /> useful employment.  We are anxious to encourage tourist traffic in the country. But the tourists are in danger of driving on top of donkey carts or on top of some other tourist when negotiating dangerous corners.  The work of dealing with these corners would give useful employment and could be tackled immediately.  Anything, to my mind, would be better than what is called the dole.  There is no dividend from the dole.  The kind of road-making we were treated to for the last two or three years, though it was absolutely necessary and a very good thing to get the money for it, was not permanent or lasting enough to give any real encouragement to the people.  There is, then, £600,000 of an Agricultural Grant, and to my mind that grant should only be given as a kind of subsidy to farmers who would break up their land, give employment, and produce more food.  It is a pity to think that a man with 600 or 700 acres, who will not break up any of his land, should be getting the same benefit as the man with fifty acres, who breaks up fifteen or sixteen acres and produces a lot of food.  To my mind, that is the proper way to tackle the problem of reducing the cost of living.  Let us set the example and flood the markets here with food.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Cheap food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>If the labourers and farmers would make common cause, come together and produce more food, that would relieve unemployment.  It would relieve it in two ways.  Firstly, the food would be cheaper&mdash;wages would go further&mdash;and secondly, it would give employment to the unfortunate workers who are knocking about the roads idle.  There is another matter also.  In different districts compensation was allotted to men for having, perhaps, their mansions or some other property burned.  They were to get twenty, thirty, or forty thousand pounds to do what they would like with it.  I think it should be made a condition when they are getting this money that a great portion of it should be invested in housing&mdash;let the housing be the property of the man who was <Col N="1855" /> entitled to the money, if you like.  That, in its own way, would give employment and would be a safe investment.  I hope the House will take a note of the few things I have marked out, and I am certain that in the near future, if they adopt these means&mdash;forestry, the breaking up of more land, the joining together of the labour interests and the farmers, putting shoulder to shoulder to produce more in the country&mdash;that will be one of the best methods to get out of the tangle we are in at the present moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>During the time one has had the privilege of being a member of this House one has heard many discussions on this interesting problem of unemployment, but during all these discussions very little information of a constructive character was put forward whereby one might look on these discussions as being of a useful character. The discussion that has taken place here during the last two days has partaken very much of the character of the discussions that we have had previously on this subject.  We have listened on this occasion, as on previous occasions, to interesting speeches, able speeches, from the benches of the Labour Party, but one has listened in vain to these speeches for one constructive proposal whereby this problem, which is not a new problem, might be dealt with.  I think I can say with all fairness to those who have spoken on this subject during the last two days that not a single constructive proposal has been put forward to deal with this problem.  The one proposal that has been dinned into the ears of the Government and the members of the House is: &ldquo;Provide either the dole for us, or provide relief works, whichever you like.  We do not mind which you do, but do either one or the other.&rdquo;  With all respect to these Deputies, that is not the way we ought to deal with this problem.  That is only putting off the problem to another day and making the problem more difficult.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asked what my <Col N="1856" /> proposal is.  May I first of all state the case as one sees it, and then we will be better able to understand what is the best way of meeting it.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in his speech on yesterday, drew attention to the seriousness of the economic problem as disclosed in the railway situation to-day.  Let us look into that problem for a moment.  We find when we come to discuss the question of costs in carrying on the railway services that we are up against two questions: that on one side we have in the Free State to-day a scale of rates 100 per cent. in excess of pre-war rates.  In Great Britain, the percentage of the rates to-day is 50 per cent. over the pre-war level.  In Northern Ireland the rates are 75 per cent. over the pre-war level. Notwithstanding the fact that the railway charges here are 50 per cent. in excess of what they are for similar commodities on the other side, we find the economic situation is very considerably worse than it is on the other side or in Northern Ireland.  Now as one inquires further, even with these high rates the railways are in a serious financial situation.  Why is that?  The cost per ton of carrying commodities and the cost of carrying passengers is considerably in excess in the Free State of what it is either in Northern Ireland or on the other side.  Not alone are the wages, as paid to the railway employees in the Free State, in excess of what are paid to employees in a similar situation in Great Britain, but we have conditions attached to the services in the Free State which are wholly unsuited&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry to be worrying the Deputy so much, but to get at the bottom of these problems it is necessary occasionally to bring out these home truths.  I am not bringing out this particular case with the object of causing any irritation.  I am satisfied <Col N="1858" /> that the way to settle these problems is not by bandying words across the floor of the House, but rather to get the two sides concerned in these problems to come together to discuss their differences and see if some mean course could not be arrived at whereby this poor country of ours might be benefited.  That is the idea I had in bringing forward this idea.  We heard the statement yesterday from Deputy Johnson ratified by other Deputies&mdash;it was not the first occasion on which we heard it&mdash;&ldquo;Either provide work or provide the dole.&rdquo;  That was put forward in the spirit that these men have tried, and have failed, to get work.  I hope I am fair to the Deputy in saying that these men tried their best to get work and failed, and that, consequently, being unemployed something should be done for them.  That may be true of some, but it is not the whole truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the last few years a big effort was made in the city to restore the ship building industry.  A great many years ago this industry was a very thriving one, but it lapsed for reasons that I will not go into now.  An effort, however, was made within the last few years to revive it.  Considerable sums of money were invested in two companies which had yards in the city. When work was started in them, it met with a considerable measure of success. Many of us were delighted to see the number of ships that came into the city, and to hear the noises which the industry created as we passed up and down the river.  A period, however, occurred in that industry such as occurs in all industries.  Following on the boom period during the war, it was necessary to make a reduction in the wages paid in that industry here, a reduction similar to that made in industries of a similar kind on the other side of the Channel and in Northern Ireland. I should say to those who are not initiated in the details of that industry, that in order to get work Dublin had to compete against Liverpool, the Clyde, Belfast and other ports, and of course in all these cases the work went to the lowest tender.  As the rate of wages in Dublin was higher than the rate of wages paid for similar work in <Col N="1859" /> other places, it is quite obvious that the cost of carrying out work in this city would be proportionately higher than in other places.  While those engaged in the industry in other places agreed to a reduction in the rates paid, those employed in Dublin refused to agree to that reduction.  The consequence was that the yards were closed. When they had been closed for a period of practically twelve months, and when those promoting the industry had given up any hope of being able to reopen them or of being able to carry on work successfully, then labour came to its senses and found out that it was useless to maintain the attitude that it had maintained up to then.  It then agreed to accept the conditions it had refused to accept twelve months previously. What was the result of that? The result was that the whole trade had left the city and that hundreds, if not thousands, were left unemployed. Is the Government, I ask, responsible for the fact that these hundreds or thousands were left unemployed?  We hear it bandied across the House that the Government is responsible.  I hold no brief for the Government, and there is no Deputy in the House who would be more ready than I would to attack the Government if I felt it was necessary that something should be said against them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we will have the constructive proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>In the different proposals brought before us by the Government in the Budget and in other ways, their endeavour has been, and I admit it is an honest endeavour, to try and get additional industries started in the Free State.  Tariffs and other means have been adopted, not, as the Minister has pointed out, with the object of obtaining additional funds, but primarily with the object of providing additional employment.  May I speak on this subject with a little knowledge as to the views of those who would be likely to invest capital in these different industries in the Free State.  One of the first inquiries that would be made would be as to local rates.  Local charges, after all, are a heavy burden on industry.  I do not know whether Deputies on the Labour benches realise the fact that the valuations on some of these factories run into very large sums, and when you have a rate of something like 17/2 in the £ on the valuation of the city, you can understand what a burden local taxes are on a new industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industries in these days are run on big lines.  We have what we talk of as mass production, and to carry on mass production means the establishment of large factories.  That means a heavy burden upon industry if the local rates are high.  Supposing that industry can be carried on and is established in a place where the local rates are little over half what they are in the Free State, I think the capitalist will pause and consider as to whether it is wise to add an additional burden to the cost of production by establishing a factory in the Free State.  Deputies on the Labour benches ask: &ldquo;What have we to do with that?&rdquo; Well, those who have experience in connection with local authorities know that the greater part of the rates, in fact, in some cases almost the entire rate, is spent in giving employment, and is spent on labour, if you like to put it that way, in carrying out the work of the local <Col N="1861" /> authorities.  The only other burden on local bodies besides paying for this employment, as some of those on the Labour benches are well aware, is in providing for a sinking fund and paying interest on the debt charge.  But apart from that I think it will be common cause that the balance is all spent on labour.  That being so, if the charge for labour is high the rate must be high, if the charge for labour is low then the rates will be low.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>And if the charge for interest be high, what then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>And the profits in the building trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Are these charges for labour high in the city of Dublin?  In my own trade, and I have spoken of it more than once in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, half-a-dozen times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>And I will speak about it again, because I like speaking of things I know something about.  In my own trade I have spoken of the rate of wages, and I will have something to say about it again this afternoon, lest Deputies should forget, although I know some of them do not like hearing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. EVERETT Mr. EVERETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you tell us about your profits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>In my own trade I stated more than once, and if my statement was inaccurate it should be challenged, that the rates of wages paid in that particular industry are the highest in Europe.  But they are not high enough for the Corporation labourer.  I would like to put a question to the Deputies on the Labour benches.  They are men of a good deal of leisure, and with a good deal of brains in many cases: will they show me any case in Europe where the wages of the ordinary scavenger are higher than in Dublin?  What is the effect of that on industry?  Ministers are anxious to encourage industry in the Free State, and these industries will be established near to the city, because it is only there that the necessary amount of labour is available <Col N="1862" /> and other assistances that are needed for these industries and what, I ask, is going to do more to spoil the efforts of the Ministry or the Government, if you like, than the maintenance of high charges and of those high rates?  Can Deputies opposite say that they have nothing to do with that?  If they have nothing to do with it, well the sooner they have something to do with it the better for everybody.</P>
      <P>There is only one further point I would like to put.  I did not intend to bring it on this afternoon, but I have complained more than once of the fact that owing to the high wages in the building trade in the Free State, thousands were unemployed that might be employed to-day if these rates were more reasonable. I made that statement before, and I reiterate that statement to-day.  Of my own knowledge I could give instances of works that could have been gone on with in the last six months but for the high cost that was necessary to carry them out, and I am quite sure if a reasonable reduction could be brought about from these peak rates of wages which are, as I said, the highest in Europe, thousands could be employed in that industry in the Free State that, unfortunately, are in receipt of the dole to-day.  Who is responsible for that? Is it the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. EVERETT Mr. EVERETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government and the employers and the contractors wanting too much profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government had its way, I am quite sure it would like to see all those engaged in that industry getting a reasonable wage.  We all like to see that.  May I say as an employer I want to see a man get a fair day's wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy tell us what is the comparison between the rates of profit in the building industry in Ireland and the rest of Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I do not want to see any man not get as much as he earns, but I do want to see that what he gets is earned.  Now, in connection with these high charges on the one side, <Col N="1863" /> one would not complain of them if fairly earned, but, unfortunately, one is not able to say that they are, and in addition you have low output.  These two factors coming together inflate cost of production enormously.  What is the result in the house building industry? It is that the cost of house building is higher in the Free State to-day than in practically any other country in Europe.  Houses built have to be inhabited by workers, and the workers have to pay an economic rent for these houses.  Consequently the rent which the worker is called upon to pay in the Free State is higher by reason of the increased cost of the building of the houses than workers are called upon to pay in any other country in Europe and by that means the cost of living is raised.  Deputy Morrissey asked what about the cost of living, but I have shown him that high wages increase the cost of living.  I have made that quite clear, and I hope we will have a considered reply from Deputy Morrissey.  I do not want to add anything more, and I really did not enter into the debate in any contentious spirit.  I would like to see these economic problems discussed, not across the floor of the House, but at a round table, when those engaged on both sides would be men who understood the problem, as was suggested several times by Deputy Corish.  Unfortunately that suggestion has not been acted upon.</P>
      <P>My constructive proposal is that I am satisfied the problem can be only dealt with by such a discussion amongst those concerned, and if I, in my position, as representing employers, can do anything towards bringing about such a conference I am at all times ready and willing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try for the moment, at any rate, to forget most of what Deputy Good has said, and endeavour to convince myself that Deputy Hewat's speech in reality represented the feelings of the humane employers of to-day.  If there is such a conflict between two representatives of employers in the Dáil as has been suggested by the contradictory speeches of Deputy Hewat and Deputy Good, we <Col N="1864" /> on these benches will be entitled to demand unity in the ranks of the employers before conceding to any extent the demands made in such a ridiculous way by Deputy Good.</P>
      <P>The discussion yesterday evening took such a serious turn, in my opinion, that one must be very careful in following the lines of that discussion.  The question of the usefulness or otherwise of Parliamentary institutions was raised, and that issue raises a very important question, and goes far beyond the ordinary line of discussion on which one would expect in criticising the policy of the Government.  Whatever one may think about good or bad governments, so long as one subscribes to the Constitution we cannot blame the Constitution simply because a bad or inactive Government happens to be in office.  I regret personally that that issue was raised, and I am sorry especially that it was touched upon by Deputy Johnson, because I am one of the members of the Labour Party&mdash;and I believe we are all one on this, and that the Dáil generally accepts it&mdash;who believes that there is no Deputy, who by unselfish work, untiring energy, and time spent, has done more to raise the status of this Parliament than Deputy Johnson.  That is why I deeply regret that the issue was raised, and that the discussion took that line, rather than the line of directly criticising the policy of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister states that it is not possible to do certain things which we demand should be done.  We know from our own experience that the Minister, when making suggestions or putting up proposals for the solution of the unemployment or any other problem for which money has to be found, is to a great extent in the hands of the Minister for Finance, who for the time being controls the purse strings of the people. I am personally aware that proposals which would tend to relieve unemployment in certain areas have been submitted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the one hand, and by the Minister for Local Government on the other hand, to the Minister for Finance and have been turned down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The complaint I have to make with regard to the failure to solve this very <Col N="1865" /> serious problem, which is the greatest of all problems to-day, is against the Minister for Industry and Commerce as one of the seven members of the Executive Council.  I believe that there is not sufficient co-operation and contact between the members of the Executive Council, who are concerned in finding a solution of the problem, to enable a solution to be found. Memoranda, as we are aware, are continually being put up by the different Departments to the Minister for Finance.  A great deal too much time is wasted by the Departments in putting forward memoranda which could be very usefully spent if the members of the Executive Council locked themselves into a room and endeavoured, as those responsible for the government of the country, to find some solution of the problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy yesterday evening told us of all the Bills that have been passed in this Parliament since the Saorstát was set up in December, 1922, and the President followed on the same lines.  As a member of the Labour Party, I have endeavoured to persuade that Party to use the Standing Orders to the fullest possible extent, in a constitutional way, to create such obstruction as would prevent those Bills from being rushed through in the way they have been.  I am one of the members of that Party who feel that too much consideration has been given to the Government in endeavouring to get many measures through which are useless to the ordinary members of the community.  We have, time and again, agreed to the suspension of the Standing Orders to allow this, that and the other stage of different Bills to go through.  If that is not consideration from these benches I do not know what the President expects from an Opposition Party, such as ours is.  The only section of the people &mdash; and it is a very small section &mdash; that has received any benefit, or is likely to receive any benefit, from the hundreds of measures turned from red, white and blue into green, is the legal profession, and I have no doubt that the legal profession for the next ten or twenty years will be very usefully employed in endeavouring to interpret for the <Col N="1866" /> different sections of the community the different clauses of the many Acts which have been rushed through without careful consideration, and which most of us do not understand.</P>
    <P>There is only one Bill, in my opinion, that would be of very much use in solving the unemployment problem.  That is the Arterial Drainage Bill.  That is the best Bill passed through the Dáil since I came here in 1922.  I believe that if the Department is ready to put that Bill into operation, more benefit will be derived from it by giving employment in that way than from any measure I know of, so far as the rural community are concerned.  I hope that on the administrative side the organisation is ready to put that Bill into operation immediately it receives the assent of the Governor-General.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy sent out a message to the new county councils, as he put it, to look at their own areas in a new and paternal spirit.  We all know that although the new local Government Act is revolutionary in regard to the alteration of the methods of local government, it places a very heavy responsibility upon the smaller number of people engaged in that particular work. They have no powers, even under that Act, to do anything in the direction of relieving unemployment, because they are limited in their expenditure by the rates that are to be spent in a particular area and, as we all know, rates cannot be increased in existing circumstances. Therefore, it is useless for any county council, no matter how efficient and competent they may be, to make a survey of the existing conditions in reference to unemployment, as they have no money at their disposal to bring about a solution of the problem. If the Minister, or the Executive Council, will promise that in each county area where unemployment is acute, they will set aside a sum of money for particular works that they may consider useful and productive, then the county councils might be asked by Deputy Mulcahy and the Government to make the survey which the Deputy now asks them to make without any money being at their disposal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy also says that it will be necessary to set up more machinery. <Col N="1867" /> God knows we have enough machinery set up to enable the Government to estimate the dangerous aspects of the existing unemployment problem.  I do not know what machinery Deputy Mulcahy had in mind, or if the machinery in existence is not capable of offering a solution in regard to that matter.  The Deputy also stated that they wanted more information.  I feel that Deputies whose duty it is to study conditions in their own areas &mdash; and I presume they visit these areas from time to time &mdash; should know the conditions and acquaint the Dáil and the Government. If any information is wanted surely the Government, the Executive Council and the Minister responsible should rely on Deputies to give information which they should have if they are aware of what is going on in their own constituencies.</P>
    <P>At the last election the Cumann na nGaedheal Party issued a programme, and one of their highest aspirations or promises as set out in clause No. 7 of that programme was &ldquo;to substitute as far as possible for the unemployment dole national schemes of useful work, including arterial drainage, reafforestation and the improvement of roads and waterways.&rdquo;  I take it that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in addressing his constituents, meant what was included in that programme. Perhaps I should say that his constituents would not be very much concerned with the existing unemployment problem.</P>

      <P>However, a Bill has been passed dealing with arterial drainage.  We know nothing, or very little, about the policy of the Government in regard to afforestation.  We are waiting for, and I hope will receive <Col N="1868" /> before the Dáil adjourns, from the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Local Government some statement on behalf of the Government in regard to the improvement of roads, how it is proposed to construct the trunk roads, the areas through which they will pass, the cost of construction, and how the money is to be raised.</P>
      <P>I want to know from the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has come to any decision in regard to the recommendation contained in the report of the Inland Waterways and Canal Commission.  The question was raised by Deputy Figgis in February, 1924, by a motion in the Dáil, and the then Minister for Industry and Commerce said in effect that until the Government were able to balance the Budget he was not in the position to make any definite pronouncement in regard to the recommendation of the Commission.  I am not going to weary the Dáil by going into the question again more than to ask the Minister if, after eighteen months' study or examination of the report, he is in a position to make any statement now.  It appears to me that the Government have no definite policy on the question of transport.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible for a Railways Act, whereby he has fixed the capital of the new Great Southern Railways Company, and in effect claims power to fix their standard charges, and, consequently, fix their earning power based on normal working conditions.  In effect that will be the result of the Act when it comes into operation.</P>

      <P>That is the policy of the Government with regard to the railways.  Did they decide on a certain policy with regard to railways ignoring the question of canals and roads and the relative position of the roads and waterways to the railways, as well as the effect of one upon the other.  I do not believe the Government, if they ever considered the transport problem, could have done so by looking at it only from the point of view of railways. Of course, Deputy Good is an expert on railway matters on the information that he gets in the library of the Chamber of Commerce.  I am surprised that Deputy Good did not find in the library&mdash;I believe there is a copy there &mdash; the existing conditions of service of Irish railwaymen.  If the Deputy took the trouble when studying railway matters to read the existing conditions of service and the terms of agreement between the railwaymen's union and the railway managers he would know that there is no such thing in actual operation in small west of Ireland stations as an eight hours' day.  There is an agreement in existence whereby there is actually a twelve hours' day in small stations of that kind.  I hope that Deputy Good will not come here again and make such statements unless he brings documents to prove what he says.  Deputy Good said that wages and conditions at small west of Ireland stations are the same as they are in Great Britain.  That is not so.  There are a number of small railways, the employees of which have agreed to work at 10 per cent. below the wages of the workers in the larger railways, such as the Great Southern, the Great Northern, and other lines. That is not the position in England.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not actually an eight hour day, as there are meal hours in between.  It is all over twelve hours, and allows the two trains that Deputy Good was alarmed about to pass through a small station without having <Col N="1870" /> a double staff.  I do not want to say anything to prevent Deputy Good's hopes being realised when he wishes the people concerned to come together and discuss their differences round a table.  I am hopeful that will be done. As a matter of fact, the trades unions representing Irish railwaymen have never refused to discuss any question with the managers of the Irish railways. I would like that any discussion that is going to take place on wages and conditions of service should be without prejudice, and that the railway managers would come along to the meeting with documents and books to prove to the railway men, who must have some knowledge of the existing conditions in the service, that the railways are in the bankrupt condition that they claim them to be.  I deny that and I say the Minister for Industry and Commerce is quite right in the statement he has made in regard to the present financial condition of the Irish railways.  I do not want to go into any details which will prove that to Deputy Good, for the simple reason that if I gave certain information to this House which I now possess, it would point a finger at certain railway officials who could be accused of having supplied me with that information; it would give them away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will, however, cite one case, and I will make a charge, without any prejudice, against the railway company.  In the case of the Great Southern Railways, as a result of the coming into operation of the Railways Act, I say that they are not doing anything which a railway company should do to secure traffic and to maintain the traffic they had.  I say that deliberately, and I can prove it.  It is well known, and Deputies on these and other benches have spoken to me on the matter, that the railways, and particularly the Great Southern Railways, are not at all anxious to facilitate the provision of excursion trains which, as we all know, were, in the old days &mdash; the pre-war days &mdash; a considerable source of revenue to Irish railway companies.  I will give you a case in point.  A sodality attached to Westland Row Church, which always ran its excursions from Westland <Col N="1871" /> Row Station, over the Dublin South Eastern Railway, to Avoca, applied this year, as was customary, to the Great Southern Railways for facilities to run another excursion train to Avoca.  They were asked by the Great Southern Railways Company to guarantee a thousand passengers at 4/- each, a condition which was unknown in connection with excursions in previous years.  The sodality people refused to do that, and they went to the Great Northern Railway Company, which conducts business on business lines, and they secured an excursion to Warrenpoint for 5/- a head.  Warrenpoint is double the mileage from Dublin that Avoca is.  When the Great Southern Railways people at Kingsbridge found out that there was a likelihood of losing the excursion to Avoca, they offered the same conditions to the sodality as applied last year in connection with the trip to Avoca.  Those conditions were that a guarantee of only a couple of hundred was asked, and the fare was 3/6 instead of the 4/- which was demanded this year.</P>
    <P>Last Sunday, a Sodality attached to Dominick Street Church asked the Great Southern Railways Company to run an excursion to Avoca.  What was the fare quoted?  The fare quoted in the case of the Dominick St. Sodality, presumably as a result of the experience gained in connection with the other Sodality, was 2s. 3d.  Compare that with the demand for a guarantee of one thousand people at 4/-.  I challenge Deputy Good to go to the Chamber of Commerce and to bring anybody who will disprove those statements. That is one example that shows the Railway Companies are not anxious to facilitate people or to maintain traffic at the present time.</P>

      <P>I take no responsibility for any disorganisation within the administration at Kingsbridge or anywhere else.  It is the duty of the new Company to set up a proper organisation that will deal fairly with matters <Col N="1872" /> of this kind which tend to help to increase its own revenue.  I am not at all sorry for anything I did in connection with the Railways Act.  It would be impossible to nationalise the railways of this country without first taking the step that the Government took when it introduced the Railways Act.</P>

      <P>The whole story is coming out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  I said that before.  I may say for the information of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that six months have elapsed since the coming into operation of the Railways Act and to-day the most important department of the Gt. Southern Railways, the organisation of the rates department is not permanently fixed. If the organisation of the rates department, which is the principal department in this big railway combine, is not settled, and if each man does not know his duty and responsibility to the people making claims, how can the railways succeed, or how can we help them from getting into a state of bankruptcy that they themselves are creating for the shareholders and the workers? Deputy Good claimed that because the rates of English railways were 50 per cent. above the rates pre-war in Great Britain, and because they were 90 per cent. greater here and 75 per cent. greater in Northern Ireland, that was the reason why the cost of living was so much higher here than in Gt. Britain or in Northern Ireland.  I deny that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What effect would a reduction of 1/- per ton have in reducing the cost of living to the consumer who buys tea? None whatever.  The same would apply to all articles included amongst the necessaries of life.  The fact is that although the rates have been reduced by 50 per cent. on the railways of England as compared with Ireland, in England the unemployment problem is worse to-day than it is in Ireland. The reduction of railway rates has nothing whatever to do with the high cost of living.  I wonder would it be an unfair demand to make of Deputy Good that when a conference takes place &mdash; as I hope it will &mdash; between employers connected with different industries and the people <Col N="1873" /> who represent labour, representatives of the trade unions, the employers should come to that conference prepared to join with labour in trying to bring about a solution of the profiteering question, or will endeavour at least to assist labour in endeavouring to solve that problem?  If the employing classes came to the conference with that intention, and promised to join with labour in bringing in legislation or bringing pressure to bear on those responsible for profiteering, that would be dealing with one of the most dangerous forms of irritation that exists amongst the workers and the unemployed. Deputy Good referred to the question of the wages of railway workers.  I wonder does he know that in the City of Dublin, where the cost of living is so high &mdash; much higher than the figures supplied by the Government would indicate &mdash; that an average railway porter has a wage of £2 9s. a week?  Take an ordinary railway porter at Kingsbridge.  He has a wage of £2 9s. a week.  He shifts Guinness's barrels out of the brewery, and the worker who fills the barrel, or cleans it when it is empty, is getting a wage of close on £5 a week.  We hear nothing at all from Deputy Good about the rates of wages of brewery workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>What rate would the same porter get at Holyhead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Certainly not. I wonder would Deputy Good be prepared to admit that the man who filled the porter barrels and the man who cleaned the porter barrels <Col N="1874" /> when empty, rendered greater service to the community than the man in charge of the signal cabin at Kingsbridge who holds in his hands the lives of the travelling public?  When studying the matter again before he comes forward to magnify the problem and refer to the wages of railway workers and working men generally, I think he should speak of the position of the two classes of employees in two different industries working alongside each other.  Now, I have every hope that if the railway people in authority, if the high officials and the directors particularly will only set themselves down and spend sufficient time in the board-room at Kingsbridge studying the position and the conditions of the railways to-day and endeavour to find out where the traffic has gone from the railway companies during the last six or eight months and how best to secure its return, they will get a solution of the problem.  Though the case is serious from the point of view of the shareholders there is only one thing that I regret in the Act and that is that the shareholders cannot meet to criticise the new management before next year. Because if it were possible for a meeting of shareholders to be held I could give shareholders valuable information and I could put their fingers on what is wrong in the working of the company. The Press in leading articles to-day criticises and blames the Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the position of the railways. The leader writers and the papers that are very closely associated with and very nearly related to many of the directors could, if they only examined their own consciences, put their fingers on the weak spot as to what is wrong in the working of the railways to-day.  It is no use to come along and to blame the Minister for Industry and Commerce if there is disorganisation. If there is, and I state there is, disorganisation in the administrative machine that is working at Kingsbridge to-day it is the fault of the railway directors and principal officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAlexanderNagle" hpid="Mr. NAGLE Mr. NAGLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very much struck by Deputy Good's opening remark and, as he progressed, I was reminded very strongly of a story written by the late <Col N="1875" /> Jack London called &ldquo;The Iron Heel.&rdquo; I will not take up the time of the Dáil at any length with that story.  The point that I want to make from the story is that Ernest Everard, the principal character in that story, was a great agitator and socialist.  He was invited to meet the members of the Philomaths Club, a club in San Francisco, a club that catered for all the elite in the business and financial world.  All the intellectual leaders in that part of the country were members of the Philomaths Club. They met once a month to discuss pressing problems and to enjoy themselves in intellectual matters.  Ernest Everard, in going there, was asked to meetings and a lot of people looked upon him as rather a beast of the underworld.  His opening remarks led them to believe he was quite a harmless beast, but there was a free fight in the end.  He opened his remarks by saying that he was a young man who had read a good many of what are called society novels, and in these he always learned that the rules of society and the leaders of business, and so on, were men of wonderful intellectual ability.  He had the impression that they had become leaders of society and leaders in financial matters because of their wonderful ability.  He went on to say that through years of study of the problems which they had failed to solve and because of years of contact with these men his initial views of them had been completely altered.  Well, I have not had as much experience of the leaders of society and the leaders of the financial world as Everard is supposed to have had.  At the same time I came to the very same conclusion as he came to, in as much as when I was young my impression was that it was only wonderfully clever people who got on in this world, and who deserved to get on.  But after meeting, during the last six or seven years, the successful men in this country, the men who claim to be able to rule, and who wanted power to rule the financial world and to rule the country's destiny, I have come to the conclusion that when you come close to them and examine them carefully you find they are not quite as <Col N="1876" /> clever as they themselves and some of their apologists in the Press would have us believe.</P>
      <P>Deputy Good began by saying that on a good many occasions this problem has been discussed, and that it has been discussed here, and that a good many members on the Labour benches talked and talked, and he was good enough to say that they made many admirable speeches in a sense, but he concluded by saying that never on one occasion was there a constructive proposal put forward.  When I heard him say that I pricked my ears.  I was anxious to hear the termination, because I thought we were going to get that constructive proposal which had always been lacking in the speeches made from these benches.  His constructive proposal amounted to this: Let there be a Round Table Conference between the representatives of the employing classes and the representatives of the wage-earners in this country, and he was perfectly sure that from that would emanate some solution of the present unemployment problem.  Before he came to that conclusion he talked about wages in the building trade, and he talked about wages in the shipbuilding trade, and other things, and he led us to believe that, in his opinion, the reason for unemployment, particularly in the shipbuilding trade, and he wanted to imply in every other trade, was that the workers were demanding too much wages, or that the workers were too pig-headed to accept the suggestions of the employers and to accept smaller wages than they had been receiving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that is finally his constructive proposal, and certainly I must say that it falls far short of what I was led to believe and expect.  I will test that by a statement that I am to make, and in that statement I will ask Deputy Vaughan, who represents in the Dáil the same constituency in the County Cork, to bear me out.  That statement is, that for the last four or five years, when there were strikes and lock-outs more prevalent in this country than they had been, that there was not, I think, one case of a strike or lock-out in that part of the County of Cork known as the Parliamentary Constituency of <Col N="1877" /> North Cork.  Now in spite of the fact that there has been no such thing as a wages dispute, and that the wages there have never been very high, there is a great deal of unemployment in that constituency.  If that is a fact, then certainly what Deputy Good gives as a reason for the unemployment problem does not hold good.  If I can see that in any place in this country where there has never been a strike or a lock-out, and where wages have never risen to great heights, that there has been unemployment, then we can reasonably conclude that the refusal to accept reductions of wages is not the sole cause of unemployment.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated in his speech yesterday that this was not a poor country, and he stated that the people of this country had no experience of the fruitful application of money.</P>
    <P>He led us to believe that that was one of the reasons for unemployment. If that is one of the reasons we cannot certainly lay it to the doors of the workers of this country, because the working class of this country never had any money to lay out in a fruitful manner.  We must conclude that fault lies with those who have money, the so-called business people, and with their inability, as the Minister said, to lay out their money in a fruitful manner and in such a way that it will be guaranteed a return.  I would like just to mention this.  Deputy Morrissey asked Deputy Good a question as to builders' profits.  Deputy Good did not give an answer to the question.  I will try to give an answer to that question in a few words.  Only recently there was a question of a contract for some houses that are at present being built in the Marino by the Commissioners of the Dublin Corporation.  Certain persons approached me in the matter with a view to my seeing the Secretary of the Housing Department of the Ministry for Local Government and Public Health, with one or two others.  It was put up to me that a certain contractor who wanted the contract had cut down his prices for the contract to the very lowest figure that he thought would pay him to do the work.  He admitted to my informant that the amount of <Col N="1878" /> profit per house that he had allowed for in his contract price was £30.  The contract at the time was one for 200 houses and another for 216 houses. Take the even figure to save any mental process.</P>
    <P>Two hundred houses at £30 per house, as a minimum profit &mdash; and he would insist on getting that, and would not cut down the price by a single shilling &mdash; meant £6,000.  I have not the exact figures, but I saw some years ago, when the Fairbrother fields houses were being built, that the bricklayers' wages came to about £30 per house.  If the bricklayers engaged on the houses being built for the Dublin Corporation agreed to forego a considerable proportion of their wages, or even if they agreed to work for nothing, they would only save what, to my knowledge, is going into the pockets of a particular contractor in the shape of profit.  These are things that should certainly be considered when people are putting forward what they call constructive proposals, which mean nothing more or less than that before any remedy can be got for the unemployment problem, reductions of wages must be accepted.  If the bricklayers, in the first instance, had worked for nothing, they would only save what a particular contractor was expecting to get in the shape of profit. We have been told by the President, and by the Minister, that certain things have been done.  I am quite willing to admit that certain things have been done, which we hope will be to the advantage of the people of this country.  We can take, for instance, the Trades Loan (Guarantee) Act, though it is a comparatively small thing.  Then the Beet Sugar Bill may turn out well.  There is then the Shannon scheme.  Everybody in the country expects that the Shannon scheme will be beneficial to the people.  Only to-day an unemployed worker in the city of Dublin called me, as I was passing, and asked me almost with bated breath was it true that the Shannon scheme was going to be dropped. Somebody had misread some statement in the newspaper, made in the Dáil or Seanad, which led him to believe that the Shannon scheme was going to be <Col N="1879" /> dropped, and he was in great panic lest it should.  I told him that, so far as I knew, that statement was not true, and that the promises put forward by the Minister would be put into operation in the near future.  I am quite willing to admit that that man &mdash; or, for that matter, any unskilled worker in the city of Dublin &mdash; may never be engaged on the Shannon scheme, because there are plenty of men of the unskilled labour class to be got in the vicinity of the Shannon to do the work.  Still, the fact that this unemployed man in the city thought it was a pity that the Shannon scheme should be dropped shows that he, and probably many others, are looking to that scheme with hope.  I look to the Shannon scheme with hope, too.  I look to it with hope, not merely for the reason that it will give employment to skilled and unskilled workers in the putting up of the dams and the building of the banks, but because of the benefits that will accrue to the people of the country when the scheme, some years hence, is in full working order.  While we acknowledge the benefits that the scheme is likely to bring to the people, I would remind Ministers and Deputies that the average man out of employment, while he may be hopeful of benefits from the Shannon scheme, will not be in a position to take advantage of the benefits some years hence, if, in the meantime, he is not able to get two or three meals a day.</P>
    <P>Everybody seems to have taken credit &mdash; judging by the tone the remarks were made in &mdash; for the fact that they did not believe in the dole.  I am not so virtuous as all that.  I believe in the dole.  The dole is a very useful thing.  Unemployment benefit is a very useful thing.  The Minister himself said on the last occasion, when introducing a measure to extend unemployment benefit, that this amount of money, made available for unemployment insurance benefit, would do more good by that means and cover a greater number of hungry people than would be the case if the same amount of money were put into some other scheme.  I agree with that.  But while I agree that the dole is useful, and <Col N="1880" /> even necessary in times of crisis, at the same time, I would not close the door against any kind of relief work of a constructive nature.  I suggest that the Government should use as much money as they can make available on relief works of a constructive nature. During the past four or five months the Land Commission administered a certain amount of money that was made available for relief works&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>It was Wexford's loss that it did not get it.  In the administration of this money, inspectors, sent down to the different areas by the Land Commission, saw that the work that was being done would be permanently useful.  In most cases, the money was spent on reconstructing or making negotiable roads to bogs, and in connecting one main road with another, so that the people going to church or the children going to school or the people going to market in the nearest town, would have a shorter route and, perhaps, have to traverse from three to five miles less than they previously had.  There are many areas in this country, including the County Cork, where money could be spent very usefully on works of this nature.  Last year there was a failure of the turf crop, due to the bad weather.  A lot of money was spent by the Government in giving coal at one-third the market price to the people in those areas where the fuel had failed.  In a good many cases, where the turf had been cut in spite of the bad weather, a lot of it could have been carried home and used if there had been decent means of access to the bogs.  These are ways in which money could be usefully spent, in the summer months, both from the point of view of the Government, of the people getting employment, and of the people living in the particular districts. The Minister said one thing which I did not quite agree with in his speech yesterday evening.  Taken by itself, it sounded all right and could not be contradicted.  He said that this fine weather was very useful, and that many farmers had told him it was worth millions to them.  I agree that it has been worth a good deal to the <Col N="1881" /> people generally.  It has been worth a good deal even to the people who have nothing to do but walk the streets. When the sun shines, one is inclined to be more optimistic than when the rain is falling and the clouds are heavy overhead. But even in the rural areas, the sunshine has been of very little material benefit to the man who is unemployed. The sunshine has been beneficial to the people with land, who are trying to till that land.  But to the man who has no land and who is unemployed, the sunshine has been of very little use.</P>
      <P>I think that the Minister might have refrained from using that argument in a debate of this nature &mdash; that there was not so much necessity for unemployment benefit or relief work now as there was during the winter months when the sun did not shine.  Deputy Good in suggesting these conferences would expect that the workers should make up their minds beforehand, as to what the result of the conference was going to be.  There is one thing that Deputy Good strongly objects to on this and every other occasion and that is that employers cannot force workers to accept reductions of wages simply because there are agreements in existence which cannot be perhaps altered. Sometimes the employers are willing to keep agreements as between employers and employees, because they are afraid to take drastic measures to abolish these agreements and reduce wages lest some trouble might result.  I heard one instance, and I will just give it, where the trouble was got over.  As we all know, many industries are working on short time, and some of them have been closed for certain periods.  I was informed a few weeks ago by a friend of mine that the means adopted by a director of one particular business on the outskirts of the city, solved the problem.  This is what Deputy Good has in mind.  I refer to the Dolphin's Barn brickworks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dolphin's Barn brickworks were closed for some time.  There was an agreement arrived at to work at a certain amount of wages and for a certain number of hours per week.  The workers were told that they could resume work but they were informed that they <Col N="1882" /> could only resume on condition that they accepted a reduction of a halfpenny per hour in wages, and in order to make up the wages lost by the halfpenny reduction, they would be allowed to work three hours extra.  I would suggest that that is the method Deputy Good would like to see employed in all industries and by employers generally but that the possibilities of the huge loss that would be involved by a strike prevent these employers from adopting it.  Consequently they want a round table conference, but as far as I know a round table conference would be abortive unless there was a strict understanding beforehand that the workers would accept reductions in wages.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister for Local Government if the contracts where a trade union or a fair wage clause exists &mdash; and my friend suggests that I should bring this matter in some way before him &mdash; is it a breach of the fair wages clauses on any particular job or contract, to use bricks that are produced in the Dolphin's Barn Brick Works, seeing that the workers were compelled from their necessities to accept work at wages less than trade union conditions would allow, without their consent and without the consent of their organised society?  Can houses built by the Dublin Corporation Commissioners be built of Dolphin's Barn bricks, seeing that the fair wages clause does not apply to workers of the Dolphin's Barn Company?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to interrupt the Deputy, but his statement is not quite accurate.  The works referred to were closed for twelve months, and in order that they might be re-opened and have a chance of continuing, it was pointed out to the workers that it would be necessary to reduce the price of bricks in order to create a demand. The workers agreed to a small reduction of wages.  They were allowed to work additional hours so as to make up for the loss in wages.  The price has since been reduced and the demand has been increased in consequence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAlexanderNagle" hpid="Mr. NAGLE Mr. NAGLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful for the correction, but it does not alter my views in the least.  Having been twelve months idle, these men had Hobson's choice: they were compelled willy-nilly <Col N="1883" /> to work for reduced wages and for an increased number of hours or else remain on the starvation list. Deputy Mulcahy suggested yesterday evening that the new county councils &mdash; and he is rather hopeful that the personnel of the county councils was such that they would be likely to do it &mdash; should consider the conditions in their particular areas with a view to solving the problem of unemployment there.  I would suggest that Deputy Mulcahy must be altogether out of touch with the members of his party and with the Ministers of his party when he makes a suggestion like that.  What would happen if the county councils decided to spend even one extra pound annually for the purpose of relieving want, or unemployment in their areas?  I would like to say what I think would happen. Only the other day I was informed that the Commissioner appointed by the Local Government Department for the three county boards of health in Cork issued an order in the area of the South Cork Board of Health, which includes Cork City, that in future no unmarried man should get outdoor relief. Even if an unmarried man has been six months idle and has run out of insurance benefit, he is not, according to the representative of the Local Government Department in that area, to get any relief.  Deputy Hall suggests that the remarks of Deputy Mulcahy were childish.  It is not a slur to say a man is childish or that he is innocent of possible wrong doing.  That is not a very severe thing to urge against him. I suggest that he is innocent of conditions in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, if any of the county councils attempted to carry out any of the suggestions put forward by Deputy Mulcahy, next week or the week after, we would find that the Local Government Department was surcharging the members who were present at that meeting and who agreed to that proposal, or else that the Local Government Department had suppressed these particular councils and had set up Commissioners instead. Finally, I would like to suggest that <Col N="1884" /> these questions of relief work should be considered, particularly in the rural areas, where most of the workers never got unemployment benefit.  I would be safe in saying that there would be very many means whereby money spent on work of that nature could be usefully spent.  The Minister for Agriculture will bear me out in saying that as far as Co. Cork at any rate is concerned, money spent on relief work in repairing and making roads, to keep people from starvation, was very usefully spent, and the work was done as well as works of a similar nature under any other auspices in this country.</P>

      <P>I have not very much to say on this Vote, but what I have to say I hope will be to the point. I hope that it will bring us back to the realities of the present situation with regard to unemployment.  I am going to admit at the beginning, that as an attempt to side-track the whole discussion, Deputy Good's speech has been very nearly a success.  I do not wish to deal with what he said.  I think it has been very effectively dealt with by the other speakers.  I wish to put a few questions to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and to the President. I would like to know from the President what amount of money has been awarded for the destruction of property and what amount of it has been expended.  We are being continually told in this House about the millions of money awarded for houses destroyed during the last five or six years, and we have been told that this is one of the chief things that ought to relieve unemployment.  The money may have been awarded and paid to the people concerned, but what we want to know is whether the houses destroyed are being rebuilt, and whether the unemployed, or the country, is receiving any benefit from all the compensation that we have been told about.  That is one of the questions I would like to have an answer to.  I want to know from the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he hopes to have some men employed on the Shannon scheme.  When are they likely to be employed, and could <Col N="1885" /> he give us a rough estimate as to the number of men that will be employed on this scheme before the end of the year?  I also want to know from the Minister if he can give us correct figures as to the total number of unemployed in the Free State area.  I would like him to tell us what real information he has as regards the position of the unemployed in the country to-day.</P>
      <P>During the past three or four weeks I have been through most of the constituency that I represent in this House.  As a result of the experience I have had I find it very hard to sit here and listen to Deputies talking about the position of the unemployed &mdash; Deputies who know absolutely nothing as regards the condition of the unemployed. I can speak from practical experience.  I have been in the houses of these people, and I have seen several cases of actual starvation amongst them.  I went into a house in one particular town where there was a widow with six children.  There was not as much as one penny loaf in that house, nor was there any possibility of that woman being able to purchase even one loaf.  That is only one case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know whether the report made by one of the inspectors in the Ministry of Local Government and Public Health has been brought to the notice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce as regards the conditions that obtain in the Slievardagh district of Tipperary were the coal-mines are situate.  The inspector, in his report, states that the conditions of the people living in that district are appalling. He states, too, that the children are hungry, that they are running wild and half naked over the countryside, that their fathers, in most cases, are half starved, and as a consequence are ill in bed, and that their mothers are in no better condition.  That is the position of affairs in the County Tipperary, and I am not going to suggest that the conditions there are nearly as bad as they must be in poorer parts of the country.  It is certainly very hard for Deputies who have actual experience of these things, who are in close touch with these people, who know their position and their wants and who <Col N="1886" /> are with them week after week, to listen to statements that are made here in this House on this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good would probably try to be as fair as he possibly could, but it is seldom, I think, that Deputy Good would be in the house of a man who had been unemployed for four, six, or eight months.  Therefore, the Deputy could not speak from actual experience on this matter, but Deputies on these benches can.  There is no use in the Government telling us that in three or six months' time certain schemes will be in operation that will give relief to the unemployed.  What we want to know from the Government is, what they intend to do for the people who have been continuously unemployed for the last six or twelve months, many of whom are hungry to-day.  What is the Government going to do to keep life in these men so that when the schemes they speak of are put into operation these men will be in a condition to enable them to take up work and give the good return that Deputy Good and all of us hope for?  As far as I am concerned, once a man gets decent conditions of employment and decent wages I would be the first to demand that he should give a fair return for the wage he receives.</P>

      <P>I stated that publicly within the last three weeks.  I put it to the Minister, to the members of the Executive Council, and to the majority of the members of this House, that they do not and cannot realise the terrible position in which the unemployed are in to-day.  I have not the least doubt that if the members of the Executive Council and if the majority of the members of this House knew what the actual position of the unemployed is to-day in the country &mdash; if they realised how really bad it is &mdash; they would be anxious to do what they could to relieve it.  I do not think that I am an alarmist in any sense, and I do not want to make extravagant statements, but it seems to me that if something is not done immediately to deal with this question, the Government and members of this House will be sorry.  I am prepared to go further and to say this, that if these people <Col N="1887" /> who are capable and anxious to do work cannot get work, or if they cannot get legally and legitimately the means to provide food for themselves and their families, then they must get it in some other way.</P>

It is easy for people who are sure of their three meals a day to smile at these things, but I am in deadly earnest, and I am speaking of what I have witnessed myself in the houses of these people.  I am speaking of the misery and of the privations that I have seen during the last three or four weeks, and I put it to the Minister that it is his duty to provide either work or maintenance for these people.  The Minister told me on a former occassion that it was not the duty of the Government to provide employment for the unemployed, and that it was not, in effect, the duty of the Government to prevent people, if you like, from starving.  I do not think that the Minister really meant that.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey asked a question with regard to the money for compensation and as to how much of it had been expended.  The purpose of the question, I presume, is to find out what benefit that money has been towards solving the unemployment relief problem.  I propose towards the end of my remarks to give certain indications of the moneys voted and spent.  I have not included any figure for the compensation money, because I am not in a position to state that the money voted in that way will be spent, as it is impossible to put compulsion upon certain owners who have got awards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister, but there is a point I want to put.  What I want to say is this, that if the Government are not in a position to say how much money has been spent, or if they are not in a position to compel people to spend the money that has been awarded to them, then this compensation money that has been voted here for the owners of destroyed property should not be quoted as money given for the carrying out of relief schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will agree that it would be quite fair to quote it to this extent, that where a certain amount has, in fact, been spent, whether spent under compulsion or freely, to that extent it would be some contribution towards the relief of unemployment.  A question was put as to the number of men that are likely to be employed on the Shannon scheme.  3,000 men will be employed. These 3,000 men will be employed, say, in the month of November, but I should say that their employment will depend on how fast the preliminaries can go.  I have not so far been accused of being lacking in the matter of speed in regard to pushing the preliminaries, and I am not going to fail <Col N="1889" /> towards the latter end of the year in that matter.  3,000 men ought to be employed on the Shannon scheme, 2,700 of these being unskilled men.  That does not end the benefit with regard to employment arising from that scheme, because there will undoubtedly be vast numbers of engineers also employed, engineers who are equally out of work at the moment.  There will be corresponding classes drawn in in other ways.</P>
      <P>When I speak of 3,000 men employed I mean 3,000 people to be employed at excavation work.  The Deputy referred to the condition in the rural areas.  I am avoiding that at the moment, but only to postpone it for the moment.  I have what I believe to be most accurate information in regard to the position in the rural areas. If I may refer to one remark of Deputy Nagle in that context &mdash; he thought it unfair of me to allude to the benefit that the summer sun has been to the farmers.  In the first place, I did not refer to it.  It was the President made that remark.  I agree entirely with the President, but I want to make a comparison later on.  When we were setting out to consider this problem last year we decided to extend the Unemployment Insurance Act, and at the time the weather conditions, so different to what they are this year, entered into our calculations.  It was a factor that affected the town and rural worker alike, and we decided to meet the situation in two ways: to extend the unemployment benefit for those uninsurable, and with relief schemes for those who were not.  We have come to a different conclusion this year simply because the conditions are different.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Nagle also referred to the fruitful use of money.  I do not agree at all with the use the Deputy made of that argument. I do repeat again that there is not very much ability in this country in regard to the fruitful use of money, but I think it is possible that there may be a considerable number of people who otherwise would make fruitful use of the money they have but who are deterred from doing so by certain industrial disturbances in this country for years past.  I do not want to push that argument too far, but I think, at least, it is one of the arguments that can be used by people who are challenged to point out that they have money and that they have in other respects shown ability to use their money in a fruitful way. There are good grounds for people excusing themselves on the plea that there are certain deterrents in the way of ill-considered action by certain people.  I cannot agree with the observations of Deputy Davin and think so badly of the Deputy as he would lead us to believe.  He talked of Bills being rushed through the House that he could not understand, but I am afraid in this matter of unemployment a certain number of figures have run through his head that he did not understand.  He used a certain argument against me but I really want to rely upon it as an argument in my defence.  He quoted some Cumann na nGaedheal extracts and talked of certain instructions that were given in regard to schemes.  He mentioned four items &mdash; drainage, afforestation, roads, and waterways.  Now, first, the answer I make is on the question of drainage, that a Bill has been put through and even before the Bill was put through schemes had been put in operation and amounts were being spent on drainage. <Col N="1891" /> As the floods are relieved the land will be brought in for further work and any benefit that can be given to this country from drainage will be given. Even prior to the introduction of the Bill a certain amount had been given. But with the Bill passed through that work will be speeded up.</P>
      <P>There is a certain amount set apart with regard to afforestation.  It is not a big sum, only £24,000.  But there is no subject upon which there is so much loose talk and inaccurate thinking as on the question of afforestation.  I wonder if people who urge afforestation as an answer to the unemployment problem ever stop to consider what preparation is required &mdash; preparation involving the employment of very few men before you can really set out upon any big scale of afforestation.  Afforestation has been tried out in many countries.  It could be tried in many countries, where there would not be the same difficulties with regard to the acquisition of land, and dealing with owners and their rights with better results than here.  But in very few countries has afforestation been a complete answer to the unemployment problem.  Nevertheless, afforestation as a fact is there.  The amount is small, but preparations can be made and a bigger number of men can be absorbed, and if it seems the money can be spent in that way more usefully than in any other way, then afforestation undoubtedly will get its chance.</P>
      <P>With regard to roads, one would have thought that instead of Deputy Davin making complaints about nothing being done on the roads he might have been complaining that the money had been wastefully and extravagantly spent on the roads.  This year there is a sum of £770,000, which is now ready for expenditure on the roads, apart from any further big scale expenditure that may be entered upon as a result of whatever statement the Minister for Local Government has to make before we adjourn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Waterways is a question, of course, to which Deputy Davin must return.  The report of the Commission has been received <Col N="1892" /> and considered and I do not suppose anything I can say will add much to what was said by my predecessor with regard to the exhaustiveness of that report and the way it is drawn up.  But as to carrying it into effect, I have to repeat what my predecessor said, that the cost is very heavy, and that we cannot see there is any very great prospect of increasing the benefit to the country by reason of a better provision for the waterways and canals.  Two items are being attended to which were recommended by the Commission.  They are being attended to as incidental to other schemes, but as far as the general acceptance of the report of the Canals and Waterways Commission is concerned, we simply have the same answer.  We do not believe it is as economic as other things on which money may be spent, and until either money gets easier, or there is a better prospect of a return, money will not be spent in fully carrying out the report of the Waterways and Canals Commission.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to deal with the points raised by Deputy Byrne, because I am speaking now on the question to refer my Vote back, and that motion depends mainly on the question of unemployment. Deputy Byrne spoke mainly on the question of the Lucan trams and the question of reciprocity with regard to unemployment insurance. These are matters I can deal with later on the Vote itself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish has raised two points with regard to the Unemployment Insurance Act, and I do not think he has properly appreciated the position in either of the two points.  He referred to Section 8 (4) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, and he appears to think that the abolition of that clause would relieve a great number of men. The restrictive effect of the clause is very much exaggerated ordinarily.  The clause is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That where no contributions are paid in respect of any person during any insurance year he shall... be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit until twelve contributions have been paid in respect to him under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let Deputy Corish realise this: that <Col N="1893" /> a single contribution paid for a man in one insurance year avoids the disqualification under Section 8 (4).  If a man has not become disqualified, say, in the insurance year 1922-23, and he gets a single stamp to his credit in the year 1923-24, he is saved from disqualification during that year and also during 1924-25.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am leaving that to the sense of the Dáil.  A single stamp avoids that disqualification to benefit for two benefit years.  It is only at the end of the benefit year, looking back upon it, that you can say that no contribution has been paid for him in that year.  This whole thing really is a small point.  I do not think it can relieve a great number of men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>To an extent it is critical, because it marks the difference between the insurance system and something that is not insurance.  The reason behind that clause is, that once a man fails to get one stamp to his credit in a particular year he more or less goes out of the insurable classes, and before he re-enters he has to have twelve contributions.  Do not take this as a question between employment or money for those who are unemployed, as opposed to no money for those unemployed, but simply on the basis of an insurance system versus something which is not an insurance system.  The difference could hardly be refined down to less than what it is in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, if a <Col N="1894" /> man has been in continuous employment at an insured trade, say from 1912 to 1920, or 1921, if he has not one stamp in 1922, he automatically becomes disqualified from benefit, and has to get 12 stamps to bring him back again, no matter how many stamps he has to his credit before that.  Is not that the position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <P>There may be certain ways of penalising a man because he cannot get work.  That is not the proper way to look at it.  Here is a question of insurance depending upon contributions.  That is the basis of the whole thing.  It may be said that it is a wrong basis.  If the argument is that a scheme dependent upon contributions leans hard upon working people because there is that restriction, then I hold it is a weak argument. I do not hold there is any substance in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a weak argument. I submit it is a good argument in view of the fact that it was to relieve people who are <i>bona fide</i> workmen who worked for years continuously until the slump came in particular industries. These are the people, I think, insurance ought to cater for first &mdash; people who are genuinely seeking work, and have been insured continuously and working continuously. These are the people that would be brought into benefit if that clause were removed.</P>

      <P>We have it between <Col N="1895" /> us.  That is what it comes to. That is the effect of it, and people can consider how far it is an oppressive regulation.  Then there is the question of ex-Army men.  It is a small point, but the Deputy made a slip which I want to correct.  He spoke as if the only assistance given to ex-Army men was the assistance given by way of special benefit about November last. There was, of course, the assistance given by way of contributions in respect of certain men's services in the Army&mdash;men discharged before a certain date.</P>

      <P>They got sufficient contributions put to their credit which they had not earned.  If the Army is going to count as an insurable occupation for the purpose of having stamps put on, it should count as suitable employment for the purpose of having contributions denied.  If the Deputy comes to that point we will see what we can do to meet it.  Nobody has ever been refused benefit on the ground that Army posts were open and were not availed of.  If the Deputy liked to have put it on that basis, he could have been met by equalising the conditions, that you would have cards stamped for Army service and you would have Army service counted afterwards as suitable employment, so that if a man was offered employment in the Army and refused it, he would be debarred from unemployment insurance.  It is a small point.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Building Trade.&mdash;Employment continues good but skilled and semiskilled <Col N="1896" /> workers are only engaged. The ordinary labourer is unsuitable.</P>
    <P>Engineering Industry.&mdash;Employment in this industry is growing very brisk; a great increase of trade is anticipated as a result of the recent tariffs on bedsteads, etc., but it is rather premature to judge the ultimate effect on employment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hogan believes that the Government has no information as to the real figures. Having made that statement, I was about to counter him with certain labour exchange figures, but he forestalled me by saying they are no index, as people do not register.  Here is the peculiar situation we are driven to: Deputy Hogan justifies revolution on the basis of figures which he puts up and says he knows of.  He judges as to others from his own county.  That is to say, there is a state of unemployment sufficiently bad to justify revolution, but not sufficiently bad to justify people registering at the exchanges. Is it a way of protest?</P>

Even let us allow for a certain percentage of men far away from the exchanges and not coming in, whether from the difficulty of travelling or sickness.  Let us allow a percentage over what the labour exchanges show. Are we simply to take what Deputies come here and tell us?

      <P>I cannot make inquiries with regard to every statement made here.  If I made any statement with regard to Kildare that the figures will disprove, and if the Deputy wants any figures I will get them. I admit that Kildare, as well as Wexford, is a bad area, and if the Deputy will wait until I come to it, I have here a series of reports with regard to rural areas.  I am not going to make anything more out of it than that.  Deputy Hogan says there is a Minister for Defence to say &ldquo;We will protect you,&rdquo; and a Minister for Justice to say &ldquo;We will protect something else,&rdquo; but no one to say to the unemployed.  &ldquo;We will protect your lives.&rdquo;  I am going to ask him to postpone judgment until I give a series of figures with regard to matters that have been done to help to protect the lives of the unemployed, where money is actually voted to be spent this year and employed between <Col N="1901" /> now and the 31st March next, so that we can look forward to protecting the lives of the unemployed.</P>
      <P>I could not understand what Deputy Hogan meant when he spoke of this unemployment insurance of the Government as being a contract between the Government and the employee.  He said it was not a dole, because it was a matter of contract, and he said: &ldquo;Let the Government carry out its contract.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that it was not a dole; I meant to convey that.  You had three parties; the contract was between the employers, the employees, and the Government.  The Government is carrying out its part of the contract, but when the employees and employers knew it was part of the contract they paid in and, therefore, the Government was bound, according to the Adaptation Act, to pay its part.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy stand fast on that?  Will he ask me to carry out the contract made by the Unemployment Insurance Act and go no further?  If he does, I will show him that I have more than carried out my part of that contract.  I will show him that I have imposed on industrialists and on industry more than their proper share.  Does not the Deputy know quite well that these extensions have been something of an advance on the contract that he definitely alludes to?  There is no contract to pay on and on, progressively, sums of money to unemployed where there is no contribution paid for them.</P>

      <P>Let me take the arguments separately.  I am talking about the question of contract.  I am answering the Deputy, and I say that the Deputy does not properly appreciate the situation when he says that the Government has failed to carry out the tripartite contracts.  If it is merely a question of standing fast by any contract that was made by a certain Act then we have gone beyond it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the answer to that is the mere statement that the fund is a million and a half pounds in debt.  That disposes of the question of the carrying out of the contract. That amount of money was put up by the Central Fund.  Any benefits accruing to certain people have long since been satisfied and we have gone well beyond it.  Deputy Johnson has moved to refer this Vote back.  I am not clear what is being referred back.  At first as I listened to his speech last night his whole argument seemed to be that no unemployment extension was being promised, therefore nothing was being done.  Towards the end of the speech he said something with regard to whether it be by relief works or by an extension of unemployment or something else.  The Deputies have received this morning a statement in the Orders of the Day with regard to the Supplementary Estimate for Relief Schemes, a sum of money bringing up the sum previously mentioned in the Estimates to an equivalent of what was voted this time last year.  That meets the argument that Deputy Johnson himself raised, that the relief scheme voted was under consideration here.  But right through Deputy Johnson's speech and the speeches of members of his party there ran this criticism: &ldquo;If you do not extend this unemployment insurance, then we can definitely make a statement that nothing is being done.&rdquo; Deputy Johnson criticised me at the opening of his speech for saying that relief would be given on the basis of insurance, and saying that I had given certain figures which led to that conclusion. I treated the matter as one of figures where the fund can bear a charge.  I treated one matter certainly as a matter of figures, that is unemployment insurance.  It is inherent in the words that I used.  I do not see how anybody considering the figures I gave can any longer hold that the continuance can appropriately be called the Unemployment Insurance System.  I do not want to be accused of defining things by way of words.  There is a question of meeting the problem of unemployment through an extension of the insurance system.  I have said that the figures I have given show that cannot <Col N="1903" /> be done.  There are other means for meeting this, and there are certain figures I will have to give with regard to it.</P>
      <P>Possibly, at this point, I may as well allude to what Deputy Morrissey said about a phrase of mine that has often been misquoted on the matter of the functions of the Government.  I said, as reported in column 617 of the Official Report for Friday, 31st October, 1924:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I used the same phrase last night to indicate that certain pressure could be put on people, that certain tendencies could be developed, and that certain adjustments in the fiscal system could be made so as to ensure, as far as we could ensure, without interfering indirectly with trade or enterprise; but beyond that we cannot go; we cannot for the moment enter into the field of State interference or State control of industry. There is a great deal of State interference at present, but you cannot go to the point of State control.&rdquo;</P>

Deputy Johnson said last night that &ldquo;the Minister told us that nothing could be done for the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, and he has not suggested any other way of meeting the needs of those people.&rdquo;  I think that the mere fact that an extra relief Vote had been moved for, and that the Deputy knew that, should have obviated the necessity for my going into details on that matter.</P>

      <P>I am very doubtful of that.  On the 1st April the Ministry of Finance was able to look forward to certain works that had still to be done and that were likely to give £115,000 worth of employment.  That was to be given in the financial year. To that amount now is added a sum of £135,000.  There is, therefore, a quarter of a million given in relief schemes this <Col N="1906" /> year, exactly the amount voted in the Estimates last year.</P>

      <P>The point of that objection passes me.  I am suggesting other ways of meeting the needs of those people.  I may have failed to do that last night.  There is definitely this question of relief money and all the other moneys voted, excluding compensation money, which will be spent in this financial year and which ought to give tremendous relief to the unemployed. Right through Deputy Johnson's speech I got a comforting assurance, but it was an assurance that was not, to my mind, borne out by the action that he talked of taking.  He spoke of people who had not been able to form the habit of working.  He complained later of those people as being some way disorganised and they had not a way of forming the habit of <Col N="1907" /> steady work.  He spoke also of people who were not likely, or had not the ability, to keep in regular work, and of people who could not find employment. Every Deputy on the Labour benches right through, with possibly the exception of Deputy Nagle, touched on the point, and generally condemned, the mere dole as opposed to work for pay. I presume work for pay is the object and aim of every Deputy on the Labour benches, including Deputy Nagle?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the basis I have gone on this year, and it is on that basis the Government go at this period.  As to a decision in favour of unemployment insurance or relief schemes, it depends on a calculation of prices.  Last year there were many more unemployed than there are this year.  If that argument is wrong, then my contention falls to the ground.  If the argument be right, then I think it is better to have work for pay than to have maintenance.  I go further and I say that whereas the argument in favour of unemployment insurance extension, where you are facing a big number of people, is its cheapness&mdash; that is admitted&mdash;on the other hand you have the feeling through the country&mdash;I have been made very sensible of it lately&mdash;that it would be better expend half as much money again, even on relief schemes, which are not really remunerative, than to give a less amount of money by way of unemployment insurance benefit.  That was a consideration.  It was not a question of doing nothing, but a question of <Col N="1908" /> unemployment insurance extension versus relief schemes, and the decision is in favour of relief schemes.  I am queried with regard to the position of the country.  I have got a series of reports about the position in the country. They are somewhat detailed, but I propose to go through them because they have a bearing on the problem.</P>
      <P>The information is given simply county by county, and it is given in four columns.  The first is the position as regards unemployment; the second column deals with distress; the third, the extent to which unemployed have been absorbed by spring work on the land; and the fourth the extent to which unemployed are likely to be employed with work during the harvest. In Carlow the information sets out that there are no unemployed among the labourers in the rural districts, except about 50 cases, due to diminishing work in connection with road maintenance. &ldquo;Practically nil&rdquo; is the information in regard to absorption on the land during the spring.  As to the extent to which they are likely to be provided with work, it is expected that a large number of the 50 referred to will be employed on the roads next month.  The remainder will be employed during the haymaking and the harvest.  For County Cavan it is stated that unemployment is fairly extensive. Distress is not real, except in certain areas, mainly the Bawnboy rural district area.  &ldquo;Practically nil&rdquo; is the statement in regard to absorption during spring work on the land.  A fair number is likely to be employed during the harvesting operations.  As regards Clare, unemployment is not prevalent &mdash;I am referring to the rural areas, remember. As regards distress, the same remark would apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically all are absorbed upon spring work or road maintenance, and it is expected that those not now employed on roads are likely to be provided with harvest work.  That report comes from somebody who has the same method of observation as Deputy <Col N="1909" /> Hogan&mdash;his own senses&mdash;and that is his statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Cork is divided into certain areas, and I will refer to North-east Cork.  The unemployment is practically confined to towns and villages.  There was a very small absorption on spring work on the land, and the extent to which work is likely to be provided during the harvesting season is small.  The majority, unaccustomed to farm work, will not seek such employment.</P>

      <P>In South-east Cork unemployment is in evidence in parts of the districts, especially in the neighbourhood of towns and villages. An additional 20 per cent. will likely find employment during the harvesting operations.  &ldquo;Mid-Cork.&mdash;A considerable amount of unemployment in the district; very slight improvement during the spring; a fair amount of labour will be required for harvest work, if the season is good.  West Cork.&mdash;No unemployment in the district.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The resources of the Department would surely only mean a more accurate survey.  To the extent that the Deputy is without the resources of the Department, he has not the means of an accurate survey.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAlexanderNagle" hpid="Mr. NAGLE Mr. NAGLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that it is very likely that a Deputy travelling around his constituency would get more closely into touch with the unemployed, or even with the employed, than anybody else. A Government official might go to any part of rural Ireland and it would not be known that he was there, outside of the hotel where he was staying, whereas my experience is&mdash;I am sure it is the experience of most Deputies&mdash; that a Deputy can go nowhere without being known and seen.  A Deputy going through the country is waited on by scores of people asking if something can be done to give employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask if the Minister includes part of the constituency of North Cork in what he calls &ldquo;Northeast Cork.&rdquo;  I have a letter in my pocket from Rockchapel, and it says that there has not been a single day's work done by the 100 men, who were in the habit of doing casual work on the roads, since the 27th March, and of those unemployed only two men have <Col N="1911" /> drawn the dole.  I know that in North Cork&mdash;I think West Cork is even worse, but I will let Deputy Murphy speak for that&mdash;there are hundreds and hundreds of men unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Deputies appreciate the distinction that I am trying to make.  The question of road workers having been introduced makes it important that this distinction should be understood.  This report has hardly any reference to towns and villages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAlexanderNagle" hpid="Mr. NAGLE Mr. NAGLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt but this particular place I mention&mdash; Rockchapel&mdash;is seven or eight miles distant from the nearest town on the Cork side, Newmarket, which is a very small town of about 1,200 inhabitants. On the Limerick side, the nearest town, Abbeyfeale, is about nine miles away. Rockchapel is as mountainous a district as is to be found in any part of Kerry or Wicklow.  The unemployed are in a very bad way, and even the farmers are nearly on the verge of starvation, because most of them are very small farmers indeed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

I have a letter here in my pocket which states: &ldquo;I <Col N="1912" /> have a few pounds, and I will forfeit them to pay a man to come down from Dublin to make inquiries about the state of this parish.&rdquo;  If that man be not willing to pay up, I will pay the amount if the Government is willing to send down an inspector, because it will prove that we are right in respect of that parish, in any event.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAlexanderNagle" hpid="Mr. NAGLE Mr. NAGLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>

      <P>May I say that on last Sunday week, in a place called Inchigeela, west of Macroom, the local relieving officer showed me a letter he had received from the inspector of the Department of Local Government whose headquarters are at present in Cork, setting out a form of questions to be answered along the lines suggested by the Minister: &ldquo;People likely to be absorbed in spring work and harvest, cases of distress and unemployment, people receiving outdoor relief, and the best way to relieve that distress, doles or relief works.&rdquo;  This relieving officer asked me what way would I suggest that he should reply to that letter.  I told him candidly to make the best case he could on the facts as they were I can imagine if he asked somebody else who was not in favour of getting some relief works, what kind of answer he would be likely to give.  It is on answers of that kind that the Minister is basing his statement.  They are almost as bad as the Minister wants to make Deputy Hogan's statement appear.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made a statement that there is no unemployment in West Cork.  I will take the Dunmanway area, the district I live in.  Two hundred people were employed there on relief work up to 31st March last.  I make the statement now that 180 of those men are unemployed since 31st March, and I would like the Minister's inspector to challenge that figure if he can.</P>

      <P>That is, again, another simple statement in opposition to the figures I put up.  It was the same people probably acting in the same way, who got the reports of this type for us last year.  The Labour Exchanges also supplied certain figures to us last year when the other decision was made, and when that decision was come to nobody then objected to the information.  The information has come <Col N="1916" /> from the same source this year, and again it was this same source supplied the information with regard to the relief works that had to be started in the winter, and their information was then accepted.  There was no pressure put on them&mdash;if there is any suspicion of that&mdash;to give information that would be in conformity with the decision the Government had already arrived at, because there had been no decision arrived at.</P>

I prefer to have the whole thing in the Deputies' hands.  It is a matter that Deputies could not properly follow by having it read in this way, and it would be much better to have sheets issued to each Deputy in the House to-morrow.  I suggest that is much the best way.

      <P>I propose to circulate this report to-morrow.  I have just one or two things to say further. Deputy Morrissey directed my attention to the question of compensation. I am not going to refer to compensation at all.  It is not coming into any calculations I make.  The President yesterday referred to the whole Budget calculation.  He said that the Budget <Col N="1918" /> calculation hung together, that it was one statement, that both sides of that statement had to be taken into consideration.  He urged that it was not fair for Deputies to have accepted that Budget, with all it meant on both sides of the account, so to speak, and then later to come along here with other demands which definitely upset the whole calculation.  There is no phrase about &ldquo;Balancing the Budget&rdquo; this year.  There has been a certain amount of funding done but surely nobody suggests that this is a matter for borrowing.  You can borrow for debt&mdash;reproductive debt&mdash;but you are not going to borrow simply on an unemployment insurance account which is overdrawn.  The Budget had in view all the Estimates.  The Estimates that Deputies had voted prior to this Estimate coming on included the following: Office of Public Works&mdash;a sum of almost £420,000 for new works.  There was then a sum of £330,000 in respect of housing.  I think a statement has been made that that was not the only sum that will have to be provided for housing this year.</P>
      <P>Then there is the sum I mentioned of £24,000 for afforestation.  From the Local Loans Account there is the sum of £170,000, and for the improvement of estates a sum of £200,000.  The relief grants of £115,000, brought up by £135,000 in the estimate circulated to-day, make a total of £250,000.  Then there are sums from the road tax and the 6d. tax amounting to over three-quarters of a million this year, so that there is about £2,200,000 to be expended this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>So far there is nothing fixed with regard to that.  At any rate, there is this sum of £2,200,000. I do not say all this is voted as unemployment relief money.  The greater portion of it will undoubtedly be expended this year, and that must tend to help the unemployed.  There is the sum of £250,000 specifically allocated for the relief of unemployment, and the situation then is this, that there is a choice as between unemployment insurance extension or work.  We have been told that work is what is required, and money is set out here for work as against the extension of unemployment insurance.  I urge to-day what I urged yesterday, that the fund will certainly become insolvent if there is any addition to be made to it.  Certain people have had benefit extended for them five or six times, and it is no answer to the unemployment problem to select a privileged number of people and give them an extension and leave everyone else unprovided for.  A sum of £250,000 has been specifically set aside for relief works, and then in other ways you get this total of £2,200,000 which is to be expended this year.  If it can be said in face of these figures that nothing is being done for the unemployed, I cannot take that as a reasonable criticism of the efforts of <Col N="1920" /> the Government in their approach to this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The best approach I can make to give an answer to that is this: There are more or less two series of figures kept, a live register and claims current.  The live register at the moment numbers 29,800, and claims current about 22,242. Claims exhausted on our calculation appear to be about 13,000.  If you add the claims current to the claims exhausted you get the total of about 35,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that we might adjourn now for an hour, and before adjourning for an hour I <Col N="1921" /> would like to make a short reference to a matter mentioned by Deputy Good in the course of this debate: that a conference might take place between the employers and the employed or between the representatives of capital and labour, or whatever designation might be given to the two great parties in industry.  Now, such a conference would be welcomed by the Government, and anything that the Government could do to promote the industrial and commercial development of the country and that it is possible to be done will be done willingly. But I would like to point out that the suggestion of a conference raises immediately several questions.  Industrial activities or the captains of industry comprise or embrace a very large number of people, from directors of public companies employing thousands of people down to those employing hundreds, and even to those employing tens.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, labour involves equally many occupations ranging from, I suppose, national school teachers to messenger boys.  The mere calling together of such a conference of those who would be described as capitalists and employers of labour is a very simple procedure, but to get the exact people who will make the accommodation and bring about accommodation or be effective in the conference is a different proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Good and Deputy Hewat were in a position to nominate some people representing those that are comprised, say, in the Chamber of Commerce or some such institution, and Deputy Johnson and Deputy Corish or some other member of the Labour Party were to nominate equally somebody who represented Labour, the Government part of the proceeding would be willingly subscribed.  But directly that the conference meets the question of the terms of reference arises, and these terms of reference, I submit, ought to be the outcome of some sort of agreement as between the parties to the conference.  The conference ought not, in my view, to be a conference called by the Government. It ought to be a conference which would come into being, if you like, at <Col N="1922" /> the request of the Government, but the initiative and desire for accommodation and the effort at accommodation should come from the parties rather than from the Government, and to that extent, I think, the onus for the terms of reference ought to fall upon the two parties to the conference.</P>
    <P>There is very little use, to my mind, in the Government setting up terms of reference and trying to find accommodation if the parties to the conference are not themselves imbued with the desire to reach accommodation, and even though the gulf between them is as wide as it is possible to have a gulf, the fact of their coming together and realising that this problem is their problem and not the problem of outsiders ought, in our view, to make each of the parties realise that it is a question that must be solved and they are the parties to solve it.  I move that the House adjourn until 7.30.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the impression the Minister has created by his reliance on figures and moneys which have been voted and which he hopes will be expended during the coming financial year, and the figures he has given regarding the unemployment insurance fund, about the condition in the rural areas, show that he has had, perhaps inevitably, to rely upon the mere statistical side of the reports which are made available and, if I may say so, he has failed to realise or to understand the problems that we are trying to raise and put before the House.  The matter raised appertains to unemployment insurance, and the Minister, quite rightly, has examined unemployment insurance, the state of the fund, the effect of the very heavy drain upon the fund, the fact that that cannot continue on the present basis&mdash; all that, no doubt, is very true, and quite correct as an argument.  But unfortunately the unemployed man does not examine finance accounts and does not understand the difference between unemployment insurance funds and payments out of State funds; the man who is unemployed <Col N="1923" /> knows he has paid a certain contribution for years and that that contribution was increased and that it remains a very high contribution, and he believes that at any rate the organised community, the State, made provision for assistance to him in times of trouble and in times of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now it is quite understandable that actuaries and the book-keeping department and the Minister reading statistics will agree that the unemployment insurance fund is no longer solvent and that you cannot consider this matter of extended unemployment benefit as insurance benefit.  As I say, that is not understood by the unemployed man. But suppose there had been no unemployment insurance scheme of any kind. Supposing it had been maintained in the restricted sense it was when it originally began.  I think I asked this question last night: what would be the attitude of the State to large numbers of unemployed men? There would no doubt be some relief scheme and attempts at relieving the pressure of unemployment through relief schemes.  Whenever that position had been taken up in the past there was no doubt a great deal of condemnation of relief schemes because of the effect of relief schemes.  Some of the wrongful methods of the old relief schemes have been avoided in the recent ones, but notwithstanding relief schemes and the utmost that was done by relief schemes in the days gone by there was always a large number of men who were not able to get any advantage out of relief schemes and who suffered severely from unemployment and who deteriorated morally as well as physically.  If the Minister had had that particular kind of experience he would know that in pre-unemployment insurance days in bad times, relief schemes would benefit a certain number, but that very large numbers of other people never got advantage out of relief schemes if only by virtue of their physical incapacity.  It is said, of course, with a great deal of force, that all types and conditions of men with all kinds of experience were taken out of trades and called up during the war and put into the trenches and after <Col N="1924" /> a few hours' or a few days' or a few weeks' training became competent at any kind of physical labour.  No doubt that is true and it teaches a lesson.  If you propose to take a clerk or a watchmaker or a bootmaker or a saddler or any one of the various types of skilled workmen, perhaps the man working partly mentally or in a sedentary occupation who has been living at a certain rate and put him to road work, the usual kind of work done in relief schemes, there is hesitation and a natural hesitation on the part of the unemployed man to take that work for a considerable time.  That hesitation is natural because the workman feels that he has hope&mdash;and a very good thing for him that he has hope, and that if he goes to road-making and hard physical labour he may become fit for it in three or four weeks' time, but the very act of fitting himself for physical labour unfits him for the skilled work that he has been used to.  That is an aspect of this relief work that must be taken account of by the Minister, and it is an explanation of why relief work in the past before unemployment insurance was introduced was never fit for a big proportion of unemployed men.</P>
    <P>What I want to say to the Ministry is that they have inherited a certain standard of social legislation regarding the State and the individual. One of the expectations is that the unemployed workman would at least be tided over a period of difficulty, and we are unfortunately continuing to bear the brunt of an abnormal period of unemployment which the ordinary insurance scheme does not meet.  But the unemployment insurance idea is, I believe, a good one, and we ought not to think of it as being something that should be thrown overboard.  I want to suggest that what the Minister ought to do, apart from relief schemes, is to keep this unemployment insurance scheme in funds, to continue unemployment insurance benefit during the period of unemployment, and in order to avoid the risk of absolute insolvency, to make a grant to that fund.  I do not know what sum would be required. <Col N="1925" /> Perhaps £100,000, perhaps £200,000 would be all that would be required. But if the question of insolvency is the trouble, the insolvency can be got over. I would say that loans to the unemployment fund, even though it will not bear them on the present rates, may have to be repaid at higher rates when prosperous times come.  I would go so far as to say it is far better that the present unemployed people in the country should be maintained in some kind of insurance, even if in a year or two years' time, when trade is better, when we hope that the country's condition will be vastly improved, it is found necessary still further to increase the contribution.</P>
    <P>I said that the Ministry had entered into an inheritance, and part of that inheritance was the unemployment insurance scheme, that system of social legislation which included unemployment insurance.  I think it is very regrettable that we are steadily throwing overboard the advantages in the matter of social legislation that accrued to the working people and the poor.  It is said, of course, that the country is not fitted to bear the cost of this social legislation which we inherited; that it is too expensive, that the country cannot afford to be as liberal in regard to social benefits as was possible when Ireland and Great Britain were legislatively united.  Of course it is said that there are many other aspects of social and political life which have been at too high a standard, but I think it is not unfair to draw attention to this, that in the sphere of legislation, in so far as we have interfered with the social legislation that came down to us we have only interfered in the way of cutting off benefits that affected the poor.  Perhaps I am going a little too far.  We did pass a Rent Restriction Act which was a better Act than we inherited for the householder and the rent payer.  That is undoubtedly a fact.  We have legislated in respect to poor law.  Some claim that that was a benefit to the poor.  The belief however is very widespread that so far from that being a benefit to the poor it was a disadvantage.  It took away from the poor much of that benefit <Col N="1926" /> which they had hitherto been able to look for.  We altered the pensions for the old and blind to the detriment of the poor.</P>
    <P>We are now altering the social legislation respecting unemployment, or, shall I give way to the Minister and say that we are refusing to continue the extensions which, had we not had the political changes that have been made, would have been continued.  So that in respect to the aged, in respect to the poor, working through the poor law, and in respect to unemployment insurance&mdash;those three departments of social life which affected the poor people, the working-class population&mdash;we have legislated and are legislating to the detriment of the poor as compared with that which they were able to command or, if one might say, which they enjoyed in pre-Treaty days.  That is not anything to be proud of.  It is certainly something to be sorry for when one looks at the effects of our legislation and that we have not legislated to deprive, to anything like the same degree, any other section of the community of the advantages of pre-Treaty legislation.  A good deal has been said about unemployment and the remedies for it, and the absorption into occupations of the unemployed by the promotion of industry, the expenditure of moneys in one direction or another. One or two Deputies have attempted to allocate the blame for the present state of the Labour market, the glut of supply, shall I say, or the absence of the demand for labour.  With regard to the question I have raised I am not going to contend with anybody at this moment as to whether employers are responsible to any greater degree than the trade unions, whether the investing public are responsible to as great a degree as either, whether trade unions or employers, or both are equally responsible. I am not asking in this matter for any allocation of blame.  I am prepared to say, if you like, and if it is worth anything, &ldquo;let us put the whole of the blame on to the trade unions.&rdquo; Supposing that were true, still there are unemployed men in large numbers, and we as a legislative assembly, particularly the Executive Council, have some responsibility, I submit, for caring <Col N="1927" /> for the livelihood of these men who, from the fault, if you like, of the trade unions, or the employers, or anyone else, are not in a position to be masters of their own destiny in the matter of employment. They cannot go to a factory and say, &ldquo;I am going to work on this job.&rdquo;  They cannot go to a farm and say, &ldquo;I am going to work this land for myself.&rdquo;  As I said last night, they are disinherited.  They have no resources except employment, and I submit that we are bound to make some provision for maintaining them. The question, then, is what provision? Is it to be through the poor law system? I wonder does anybody maintain at this time that that is the best system to rely upon to ensure the maintenance of physical health, as well as the self-respect of men who have been unemployed for a considerable time?  As a matter of fact, the system that has been introduced is quite clearly not designed to meet that particular type of citizen in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>As to relief work promised, I do not mind whether it is called relief work or not.  I do not want to cavil over names or descriptions.  It is work which is to be set in operation of a useful kind, but admittedly it is not going to be carried through in the most economical fashion, as the best fitted men are not going to be employed on the job.  Presumably that is a fair description of what is usually called relief work.  Unfortunately it is usually used for reducing the general standard in regard to pay. For the sake of this discussion at any rate I do not want to cast any slur on relief work, in any manner, but the whole of the provision made for relief work according to the statement of the Minister, even though it were capable of being done by every unemployed man who is willing and if it were well divided right through the country, could not meet the requirements for more than two, three, or four weeks of the 30,000 men at present on the live register.  There are 30,000 men at present on the live register, and two or three weeks' work is all that is contemplated for unemployed persons.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a good deal of <Col N="1928" /> play over figures.  I am prepared to take the very lowest possible figure that the Minister likes.  He does not know, and I do not know how many unemployed men there are.  He has records of 30,000 still on the register, which is a reduction of 10,000 in two months.  But strange as it may seem, and yet familiar as it ought to be, there have been reductions of a similar kind regularly for the last year or so as the benefit year passed by.  It is in consequence of that fluctuation and the unreliability of the figures on the register that the Minister ceased to publish the figures.  He knows that the live register figures are not reliable as an index of the actual number unemployed, or even, shall I say, the comparative number, because as benefits cease men cease to register.  Suppose there were only 10,000 unemployed men, and that 5,000 of these still have benefits to draw for a few weeks, and if over 5,000 was the maximum number which, within the next few weeks will be disentitled to benefit, the fewer the numbers then we assume to be in this position the less reason there is for a refusal to extend unemployment insurance, or to extend some means of payment, whether you call it insurance or not&mdash;individual subsidies, or whatever description you like to give it&mdash;to extend those payments during unemployment.  The more effective schemes of employment are for absorbing unemployed the smaller the charge will be upon any insurance fund or any fund out of which unemployed persons will be paid.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have statistics showing that there is a reduction in the number of unemployed in this, that or the other trade, or in this, that or the other town or county; that trade is improving and that unemployment is reduced.  I should be very glad to think that that is a fact.  I believe, and I think I said so last night, that undoubtedly in some trades there has been a big reduction of unemployment. But we know, notwithstanding the statistics that might be accumulated pile upon pile, of large numbers of men who are in this position of being out of employment, who have been out of employment for a considerable time, whose benefits are exhausted and who <Col N="1929" /> are now without any prospect of work or pay or remuneration or assistance of any kind except through poor law.</P>
    <P>The Minister may as well understand that statistics, while they may be very useful to him as an index, and as a pointer as to whether things are getting better or worse, and while they may be valuable from that point of view, as a measure of the pain and suffering that the community is undergoing they are not of the slightest value whatever. The proposals of the Minister regarding relief schemes will presumably be distributed to different parts of the country.  At least the schemes will be spread over different parts of the country, and one department or another will have the disposal of the fund or charge of the schemes and in so far as it is effective, then the charge upon any insurance fund, or if the Minister does not like the term, subsidisation fund, will be so much less.  But we ought to recognise that there is a responsibility lying upon us, lying upon the State to maintain these men while employment is not available.  Put any test you like.  We may have, and almost certainly would have, differences of opinion as to the validity of the terms and conditions, and details of the schemes and proposals of one kind or another.  We may be critical, we may oppose, we may have the most acute differences regarding the terms under which schemes of work or relief and the conditions under which men are employed and the conditions under which the moneys would be received out of the funds are concerned.  But I plead with the Minister at least to maintain the principle that men who are thrown out of work through the social and the economic forces of which they are not, and cannot be, controllers, that the men should not be forced back into feeling themselves Ishmaelites cast out by the community and having to rely upon their cunning and strength as individuals and not as part of a social fold.</P>
    <P>That is what we are doing; we are throwing upon men the responsibility as units, as individuals absolutely on their own, and you are saying that &ldquo;We are no longer in any way responsible for your well-being.  We have <Col N="1930" /> done our part in facilitating employers to employ you.  We have done our part in saying to corporations and councils &lsquo;Here is money for your assistance, here is money for this, that or the other thing&rsquo;&rdquo; But do not let us be charged with having said to the individual workers who have not an opportunity of getting employment and who are denied an opportunity of getting employment; &ldquo;You are thrown now upon your own resources, you are individuals against society, and, as self-preservation is the first law of nature, you must use your natural strength and cunning to obtain the means of life.&rdquo;  It is the case of meeting the fundamental needs and I say that we, as representing the community, are reverting to the position of saying that there is no responsibility on the part of the community for the saving of the life of the individual who is denied an opportunity of participating in the upbuilding of the community.</P>

      <P>Before the question is put, I want to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will answer one question that I wish to put to him.  He first made a statement that there was a sum of £2,200,000 made available, or about to be made available, for different relief works.  The Minister assumes this money will be expended before the end of the financial year.  That may or may not happen.  I want to ask the Minister if he can tell us when he expects that that money will be in circulation, when these schemes will be started, whether he can say if it will be in one, two, three or six months, and if he can tell us what provision, if any, the Government propose to make for the unemployed in the period that must elapse between now and the time that these schemes that he talks about will be in operation.</P>

      <P>I referred to a sum of almost £2,200,000.  I should say that a certain amount of that money is actually in circulation at the moment. I cannot, of course, answer the question of how much is actually in circulation. There are new works proceeding under the New Works Vote.  Barracks are being rebuilt through the country; <Col N="1931" /> certain applications have been made and answered under the Local Loans heading, and the question of drainage that I already spoke of is being attended to.  Men are actually being employed. Men were employed a long time before I spoke here this evening on drainage works.  I do not know what progress has been made in regard to housing.  It is to be remembered that the £135,000 of which I spoke is only a vote-in-aid; it does not represent the entire amount that will be spent on housing.</P>
      <P>As I have said, there is bound to be a supplementary vote in the autumn, a new vote which will again be merely a fraction of the amount that will eventually be spent on housing.  The forestry money is being spent; some of the £24,000 has been actually spent already and the rest is in process of being spent.  I do not know anything in regard to the improvement of estates. Money is being spent on the roads very definitely at the moment.  The relief grant of £115,000 previously allocated is another matter.  Expenditure was certainly proceeding under that heading on the 1st April and from that day onwards.  The new vote of £135,000 can be easily grafted on to that.</P>

      <P>The Minister has dealt in a comprehensive way with all the departments concerned in this Vote, and I have not any detailed criticism to offer.  But under sub-head A it occurs to me to make a few remarks as regards organisation.  In this Department you have a large amount of money expended. Salaries, wages, etc., amount to £229,031.  That money is expended by what I might call a conglomeration of rather large departments, which are practically self-contained.  There is little or no co-ordination of the departments under the charge of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Some of the departments would hardly come under the description &ldquo;Commerce&rdquo; at all.  If you look at page 206 you will find that for the Department as a whole there is, under the heading of &ldquo;Minister and Secretariat,&rdquo; one Minister, one Secretary, one Junior Executive Officer, one Third Class Officer, and one Assistant Private Secretary&mdash;five in all.  We all know of the great ability of the Minister, and many, if not all, of us know of the ability of his Secretary. But in a huge department of this kind, to imagine that a comprehensive view can be taken of the duties of the different sub-departments by two men, is to realise that the burden placed on these two, the Minister being one of them, is a burden which, having regard to the necessity for the Minister's attendance here and the various other duties he has to discharge, even two supermen could not easily bear.  This Department requires co-ordination. After all, there should be one policy for the whole, and it should be conducted from the head of the Department. I suggest that, without any extra expense, the organisation of the whole Department might be considered advisable.</P>

      <P>The organisation I advocate is not a reorganisation in the sense of spreading out or adding anything. On the contrary, when you look over this book and look at the number of Ministries, I think a Geddes Committee such as was suggested, or something similar, could be very usefully employed, in seeing how many could be eliminated and how many departments could be concentrated in a fewer number of organisations.  What I am criticising is the fact that this is not treated as one Ministry.  There is no co-ordination between the different Departments in the Ministry and there could not be, either physically or mentally. If you compare the heading, Minister and Secretariat, with similar headings, in other Votes, you will be immediately struck with their different positions.  This, perhaps, the most important Vote of these Votes is treated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If that is the viewpoint of Deputy O'Connell he is quite well able to put it for himself.  In any opinion the result is that this Department, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, is not in live touch with the problems of trade and commerce in the way that it should be.  It only gets them second-hand.  I hope that is clear to Deputies.  There is just one matter under this Vote, that it might be in order to deal with under the heading of salaries, wages, allowances, etc., and that is the question of the transport and marine branch.  It comprises a number of officers including a director and the salaries amount to £12,385. There are 39 persons employed, as compared with 35 last year.  Ship-owning in the Free State is not a very extensive occupation.  You could count the number of shipowners in the Free <Col N="1937" /> State, practically on the fingers of your two hands, but the position in which shipowners have been placed in the Free State, by the change of Government, is rather a large question.  I would ask Deputies to follow me and to consider it, and I would ask the Government to give us some idea as to the policy they propose to pursue in this direction.</P>

      <P>I understand that they are collected by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and are retained by that Ministry.  That is what I was told by the Minister for Agriculture when I raised the question on the Vote for the Department of Agriculture.  I want to know if the statistics are available to members of the Government, to be availed of by certain members of the Government to make statements arising out of them.  I would also like to know if they are available to Deputies so that we could make comparisons as to the information they contain.  Some members on these benches were held up at a public meeting in Cavan on statements made by a Minister of the Government.  It would appear to the ordinary individual in the country that the Minister made his statement at that meeting on the authority of these statistics.  In that way the Minister would be taken by the ordinary individual in the country as speaking with authority and speaking the truth.  The actual facts are that the Minister was not speaking the truth.  If he had the figures in front of him then he misrepresented them, and if he had not the figures in front of him he invented the statement he made, which I think is probably the more likely.  The Minister referred to myself in particular.  He said that I had 300 acres of land, and that out of that I tilled 15 acres.  I should say that he did not make that statement at the meeting, but rather, he sat down calmly on Monday and wrote that statement as a correction of his speech in Cavan and had it published in the newspapers.  I assume that when he wrote that statement he had in front of him actual figures supplied by the Department.  What I want to know is, whether he had or had not.  The actual facts are that where he said 15 acres were tilled, he should have said 23 acres Irish plantation measure, and instead of the figure 300 acres he should have used the figure 236.</P>

      <P>All I can say is, that my Department arranges for the collection and the tabulation of certain statistics, statistics which the Department of Agriculture calls for.  The Department of Agriculture decides as to what particular material is to be collected, and then my Department deals with the compilation of the statistics. The further decision as to what is to be published rests with the Department of Agriculture.  I do not know whether some member of the Gárda Síochána, acting on the advice of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, went out to inquire into the details of Deputy Gorey's holding.  I presume that is not so, because if Deputy Gorey's allegations are correct, the mistakes made would certainly not have been made in the type of statistics that we collect.</P>

      <P>They would not ordinarily have been made.  I do not think that there was what you might call any statistical information revealed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that was not available to any person in Deputy Gorey's neighbourhood. The Minister was probably speaking on a certain amount of local information that he had got, and not on actual information supplied by members of the Gárda Síochána.  As I have stated, we deal with collection and the tabulation of these statistics, but it is the Department of Agriculture that has the say as to what material is to be collected and as to how much publication is to be given to it afterwards.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible for this Vote, but he does not share any responsibility with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. That is to say, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is not a member of the Government properly so-called, so far as the Government is a group of persons with collective responsibility.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, in regard to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is in exactly the same position as Deputy Gorey.  That is to say, he is a member of the House. The question Deputy Gorey referred to with regard to this Estimate was not a question which could be answered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, namely, as to what steps the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs took in a particular case.  The question now is, how these statistics are collected. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has explained that; but the personal question as to the use or abuse by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs of statistics or information is not one which, I am sure, Deputy Gorey himself must realise, the Minister for Industry and Commerce can deal with.</P>

      <P>Under sub-head (hh) I want to ask the Minister a question about advertisements which have appeared in the newspapers for a whole string of engineers required in connection with the Shannon scheme.  What I want to know is, if the remuneration to be paid to these engineers is to be a charge against the sum of £5,200,000, the Estimate for the Shannon scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum of £5,200,000 includes a certain amount of money which is set down for what is called organisation and management expenses.  The allowances set down under that head are somewhat liberal, and I do not think there will be any necessity to expend the amount of money so set aside on that part of the scheme.  It was never intended, however, that that sum of money should cover the sums to be paid to the number of engineers who will be employed for a couple of years on the actual operations of the scheme.  Whatever is paid to the engineers referred to by the Deputy, will be extra.  I am not absolutely certain of that, but that is my impression, and I will be very much surprised if it is wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That will definitely have to be provided for by a Supplementary Estimate, but it is not a very considerable sum of money.  I should say it is wrong to state that a considerable sum of money will be spent.  The number of engineers to be employed will be very small.  With regard to the positions which have been advertised, these are not all to be filled at once.  Appointments are not going to be made next week or the week after. Some of these engineers will not be needed until the scheme is somewhat more advanced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>If I remember rightly the chief engineer is a man who is to get a salary of £800 a year.  I think the salaries to be paid to all the engineers will tot up to a fairly large sum in five or ten years' time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

Some of the others who are mentioned will come on the work at varying periods in the scheme and will leave at varying periods; but certainly in the first year £10,000 would cover all the salaries that would have to be paid.</P>

Now with regard to sub-head (e), payment for the acquisition of land, colliery railways, what position does that stand in? Are the payments that are being made total payments, or is it to be an annual expenditure on the railways concerned, Wolfhill and Castlecomer?  In other words, is this a net account?

Is there any means by which they will give an equivalent to what the other light railways received, or are they going to allow this whole line to be scrapped? It has gone into a state that it will be impossible to carry it on, and it is considered by residents that it will be a great loss to permit the line to go into disuse.

      <P>As to the Dublin and Blessington Tramway Company, I think I mentioned when dealing with the Railways' Act that we did not feel it incumbent upon us to search the country for all contrivances that ran on wheels to seek to include them in that Act.  There was a certain selection made as to contrivances that should not come within the scope of the Act, and the Dublin and Blessington Tramway is one of these.  When some amendment was moved with regard to the inclusion of the Dublin and Blessington Tramway, I pointed out that other matters than the fact of locomotion had to be taken into consideration, and that the natural joining for the Dublin and Blessington Tramway was with the Dublin United Tramways Company.  I said that if there was a movement made in the direction of getting the Dublin United Tramways Company to consider the taking over of the Dublin and Blessington Tramway, I would do all I could to help. The matter was raised with the Dublin United Tramways Company, but they did not see their way to put up any proposition on that point.  I cannot say that the Government have given much more serious consideration to this matter than was given prior to the introduction of the Act.  There has been one movement made of approach to the Dublin United Tramways Company without any result, and that is the position we are in at present.</P>

It is expected that negotiations concerning the acquisition of the lands referred to should be completed in this financial year, and that the sum of £6,800 should be sufficient to discharge all liabilities in connection with the acquisition of the lands. There have been certain legal difficulties with regard to the matter, but it is hoped these will be completed.

The railways pay rates on their property and pay a proportion for the upkeep of public institutions, roads, etc.  If we are liable, as we are, to maintain public highways to carry traffic, I think we are also liable to pay the railways a capital sum equal to what was paid for construction.

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if any steps have been taken by the officers of the Tribunal to make inquiries as to the effect of the existing classification on the exports and imports of this country.  I take the view, and I think other Deputies will subscribe to it, that the existing classification based as it is to-day&mdash;and there is a grave danger that it may be continued, but I hope not&mdash;gives preference to the exports of this country for the use of people in Great Britain, and in a way sets up a tariff against <Col N="1950" /> articles imported.  I would like to have some information from the Minister as to whether he has had any official on the Tribunal, or officials of the Transport Department, looking into that aspect of the case, so that when the case for confirmation of classification comes before the Tribunal the matter can be gone into.  The whole question is one that should be carefully gone into by the Department of Transport, or by officials of the Railway Tribunal, to see what has been the effect in the past, and if there would be any justification for an alteration in the existing classification, or if there is a likelihood of the same classification being adopted here as exists in England to-day, or as may be altered as a result of a Committee that is now going into the matter.</P>

      <P>Most of the questions that have been asked can be answered by saying that the Tribunal has set a certain programme before itself, and that representations can be received in the way set out in the Railways Act.  The question of classification is one that will be dealt with about the month of October, and at that time the question of sugar beet, to which Deputy Heffernan referred, will fall due for consideration.  As far as he is representative of certain people, Deputy Wilson missed one chance actually offered to him.  He could have come in or representatives could have come in, on the question of the conditions of carriage, but I may reassure the Deputy by telling him that any work he could have done was done, I think, very efficiently for him by people who had studied every aspect of it, and who had to make a certain case and put up certain representations.  Deputy Wilson I think was asking what was the line along which they were proceeding. Their programme would include and they were actually dealing some time ago, as the Deputy must know from the newspapers, with the conditions of carriage. The question of classification and standard charges will come on in due order later.  Deputy Davin may also rest assured that the question of classification is being attended to, and that a proper inquiry will actually result <Col N="1951" /> before the Tribunal when they come to deal with it.  I do not know if road traffic falls under the censure of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle with regard to irrelevancy.  I do not see that the Railway Tribunal has anything to do with it.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Minister's reply concerning sugar beet, and the classification with regard to sugar beet, I would like to ask him is there any possibility of speeding up the consideration of that classification? My reasons for suggesting that are that the districts which are proposing to put up beet sugar factories are very much concerned with the cost of carriage. Farmers who have been asked to promise to send sugar beet from long distances are also very much concerned in this matter.  There is no very definite information available at present as far as I know.  The rumour is going round that a flat rate will be established. What the rates are at present I do not know.  In England they are 5s. a ton for about 10 miles.  That would be rather a prohibitive charge for any carriage beyond a distance of 10 miles.  I would like to hear from the Minister is there any possibility of having a pronouncement made on this matter before October, or perhaps at a later date, when the decision of the Tribunal will be published?  I ask that because the people interested in the project at present are anxious to get some immediate information with regard to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be quite impossible as the work of the Tribunal is set out to get one matter such as sugar beet dragged out and have consideration given to it apart from everything else.  There has to be some order with regard to the matter with which the Tribunal has to deal. They have to deal with classification, and after classification, and as a result of it, the question of standard charges falls to be determined.  If you take one item out of, and ahead of, its time, and do not look upon it with relation to other items that may fall in this or in another class, you could not possibly have a definite determination of your <Col N="1952" /> standard charges.  It would be quite impossible, even though there might be an advantage, to get this taken out of its order.  At all events I have not understood from the Minister for Agriculture that there was any great advantage in having that matter decided ahead of its time.  The main point calling for consideration at the moment with regard to sugar beet traffic is a very simple one, as to what transport facilities there would be round about certain areas.  The promoters who are going to take advantage of the sugar beet proposals are surveying with the intention of setting up a factory there.  Of course the question of the charge upon such an article as sugar beet, or the class into which it will be put, will have nothing to say to that because that will operate all over the country.</P>

On the other hand, we have an example of railway charges on other matters.  A half-wagon, coming from Dublin to Kilkenny is £1 4s. a ton.  A fortnight ago I paid £3 12s. for three tons of cake from Dublin.  That is an extraordinary charge and it gives an example of the charges made on the Irish railways. While the country has to meet charges of that description it is a great handicap on industry.  I do not know what the charges on beet are, but this charge on cake is a great hardship and a great handicap on industry.</P>

      <P>Deputy Heffernan is stressing this matter too far, because if we rely on the Minister for Finance's statement, the factory will not be built until 1926.  Long before that, the Tribunal will have decided the matter of standard charges, etc.  Deputy Gorey should realise that the Act gives power to the railway company, power which they always possessed over their own line, to give special reduced rates for any article that is likely to produce an increase of revenue for the Company. I hope the Company will not be prevented by the Tribunal from doing that in the future.  Deputy Gorey did not probably examine very carefully or go very deeply into how the three pounds-twelve was made up.  He is not a mathematician, but if he looks into the receipt there would be a possibility of getting a rebate from what is an excessive charge.</P>

The point is that farmers who are long distances away, and who will send their beet by rail, want to know where they stand, and whether they will grow beet or promise to grow beet.  And in order to come to a decision on that matter, they will first have to know what the railway charges will be on the carriage of beet.</P>

As far as I could gather, it is entirely satisfactory and I have nothing to add to it.  With regard to Deputy Davin's own question to me, there appear to be certain doubts as to the interpretation of portion of Schedule 3, dealing with compensation. I have had a certain representation made to me in that respect.  I could not conceive&mdash;at least, it was not made clear&mdash;that the doubt that was said to have arisen could reasonably arise on the interpretation of that clause.  The matter has not advanced any further since.  I have no intention of introducing any amendment to the legislation, but I do not say that amending legislation would not be necessary if a certain interpretation were given to a particular clause.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I attempted to raise some points on this Vote out of place, and I was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle, who was in the Chair at the time.  I deferred any remarks I had to make until we came to the Marine Services so as to be in order.  What I want to refer to on this subject is the position of steamship owners in the Free State under the altered circumstances that have arisen through a change of Government.  In making some remarks on the subject, I may mention that I have some interest in the tonnage registered in Dublin, and also that I have occupied the position of Chairman of the Shipping Federation for the Free State area.  I would like to say that the British Mercantile Marine, and the laws governing the control of shipping, etc., are the growth of very many years of legislation, consideration and thought.  The British Mercantile Marine travels all over the face of the globe; it is not a local, but rather a universal service, and it governs largely the conditions of shipping throughout the world.  To a certain point we are incorporated in the British Mercantile Marine, and I think, except in some cases, where changes have had to be brought about, we are still operating under the Merchant Shipping Act and various other British Acts that govern the service of steamships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shipping owners in the Free State are not many in number, and we are not of very great importance, I take it, as compared with the British Mercantile Marine; but we do place a very great deal of importance on not being separated by differential legislation in any way from the traditions of the British Mercantile Marine.  I do not know whether that statement will contravene or contradict national aspirations in any way, but, looking at the British <Col N="1957" /> Mercantile Marine as a service of world-wide importance, I think we should still be governed and controlled by legislation that can be co-ordinated with the service on the other side of the water.  That is of very great importance to us.  Personally, I would like the Government, and I think my colleagues who are interested in shipping in the Free State would also like the Government to consider the position and formulate a policy on this matter.  I agree that the difficulties that arise are very considerable, and are not easily got over.  A few points may have to be got over.</P>
    <P>I would like to impress the House with the importance of being brought into line in every way with the British mercantile marine.  In the past Irish sailors have been engaged on board British ships, and they had the benefit of all the legislation, the unemployment and the social legislation, that has been adopted in Great Britain. The partial severance of the conditions applicable to sailors and firemen is at present, I think, a hardship on the Irish sailors on board British ships, and equally so, but not necessarily so, is it to be taken into consideration by this House in the case of English and Scotch sailors on board Irish ships. The need for co-operation and coordination in connection with these regulations will be seen.  It is necessary to keep our Irish sailors on the same standard as they have been in the past.  If the legislation in the two countries varies in any way, immediately the difference in nationality becomes a rather serious matter.  The privilege of Irish sailors being able to go on board the British ships, equal in every way with the sailors of the other nationalities, is an asset that we ought to try and secure for them as far as we possibly can.</P>
    <P>As regards ship-owners, I have found a very considerable inclination on the part of the main Shipping Federation, which has its headquarters in London, and of which we are only a local committee, to regard us as an insignificant unit in relation to the change that has taken place.  Of course, as regards the amount of tonnage we control or administer, we are <Col N="1958" /> insignificant, but I have always taken the higher stand since the change has taken place, that we should be represented on the Shipping Federation as a unit of very considerable importance &mdash;of much more importance than we could claim to be in relation to the tonnage we control.  As regards the present carrying on of the service, which is covered by this Marine Service Vote, the Merchant Shipping Act has applied to this country up to the present.  But I understand that the Department have had, from an early stage, the idea of bringing in a separate Merchant Shipping Act for this country.  If that be so, I would urge that it should be decided upon as early as possible, because various complications are arising from time to time under the present state of affairs.</P>
    <P>We might get over these difficulties better if we knew exactly what was before us.  I do not ask the Minister for any answer on this point to-night. I only mention the matter so that it will receive due consideration.  I hope the decision will be in the direction I advocate, if possible.  I do not claim a right to request that the Department should do anything that would be contrary to the national aspirations.  But we, as shipowners, claim inter-dependence with British shipping.  We run to British ports, and so far as our cross-Channel services are concerned, we are in much the position as we are here.  Separation would not be at our request, and would not be in our interest. We ask that the services should be co-ordinated, and we ask that every effort should be made so that Irish sailors on board British ships should not be handicapped in comparison with British sailors.  We would urge that the laws of the two countries should be so formulated that a case such as occurred recently could be dealt with by the Courts here, and their decision acknowledged as binding on both sides of the Channel.</P>
    <P>That may not be possible.  I do not say it is possible.  But to-day an Irish sailor injured on board a British ship, trading to China, Japan, or any other country, is entitled to compensation for injury under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  That man may want to <Col N="1959" /> come home here and live in his own country, but under a recent decision in the Courts here, that man has no claim against the British shipowner so far as our laws are concerned.  To take his case into the Court, he has to go over to the other side of the Channel and submit to the British Courts, because the ship is owned by British ship-owners and subject to British legislation. All these things complicate matters so far as shipping is concerned.</P>
    <P>It may be the idea that the Free State, or Ireland as a whole, may require to have a mercantile marine.  I am afraid the conditions will never warrant the separate establishment of a mercantile marine or the severance of the two countries in that way. There are, of course, other difficulties. Take our national and financial policy to-day.  You have a man on board an Irish ship sailing to Liverpool.  The cost of living is lower in Liverpool than it is in the Free State, that being due largely to the fiscal policy of the Free State.  The inclination of that sailor, who is going from port to port, will be to change his home from this to the other side.  That would, of course, work against the Irish sailor on an Irish ship.  These are matters which require grave consideration.</P>
    <P>I do not put forward any proposal that Irish ships should be treated differently from British ships.  It might be in my interests, and in the interest of my colleagues, to come forward here and say that Irish ships should be subsidised because they are Irish ships.  The same claim is being put forward from various parts of the House in respect of other matters.  The claim could be put forward that shipping is in such a parlous state that a subsidy is required to keep Irish boats running.  I make no such claim.  I ask to be placed on a level with our competitors, and I hope that is all I will ever ask in this House.  To-day, of four boats, we have two tied up, because they lose less lying up than they would running.  That is a phase of the trade as a whole, but we have to do our part and face the loss as best we can.</P>
    <P>These things will right themselves in time.  I would hope that, with the new <Col N="1960" /> national aspirations which we are trying to cultivate, the mercantile marine attached to the Free State would, in due course, increase in size and importance very considerably.  But I hope it will never be put forward here, or elsewhere, that this increase should be brought about by anything except natural causes and ordinary businesslike attention to work.  The question of subsidy ought not to arise.  The moment you separate Irish shipping from British shipping, Irish steamers are placed practically in an impossible position in competition with shipping as a whole.  I ask that, in dealing with this matter, the Government should consider shipping as a universal service and try to give us the benefits of the co-operation which we at present enjoy with the British mercantile marine, instead of a policy of separating us from our larger neighbour.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hewat referred to three matters&mdash;the question of merchant-shipping legislation, the question of an arrangement&mdash;I think he really meant reciprocal arrangements&mdash;with regard to insurance of men on board ship.</P>

      <P>Thirdly, he referred to the question of the Workmen's Compensation Act and its application to sailors.  In regard to shipping legislation, I think the position is pretty clear.  The Merchant Shipping Act has been carried over and is in operation here.  Legislation is contemplated and has been contemplated for a very long time, but it is one of the most difficult and complex <Col N="1961" /> things that has to be attended to in my Department, and I cannot promise any date on which it will be introduced.  It is most unlikely that legislation will be introduced this year. The Deputy may rest assured that there will be no violent changes just for the sake of violent changes, that everything will be given due and proper consideration and that the Oireachtas will have an opportunity of pronouncing upon any proposals the Government may put forward in the way of merchant-shipping legislation.  In regard to the matter of insurance, I do not know whether Deputy Hewat desires that the question of insurance as regards seamen should be separated from the question of reciprocal arrangements for unemployment insurance. I do not think that would be desirable. As regards the general question of reciprocal arrangements, I have to confess that we have not got any further with the authorities on the other side.  We have made a proposition that we would receive contributions payable in respect of our own nationals, and pay benefits on that basis.  The only counter-proposition that appears to be put forward is simply that the funds of each country should benefit by payments into them and that the funds of each country should pay out whatever contribution it would appear to be liable for.  I gave figures here before Christmas last year, showing the estimated loss that would mean to the revenue of the State.  We simply could not accept that very simple proposition put up from the other side.  There is no appearance of an approach to what could be called reciprocity with regard to this unemployment insurance matter.</P>

      <P>In this matter the Department might make use of people outside.  If the Minister would indicate what his difficulties are, I might be able to get the Shipping Federation, with the assistance of the Sailors and Firemen's Union, which is represented on the Maritime Board, to move the British Government to get some proper arrangement between the two countries. I would be glad to give any help, if I can help, owing to the fact <Col N="1962" /> that to-day an Irish sailor on board ship is treated in that respect as an outcast.  In other words, he is not called on to contribute at all, and the only contribution to the insurance fund is on the one side.  The employer has to pay something into a fund which has nothing to do with the payment of seamen at all.  He does not get any advantage out of it.</P>

      <P>There have been difficulties, but although attempts have been made to surmount these difficulties, these attempts have been unavailing.  We can, however, persist in our attempts, particularly on the question of seamen, if it is thought desirable to have seamen taken out of the general category and looked upon as a class by themselves.  I do not say that will be the decision, and I do not say we will consider them apart.  In regard to the matter of Workmen's Compensation, to which Deputy Hewat referred, a certain allowance has been made in respect of that.  A committee has been set up by my Department to go into the question of Workmen's Compensation.  They are asked to consider the whole code and to make any suggestions they may think proper, and especially to look after the question of seamen.  Two people have been specially placed on that committee, Mr. Barry and a workers' representative&mdash;I think he is Mr. Bennett&mdash;so that this matter may get special consideration and that suggestions should be made in regard to it.  Deputy Heffernan has raised the point of a decrease of a sum of almost £800 under sub-head B, while the staff remains the same.  That is not so large a question. The decrease is to be explained not by any diminution of the staff, but rather by a new location for some of the staff. A particular surveyor who used to be located in Dublin and who had to incur considerable expense in travelling, is now located in Cork.  A certain amount of travelling expenses will be saved in that way, and it is estimated that the expenditure will fall by this amount, simply for that reason.</P>
