      <P>Is it in order to raise a point of order?  I desire to know whether there is any disqualification of candidates on whose behalf there has been a great deal of canvassing, telegraph-sending, letter-writing and personal importuning.  I do not know whether there is any Standing Order to that effect, or whether it is left to the judgement of Deputies to express their views on that method of procedure.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will examine his portfolio he will find that on the last occasion on which an election such as this took place, that information was given in due course and in a very elaborate form; it contained all the information in regard to Proportional Representation that could be possibly conveyed to members of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I believe, A Chinn Chomhairle, you are expressing the wishes of the House when you mention that an expression of thanks should be conveyed to the counting staff for the efficient manner in which they carried out their work.</P>
      <P>I will now move the adjournment of the Dáil until Tuesday, 3rd November, at 3 o'clock.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.10 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 3rd November.</P>
