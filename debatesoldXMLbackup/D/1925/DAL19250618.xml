      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state what is the cause of the delay in paying the award made in the compensation claim of the Annacotty Co-Operative Creamery, Limited, Lisnagry, Co. Limerick, and whether he will have payment expedited.</P>

      <P>No award in favour of the Annacotty Co-operative Creamery, Limited, Lisnagry, Co. Limerick, has yet been received in the Department of Finance.  The question of payment, therefore, does not arise.  It is understood, however, that an award will be sent immediately by the Compensation (Ireland) Commission to the Department, when no avoidable delay will occur before payment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that tourists visiting Bundoran and other seaside resorts in Donegal are subjected to a great amount of inconvenience and annoyance by the Customs at the Border; whether a Mr. Kelly, a native of the Saorstát, motoring from Belfast to Bundoran recently, had to pay £5 5s. 0d. duty on his personal <Col N="1180" /> clothing, which had been sent by rail in advance; whether this amount will be refunded to Mr. Kelly on his return from his holiday; and if the Minister will state what are the regulations now regarding personal clothing sent by rail as luggage in advance unaccompanied by a passenger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS (replying)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that tourists visiting Bundoran and other resorts in Donegal are subject to any inconvenience and annoyance by the Saorstát Frontier Customs officers, except in so far as the necessity for complying with Customs Regulations with a view to paying duty, or to satisfying the officers that smuggling is not being attempted, can be regarded as an inconvenience and a source of annoyance.  Very wide concessions have been extended by the revenue authorities to tourists visiting the Saorstát, but revenue interests require that Customs formalities shall be complied with.</P>
      <P>Personal clothing sent by rail as luggage in advance, unaccompanied by the owner, is liable to duty; but payment is ordinarily waived if the luggage is claimed by the owner when delivery is sought, and the Customs officer is satisfied that it is made up of <i>bona fide</i> personal effects, consisting of used clothing, and that the quantity is not in excess of the owner's normal requirements. Sufficient time has not been available to investigate the particular case of Mr. Kelly.  It may be that personal luggage was conveyed in the motor vehicle on the occasion of his visit, and that the clothing in the parcel sent by rail was additional to that brought by motor and appeared to be in excess of Mr. Kelly's requirements. However, I will have full inquiry made and will communicate the result to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important matter affecting tourists. Would the Minister state, when he refers to concessions with regard to luggage, whether we are to understand definitely that luggage in advance, unaccompanied by the passenger, when claimed by the owner and recognised as worn wearing-apparel is not dutiable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The concessions appear to be: admission of motor vehicle without payment of duty, provided the tourist is making only a temporary stay in the Saorstát and admission of clothing and apparel without payment of duty provided it is worn clothing or apparel, personal to the tourist, and not excessive in quantity, having regard to his requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Who is to be the judge as to &ldquo;reasonable requirements?&rdquo; Is it not obvious that an American tourist, touring Europe, will carry with him a great deal more luggage than a person who is only going across the Border for the week-end?

      <P>Would the Minister say whether the concessions he has referred to apply to family luggage?  I am aware of many families who propose to go to seaside places in the Saorstát and the imposition of duties in those cases would be very serious.</P>

Cork, was granted an award of £145 in August, 1924, for hay, straw, mangolds, etc., maliciously burned in December, 1922; whether Mr. O'Connell was told some months ago that he would be paid his compensation in a very short time; if he will state what is the cause of delaying payment of the claim, and whether settlement of same will be expedited.</P>

This is a very serious matter for the firm.  These are summer goods, and probably the summer will be gone before the goods reach these people.

      <NameTxt>Mr. LOUIS J. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether the award of £43,244 made by the Shaw Commission for the destruction of the Irish House, Tipperary, as advertised in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of 6th December, 1922, has been paid in full or in part, and also whether the condition attached by the Shaw Commission that £11,000 of the said award should be expended in the reinstatement of the structure has been waived, and, if so, on what grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS (replying)</NameTxt>
      <P>The unconditional portion of the award referred to by the Deputy was duly discharged in the month of September, 1923.  A cash payment in respect of the unconditional portion was made to the applicants two months later on rthei acceptance of a sum considerably smaller than the amount allowed by the Compensation (Ireland) Commission. This case was the subject of an agreement with the British Government and the compromise which was effected on the request of the applicants resulted in a saving of, approximatingly, £6,000 to the State.  The applicants subsequently started proceedings in the High Court, but these proceedings were dropped.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, there was a condition in the award made by the Shaw Commission that £11,000 should be expended in reinstatement.  I would like to know whether the action taken in this case is to be regarded as a precedent. Why should an exception be made in this particular case, or why should other people not be allowed to forego a certain proportion of their award on condition that they would not be asked to rebuild?  The Minister's answer, to my mind, is not satisfactory.  They got £43,000 odd from the Shaw Commission for property they purchased, which, with the increased stock, did not reach half that.  There is £11,000 earmarked for reinstatement of the building, but in consideration of a sum of £7,000, they were not asked to rebuild. The Minister's answer is not satisfactory.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is the Minister for Finance empowered to alter a conditional award into an unconditional one?  That seems to have been done in this case.

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the President or the Minister could inform the House what were the special circumstances in this case, because, as far as I understand, this was a large drapery house in the town of Tipperary, and it would benefit everyone in that town if the building was restored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, I understand that a condition of this kind is attached for the benefit of the general public.  In this case it is claimed by the Department of Finance that by the compromise that was effected there was a saving to the State of some £6,000.  Presumably the Minister considers that sum of £6,000 as balancing and offsetting the benefit that would accrue to the general public by the fulfilment of the reinstatement condition, and agreed to the waiver. As to the question that has been raised of the precise power that the Minister has to agree to such a waiver, I would prefer that that question would be addressed direct to himself.</P>

While there will be a saving of £4,000 to the taxpayers, the ratepayers will be at the loss of £65 a year for this particular house, and I fail to see that in most instances the interests of the taxpayers and the ratepayers are not one, because the ratepayer is, as a rule, the taxpayer in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are in all nine cases of owners of land who have not yet been paid compensation. In every case the delay is due <Col N="1187" /> to the difficulty in completing the legal formalities either because agreement could not be reached until after the coming into operation of the Land Act, 1923, when the landlord and the chargeants upon his interest had to be joined in each deed, or because a clear title has not yet been shown to the holdings acquired.</P>

      <P>The fact that the land has been taken for a long period does not add anything new to my information on the subject.  I have already alluded to that, and I have stated that the delay was due more or less to the fact that the people whose land was acquired would not accept compensation until the question of the Land Act, 1923, came along, and that further to and since that, there is a question of clear legal title, free from incumbencies, to the land.

      <P>The number of applications for passports made to the High Commissioner has so far not been found sufficient to justify the setting up of special machinery in London to deal with them.  A passport cannot be issued until the identity and <i>bona fides</i> of the applicant have been satisfactorily established.  There would consequently, as a general rule, be a greater delay in the issue of passports in London than in Dublin.

      <P>Does it not strike the Minister that some of our citizens who may find themselves in London and who wish to take a short holiday abroad, while they could get passports from the British Government within twelve hours, would have to wait for four days to get them from Dublin? What is the sense of any inhabitant of the Saorstát having to pay the British Government fees on a passport which he can get from them within twelve hours and which, under present conditions, he cannot get from our own representative?  We have fine offices and a most courteous staff in London; they do every thing to help us when we apply to them, but the only thing that can be done is for them to identify us to the British Government, which at once issues the passports, and we then have the pleasure of paying the British Government, and instead of having a passport beginning with: &ldquo;We, Timothy Healy,&rdquo; we get one beginning: &ldquo;We, Austin Chamberlain.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>An Irish citizen applying in London for a passport can only be granted it when we have been <Col N="1189" /> satisfied as to his identity and <i>bona fides.</i>  It may happen in the case of a man such as the Deputy that he might get it in twelve hours, but certainly, in the case of ordinary human beings, it would take longer.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if, in consequence of the transfer of engagements under the National Health Insurance Act the adjustments in the Funds of Societies in this country have yet taken place, and, if so, if the amount ascertained to be due to Saorstát Societies has been credited to the Irish Insurance Fund, and if sums invested prior to the Treaty in British Securities will be made available for investment in Irish Securities.</P>

      <P>It is hoped that the apportionment referred to by the Deputy will be completed by the end of the present year.  The apportionments and adjustments necessary are being made by the International Arrangements Board, appointed under Section 11 (1) of the National Health Insurance Act, 1923, and Article 14 (1) of the National Health Insurance (International Arrangements) Order 1923.</P>
      <P>Investments which were held by the National Debt Commissioners, and which, on apportionment, are allotted to Saorstát Eireann, will be handed over to the Minister for Finance.  Under Section 54 (3) of the National Insurance Act, 1911, as amended by Section 28 (1) (c) of the National Health Insurance Act, 1923, it is open to the Minister to realise such investments and reinvest in any securities in which trustees are for the time being authorised by law to invest trust moneys.</P>
      <P>Pending a final apportionment, 45½ per cent. of the securities held by the National Debt Commissioners were provisionally apportioned to Saorstát Eireann under the Irish National Health Insurance Fund (Apportionment of Assets) (No. 2) Order, 1922, and were handed over to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> Any investments which, after the apportionment of funds has been completed, are held by Saorstát Eireann Societies or by the Irish Insurance Commission on their behalf, can be varied by or at the direction of the Society within the limitations laid down in Section 56 (2) of the National Insurance Act, 1911.</P>

The amount in the Central Fund at the time of apportionment did not include (1) the sums to be transferred to that fund in respect of the contributions of insured persons for the year 1920 &mdash; the last year in which such sums had to be so transferred; or (2) the portion of the unclaimed balance in the Stamps Sold Account to be carried to the fund under Section 29 of the National Health Insurance Act, 1918.

      <P>I move that the Dáil sit later than 8.30 p.m. this evening, and that the motion for the adjournment be taken not later than 10.30 p.m.  Last evening I said the Seanad resolution would be taken on this day week.  The particular resolution I had in mind was the Seanad opinion of what was the intention of the Dáil when they passed a resolution in February last, and not resolutions of which notice has been given for the arrangements to be made in connection with the formation of the panel for the Seanad elections.  I should also like to say that it was put to me last evening that the Dáil should not assemble on Tuesday next, as the local government elections are on that day.  I have since been requested to consider not assembling until Thursday, as some Deputies are candidates at the elections and they consider it would be necessary for them to be present at the counting of the votes.  I do not feel justified in refusing a request of that sort.  However, I am informing the Dáil of it.  The fact that we have to adjourn beyond Tuesday next will necessitate attendance here in the following week.  That is to <Col N="1198" /> say, we will have to come back on the 30th June, and possibly, for the first two or three days in July.  It is inevitable that we should come back the first week in July.  After that I do not think it will be necessary for us to meet unless on the 9th July, the day for the selection by the Dáil of persons to form the Dáil panel for the Seanad election. I thought it was advisable to let the Dáil know at the earliest moment what day it was proposed to adjourn to on to-morrow.  I do not think that we would effect our purposes by sitting late on Friday, or sitting on Saturday. There are two or three measures which it will be necessary to give notice to take out of the usual order in order to have them passed before the adjournment. These are measures that were introduced yesterday, and also the Sugar-Beet Bill.  I think I am entitled to ask for a little earlier consideration of those measures, by reason of the fact that a long time will elapse before they will come up for consideration.  In other words, the Sugar Beet Bill would come in the ordinary way before us on Tuesday next, but now it will not come up until Thursday.</P>

      <P>I do not know what is in the President's mind in regard to these matters, and in regard to the programme generally.  It appears from what he said that he hopes still to be able to conclude the whole business on July 9th, leaving blank two days next week.  There are a number of measures now being proposed; there are a number of measures that have not yet got to the final stage; and there are some measures to be introduced.  The President, I think, is overlooking what I deem to be the necessity for having a discussion on last year's report of the Public Accounts Committee.  I certainly cannot see that the business I foresee is likely to be completed by 9th July.</P>

      <P>We are very thankful for the adjournment over Tuesday, so as to give Deputies an opportunity of voting at the elections, but we do not see why the Dáil should not meet on Wednesday, because the result of the counting of the votes will be the same whether Deputies are there or not.  We <Col N="1199" /> did not ask for Wednesday.  As to assembling here on July 9th, to deal with the question of the Seanad panel, I think it would be a very great hardship on Deputies to have to come here for that particular business alone.  If we are going to assemble in the first week of July, perhaps the Seanad election panel could be arranged to be taken during that week?  If not, could we not assemble during the second week in July and have all the business taken during that week?  It would be too much to expect Deputies leaving here at the end of the first week in July to come back on the 9th July again for no other purpose than to select the Dáil panel for the Seanad elections.  If that could be done it would meet our convenience.</P>

      <P>No such information was conveyed to me.  I do not think any Deputy who spoke to me concerning Wednesday was interested in what takes place in Deputy Conlan's constituency on that day.  I undertook to give a certain number of hours for Estimates.  I admit it was an elastic arrangement.  But the programme I have outlined would indicate that that time has not elapsed.  As a matter of fact, a greater number of hours will have <Col N="1200" /> been afforded the Estimates than was originally promised.  The same might be said as regards the Finance Bill and the Budget resolutions.  It will, I think, be possible to get the business done without any undue haste, save only in respect of the number of days that might elapse between a certain stage of a Bill and a later stage, and that it would be possible for us to do what I have said.  If, on the other hand, it is preferred that we should not assemble in the first week of July, but rather in the second week, and at the end of that week to take the vote for the Seanad election panel, I have no objection.</P>

      <P>I think the President will remember that the Independent Group asked that priority in discussion, or at any rate, an early discussion, might be given to the Estimates for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  They were postponed solely because of the pressure of work on the Minister, and as they could not be taken earlier, I think we are entitled to have a full discussion on these Estimates. We allowed them to be postponed to convenience the Government, and I do not think that fact should prejudice our desire to have a full discussion of them.</P>

That is unreasonable.  There are twelve hours still for the discussion of the <Col N="1201" /> Estimates.  Some of them got very much more consideration than they would in ordinary circumstances.  It would have been impossible for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the Shannon scheme on, and the Bill that is at present before the Seanad, to have come here earlier, but it is not intended to limit the amount of time that will be taken on the Estimate for that particular department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I, with eleven others, was appointed by the Dáil to act as a Committee of Public Accounts for this year.  Last year a Committee was set up, and it was unfortunate that for a time there was difficulty in getting a quorum.  In consequence, an appeal was made for a reduction in the quorum, and it was decided to reduce it from five to four.  A similar quorum obtains this year, four out of twelve.  I was appointed by the Committee to act as its Chairman, and I think it my duty to report to the Dáil that on two occasions within the past fortnight meetings have been abortive, by virtue of the fact that no quorum was present for half-an-hour after the time announced for the meeting.  The effect of not having a quorum is, first, that the Committee cannot continue its work, second, that the time of high officials of State is wasted, inasmuch as they are bound to be present at the meetings of the Committee.  I am making that report as Chairman of the Committee. I should like to say a word, as a Deputy, in comment upon the statement of the Chairman of the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The functions of Deputies of this House do not seem to have been readily understood by many Deputies.  I think those duties involve, as first preference, attendance on Committees, particularly on the Committee of Public Accounts. The duty of attending Committees should be looked upon as of quite primary importance.  The Committee of Public Accounts is, one might say, complementary, <Col N="1202" /> is a necessary complement, to the voting of grants of money by the Dáil.  Unless we are going to confirm the work of the Committee on Finance&mdash;that is to say, the whole House sitting as a Committee&mdash;and to make sure that the requirements of the law have been satisfied in the spending of public moneys, then our duty as Deputies is not fulfilled.  The House would, no doubt, find it impracticable to do this work, and therefore there devolves upon a Committee the duty of examining the Appropriation Accounts and the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>If it is impossible to obtain the attendance of a Committee to do the work that is necessary for the Dáil as the guardian of the public purse and the custodian of public taxation&mdash;if a Committee cannot be found which will deem it its duty to do that work conscientiously and carefully&mdash;then the only alternative would be the impossible one of having all those matters discussed in the Dáil.  I think it is necessary to make this comment, that unless Deputies of all parties recognise the responsibilities attaching to membership of the House, which involves an obligation to attend Committees, particularly important Committees such as this, then membership of the House is going to lose in honour, because it is devoid of responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this Committee, Deputy Johnson has said a good deal; but, having said so much, he should have said something more.  This Committee, like every other Committee in the House, is composed of different parties in proportion to their strength as represented in the Dáil.  The privilege that is claimed that parties should be represented in proportion to their strength has been very religiously insisted upon by members of those parties.  It is quite obvious, from Deputy Johnson's statement, that some individual Deputies or parties have been responsible for a dereliction of duty.  Deputy Johnson might have given us a list of the attendances of the Deputies on that Committee.  I do not think it is quite fair to leave us without that list of attendances.  I do not know anything about the attendance of <Col N="1203" /> Deputies.  I know that two members of my party are on the Committee.  To my knowledge they attended the Committee meetings under great difficulties. They came from the country time and time again and they gave a good attendance. I believe their average attendance was good.  I do not think any fault can be found with the attendance of the Deputies from those Benches. The general attendance of Deputies on this Committee should be given to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a fair request.  The Deputies on the Committee are: Deputies Cooper, P.J. Egan, Roddy, Esmonde, Wilson, T.J. O'Connell, Johnson, Hewat, Broderick, Connor Hogan, Lavin, and McCullough. There were ten meetings called, two of which have been abortive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>In conjunction with the question of attendance, I think we should consider, in equity, the demands that have been made on the time of members of the House.  For some considerable time past this House has been sitting four days a week and on almost every occasion, with the exception of one day in the week, when it sat earlier in the day, the House continued sitting until 10.30 p.m.  If Deputies are to be called upon to sacrifice all that time to do the business of the House, then, surely, it is only fair that some consideration should be given to those business men who have to attend on Committees of the House.  If the demands of the House had not been so great, more time would have been at the disposal of those members to attend on the different Committees.  The demands that are being made on the time of members of the House will, <Col N="1204" /> I am afraid, have a serious effect on the interests of the House.  We are anxious that the House, as representative of the State, should have in it representatives from all the different classes in the community.  It is quite obvious that, if commerce is to have that representation in the House that we would like to see it have, it will be most difficult to find business men who can give up the amount of time that the House is demanding of business men at the moment.  That is an aspect of the question that ought to be considered.  There is a great deal of time taken up here in the House&mdash;I will not say that it is taken up in useless discussion, but I will go so far as saying that there is a good deal of time that might be saved that is not saved. That particular aspect of the question ought to be considered in the interests of the country.</P>

      <P>With respect to the Farmer Deputies on this Committee, the House will remember that the spring has been very wet and during the time that it rained we attended very religiously on that particular Committee and on every other Committee. When the fine weather came during recent weeks, naturally we had to attend to our business in the country. It was during those weeks that there were numerous meetings of the Committee and, in consequence, the attendance of our Deputies was not too good.  I would like the House to understand that it was not because they were wanting in any sense of duty that the Farmer Deputies failed to attend; it was simply because the country needed their services, and because of that call they could not be here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true, as Deputy Good says, that we are all working under a very considerable strain. I do not think he meant to limit the strain of work to business men alone, because other Deputies in the Dáil have duties as well.  The Labour Deputies have duties; some of them are Secretaries of Trade Unions, and they have other responsibilities.  Certainly there is no other Deputy who devotes himself more assiduously to his duty than <Col N="1205" /> Deputy Johnson, yet he is able to achieve a full 100 per cent. attendance on this Committee.  As Deputy Johnson says, there is something lacking in our frame of mind in regard to those Committees.  The particular Committee he refers to is one that takes up the time of Deputies on important public service and it occupies as well the time of high officials of the Department of Finance, including the Comptroller and Auditor-General, who, with other officials, has to attend this Committee to justify the expenditure of the money that we voted here two years ago for the service of different Departments.  We have sat there and we have waited for a quorum.  Those officials sat twiddling their thumbs and wasting time that would be better employed doing the work of the country. That is why I think Deputy Johnson is abundantly justified in bringing this matter before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>It is true that we have claims on our time and many responsibilities, but, on the whole, the worst attendance on the Committee of Public Accounts has been given by those Deputies who take the least part in the debates in the Dáil, and who, to outward appearances at any rate, have comparatively few duties and responsibilities.  They are not serving on other Committees and they are not very active participants in the general work of the Dáil.  I feel puzzled, as Deputy Johnson is puzzled, as to whether this Committee can be carried on on these lines.  We have Deputies putting forward the claims of their fields or the necessity for attending a party meeting, or other claims of that sort.  Inevitably, claims of different kinds do come.  For instance, I am constantly finding myself torn in two.</P>

I find myself constantly <Col N="1206" /> torn in two, so to speak, and I have no doubt other Deputies find themselves in the same position.  If we allow other claims to influence us beyond the claims of the important and responsible duties of the Dáil, we shall never get the work done, and we shall have to discuss all these matters in full in the Dáil, and remain in session until we have disposed of them.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Lands and Agriculture, in introducing this Estimate, asked us to take our courage in our hands and face the situation. In other words, to make a choice, I think he said, between the congests and the landless men of the Saorstát.  I, for one, am prepared to take my courage in my hands in this matter, not to make a choice as between the one and the other, but in so far as fair play will be given to all.  I intend to take my courage in my hands to that extent. I can say that, unfortunately, both the congest and the landless man are in the same position, to a very large extent, perhaps 100 per cent.  To find homes for the congests in the counties of Leinster and Munster, in a great many cases, would mean the displacing of a considerable number of people who derive their living from the land at the moment.  They would be flung, as it were, on the scrapheap.  Estates have been broken up.  A considerable number of people had been employed on those estates, and where they have been employed, I, for one, will insist as far as my influence and the influence of the Party on these Benches go, that those people will not get preference over other citizens of the Saorstát, but that they will get equal rights, that their claims for a living in this country will get as much consideration as the claims of any other citizens.  I know a case very well of a farm of 1,000 acres, giving employment to 24 householders, embracing a population of 141 people. A number of these, I believe, are likely <Col N="1208" /> to be accommodated on this property when it is taken up.  I do not know what will happen with regard to the others.  That would apply to every county, if properties like that are to be taken indiscriminately, without any regard to the people who are deriving their living from them.  I say we cannot entertain a proposition by which one section of the community will deprive another of the means of subsistence. If we do not pay attention to the people who are making a living from these properties we will increase the ranks of the unemployed.  I believe when you come to find out where unemployment is really prevalent in the country you will find that there is as much unemployment in the Leinster and Munster counties as there is, perhaps, in the Connacht or Ulster counties. As I said before, I do not make a preference claim.  I would be very sorry to do that, but I would make an equal claim, and any Deputy or any citizen in the Saorstát would not be worth his salt if he did not stand by that claim.</P>
      <P>With regard to the policy of dividing up ranch lands, we stood for that policy in the Dáil when the Bill was being introduced, and I think most of us are glad that we stood for it.  We stood for it before ever the Bill was introduced. We have been standing for it more or less all our lives, and we stand for it still.</P>

      <P>I will not refer to that. This principle undoubtedly is a good one, within reason.  Lands have been farmed in this country without any regard at all to the human population. In other cases, although considerable tracts may have been held by one individual, they have been farmed with very considerable regard to and with due consideration for the human population. I can instance a case of lands farmed in this country, with more people depending on them than there are in some of the most congested districts in Connacht.  I can instance a case in my own county, the case of the Mount Juliet property, owned by Major McCalmont, where there are up to 300 hands employed.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I am exaggerating the number of hands employed. I know that there is a big number of people employed, between the hunting establishment, the stud farm, and all the rest.  Perhaps I am exaggerating when I say 300, but certainly there are more people living there than in any area of the congested districts. I cannot visualise a greater calamity to the community than interference with property of that description. This principle, as I say, is good when carried to reasonable lengths, but that blessing can be very easily converted into a curse if dealt with indiscriminately and carried beyond a certain point.  Deputies and other public men talk very glibly on public platforms about the population this country had at one time; they state that we had a population of eight millions, and that we could have that population again.  I wonder what sensible man would make that statement to a body of sensible men.  We must assume that the man who made such a statement is a fool, or that he considered those to whom he was talking fools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I make the assertion that with the best will in the world, as far as the land is concerned, such a population could not be carried in this country.  Men may have been satisfied 100 years ago to live in a hovel on a few acres of bog, where they eked out an existence, on a certain standard of living.  That could not be made to satisfy the people of this generation.  I say that no greater crime could be committed against the individual than to force him to live in a country under such conditions.  If there is room outside the shores of this country it is a good thing that people are able to get out of it.  I do not mean total emigration. But you might as well realise that this country will only carry a certain population, and if you are going to develop the population you must do it on other lines.  You can only develop <Col N="1210" /> the land population up to a certain point, and at that certain point you must stop.  I will repeat what I said earlier, that we welcome this principle as a blessing up to a certain point, but that after that point has been reached it could very easily be converted into a curse.  What would be the result if in this country we had a population of congests?  Come down to what is considered an economic farm to-day; have it universal all over the country, in the hope that the population is going to increase. Even when the lands are made into what are considered economic holdings, it will not appreciably increase your agricultural population. That is admitted.</P>

      <P>If it is not admitted it can be proved.  It will not appreciably increase the population.  If people must be kept in the country it will mean that in ten or fifteen years time this will be a nation of congests.  What would happen if we were all congests? Who would supply the sinews of war? Who would afford relief to those requiring it?  This is a question that has its limits.</P>
      <P>Reference was made here yesterday to the undesirability of breaking up ranches.  The case of Meath was instanced. That may, to a very small extent, affect that particular branch of our industry.  There is no reason in the world why those good lands of Meath and the better lands of the country, if that class of farming is the most profitable, should not be confined to the same class of agriculture.  I think it is no uncommon thing in Meath, Kildare and County Dublin, to find that people on very small holdings are the best feeders of cattle.  Small-holders feeding a half-dozen cattle are known to be the best feeders coming into the Dublin market.  That can be made by better handling and the more early marketing of our cattle a most desirable thing, independent of whether there is a breaking-up of the ranches or not.  We must have early maturing and early killing of cattle.  I do not believe that this breaking-up of the ranches will very seriously interfere with the cattle trade of the country.</P>

      <P>I think it was Deputy Magennis who referred to our old nobility.  Another Deputy referred to their culture.  I must confess that I am not one who is afflicted with any reverence for our old nobility or the culture that they imparted to this country.  I have no reverence for the culture these people imparted.  I have no reverence at all for their pedigrees. The only thing that I ever got from that class of people in my early days was the heel in the face, every time they got the opportunity.  Their culture may have been there but it was kept amongst a very close corporation, it was not allowed to reach the masses of the people.  They did not spread their culture in the districts where they lived.  I think in many instances it could be described by some other name than culture.  I am not going to use an appropriate term here; it might not be allowed.  At the same time, whatever may have been our feelings in the past, there is no reason why we, as representatives of the country, should approach this matter from any except a business point of view and a humane point of view.  Hostilities should not animate us nor should veneration.  We should treat it as a plain, business and civic proposition. The time has arrived when it is bad, when it is dishonest, from that point of view, for politicians to get up on platforms and appeal to the worst traits in human nature, to preach about what can be done for them, without any idea in their minds that they can do it.  That has been indulged in time and again.  It is being indulged in even now.  Men get up on platforms and make promises and ask for support by advancing theories that they know they cannot give effect to.  This may be good enough from a party <Col N="1212" /> point of view, or from the point of view of getting votes, but all this will come home to roost.  And it will come home to the people who preach it as much as to anybody else.  It has been said here that farms should be held only up to a certain acreage&mdash;that farms going beyond a certain acreage, no matter how farmed, should not be permitted.

      <P>Take my own case, for instance.  There are five men employed <Col N="1213" /> on my farm.  Four of those are householders. There is, then, my own household, which happens to be a large one. Thirty-nine individuals are finding a living there.  The two farms I hold comprise 240 Irish acres.  Thirty-nine persons are living on them.  That gives each of them about six acres.  Out of that, despite statements made elsewhere, twenty-three Irish acres, or thirty-eight statute acres, are under plough.  I am not making any claim for first meadow or second meadow.  I am talking of land that is growing root-crops and corn-crops.  I make no claim for meadow.  It was recognised under the Tillage Order and allowed for, but I do not think that it should be properly claimed as tillage.  I certainly make no claim for it.

      <P>It would be a great calamity if this breaking up of the ranches should, to any extent, interfere with the cattle trade or, incidentally, interfere with the trade we are trying to establish in this country, which is held by many people to be one of the ways by which the salvation of this country will be attained&mdash;the dead meat trade. I do not think it would be possible&mdash; perhaps it would to a certain extent&mdash; when alloting these ranches in Meath. Westmeath, Roscommon, and other counties, for the Minister to lay down certain conditions to ensure that the people who get this land will be people who are able to deal with the fattening of cattle.  If the lands are to be taken away altogether from cattle feeding, it may be very unfortunate.  It would be in the power of the Land Commission, when making allotments, either to impose <Col N="1215" /> conditions or to put the proper class of people on them.  If a change came suddenly, it might have a very serious effect.  It should be done gradually, if it is done at all.  I hope the Land Commission will take due notice of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made here by Deputy Nolan to a very important matter&mdash;the payment of annuities and debts to the State.  Very properly, the Deputy has given us a list here of what I might describe as chronic bad-payers &mdash;people who have always been in arrear, and in arrear to a large extent. Where arrears continue by people responsible for annuities, and where, in the opinion of the Land Commission, nothing very much can be done with them, they should take the decision to realise their security.  There are enough good men in this country looking for land, and this might add something to the Minister's small acreage of available land for congests and landless men.  Something ought to be done with those who have been failures, who continue to be failures, and who, in the opinion of the Land Commission, are likely to continue as failures.  We do not defend men or women of that character. Where casual cases occur, where people for one reason or another happen to get a half-year or even a year in arrear, where they have always given guarantee of good faith, I think it would be very wise for the Land Commission to exercise their discretion, not alone in the interests of these people but in the interests of the State.  It would be good State policy.  Circumstances occur in the life of every individual which make it absolutely impossible to deal with a payment at a certain time.  These people, if they get time, will make good, as they have made good in the past.  We do not want to take the discretion out of the hands of the Land Commission, but we want them to exercise judiciously that discretion.  We make no case, and make no claim for the &ldquo;chronics.&rdquo; They have always been a burden on the State, and they are likely to continue to be a burden.  The best thing that could possibly be done would be to remove that burden and put good <Col N="1216" /> people in where they are.  In other cases, people, owing to accidents or circumstances over which they have no control, may be unable to meet their liability within the time.  I can very easily imagine that happening this year.  I met people in Dublin from my own part of the country recently who were in this position, and who, if they got time to dispose of their wool crop, would be able to meet their liabilities. Deputies know the prices that have obtained in the wool trade during the past few weeks.  Their system of farming is such that they will not realise anything until September.  That is their method, and they cannot depart from it.  I say that it would be a very judicious act, and good national policy, to give these people time.  The Land Commission know very well the cases in which they can do that and the case in which they cannot do it.  If they do not know that, they should know it from experience.  In any event, they can easily get the information in the particular counties.  We do ask for the exercise of discretion, particularly this year, by the Land Commission in this matter.  Deputy Wilson meant exactly what I have said when he spoke yesterday.  I have tried to put the matter in plainer words.</P>
    <P>The big national question of land settlement is one that cannot and ought not, be dealt with in any except a statesmanlike way.  We should not get into the mob method, or we should not encourage mob methods&mdash;what we used to describe in the old days as &ldquo;the hazel method.&rdquo;  In modern days that has developed into the gun and revolver method, and the method of night-visits.  That must be put a stop to.  I would go further&mdash;I think we dealt with this last year&mdash;and say that people found guilty of that class of conduct, people found guilty of intimidation, should be black-marked.  I say &mdash;I may not be expressing the view of the party, but I am expressing my personal view&mdash;that a black mark should be put against blackguards of that description, and that they should get none of the soil of this country.  We can do without them.</P>

They had been denied access to the bog for two years, and they are denied this year.

      <P>It is a very serious question for these poor people.  The landlord has now gone a step further and has served eviction notices on several of the tenants, and the Home Help Committee in Athy has also been served with notice of these evictions, a fact that goes to show that the landlord intends to proceed with the evictions. We had all thought that evictions in Ireland had ceased, but it appears from these facts that they have not.  No doubt the tenants are in arrear; that is not denied, but the reason they are in arrear is because they have been refused access to the bog which was their principal means of livelihood.  In connection with another point, it appears to me that there ought to be more co-ordination <Col N="1218" /> between the collecting department of the Land Commission and the State Solicitors.  I will give a case in point. A man whom I know very well and who is an extensive tillage farmer got into arrear a few months ago with a half-year's annuity.  The State Solicitor wrote to him threatening proceedings. On the 9th March he sold cattle in the local fair and on the same day remitted the amount of his debt to the Land Commission.  On the 30th March he was served with a process.  Somebody would seem to be in default there.  Could not the collecting department of the Land Commission have informed the solicitor that the money had been paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. CONLAN Mr. CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The solicitor is not entitled to collect costs on a letter.  He was served with a process more than three weeks after he had paid the Land Commission.  On the day that he wrote to the Land Commission sending the money, he wrote to the solicitor informing him of what he had done. One would think that when the solicitor had received that information he would have taken steps to ascertain from the Land Commission if it were so and that the proceedings would be dropped there and then.  I cannot see any excuse for issuing a process under such circumstances.  I hope that the Minister will look into that matter. Like Deputy Gorey, I do not defend bad &ldquo;pays&rdquo; or men who have no desire to fulfil their obligations, but in this case that was not the fact; the man was only waiting to make some money in order that he might satisfy the debt, and he should not have been treated in that manner.</P>

      <P>We in this Party have been brought into the limelight very much in this morning's paper by means of a headline stating that the Farmers as a Party were out against the division of the ranches.  What led to that, I believe, was Deputy Connor <Col N="1219" /> Hogan's speech yesterday evening.  He should have prefaced that speech by saying that he was expressing his own individual opinion, not the considered opinion of those who sit on these benches.  I want to justify myself and to justify the action of the Party to which I belong.  I went through the campaign at the time of the General Election when a programme was put into my hand.  No. 5 of that programme was &ldquo;The completion of land purchase and the division of the ranches.&rdquo;  I have been on various platforms in the County Meath, on Back-to-the-Land platforms.  Before there was a national Parliament in Dublin, I advocated the division of the ranches, because I believe in my heart and soul that there is a necessity, and a pressing necessity, for the division of some of the waste lands in the County Meath and in other counties.  The programme that was prepared for the Farmers' Party for the General Election realised and acknowledged that fact, and now in big broad type in this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> the Farmers' Party is held up as being out against the division of the ranches.  I say that we are not, as a Party, and certainly I as an individual am not.  But I say this, that when it comes to the question of dividing ranches the utmost care must be taken and good judgment must be used to secure that the proper class of people, men who are able and willing to work the land, will get it.  We do not want land split up into cabbage gardens; we do not want it handed out indiscriminately to every Jack, Bill, Tom and Harry, but what I want, and what the Back-to-the-Land Association wants, is a peasant proprietorship established in every county, with homesteads and happy families all over the country.</P>

      <P>I did object to having one property, the Mount Juliet property, touched.  The other property will need breaking up, but I only instanced the number of people living on that place and employed there, and I insisted that the people disemployed in the breaking up of that estate would be provided for.</P>

      <P>My point remains the same.  I am happy to say that I know two properties that have been broken up, and the workers on them have got first claims.  These men were working on these properties for a number of years; they had been constant employees of the owners, and they have all got a portion of the land.  I think that is absolutely just, because if an estate that has employed a number of workers is to be broken up, I hold that those who have been earning a living on it are entitled to get some of that land.  Deputy Connor Hogan, last evening when I was not present, dealt with the question of the breaking of demesnes and other lands.  I know of one property consisting of 350 acres, living on the bounds of which are a number of very small farmers, uneconomic holders with, perhaps, four or five acres of land.  I know seven or eight tradesmen living in neighbouring villages, industrious men, who work for the farmers all round.  These tradesmen have not got space for a goat or fowl or a pig, much less have they gardens.  The owner of that 350 acres, <Col N="1221" /> during the war when there was compulsory tillage, let it at £15 and £16 an acre.  These small farmers broke up the land and he got out of his obligation to till by sub-letting to these people.  Not one yard of that 350 acres is broken up.  Near it there are eleven farmers, and the position of two of them, whom I know, is so miserable that they have never been able to marry, because they could not expect a decent woman to live in the places in which they exist.  There are families ranging from five to ten trying to live on land that is so water-logged that the cattle can be put out only for three months in the year, and in the winter they have no place to put the cattle except to let them wander around the laneway.  There are two of the properties I refer to near these people, and the owners do not live on them, and have never tilled the land.  They practically give no employment.  I maintain that all such estates and large farms, which are simply used as ranches, and where no employment is given, should be taken over by the State for the benefit of the people who are living a wretched life on uneconomic holdings, and whose children have to emigrate because they cannot earn a livelihood on the land available for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to be misunderstood. I do not suggest anything that one might call Bolshevism.  I do not say that any of this land should be taken over without due compensation under the Land Act.  The terms of the Land Act are generous.  No man's property should be taken from him without compensation, whether it is handed down to him by a father who was a camp follower of some army and managed to secure land by that means, or because his father was an understudy of some land agent with whom he curried favour, and who, when tenants were evicted, managed to increase his farm until it became a ranch.  That is past history and has got to be forgotten. All of these men should get justice; they should be paid for the land.  I maintain that no man has a right to hold land that he does not work.  I am with Deputy Johnson absolutely in that theory of his.  Land has its duties <Col N="1222" /> and its rights, and a man who holds a ranch on which he gives no employment is of little value to the State and very little good to the country.  If such a man wants a ranch, he ought to go to Canada or Australia, where he would have to look after the shearing of his sheep and the handling of the machinery in harvest time.  Ranchers do not do that here.</P>
    <P>I fail to see where the loss would be from the point of view of culture, which Deputy Connor Hogan referred to, if the land was taken from such men.  There are, of course, some honourable exceptions amongst owners of estates.  There were men who went abroad, to Venice and Florence and other places to see the work of the Old Masters.  There were men belonging to the old regime who went to Vienna or Paris with the idea of hearing good music.  But there are a good many ranchers and men of that type who would go to see a revue or a cinema picture, but who would not go to a high-class opera or concert in Dublin or elsewhere.  Very few of those people would attend lectures given by men of prominence, either in the world of arts or literature.  The help they gave to the advancement of culture or education was not very much.  They had opportunities which, unfortunately, were denied to the majority of the people, and they did not do much to disseminate the knowledge which they acquired, if they did acquire it.  What they did for the advancement of their neighbours was not so much that we need be sorry after them.  As I say, there were some honourable exceptions&mdash;families who collected works of art and so on.  If their books were disposed of there would be found amongst them more than the novels of Nat Gould, copies of the &ldquo;Weekly Shocker&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Princess.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am sorry, but I could not allow Deputy Connor Hogan's reference to the loss to culture that would be occasioned by the breaking up of these estates to pass <Col N="1223" /> without comment.  I quite agree with Deputy Gorey with regard to the use of the land that is going to be divided. Those who, in the past, have not shown themselves capable of working land, or who are not in a position to stock land or buy the necessary implements have no right to land.  If tradesmen's sons have a knowledge of the working of land, and the capacity to work it, they also have a right to get a small portion of land, equally with the uneconomic holders.  The increase of tillage that will take place by the division of land will mean a very big asset to this country. I know numbers of small farmers who are seeking additional land.  In two districts which the inspectors have already visited, I know at least 80 or 100 small farmers who are in a position to show that even last year, bad year as it was for the farmers, they were able to make money and increase their deposits in the bank.  They were in a position to prove to the inspector that they were prepared to stock any land they could get.  That is because these small farmers go in for mixed farming and till a very fair percentage of their land.  I maintain that those who till the land are amongst the most prosperous farmers and, above all, they are the most industrious.  It is through them that the future of farming is going to be secured.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gorey asked, if we had an increase in population, where was the food going to come from.  If a famine took place, or there was a hold-up of wheat, I am afraid that it is not from the ranches you will get the food, but from the small farmers who are tilling portion of the land.  I fully endorse what is being done by the Minister for Agriculture in this matter.  I hope that his selection is going to be carefully carried out, that it is going to be gradual, as he suggests, and that care and judgement will be shown.  The sooner this problem of the uneconomic holdings is dealt with the better.  While it remains unsolved, it is a menace and an injury to the country, and is retarding the progress of the farming community.</P>

      <P>I should like to <Col N="1224" /> assure Deputy D'Alton that, while I enjoy a revue or a cinema entertainment. I can also enjoy opera in Paris, in Rome and in Naples.  I have a great capacity for enjoyment; I even enjoy Deputy D'Alton's speeches.  I never made the mistake of thinking Deputy D'Alton was a Bolshevist, because I know he is not.  I know he realises that if you are going to begin inquiries as to how this man's great-great-grandfather got any piece of property, you will never know where to stop, and that all property will become insecure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>They might ask where we get anything.  No doubt Deputy Johnson is a business-like man and keeps the receipts for the money he pays.  Once you begin in connection with title to land, or to any other thing, that has been handed down over a considerable period of years&mdash;50 or 100 years perhaps&mdash;once you begin to say that title may be invalid, because of circumstances in connection with its acquisition, then you make all property insecure; you drive capital out of the country and you produce economic chaos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not very much disagreement, I think, between Deputies as regards the main subject of this discussion. I quite agree with Deputy D'Alton that where land is held and used only for grazing by an absentee owner&mdash;land of considerable extent, three hundred acres, as he quoted&mdash;the mere fact that it is scheduled as demesne land should not prevent it being acquired for the relief of congestion, or to give holdings to landless men.  There I am with him. I do not know what the Tipperary experience is, however, but my experience in the West teaches me that the subdivision of this land does not mean a great increase in tillage.  The new owners, who get from 10 to 25 acres each, till an acre or two for potatoes for the use of their families, and beyond that, they graze the land, because it is the most profitable use to which land can be put, in the present state of affairs, and in their present <Col N="1225" /> condition of education.  The result is that you do have a larger number of families provided for.  That is a gain. You get a gain in indirect taxation to balance a certain loss in direct taxation, because it is easier to collect income tax from one man, who has a large holding, than it is to collect it from a number of men with small holdings. But, you do not really add to the economic wealth of the nation by having land grazed by a number of small men, rather than by one big man. The cattle are the same.  If anything, there is less variety, less resources, and less capital behind the small man than behind the big man.  So that, though there is a case for dividing up demesne land, or at least not being terrified by the name of demesne, it is not an overpowering case, and it must only be applied with discrimination.  Though I did not hear Deputy Connor Hogan last night, that, I gather, was the burden of his remarks that you should not at once embark on the policy of dividing everything that can be called a demesne.</P>
    <P>He spoke of culture.  While there is something to be said for the cultural side, I would like to speak of another side which is, perhaps, more common and certainly more appreciated; that is, the side of sport.  Whatever the services of owners of demesnes may have been in the field of culture, there is no doubt they have been of considerable service to the country in the development of sport, and particularly in the matter of horse-breeding.  Most of the hunts in the country were promoted and run by people who lived in demesnes, and the value of the Irish hunter was to a large extent created by the opportunities they gave.  That is one factor that I am sure nobody from the County Tipperary will overlook.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, there are a great many demesnes in this country that are being run as scientific farms, that are being run with the advantages of capital and with the advantages, possibly, of a somewhat wider knowledge than the small farmers could possess.  Those places are giving a considerable amount of employment.  I hope the Minister will exercise considerable deliberation before he interferes with any of those. <Col N="1226" /> Deputy Mulvanny, although he spoke with great force and eloquence in regard to the advisability of dividing all the ranches, would be slow, I am sure to advocate the division of Randals town, for instance, which has given such great help to the promotion of agriculture and tillage in County Meath.  Deputy Gorey spoke about Mount Juliet.  Every Deputy will realise that there are demesnes which are of material advantage to the neighbourhood. They give very considerable employment, and they carry that employment on from good to bad years &mdash;a thing which the ordinary farmer would find it difficult to do.</P>
    <P>It cannot be denied that those demesnes render good service.  There is, for instance, the question of a herd of pedigree cattle.  On a great many demesnes pedigree cattle are kept, and the resulting improvement in the strain in the blood makes for a general improvement in the cattle around, even though the bulls may be confined to the pedigree herd.  The generalintroduction of a new strain, fresh blood, is of benefit to the whole country, and it makes the breed of cattle in the country better.  I do not want to stress those points.  Where, as it is inevitable, you must proceed slowly, and where the Land Commission machinery can only deal with a certain number of estates at a time, you should leave to the last, and be slow to deal with, demesnes which give a considerable amount of employment, and which mean so much to the improvement of the district.</P>

      <P>The Act has been passed fully two years, and the people who were paying for probably twenty years are compelled to pay an increase of 2/- in the £ over what they would be paying if their lands were vested. This amount runs into something near £150,000.  In times of stress in agriculture, such as we have experienced during the past two years, this £150,000 would have been much better in the pockets of the tenants than in the pockets of the landlords.  There has been no great effort made to speed up the vesting of the purchases made under the 1923 Act.  The Minister ought to give the matter all the consideration possible.  He said that other portions of the Act must necessarily go slow.</P>
      <P>There should not be any great difficulty in speeding up the work of vesting those estates in the tenants, and so save them paying money such as they were paying out for the last two years. I would like the Minister to speed up the purchases under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not entirely in agreement with Deputy Wilson in the declaration he made regarding people paying their annuities.  I agree with Deputy Gorey, and I say that as far as the chronic people are concerned I would not give them any leniency.  I agree that it is not easy for the Land Commission or <Col N="1228" /> the Minister to deal with every side of this question.  No doubt, in some cases he has Deputies going to him pleading for time in regard to some tenants.  There are many people who would get over the hardship they suffered during the last two years if they were given a little time.  In the circumstances, the matter is not such an easy one to deal with.  I cannot say that I fully agree with Deputy Wilson in some of the remarks he made on this subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to a point I raised last night, dealing with some of the speeches made by politicians down the country and the class of audience they had to deal with.  I pointed out that their ideas were often taken up, exaggerated, distorted and distended.  What might be a perfectly legitimate utterance on the platform or in the speaker's mind, when it comes down to the rank and file lends itself very often towards the creation of certain feelings, and it tends to generate ideas that are sometimes expressed and that would be better left unexpressed.  Something of the same type appears to have happened in this instance.  Although I endeavoured to be as lucid as I could, and although I put my viewpoint in a comparatively clear way, still Deputies Mulvany and D'Alton have held that I stated I was opposed to the division of land.  I did not state any such thing as that I was opposed to the division of land. Deputy Mulvany says that I should preface my remarks by stating my individual opinions.  Judging by the inference, it would appear that I should consult Deputy Mulvany as to what my attitude and my utterances should be. That may be Deputy Mulvany's viewpoint; it is not mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I did wish to make last night was that you could not separate this question from justice, and from social reform.  If any attempt were made at separation it would only lead to failure.  I hold that whatever lands are to be divided&mdash;and I am not endeavouring to minimise the problem of dealing with congests, uneconomic holders, or landless men at any time&mdash;that division must be made in a spirit of <Col N="1229" /> equity.  The division must be made, not as a matter of political expediency, but after a close examination of every aspect of the problem, and particularly of the economics of the thing.</P>
    <P>I have been misinterpreted with regard to my statement in the Dáil last night.  I stated that when you divide a ranch you automatically lower the demand for cattle.  I submit that that is sound economics.  I endeavoured to convey the idea that our system of farm economy should be adapted to meet the changing situation.  I stated that so far from land division preceding education in this respect&mdash;education with a view to enabling the people to adapt themselves to changing circumstances&mdash;education should as far as possible precede land division.  I submit that you have to train the people to thinking economically.  Very little has been done in that direction, and if you want to make headway it will have to be done.  No attempt has been made to get them to adapt themselves to the changing situation.  Nothing of an educative character&mdash;if anything, it has been of a relatively small nature&mdash;has been embarked upon.  Concentration has largely been in the direction of getting the land divided.  The point that I would wish to express is this&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, I will repeat it now.  Unless I am called to order, I think I have a perfect right to do so.  A sound economic outlook in regard to this scheme will not alone benefit the whole agricultural community, but will benefit the credit of the State as well.  I want everyone of these considerations to be closely analysed and closely examined.  Instead of Deputies getting up here and making appeals to sentiment and emotion, they should come down to mathematical facts and endeavour to put this question on a rigid basis.  Deputy Johnson stated that he was prepared to take up land from certain persons.  If these lands were not fully utilised, he held that they were liable to forfeit. Who is to be the judge of whether lands are or are not properly utilised?  Is it the State?  Is it the persons who live <Col N="1230" /> in the vicinity?  Is it the corner-boy in the local village?  Who is to be the judge?</P>

Deputy D'Alton stated that some person in Tipperary had a farm of 350 acres&mdash;if I interpreted him aright&mdash;and not one acre of it was broken.  From that he went on to what you might call dangerous <Col N="1231" /> ground.  Out of a particular incident he drew a general principle, and he endeavoured then to formulate the idea that the State should intervene. We cannot be the judges as to what should be the conditions pertaining to any particular farm.  While you can advise them and assist them materially I do not know that it is a wise thing for the State to declare that they would dispossess these people.  Apart from any legal right the State may have, the principle is, and should be, as little interference as possible with the tenant in his holding.</P>

That does not seem to square with statements I made in opening this debate.  Deputy Johnson mentioned, quite fairly, that a warning was given on the discussion of the Land Act that there would not be sufficient land to please everybody.  There would not be sufficient land to meet the demand <Col N="1232" /> of all the applicants.  I gave that warning at the time, though I had not at my disposal the figures or facts I have been able to get since.  Nevertheless, I knew enough to know that a far greater number of people will be disappointed on being refused holdings, because there was no land to give them than the number that would actually get holdings, whether congests or landless men, or both.  We did take power under the Land Act to acquire any land of any man anywhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Saorstát, and what I was concerned to point out in opening this debate was that even after exercising that power very rigidly, and exercising it at the expense of untenanted land, demesne land, and tenanted land, very rigidly there was not enough of available land in this country to supply more than about 40 or 50 thousand persons&mdash;not 40 or 50 thousand congests, or 40 or 50 thousand landless men, but 40 or 50 thousand persons, including both congests and landless men.  I gave the figures.  I tried to show the number of holdings in the country, and in view of the figures, we were able to get fairly accurately the number of holdings in the country.  I gave the figures on which the calculation was based. Those figures showed that to carry out that very moderate programme it would be necessary to take 500,000 acres of tenanted land and it would be necessary to take a very big portion of demesnes, as well as all untenanted land.  I thought it right to give those figures to the Dáil as soon as I was able to get them myself, and I have done so.  Deputy Johnson asked why these figures were given and what exactly was the dilemma in which I found myself.  He pointed out, quite rightly, that the policy of the Land Commission was not so much a question for the Dáil as a question for the Land Commission, including the Minister for Agriculture.  He pointed out that it was my responsibility and that we had to make up our minds ourselves. I accept that; we have to make up our minds as to what our policy should be and we have done so.  In the <Col N="1233" /> light of all the facts and all the figures available when land purchase began, and all the facts and all the figures which come to our notice month by month and year by year, as the Land Act has been put into operation, I think everyone will agree &mdash;on this at least probably there will be unanimity&mdash;that we are beginning land purchase&mdash;I will deal with the delay afterwards&mdash;and we are not too late yet to change our policy if necessary. I do think it right at this stage to put the truth, as I know it, before the Dáil, because I do think, while I have my responsibility and while the Land Commission has its responsibilities, the members of the Dáil of all Parties have their responsibilities also. and not only should we face up to our responsibilities, but every party in the Dáil should do the same as far as they are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone here knows perfectly well that the carrying out of land purchase is a decidedly difficult task, and it is a task that can, in practice, be rendered doubly difficult unless the responsible men of all parties all over the country co-operate, so far as they can be expected to do so.  I do suggest, if we had decided that it was good national policy, to deal with as many congests as possible&mdash;speaking for myself and the Land Commission&mdash;we were entitled to the co-operation of every responsible man, no matter what party he belonged to, and no matter what part of the country he came from.  That was a point of view I wanted to put to the Dáil and that is the point of view on which I wanted the influence of the Dáil.  We have heard a lot of generalisations and sentiments on the Land Purchase Act which did not carry us very far.  I have heard people say that they are facing up to this question, notably Deputy Gorey, and that his policy is to give fair play to everybody. That, of course, is a very proper policy, but it does not carry us very far.  It does not touch the particular difficulties which I put up.  Neither do the rhetorical appeals of Deputy Mulvanny. I did expect that Deputies would get down to the figures I have given and which I believe to be approximately <Col N="1234" /> correct, and deal with them and not deal with irrelevant questions, such as whether this country could support an agricultural population of eight millions.  Remember, I have never said it could.  I am not arguing that point at the moment.  The nett issue in this debate, apart from details which can be discussed on subheads, is just what our policy should be, having regard to the fact that in exercising all the powers of compulsory acquisition which the Land Act gives us, we will only take sufficient land in the Free State to deal with 49 or 50 thousand persons.  That is the nett point.  It is rather a new point, but it is a very important point, and it raises very big questions of policy, now and in the future.  I was asked what was the policy of the Land Commission, a perfectly proper question. The policy of the Land Commission in the matter is to deal with the maximum number of congests and the minimum number of landless men.  We have to deal with some landless men practical difficulties will force us to deal with them equity will force us to deal with them.  But we will try to deal with as few as possible.  On one estate you have to deal with so many, on another with more, on another with less.  But, in a nutshell, the policy of the Land Commission is, as I have stated, in the light of these figures, to deal with the maximum number of congests and the minimum number of landless men.  We cannot carry out that policy effectively without the co-operation of Deputies.  We cannot carry out that policy effectively if influential public men in various parts of the country belonging to all parties&mdash; I except none&mdash;attend meetings protesting against bringing in strangers, or attend meetings pointing out the number of young men in the district who are entitled to land, and so forth. The Land Commission has an extremely difficult task.  It is not going to give satisfaction to anybody in connection with the administration of land purchase. It cannot.  There are about 100,000 congests expecting land, there are about 400,000 landless men expecting land, and the task of the Land Commission is to pick out of that number <Col N="1235" /> about 40,000.  Was there ever a more difficult task set to any State Department?  I do say, in all seriousness, that the Land Commission, in these circumstances, is entitled to take their time.  They have been going too fast, in my opinion.  They are entitled to take their time.  They are entitled to weigh up every consideration that affects that very difficult problem, and they are entitled to the support and influence of every influential man in every district, no matter what party he belongs to.</P>
    <P>Now as to delay, there is a difference of opinion as to whether the Land Commission is delaying.  The Land Commission could have gone ahead faster! The debate has given me the impression that if I had come here with figures, which were exactly half as much or exactly twice as big as the figures which I quoted, that the criticism would be exactly the same.  It is the right thing to say!  It is a matter of course!  It is very hard to judge whether the Land Commission has delayed or not.  It is very hard for Deputy Johnson, without being from day to day in touch with it, to know just how much work it takes to put through a sale, and just how much work it takes to administer big sums of money for relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly got the impression that if I had come here with figures that were twice as big or figures that were very much smaller, the discussion would run just on the same lines.  It is the right thing to say that there has been delay.  I do not know that it is worth quoting the figures again.  The Land Commission is dealing one way or another with 700,000 acres of tenanted land out of a possible total of a million and a quarter.  Yet there is delay.  The Land Commission has vested in the tenants 11,000 acres and it is dealing with 134,000.  There is vested in the tenants about 11,000 acres.  That is to say, they have got their full 35 per cent. reduction, or 40 per cent., as the case may be.  There <Col N="1236" /> are gazetted holdings to the extent of 175,000 acres, there are purchase schedules to the amount of 1,154,000 acres, and they are dealing with 1,341,000 acres.</P>
      <P>They are dealt with one way or another. Seven hundred thousand acres of untenanted land&mdash;that is about half of the untenanted land that can be available.  We are at the beginning of land purchase.  Personally, I would have considered that the Land Commission had done their work extremely quickly if they had completed their work in, say, five years from now.  Deputies should remember, in this connection, that the problem looked on nationally&mdash;apart from the cases which Deputy O'Connell quoted&mdash;amounts to this: that you have whatever land is available outside the congested districts and that you have the congests, in the main, inside the congested districts. That is, if you like, from one point of view, the smallest end of land purchase.  But from another point of view it is the most formidable end of land purchase.  The completion of land purchase is rendered much more difficult. We are now the heirs of all the cases that previous Land Acts failed to solve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, we are heirs to a problem which can only be partially solved by any Land Act.  I do suggest that the worst advice the Land Commission could get from me would be to go ahead and divide land quickly.  That can be done, provided we solve our difficulties in a certain way.  The Land Commission divide an estate down the country. There are ten or fifteen applicants. There is room for only six or seven. They can easily pick out six or seven, and put them on the land, and there will be no talk about it.  But these six or seven may not be the right people. It may take a good while, for a great many reasons, to pick out the six or seven people who, in equity, should get the land and say that they should go in.  The Land Commission could go too fast.  There is going to be a problem in regard to the congested districts in ten years after the land purchase operations are finished.  It depends on how land purchase is handled now <Col N="1237" /> whether that problem is going to be an extremely big or an insoluble problem in ten years, or whether it will be reduced, at least, to reasonable dimensions.</P>
    <P>Deputies should remember also with regard to pending sales, apart altogether from the vesting of lands in tenants, that the Land Commission has divided about 50,000 acres.  I would like to give the figure in connection with untenanted land and pending sales &mdash;the sort of land Deputy O'Connell was referring to last night.  The Land Commission took over from the Congested Districts Board 190,000 acres of undivided land.  Of that 190,000 acres there were only 20,000 acres of arable land.  The rest was mountain and waste.  At present there is 130,000 non-arable acres of land undivided, and 10,000 acres of arable land undivided. That is 140,000 acres out of 190,000 acres.  Picture what that means. There is taken over in the congested districts 190,000 acres of land, of which 170,000 is non-arable&mdash;mountain, waste bog, and so on.  Living all over that land, which consists of cut-away bog, sides of mountain, and so on, there are congests, and there is no land in the hands of the Land Commission anywhere near them on which they could be made economic.  That was the position until the Land Act of 1923 was passed.  The powers of the Congested Districts Board to acquire land compulsorily were limited, and in the particular case that Deputy O'Connell mentioned last night, where holdings were not vested for fourteen years, here is what happened: The estate is in the middle of that sort of area.  That will give you an idea of the sort of land some of it is.  The Land Commission buy the estate he mentions.  They divide it into what are called &ldquo;parcels.&rdquo;  These &ldquo;parcels&rdquo; are for tenants on another estate, which they have not got, and which they had no power up to the 1923 Act, to buy, and no funds available wherewith to buy.  They could not vest that land in the tenants until they had purchased the other estate.  You have, in the other case, the exact opposite. You have a case where the Congested Districts Board buy an estate and you have a number of tenants with <Col N="1238" /> small holdings.  You may have thirty or forty congests.  The Land Commission may have enough untenanted land to deal with five.  There might be no other land available in the area.  It would be quite impossible to divide that untenanted land.  There would be murder at some stage.  There would not be murder now, but there was a time when there would be, at any rate, considerable confusion, and the five unfortunate congests who got the land would not be extremely happy.  It would be very difficult to divide that land.  It was far better in that case, to leave that land in common until you got sufficient land to deal with the applicants. That is the sort of difficulty that the Congested Districts Board was up against.  Rightly, you can say that that difficulty should no longer exist because, under the Land Act of 1923, there are ample compulsory powers. But at least that is an answer to the case that the estate was fourteen years in the hands of the Congested Districts Board.  That clears the position up to the year 1924.</P>
    <P>So far as the Land Act of 1923 is concerned, Deputy O'Connell could only criticise the Land Commission in respect of this particular estate which he mentioned if he criticised them in respect of the other estates which are not amongst the million acres which the Land Commission have already bought.  There is no case against the Land Commission in respect of that estate, except the case in respect of the other estates which they have not bought up to the present.  They are dealing with over a million acres of land.  Speaking of tenanted and untenanted land, they are dealing with half the land of the country, and before he can criticise them in this respect he must criticise them in respect of half the land of the country.  The same remark applies to the point made by Deputy Conlan in respect of the Verschoyle Estate.  There are two Verschoyle estates&mdash;A.R. Verschoyle and W.T. Verschoyle.  They are both gazetted, and the same considerations apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid not.  How could there be?  The Land Commission cannot interfere with an estate until they have acquired the legal ownership of it.  It would be a very serious matter if they did.  Under the Land Act of 1923, the landlords relinquished their right to collect rents but no other rights of ownership were taken away.  That was the deliberate policy and was discussed and debated in the Dáil.  If the tenant wishes to sell his holding, he must still get the consent of the landlord.  The Land Commission cannot deal with any land until they become legal owners of it. The only rights the Land Commission have under the Act of 1923, in connection with tenanted land, is the right to collect rents.</P>

      <P>I gather that that is not possible in this case.  I discussed this case with Deputy Conlan before.  It is possible sometimes to expedite matters, but Deputies must remember that nearly everybody's goose is a swan. I get cases from Deputies in all parts of the House and these cases are always the most urgent in the country.  I do not say that this is not a particularly urgent case.  It may be.  I do not profess for one moment to keep in touch <Col N="1240" /> with the administration of every estate with which the Land Commission is dealing.  I would be very foolish if I did.  I gather that this is a fairly urgent case, but Deputies will have to remember that there is scarcely a member of the House who has not two or three cases which, in his opinion, are equally urgent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell quoted another case which is rather interesting. It raises a peculiar question. It is a case in which three tenants paid, let us say, £15 rent&mdash;we need not be exact as to the amount in this matter&mdash; before purchase.  One of them was migrated.  His holding went to the two others, so that the two tenants have holdings which formerly they had together with another, and the new rent payable to the Land Commission is about £19.  That may very well be, as I will explain to the Deputy.  It may be that the congest who was taken off was migrated to a holding which the Land Commission resumed from a tenant&mdash; that the land the migrated congest got had been formerly tenanted land. Assume that for a moment.  What I am going to say now applies to the 500,000 acres, which I mentioned as possible for the Land Commission to acquire from existing tenants for the purpose of the 1923 Act.  When the Land Commission acquire land from a tenant, they first of all have to pay for the landlord's interest on the usual basis.  Then they have also to pay resumption price to the tenant.  You cannot take land from the tenant without giving him fair compensation. That makes the land extremely dear.  What happens in a case like that is that the Land Commission try to distribute the difference between what would be the fair re-sale price to the people who are to get this resumed holding and what they actually paid, over as many people as possible.  That is the fair thing to do.  The Land Commission do not view the case of any one tenant as an isolated case.  Take an estate bought and say there are ten or eleven congests on it.  They can only deal with ten.  They deal with two outside <Col N="1241" /> the estate.  They might be any two.  Whatever extra cost might be incurred in connection with the transferring of the two of them would be put into the joint fund and would be the liability of the whole lot.  That is perfectly correct.  What would happen in this case would be that the difference would be spread over the three&mdash;the two who were left and the one who migrated.  That could happen and the total annuity would be higher than the rent was previously.  I am not sure that I made myself clear and, perhaps, I had better make the point again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is quite clear.  In the particular case I have in mind&mdash;not the case I quoted&mdash;the man who migrated was put on to a grazing ranch that was broken up, and he got a house there that was not newly built&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that particular grazing ranch tenanted land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked that question because that is the sort of thing that often happens.  When I referred to the difference between re-sale price and the price they paid, I made a slight mistake. In this particular case of resumed land, they sell the land at full price.  That price is big, because they have to pay the landlord and they have to pay the tenant from whom they have resumed the holding.  The annuity will, therefore, be pretty high.</P>
      <P>You justify that by this: you were getting two economic holdings where there were three uneconomic holdings before, and you ignore the fact that the annuity is higher than the rent which each paid, provided that the annuity is a fair annuity.  The important thing is to give a man a holding at a fair annuity.  That makes it extremely difficult to deal with tenanted land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not at all agree with the idea that where land is taken up, whether it is demesne land, untenanted land, or even what we will roughly call grazing land, that it carries less stock and produces less.  That is definitely not so. The average experience is this, that <Col N="1242" /> where a farm is taken up&mdash;I know specific cases of it, and I know it is the general rule&mdash;and divided between fifteen or twenty people who build houses and live there, it carries far more live stock.  I know it of my own experience.  In the district in County Galway from which I come, a tremendous amount of land has been divided, and I have a fair knowledge in my own parish of the amount of stock carried on certain farms.  I have gone into the matter from curiosity, and, taking cows, calves, yearlings and two-year-olds into account, but leaving out pigs, which do not graze to any extent, there are far more cattle and far more sheep carried on such farms, notwithstanding that there is probably a fair amount of tillage where there had been none. There is an immediate production of corn, live stock and roots where land is divided.  I think that is a record of which the Land Commission has reason to be proud.  The number of failures under the 1903 Act and the 1909 Act has been extremely small, almost none, due to the care with which the Land Commission chooses its men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to make a debating point.  I agree that the arrears should be collected, and collected promptly.  We cannot do business on any other lines.  There is a general consensus of opinion now that Land Commission annuities should be collected. That point of view, of course, is the one which the Land Commission holds, and which I suggest every responsible man must hold as a matter of course.  Annuities have always been collected promptly, so far as we could <Col N="1243" /> collect them, and annuities will be collected promptly in the future.  But I do suggest that we were not all quite so unanimous on that point of view six months ago, and that that has had some small thing to do with the difficulties that the Land Commission have been encountering in collecting annuities, some small thing to do with the present arrears problem.  This arrears problem commenced in 1922, and I think the arrears are owed, at least as to half, in the rich counties.  I am perfectly certain if I went through the lists I would find big farmers, well-off farmers, who never spent too much on politics or anything else, but who were alive to the fact that in 1922 no one might ever pay anything again, and who promptly took advantage of that.  In 1922 in very rich areas, in areas in which there is very good land and very little congestion, arrears began to accumulate. So far as tenants who are in arrears from that date are concerned, it is an extraordinary fact that the man who did not get his Receivable Order in 1922 was processed and paid, who did not get it in 1923, was processed and paid, who did not get it in 1924 was processed and paid, and I would say that that was so in a considerable number of cases.  There was considerable confusion, because the postal service was broken up, the courts were not functioning, and for at least two years it was almost impossible to sell a holding. We have threatened to sell many holdings recently, and people paid up promptly.  In 1922-23 it was no easy matter to get anybody to buy a holding, but now there is no difficulty whatever; there are plenty of people willing to buy the holdings of defaulting annuitants in the cases I have mentioned, in well-off counties, and those farmers are beginning to know that, and are paying promptly when they get notice of a sale.  But, so far as the cases that Deputy Nolan quoted are concerned, namely, of eight gales owing, that is extraordinary; it is a matter that requires inquiring into, and it will be inquired into.  But, so far as four and five gales are concerned, Deputies will have to remember that it was rather difficult to sell a holding in 1923, and a <Col N="1244" /> man who was in arrears in 1921 was in a happy position in 1923.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. NOLAN Mr. NOLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection was that some were allowed to go on for four or five, while others, who were only a month in arrear, were processed, and others were processed who were able to go into court and produce receipts.  The inconsistency is the main point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there are a few other cases mentioned by Deputy Nolan and Deputy White.  Some of them may be quite genuine.  It would be extraordinary if, under the circumstances of the last three years, there was not a certain amount of confusion, for this reason, that arrears increased tremendously in a very short time, and you had people for all sorts of reasons thinking that they need not pay.  You had people, for instance, who considered that they should get more turbary. The reaction to that point of view was: &ldquo;I will not pay my annuity until I get more turbary.&rdquo;  You had people, on the other hand, who did not pay until they got processes, and then sent the annuity to the Land Commission. The Land Commission would not accept it.  The Land Commission did sometimes accept it, and wrote to the solicitor, saying: &ldquo;We have the annuity. Collect your costs.&rdquo;  But now they have adopted the practice, and it is the right practice, of returning it to the solicitor.  You had cases that were extremely common; anyone who comes from the country will understand it. A man does not pay his annuity for some reason or other, either because he did not get a reduction in his payment in lieu of rent, he did not get turbary, or for some other reason, such as the case I quoted last night, where he was in litigation with the neighbours on some question with which the Land Commission had nothing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. CONLAN Mr. CONLAN">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>But when he gets the process he says to himself: &ldquo;I have got to pay, and the thing to do is to pay and not pay any costs,&rdquo; and he immediately sends up the annuity to the Land Commission.  They return it <Col N="1245" /> to the solicitor; he writes to the man and says: &ldquo;You have got to pay my costs.&rdquo;  It may be that at this stage the Civil Bill has been entered.  The man, of course, ignores that letter; the attitude in a case like that is, that if you do not answer you cannot tell what will happen.  The solicitor then gets a decree.  That explains the tremendous number of cases you have been told of where people are processed and decreed after they have paid. There was another class of case which Deputy Nolan mentioned, the case where parties were processed and the case was dismissed.  Those cases require consideration.  It would be an extraordinary thing in the circumstances if there was not some little overlapping.  You must consider also that the State solicitors had to deal not only with land business but with a tremendous amount of abnormal business, compensation and other, in the last three years, and were quite new to the work.  If the Land Commission do not receive the money within thirty days of the date, they draw from the Guarantee Fund and send notice to the solicitor.  I have got these specific cases.  These must be inquired into, especially the cases that Deputy Nolan quoted, that is to say, the cases where there were dismissals.  There must be something loose there, and these will be inquired into.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he would be able to bring in a Bill to relieve the ratepayers putting a penal charge on defaulting annuitants, on the same principle as that employed by the Board of Works. I think the Board of Works charge 5 per cent.  There is nothing in the Land Act to enable him to do so.  It is very unfair for prompt-paying annuitants to have to pay for defaulting annuitants, and that is happening year after year. There were £46,000 of arrears in Limerick, amounting to about 2/- in the pound on the valuation of the county. That is most unfair.  If we could bring in a Bill to relieve&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It may come to that, but no Bill can be introduced this session, and hence no Bill can be introduced before the end of the year.

There are two sides to it, but it is at least worth consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>As to sub-head (i), some months ago we had a statement&mdash; I think it was a joint statement of joint departments.  The Minister for Agriculture, speaking on behalf of the Land Commission, took the main burden of explaining the position of the people on the western seaboard chiefly, from Donegal to Cork, and the steps that had been taken to relieve them, owing to the exceptional hardship they were undergoing by virtue of failure of crops and loss of turf.  It was reported a month or two ago that some of these measures were no longer necessary, that the assistance given in respect to the feeding of school children, and other forms of assistance, had ceased. I think it is very necessary to ask the Minister to give us an explanation of the position at present in regard to these districts and the work that has been done.  Notwithstanding the statement that there has been a cessation of the work, it is alleged by people who know the district that there is still a great need, and that there ought not to have been a cessation of that relief work.  A couple of days ago I had a communication from a man with whom I have had correspondence over a number of years occasionally, and whose word I have always found reliable.  He informs me that in the district he is best acquainted with in Tirconaill the position is at present very serious indeed, that is in the districts of Glendoan, Glenswilly, Gartan and Termon. He says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot describe to you the sufferings of the poor in these areas.  You, I am sure, are aware that the potato is the staple food of the people in the poorer districts of Ireland.  Well, I can solemnly assert that I am acquainted <Col N="1247" /> with numbers of small occupiers in the districts to which I refer that have had no potatoes for two years past.  In order to keep the wolf from the door these people have been gradually disposing of a cow now, a sheep later on, so that at present they have nothing to rely upon to procure even the most meagre food.</P>
    <P>He goes on to explain his intimate knowledge of the district, and that he knows the circumstances of every individual there.  Then he proceeds:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The people of these mountainous districts are a proud race.  They want no charity doles.  They want work. A couple of roads made into the peat bogs would relieve present distress until the crops would ripen.  There are no existing roads to the bogs in which the people get fuel.  The people have to carry the peats or turf in creels on their backs for miles across mountain.  A few hundred pounds would suffice to make necessary roads and would relieve from starvation the finest people on God's earth.</P>
    <P>I have another letter from the district of Rockchapel, in the Co. Cork, which I only received this morning.  A similar description is given of the position there, and a similar appeal made, that if some useful work was done in the making of roads to the bogs it would relieve the present special distress. I am bringing forward these two instances, because I am sure they are only typical of many, and they indicate to me from two ends of the country, that the question arises whether there was justification for the cessation of these relief measures.  I invite the Minister to state whether the people in these areas, who were thought six or eight months ago to be in need, have been relieved sufficiently to put them beyond the fear of want; whether the children are being adequately fed; whether there is need for further provision, and, generally, what is the present position?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to enter, if I can, into the sort of discussion that <Col N="1248" /> will probably take place on a later Vote.  Let me say, however, that the particular relief schemes which the Department of Lands and Agriculture had to do with were&mdash;the distribution of seed potatoes and the relief work carried out by the Land Commission. Distribution of fuel, I think, was done mainly by the Local Government Department. Of course, that is stopped. There is no need for that.  I could not say what the position is up to date. But I know that a week ago most of the turf of last year was not actually lying on the ground in mud.  It had dried and the people were busy cutting additional turf for next year.  I do not anticipate there is any likelihood whatever that there will be a shortage of fuel next year.  With regard to seed, of course, the distribution of it has stopped.  Seed potatoes were distributed very largely, with good results, and, on the whole, the crop is doing well.</P>
      <P>With regard to relief works, which were, after all, the main works done by the Land Commission, and the main form of relief which they did, up to 7th May there was £210,000 worth of special works done.  Every penny that had been promised in the Dáil in October was spent in the time.  There still remains, however, a very big proportion of those works unfinished, and there is a sum of £70,000 to finish those works.  Those works are being finished, so that the relief works are, in fact, going on.  The Deputy will have a fair idea of the extent of the relief works unfinished when I say that a fortnight ago it required about £70,000 to finish them.  These are going on.  They did stop for a week or so, but they will be going on immediately.  So far as those works are concerned, they will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This £200,000 set out under this sub-head for improvement works will give employment in a great many cases in the areas where employment is needed. It is not, however, for relief works, and Deputies should not consider that they would be justified in approaching the Land Commission, so far as this sum is concerned, and saying: &ldquo;There is a road in such and such a place that <Col N="1249" /> might be improved, and you ought to spend some money on it.&rdquo;  This money is required for improvement work in connection with estates which have been purchased, or will be purchased, during the year&mdash;for houses, fences, loans, migration, etc.  That money will give a large amount of employment.  It will not, however, give employment as a result of preparing careful schemes of relief works, picking out the really bad districts, and spending a certain amount there, and a certain amount in places not quite so bad.  The employment must be given wherever the Land Commission have estates which require to be improved.  As luck would have it, most of the estates will be in comparatively poor districts.  So far as the relief works which were being done by the Land Commission are concerned, they are yet to be finished, and are being finished, and there is, I am glad to say, about £70,000 available to finish them.</P>
    <P>As to the present position in the country, I do not like to speak without having the reports before me.  There is, no doubt however, that things have improved very much.  There was, especially within the last three weeks, a very big decrease in unemployment in the country, so far as my reports go, due to the late spring, for one thing. A lot of the spring work was being done during the end of May and the beginning of June.  Things were undoubtedly very much healthier in the country.  I am not speaking of the particular areas in Tirconaill which Deputy Johnson quoted.  There is this to be said about Tirconaill&mdash;it might not apply to these particular areas&mdash;that last year there was a particularly good crop of potatoes there.  It was rather lucky as a county in that respect.  I am saying nothing about the particular <Col N="1250" /> area mentioned, because I have no information about it, but, on the whole, there was a fairly good crop of potatoes. The reports I have indicates that there is a decided improvement so far as employment is concerned, especially during the last fortnight.  I could not say any more at this stage, but this is a subject which, I take it, will be debated on the other Vote.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister that he should circulate in proper form the figures that he has given during the course of this discussion regarding land division, etc.?

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies have the interim report of the Committee of Inquiry into Health Insurance and Medical Service.  That places them practically on a par with me as regards information for formulating any general policy regarding the question of National Health Insurance.  Until the full report is published, and until I have an opportunity of getting the views of all parties concerned, I will not be able to formulate any definite conclusive policy in regard to National Health Insurance as a whole.  Accordingly, I will just go through the sub-heads and make a few comments upon them.</P>
      <P>With regard to sub-head (a), salaries, wages and allowances, the increase in this sub-head is due to the ordinary normal incremental increases and an increased rate of bonus.  The figures are reduced to those required for normal work in the Free State in all branches, except certain sections of the accounts branch, in which a full staff is required until the division between Northern Ireland and the Free State, and also the separation from Great Britain, is finally effected.  A portion of the amount provided under this sub-head, estimated at £3,800, is chargeable to the Government of Northern Ireland for work being done by this Department preliminary to the apportionment of the funds of Approved Societies.  A sum estimated at £2,000 is recoverable from the British Government for work done by this Department on behalf of the British Ministry of Pensions.  There is also a sum which is chargeable to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, amounting to £11,200, in respect of work performed in securing compliance with the Unemployment Insurance Acts, while a sum of £2,300 is paid to officers on loan to other Departments.</P>
      <P>Sub-head (b) deals with travelling expenses.  A sum of £9,200 is required for travelling expenses, etc., of the outdoor staff, which includes 63 officers. A portion of this sum, estimated at £4,820 represents travelling expenses incurred by officers of the Department in securing compliance with the Unemployment Insurance Acts on behalf of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The cost of travelling expenses is swollen by the cost of car hire, which has increased very considerably since 1914.  A sum of £360 is provided for the travelling expenses of the Commissioners and staff attending conferences and attending Approved Societies and Insurance Committees.  £90 is also provided for expenses of members of the Advisory Committee when attending conferences.</P>
      <P>Sub-head (c) touches special inquiries and services.  This is an amount of £10 only, and it is provided merely as a token-sum to keep the sub-head open.  Sub-head (d) deals with insurance stamps.  The Revenue Department has been approached on the question of reducing the estimate for the manufacture of stamps for the year 1925-26 from £550 to £500.  They state that the expenditure for the past year will not approach the estimated figure, because the printing of new stamps has not yet begun, and the only cost will be for the overprinting of old stamps. As soon as the work in connection with the manufacture of the new stamp begins, they consider that the figure of cost given is a correct one.  As regards sub-head (e), the item of £80 under it is made up of £20 for washing towels for central office and £60 for the purchase by the outdoor staff of necessary articles of stationery not supplied from headquarters.  These are railway guides, ink, gum and local newspapers, and matters of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> The next important sub-head is (g) (1).  Prior to the establishment of the Free State there was a small item for administration under (g) (1), which represented the State grant of medical benefit received in Great Britain by stray members of Irish societies.  This has now disappeared, and the words &ldquo;including expenses for administration&rdquo; are no longer required in the note.  Under (g) (2) I may say that the estimate for this sub-head was, up to the year 1923-24, always prepared by the Government Actuary in London.  His figures, which were presumably based on the expectation of sickness and on the estimated number of insured persons, were usually much in excess of the expenditure. For the past two years the Commission have endeavoured to bring the estimated figure as low as possible, having regard to the actual sickness experience, but in view of the uncertain factors governing expenditure under this head, a reasonable margin has to be allowed.  An increase in employment and greater compliance with the Insurance Acts are likely to increase the expenditure under this sub-head during the coming year, while provision has also to be made for the possible occurrence of an epidemic.  A margin of £10,500 to meet these increases does not seem excessive, and it would not be safe to take a lower figure.</P>
    <P>The only other point that may arise is that Deputies might be anxious for some information as to how the Medical Referee scheme set up last February is working.  I introduced a Bill to-day which is intended to give legal sanction to the setting-up of this scheme.  The new Medical Referee scheme for the provision to Approved Societies of second medical opinions in respect of members claiming or receiving sickness and disablement benefits was put into operation by the Commission as from the 1st February, and is authorised to be continued up to the end of this year.  Three temporary District Medical Referees were appointed for the making of examinations under the scheme, their headquarters having been fixed at Dublin, Cork and Oranmore, Co. Galway.  The examinations <Col N="1254" /> of insured persons are made by the Referees at various centres throughout the Saorstát and in the overwhelming majority of cases in premises&mdash;for example, dispensaries and hospitals&mdash;under the control of local authorities who, in most instances, have given the use of their premises free of charge.  Forty-two such centres were set up during the period under review and negotiations are in progress for the setting-up of additional centres in counties including Tirconaill.</P>
    <P>The number of applications for reference received from approved societies, from the 1st February to the 30th April, 1925, was 1,733, twenty-eight societies having availed of the scheme. Medical certifiers under the National Health Insurance Acts are also entitled to apply for second opinions in respect of cases in which they are issuing certificates for incapacity for work; but during the period mentioned only twenty-one such applications were received. Of the total number of applications&mdash;1,754&mdash;451 were considered to be unsuitable for examination on medical grounds, and the remainder were promptly forwarded by the Commission to the respective referees for the necessary action at centres where the arrangement for the making of examinations had already been completed.</P>
    <P>The total number of applications sent to the referees during the period in question was 1,049, and I will give you some particulars relating to those.  The number of applications for reference received by the Medical Referees amounted to 1,049.  The number of cases actually examined by the Medical Referees was 628.  The number of cases reported by the referees to be incapable of work was 218.  The number of cases reported to be capable of work was 410. The number of cases in which the insured persons did not present themselves for examination, including persons who declared off benefit before the date fixed for examination, and the persons who were certified as unfit to attend was 421, or 40.1 per cent. of the number of cases summoned to attend for examination.  I do not think there is anything else I can say now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1255" /> Deputies may desire to ask questions under the various sub-heads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The information that was supplied to me to-day in response to questions I put down was, of course, received too late to enable me to digest and understand it.  That precludes me from raising matters now which I might otherwise desire to raise.  I want to have confirmed my impression of the Minister's statement regarding the attitude of the Ministry on the question of the amalgamation or the unification of societies.  The Minister is, of course, aware that the opinion is widespread in National Health Insurance circles that decisions have been arrived at.  That opinion is based partially upon the report that has been circulated and partially upon alleged evidence of some kind or another.  I take it from the Minister's statement that all these assumptions are inaccurate and baseless and that, notwithstanding the issuing of the report of the Commission, the Ministry has not gone to the extent of committing itself in any way and is not going to do so until it has had evidence, even beyond that of the Commission, as regards the views of interested parties, whether they be societies or insured persons.  I think it well that it should go out quite authoritatively that I am rightly interpreting the Minister when I say that that is wrong.  I think it should go out that it is wrong to say the Ministry have decided, or have even come to the point of deciding, upon the recommendations of the Commission, either in the direction of accepting them wholly or partially, or not accepting them at all.  Do I take it that that is a correct interpretation of the Minister's statement?</P>

Until we have given all persons with any interest in this matter an opportunity of expressing their views and giving us any opinions at their disposal, there will be no question of coming to any decision.  I have a perfectly open mind on this matter at the moment.  There is no doubt the publication of the report will have its own influence.  It is a very important <Col N="1256" /> document.

Is he satisfied that under the present sanatorium system the arrangements are as good as could be secured for the money and that proper precautions are being taken to isolate cases?  Is he satisfied that proper enquiries are made to discover this class of patient?  Is it only when they report themselves, or when they apply for relief, that these consumptives are discovered in the country?  I know it is somewhat difficult to discover those people except they report themselves. There are several families in parts of the country and they seem never to come in contact with sanatoria.  They are dying and the condition of their houses is not all that could be desired. I do not think that the people who are supposed to deal with this question are reaching the object, or are trying to reach the object for which this portion of the Act was instituted.  I am not satisfied that the best is being done, or that there is enough isolation.  There are numbers of families dying from this disease and they have never been visited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that our measures for the prevention of consumption are not, in all respects, all that is to be desired.  Dealing with this question generally in so far as it is affected by this particular Vote, it is a matter that will be considerably affected by the appointment of a county medical officer of health, who will be responsible for all these services in the future, as well as for the prevention of other forms of disease.  This is a matter that will have to be dealt <Col N="1257" /> with by a commission generally, and until they have reported and proposed some scheme for the improvement of this particular system I do not see that I could serve any useful purpose by making any recommendations or altering the present system, except in so far as it will be altered under the provisions of the Local Government Act, which makes a county medical officer responsible for all these health services, preventative as well as curative.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he is satisfied that the salaries paid to the tuberculosis officers will enable them to pay the necessary visits to persons suffering from tuberculosis. There is scarcely a parish in any county where you will not get twenty cases of tuberculosis, and they require a lot of visiting if the medical officer is to supervise his work properly. The salary, including all travelling expenses paid to the tuberculosis officer, is something about £620.  My idea is if he did his work properly, and if he supervised each case properly and gave it a decent chance to recover, he would spend all that money, and more, in travelling expenses.  I think it is quite obvious from the salary paid that he cannot do his work efficiently, and I <Col N="1259" /> doubt that he is expected to do it efficiently. I think a lot of this expenditure, simply for the reasons that it is not sufficient to give a man an opportunity of doing his work properly, is a great drawback in these schemes.  I saw recently where Medical Referees were appointed to revise the work of medical certifiers.  Also they have some connection with the administration of sanatorium benefit.  These men are allowed £600 a year.  I should like to know is the Minister responsible for recommending that, or does it go to the Department of Finance, and has the Department of Finance the last word to say to it?  These men are not properly paid for their work, and I believe the work is not being properly done.</P>

      <P>I want to say a word on this question of tuberculosis.  It is not necessary, with all due respect to Deputy Hennessy, that doctors should attend regularly tubercular patients.  I was a tubercular patient.  After the disease was discovered certain treatment was ordered, and the treatment had its effect.  It was not necessary to have a medical doctor coming to me. Mainly it was a question of good food and fresh air; it was a question of treatment more than medical advice.  Once a doctor pronounces a patient ill of this disease, it is a question of treatment, and it does not require medicine.  That is my experience.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hennessy seems to be actuated by one concern, and that is as to whether the doctors are paid enough, considering that they have to go around the country.  He mentioned that there are twenty cases in every parish.  That is a thing that I am not prepared to admit.  This continuous travelling is only in his own imagination.  I thought when the Deputy came into the Dáil that he was a representative of South Dublin, but I find now that he is a representative of the medical profession.</P>

But I want to know are these men paid sufficient to secure that they can put their services at the disposal of those requiring them. In fact, I will go so far with Deputy Gorey as to say that there are a lot of these men paid so little that you could further economise and wipe out their offices altogether for all they can do.</P>

      <P>A point that does strike one about this is as to whether we are dealing on the proper lines with this particular difficulty.  The President has pointed out that in one area it is a notifiable disease.  As far as I know&mdash; he can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;outside that area it is not a notifiable disease.  What occurs to the ordinary lay mind is that if the disease is of such importance as to make it notifiable in one area, surely it is equally important that it should be made notifiable in other areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The President pointed out that it was permissive in the other areas, but as I understood him, it was compulsory in Dublin city.  The point that has been raised by Deputy Gorey is a very reasonable one.  How can you deal with this particular disease, how can you bring the advantages of sanatorium treatment before those affected with this disease, except you go where they are and get your officers into touch with them?  That appears to me to be a reasonable attitude, and in order that the officers of this particular Department should be put in touch with all those who are affected with this disease, I think it would be essential that it should be made a notifiable disease all over the country, instead of limiting notification to one particular portion of the area.  That appears to be an aspect of the question that one would like to consider more fully than there has been time to consider it in the past, but as I said, if notification is essential in <Col N="1261" /> one area, I do not see why the other area should be excluded from the benefits that notification would undoubtedly bring to those afflicted with this particular disease.</P>

The case that Deputy Good is making of course is one which might well be made if he were arguing in favour of the abolition of the present system and advocating centralised control of a State scheme.</P>

      <P>My object in drawing attention to this is that I recognise and the medical profession, I am sure, recognise, that except this disease is taken in the very early stages and prevention used before the disease develops you will not get adequate results. What I want is to try to impress on those in authority to get at it in its very early stages when it can be effective and not to be dealing with cases where the disease has been contracted, especially with extreme cases.  This is of immense importance, and that is my object in drawing attention to the matter.</P>

      <P>It should be in operation now.  The particular Tuberculosis Act is in a different category to that dealing with ordinary compulsorily notifiable diseases.  It is one of these cases where you have to reconcile the rights of the individual with the rights of the public.  Irish people are very seni sitive about tuberculosis and about having it known that it is in their family, <Col N="1262" /> and you might do more harm than good by allowing inspectors to go in and investigate whether people are suffering from it or not.  In order to get over this difficulty this Act is restricted to cases where the disease has reached a serious stage.  I think there has to be foam from the mouth, or the spittle has to be infected, or there must be other symptoms before the doctor is justified in insisting on the patient undergoing treatment and on compulsory notification.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of this Vote is the statutory payments made by the State in addition to those made by local authorities in connection with industrial and reformatory schools.  This matter, so far as the local authorities are concerned, has created some dissatisfaction.  When I was a member of the Dublin Corporation objection was taken on the part of certain schools that preference had been extended in regard to certain committals in respect of some of these institutions. In recent years, from the time of the Great War or shortly afterwards, the number of committals to reformatory schools had, I understand, fallen very considerably.  It was alleged that they fell from various causes.  In large centres such as the city of Dublin and other cities, it was alleged to have been the result of assistance that came from these who joined the army, and, as a consequence, people who formerly had to call upon such institutions were enabled to keep their children at home. In connection with reformatory schools I am afraid that the situation has become somewhat difficult.  In an Act passed about four or five years ago liability rests on local authorities to provide such institutions as reformatory schools where no such establishment is in existence.  There are two such institutions.  I think it is scarcely fair to call them reformatory schools <Col N="1263" /> or to refer to them in the way in which they have for a very long time been present in the mind of the public.  I understand that boys from these institutions render a good account of themselves afterwards.  One hears occasionally of a case of non-success, and that is often stressed as an argument against this method of dealing with youthful offenders or truants.  However, as far as the State is concerned, its liability is expressed in the amount put down in the Vote.  Personally, I have not spoken to the Minister for Finance, but I think that these particular institutions, by reason of the smallness of the number of the boys, will find it difficult to keep open their doors unless the amount is increased or a larger number of boys are sent to these schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the President's sympathetic statement regarding reformatory schools, but I think the case requires to be met a little more fully.  As I understand the position, there are two reformatory schools in the Free State area which have been operating for a large number of years&mdash;I think for fifty or sixty years.  These have been conducted by a religious order with the definite purpose of reforming character.  I do not know whether my impression of reformatory schools was typical of the general impression or not, but I must admit, without having given very close consideration to the matter, that I always visualised the reformatory school as something very like a gaol. The idea of boys and youths being sent to a reformatory was somewhat repulsive because of the knowledge that a boy of 12, 13 or 14 years of age, if he were to go into the surroundings and the atmosphere of a gaol, or anything like a gaol, would not come away with an improved character.  I had an opportunity provided, of which I took advantage not more than two weeks ago, to visit one of the reformatories in question, and I understand it is quite typical of the other, that is Glencree Reformatory School.  It has been called up to now a reformatory school, or, rather, a reformatory, but I understand <Col N="1264" /> that the people responsible for this school have come to the very wise decision to give it a name which would be more characteristic of its quality and purpose, and have changed the name to a training school.  From my observation I must say that it is entitled fully to the new designation, and, while its purpose may be to reform, it does not carry with it the impression of a punitive institution which the old name did undoubtedly carry with it.</P>
      <P>I was particularly impressed during my visit there&mdash;the incident I understand is not peculiar but is quite common&mdash;to find that two men were visitors both of whom had in years past been trained at this reformatory. One old man who had gone to America after having done his period of service or training at the school, had progressed and, as I could gather, prospered. He had come back to Ireland and had quite deliberately taken up his residence for the summer season in the neighbourhood so that he could find himself in the old surroundings with pleasure.  That is something which to me is very marked and could not apply&mdash;I think it is almost impossible for it to apply&mdash;to any normal sane human being if he were to think of this school as a jail or prison or anything approaching a jail or prison.  That same remark applies to other persons, one of whom was present from the city of Dublin during my visit.  Men go out frequently, strange to say if one thinks of the reformatory in the old category but not strange in view of the knowledge which my little experience gained.  Men who had gone through the reformatory come back on a visit and take their children to see the schools through which these men have progressed. I think that is very notable and very well worthy of recording.  I understand it is quite a common experience but it struck me as remarkable and would probably strike many people in the same light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a reformatory school boys below 12 are not taken.  Boys from 12 to 16 are sent to these schools and I can see quite well that while there is strict discipline, there is an amount of freedom and friendliness between the boys with each other and between the boys and <Col N="1265" /> their masters, their teachers and their directors.  I think in every way the school is fairly entitled to be characterised as a training school and it occurs to me that our attitude in regard to these schools should be modified according to this conception.  Undoubtedly there are all kinds of boys sent to the school and they require different types of treatment but experienced masters no doubt are able to apply that treatment, and perhaps they are tried over much in respect of the boys that are committed there.  I do not pretend, and I would like that nobody would assume, that I have a full knowledge of the school from only one afternoon's visit but I am satisfied that an institution of the kind is very much better than anything in the nature of a prison or anything approaching what might be called a punitive institution.</P>
    <P>We may ask, and rightly, what is to be done with boys who have had a bad training, who are in evil environment and who may become inured to the practices of older people round about them if they are not taken early and corrected and trained.  Undoubtedly a large proportion of the boys who are committed to these schools&mdash;I am speaking at the moment of reformatory schools&mdash;if they were not so committed would become inured to criminal habits, and these habits it would be impossible to eradicate in after years.  I think criminal habits are in the main the products of environment.  I think in the main the number of persons who require to be sent to prison or who are sent to prison for anti-social practices adopt anti-social habits by virtue of their surroundings in childhood and youth.</P>
    <P>It is well that there should be such schools when boys are at the stage of being committed perhaps for the first offence, perhaps only for the first offence which has been detected, perhaps the last of a series of offences. Nevertheless, the boy up to 16 years of age is capable of being reclaimed from criminal habits and prevented from degeneration of that kind, speaking generally.  Of course, there are always exceptions but I think that we have to realise the possibility that these boys <Col N="1266" /> would become, if they were not saved from their surroundings for a period of years, a much greater charge upon the State, both directly and indirectly. If there were no such schools, there would have to be other institutions provided. I understand there is quite a near possibility that one or both of these schools may have to close down because of the absence of funds.  The schools are capable of providing for 200 boys each or slightly more.  In recent years, it appears, owing to a variety of causes, magistrates have been slow to commit boys, and, as a consequence, the schools are in receipt of a much lower capitation grant and the amount of voluntary subscriptions is not of course increasing. It would be very pleasing if we could be satisfied with the fact that only 75 boys should be at present in St. Kevin's Training School&mdash;that is Glencree Reformatory&mdash;whereas there used be 250; and that at St. Conlath's School there are only 27.  If we could feel sure that these figures represented a great change in the character of boys during the last three or four years&mdash;that boys are not giving the same trouble to the police authorities to-day as they were at any time during five or ten years ago&mdash;it would be a source of great pleasure to us.  I am afraid that that is not a correct deduction to draw, and that the explanation does not lie in the fact that the character of the boys is so very much superior to that of their predecessors.  There may be reasons in the mind of the magistrates against committals to the school.  I understand that some of the magistrates prefer short periods of detention in detention places, and I have no doubt that in many cases a short period of detention may be quite satisfactory and sufficient. But I certainly would say, unless there is definite evidence to the contrary, that the schools which we are dealing with are beneficial in the training of the boys.  Their removal from an environment perhaps leading to criminal or semi-criminal practices is most desirable.</P>
    <P>The position at present, as I understand it, and according to this Vote, is that there is a statutory obligation to pay 6/- per week, per boy, and a temporary additional grant is being made <Col N="1267" /> of 2s. per week.  In addition to that there are payments made by the city or county from which the boys are sent.  Taking all together, the allowances for the care, maintenance and training of the boys in these schools is 13/- per week; in some cases it is 14/- per week.  That might be a satisfactory amount to enable these schools to be kept going if the normal number of boys were sent there.  But in view of the policy of the magistrates and the shortage of inmates&mdash;or shall I call them boys in training&mdash;the schools are without sufficient monetary assistance. I think it would be very wise to consider this matter in the light of the schools.  Perhaps owing to the fact that the responsible Ministry now and henceforth will be the Ministry of Education, there is some justification for hoping that the method of treating the schools will be rather different in the future.  If the boys were sent to prison, they would cost a certain number of shillings per week to the State. If the boys were to remain at school they would cost a certain number of other shillings per week to the State. I think that if this question of the financing of the schools were considered in the light of the cost of education, as well as the cost of maintenance of the offenders, it would be seen that there is a call upon the State for a considerable increase in the grant.  I think with that view of the State's relation to the schools, there would probably have to be some other conditions, and I do not know for certain to what extent my views on this matter would commend themselves to the authorities in charge of the schools.  I have some reason to believe that they would not be unacceptable.  I think that it might be a condition that the school hours should be made to conform more closely to the ordinary school hours in the National Schools, especially in the National Schools as we hope to see them when the leaving age will be much higher than it has been. I think, with regard to the boys above that compulsory attendance age, that the hours spent in technical training could be modified and made to conform to the requirements of the Department <Col N="1268" /> of Education.  I would urge upon the Minister the desirability of entering into an arrangement with the authorities in charge of these schools to conform as fully as is possible in the circumstances to this higher educational test.  I do so because many of these boys have not had the ordinary primary education that they would have had, had they been in other surroundings; they had not that primary education with the technical or semi-technical education that we would like boys of sixteen and seventeen years of age to receive.  I think if the position of these schools were treated from the educational, primary and technical side, as well as from the point of view of segregation for a year or two in the most delightful surroundings that we would have a different tale to tell in a few years' time.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say anything more at present, at any rate, in regard to the reformatory or training schools, but with respect to the industrial schools it has been brought to my notice that there is a considerable lack of care in the selection of the teachers who are training the boys, and in the actual quality of the training that is given.  I do not know whether there is any real foundation for that or not.  Again, I want to urge that the educational side of the school should be made to conform with the educational requirements both from the primary side and the technical side in so far as the boys are retained in school long enough to enter into any technical training whatever. I am inclined to think that the industrial school idea will have to be altered to a very great extent.  Boys are not sent to the industrial schools after they are 12 years of age.  They remain there for a few years.  Again, many of these boys have not had the normal amount of primary education and I think it would be worth while to impress on the authorities in charge of the schools the necessity&mdash;not merely to impress upon them but to make it a condition to a greater extent than hitherto&mdash;that primary training should be made to conform to the higher requirements of the educational <Col N="1269" /> department and that we should not require or allow too large a portion of the time of the boys at that age to be spent in what is called industrial trades.  My observation in one school did not give at all the same impression or pleasure that I had in my visit to Glencree.  The boys were much younger, and seemed to be doing a good deal of comparatively heavy work, and I am very doubtful whether they were receiving the proper amount of education required by such children. I would urge that some attention should be paid to that side of the industrial school.  My chief suggestion with regard to the industrial schools is that I urge they should be treated more as schools and less as a place of training for industry.  I think the younger boys ought not to be set apart learning trades which they will probably never adopt, and which they will not learn satisfactorily at that age. There should not be specialised training for these boys until they come to the age of fourteen, and upwards. However, there are other Deputies who know more about industrial schools than I do, and I am sure others know more about reformatory schools.  I am quite pleased to urge the desirability of considering the financial position of the reformatory schools.  I do not know whether the Minister for Justice will suggest that some of us would be better off had we gone to such a reformatory school as this.  I do not mind confessing that I think I would be a better man to-day if I had the chance of a few years experience at Glencree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said that from statistics you can prove anything, and Deputy Johnson has laid his finger on a very striking example that would favour that view.  I recollect that some years ago great credit was taken in England with regard to the reduction of intemperance, as proved by the decline in the number of arrests for drunkenness, which obviously was explicable by a decline in the activity of the police forces. Anyone who studies the statistics with regard to the leading reformatory schools, which Deputy Johnson has <Col N="1270" /> rightly praised so highly, would imagine that we had become ever so much better socially with regard to juvenile offences since the year 1904, or the year 1909.  Then the number of inmates in what was known as the Glencree Reformatory was, I think, 264. Last year the number was only 66, and the return for the current year is 78, so that one who was hasty would rejoice in his heart that we have made such marvellous advance, that notwithstanding all irregularities of the last few years, and the decay and debasement of public morality among the adults, that at any rate the children had got off scot-free and escaped infection. The fact, however, is that, as in the parallel, the case I just mentioned in respect of drunkenness in England, it is not because there is less reason or ground for filling the school at Glencree, but because for a variety of reasons, some of which Deputy Johnson just now enumeratel, though the proper inmates exist and ought to be forthcoming, they are not forthcoming.  One of the District Justices told me some time ago that the situation in this district filled him with alarm.  To begin with, to get a boy into one of these institutions which would do him so much benefit, it is necessary to have him committed as a juvenile offender.  The result is that very often for the reclamation of a boy who has careless or even criminal parents, it is necessary to procure his commitment artificially, so that he really is not an offender in the strict meaning of the word, but he is technically an offender for the purpose of his reclamation.  Just as in the case of boys who are notoriously engaged in pilfering orchards, there were soft-hearted magistrates and soft-hearted police, and the boys were allowed to go off with a reprimand.  The difficulty is to get children taken away from their evil surroundings at the proper time, and to submit them to this excellent training.  If they are allowed to remain as they are they grow hardened in vice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people give as an excuse, as in the case of my friend the District Justice, that they do not like to see those boys marked with the stigma which <Col N="1271" /> would follow them all through their lives of being reformatory boys.  That is the idea derived from Dickens, where Oliver Twist is always open to the slur that he was a workhouse boy. In the case of what used to be called Glencree Reformatory a very admirable step, namely, the alteration of the name, was taken, which contributes to remove that stigma which was undeserved.  It is no longer Glencree Reformatory but St. Kevin's Training School.  That is, so far, to the good, but I have had occasion to remark that an excellent sermon is often delivered to those people who do not need it.  The people who would benefit most by the sermon on Sunday are those who are not there, and those who would benefit most by St. Kevin's Training College are not there.  We shall have to reform our own system or something else will have to be set on foot.  Now, there are two things in this regard.  First of all, as Deputy Johnson remarked, the fact that this Vote is taken in connection with the Ministry of Education marks a very long step in advance, so far as regards the Government's position towards those schools because it recognises them not as mere houses of correction and detention but as homes or educational institutions in which the evil tendencies that boys have already exhibited will be eradicated.  They will be put in the way of becoming, as nearly all of them do become eventually, decent citizens.</P>
    <P>I do not quite agree with the psychology of education laid down by Deputy Johnson.  It is the only thing in his remarks which I do not endorse most heartily.  Those in charge of St. Kevin's Training School belong to an Order from which I draw a great many of my students.  Therefore I am in a position to know the type of man they have and the spirit which inspires them.  Amongst their studies is included the psychology of education.  It seems to me the course for each day that they provide for their pupils is directed largely to character and in the first stage, as I have just put it, to the eradication of evil tendencies.  Therefore a large part of the day's curriculum is manual labour.  This is a rather interesting programme.  They call it a <Col N="1272" /> prospectus, a statement of St. Kevin's Training School issued in the present year.  On working days the pupils rise at seven.  After a bath, morning prayers, and Mass, they have breakfast at eight o'clock.  Then, at eight-thirty, they have physical drill.  At nine o'clock there is work in shops, garden, farm and tending stock.  They have from three to four hours of that.  At ten minutes past one they have parade and recreation.  There is a long interval in the middle of the day for recovery and recuperation.  At two o'clock there is recreation.  At two-thirty work, as at nine a.m.; at four-thirty, singing lessons; at five o'clock, school; at six o'clock, supper; at six-thirty, recreation; at seven, school; at eight they have Irish classes; and at nine, bed.</P>
    <P>The first part of the day is really technical, and then in the later hours, between recreation and lighter studies, you have the school work, the primary education work.  It is really, if I may quote Tennyson in this connection, &ldquo;Working out the beast.&rdquo;  Physical labour during the long hours in the earlier portion of the day is directed towards correction in the better sense. The types that are operated upon so benevolently and skilfully in those schools are of various sorts.  They have of course what would be called in jargon &ldquo;degenerates.&rdquo;  You have children of degenerate parents and also of reckless and careless parents, children who have been brought up, as Deputy Johnson put it, in an unwholesome atmosphere and who have not had an opportunity to develop the sense of right or wrong.  Then others are really put there not because they are bad, but for fear they might be made so, and because they will receive this particular type of training which is so useful.</P>
    <P>All that costs money.  It is the unfortunate chorus to so many of those chansons that there is more money required. It is a pity in regard to reformatory schools that this year's estimate shows a reduction on last year's, because, as has been pointed out to the House just now, the amount received on the head of each of those inmates is only 13/-.  That is made up of the Government <Col N="1273" /> grant of 8/- and the local authorities' contribution.  I am informed that for a corresponding school certified of the same class in England &mdash;there is one in Yorkshire&mdash;the allowance is at the rate of 30/- per boy per week.  In that part of Ireland which still is under British rule the contribution is 26/- per week.  It is a pity that institutions such as those and its sister institutions controlled by the same order of educationists should be threatened with closing up through need of funds.  There has been a steady drain upon the resources of the Order. That obviously cannot continue.  The alternative is either to let these boys grow up in vice and swell the criminal classes or force the Minister for Justice to recruit a larger number of the Gárda Síochána, have more expenditure upon prisons and upon the convict system, buy an island somewhere and export them to it as to a penal settlement, or else make up our minds to come to the relief of these institutions.  I realised long ago that, when we came to debate educational reforms and social reforms, the public would be likely to be astounded at the estimate of cost.  That is what the public are invited to do to-day, to count the cost. They cannot have it both ways.  They cannot have the type of boys of which I have spoken left unreclaimed and get away with it, with the State ultimately losing&mdash;losing not merely in what we can calculate in terms of money, but in what cannot be calculated in terms of money.</P>

Taking the cost of the office, it works out at about twenty per cent. I would suggest that some saving might be made in that cost and that a lesser percentage on collection could be obtained.</P>

      <P>I am interested in this question from another point of view, to see that the industrial schools are assisted to carry on efficiently, and that they will have suitable buildings, so as to be in a position to give the necessary training to the children sent to them.  I consider, though the amount for industrial schools has been increased, it is inadequate.  Those who know children that were sent to industrial schools appreciate the value of these schools and the necessity there is for them.  Children of careless parents or children whose parents are dead, if not sent to these schools would later drift into the class that become habitual criminals.  That class of children lack care and moral training and get no opportunities of learning a trade unless they are sent to such schools.  I think it is the duty of the Dáil to see that the children of negligent parents are brought up so that they will be a benefit and not an injury to the State. It is well known that neglected children, who are not sent to industrial schools have the worst records so far as ordinary school attendance is concerned. The people who devote their lives to the training of these children perform a great work for the State. Anything that would make the people of this country realise the value of these institutions should be made known, as the children they deal with would otherwise grow up with criminal instincts and would certainly never go through the world without getting into trouble.  I think it is the duty of the Dáil to see that these institutions are enabled to carry on their work efficiently.  When this Vote come on again, I hope that the Deputies will press the Government further to assist these institutions.</P>

      <P>It gave me great pleasure to hear what Deputy Johnson stated about his visit to Glencree because a personal opinion like that is of more value than a dozen books of <Col N="1275" /> statistics.  It is pleasant to hear that the boys there are happy and that they get a chance of making their way in life and of being a credit to the country.  I hope that Deputy Magennis's fear that the worst boys were not got hold of is not correct.  I hope and believe that the youth of the country is improving and that greater care is given to education than was given to it twenty or thirty years ago. There is an improvement in the children, in their disposition and general bearing.  Personally I take a very great interest in this matter because during the time that it was my lot&mdash; whether good or not&mdash;to sit upon the Bench as a magistrate, I had occasionally to deal with cases that came up, where the children were sent to these schools.  I followed with interest the careers of several of those boys and I am glad to say that in the few cases I dealt with, they were most successful.  They turned out a credit to the schools and to the country. From the curriculum that Deputy Magennis read out, I think the time of the boys seems to be very fully occupied.</P>
      <P>Not a moment seems to be lost, and as far as I can discover there appears to be no allusion to holidays.  I hope that they are not kept at the grind all the time from year's end to year's end, but that there is some kind of a break in their work.  It is necessary for everyone to get a rest from work, no matter how important it may be.  There should be, I think, a break for a holiday at certain periods of the year.  I am sure the country will not grudge the money that is spent on these industrial schools when they see the good results that are achieved in them.  Boys who might otherwise grow up irreclaimable and worthless, are, as a result of the years they spend in them, turned out useful citizens and become a credit and a support to the nation in their after lives.  I think money could not be spent in any better way than on the upkeep of these institutions, and I am sure if more money is required for them, it will not be grudged, especially when the good results derived from it are realised.</P>

      <P>This is a rather important Vote, although the amount involved is not a very large sum.  Looking at it one is immediately struck by the satisfactory relationship that exists as between the expenses and the amount that goes to the maintenance of the youthful offenders in reformatories and industrial schools.  The amount for maintenance is put down at £97,000, and for salaries, £3,624.  That is a nice proportion compared with some of the proportions that we have had in connection with the estimates for other Departments.</P>

      <P>I cannot profess to have a great knowledge of these institutions, but as regards the boys who are sent to them, it would be interesting to know what proportion of them is permanently benefited by being sent there, and what proportion is found to be incorrigible.

      <P>That is so.  The proportion of the boys who, after leaving the reformatory schools, find their way into wrong paths again, may be so small that you hear more about them than you do of the good results obtained as a result of the training given in these institutions.  These institutions take in and deal with boys who have done something which merited their being dealt with by the law, or perhaps they were taken up under the Vagrancy Act and sent to these schools. One would need to be more conversant with the whole system to say whether there is any better method that could be devised for dealing with boys of this class.  I am sure that every Deputy in the House realises the enormous importance of the work of dealing with these young boys who have lapsed for <Col N="1277" /> some cause or another.  It is while they are young that they must be dealt with.  That is necessary in the interests of the boy himself and of the country as a whole.  On the face of the Vote, the amount of money spent on these institutions is not excessive, and I am sure no one will criticise it on that score.  The only question is whether the system is on such good lines that no criticism could be brought forward to evolve a better method for dealing with boys of that class.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the programme of study read out by Deputy Professor Magennis.  It must have struck every Deputy as being an excellent programme.  The boys appear to be well looked after and their studies to be well provided for.  I am sure, too, they are well fed.  Then we have had the account of Deputy Johnson's visit.  That should satisfy the mind of any Deputy that the boys are well looked after.  A question that arises is: what are the fruits of the whole system?  We have been told of the visits to these schools of elderly men who were once pupils in them. They returned to visit the schools after spending their life-time in the world. I think no school could get a better testimonial than that.  The attendance at these schools has fallen in 20 years from 260 to about 76.  I contend that the morality of this nation has fallen considerably during those years.  You cannot justify it in any way that you look at it from our own knowledge of the facts.  It cannot reasonably be held, I think, that the morality of our boys went up by 400 per cent. while the morality of the general bulk of the people fell to some extent at any rate. What strikes me about it is this, that there is a grave dereliction on the part of magistrates in this matter.  At present you have 76 boys there taken from the Saorstát.  Surely we cannot say that that is the sum total of young offenders&mdash;I do not like to call them criminals&mdash;in the Saorstát.  I knew boys myself who, when they were small, committed crimes, if you could call them crimes, and who afterwards grew up to be estimable members of society and to hold high positions, simply because <Col N="1278" /> they were looked after in their youth.  I know that the number of boys that should be in Glencree, and in other schools, should not be 76, but should be 700.  It would be better to have them there for the reason that they would be taken away from their present surroundings, where they have little but bad example before them. Their parents, perhaps, may be people who are sent to jail occasionally, or it may be that their parents are drunkards, as unfortunately too often is the case.  It is unfortunate that magistrates should take the view that so many of them do take in dealing with boys of this class.  If you had 700 pupils in those schools you would not be faced with the financial position that you are in to-day.  That financial position has largely been brought about by the unfortunate attitude of mind of both parents and magistrates to these schools, which are really very estimable schools.</P>

I do not think he really intended to express views whose meaning to me seemed to be that the magistrates had been neglecting their duty and showing mercy to some boys brought before them.  I hope the magistrates will not take these views as representing the view of the Dáil that they should be more strict in dealing with the boys and sending them to those reformatories and training schools.  A great many Deputies, of whom I am one, have had on many occasions mothers, and parents generally, of boys calling upon them, broken-hearted mothers and fathers calling and complaining about their children having been taken away from them and sent to reformatory schools and industrial schools for periods of five and six years at a time, and asking to have a memorial got up and presented to the Minister for Justice.  Within the past twelve months many members of this House were made aware of an incident that occurred as a result of the South Dublin by-election, in which a number of little boys engaged in celebrating <Col N="1279" /> the victory of one of the candidates at the time lit a fire, as a result of which a paper stores was broken into in order to make the fire larger in celebration of the victory.  One of the little boys was arrested next day.</P>

      <P>I am not going to state the age of the boy, but he was a little nipper, apparently not more than ten years old.  He was dressed by his mother in the green cloth of a National Army soldier as his father was serving in the Army at the time.  However, after the mother had practically broken her heart for three or four months waiting on Deputies asking them to sign a memorial, the Minister for Justive very graciously and very justly allowed the boy to be released.  I want to know whether if these schools are failing&mdash;and I know the good work done in Glencree Reformatory and the Artane School&mdash;it is because these schools have not sufficient attendance that they do not get more grants from the Government, and I want to know whether the last speaker is serious in his statement that in order to secure whatever grants may be made by the Government he wants more young boys committed to reformatories.  That is the gist of his speech.  I hope magistrates dealing with these boys will not think he is expressing the views of Deputies in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The late Recorder, now Mr. Justice O'Shaughnessy, at all times when boys <Col N="1280" /> came before him adopted the policy that where guarantors or some reliable person could be got to look after those boys he allowed them out sooner than send them to reformatories.  I think the Recorder was quite right in his actions, because some of the boys he allowed out and thus escaped the reformatory brand, turned out exceptionall well.  I would like to see the Government maintaining these schools and giving a decent grant to keep them ready for boys that it is considered necessary by magistrates to send to them for training, but I sincerely hope, and I will watch with interest this time twelvemonths to see the commitments to industrial schools and reformatories, that the numbers will not be increased and that the magistrates will not take the advice given by the Deputy who has just spoken.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The child was mentioned as eight years old, and directly I informed the Deputy that at that age a child would not be taken into the school, he raised the age to ten years.  The Deputy does not know what he is talking about.  These institutions are necessary.  They are as necessary as the punishment code in our Army Acts and the criminal code in this country for which the Deputy votes money and votes to tax the people in order to get that money. The Deputy need not go and tell the people of his constituency that he is the only soft-hearted man in this assembly and the only man whose heart is bleeding for the suffering people. Everyone of us has feelings as well as the Deputy and we realise that it is our duty and responsibility to those young boys in their own interests, and in the interests of the future of the <Col N="1282" /> country, to have them corrected when they go wrong.  It is our duty, too, to let magistrates know if through some sloppy soft-heartedness, such as the Deputy has given expression to, they are not doing their duty&mdash;if they do not remember that these institutions are there to correct young boys.  The Deputy has gone as many citizens have gone on many occasions to admire at public functions the performances given by a number of those boys.  I am not going to mention those particular functions, but if it were not Glencree Reformatory, whose school caused the Deputy such suffering, he would not be able to enjoy himself as much as he did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular school is a credit to the State&mdash;absolutely a credit to the State.  The Deputy need not frighten the magistrates regarding their duty. If the magistrates would go up there and see the schools they would get rid of this ridiculous prejudice that there is against this particular institution.  If the Deputy would go up there, he could go to those broken-hearted mothers that he talks about, and tell them that their sons are being well-cared for there.  I am satisfied in my own mind that, owing to persons in authority not sending children there, the last few years have been costly for this State and for this city.  I am perfectly satisfied as to that.  If the Deputy thinks I am afraid to tell the citizens of Dublin that, I say to him that I am prepared to go out and tell them any time he likes.  I do not mind telling them the truth at any time, even though some of them may not like to hear it.  I think it would be very bad for the public life of this country if we were not prepared to tell the people the truth.  Institutions such as this must be kept up.  We must have prisons.  We must have places of correction for youth.  We must be prepared to answer such questions as were put by Deputy Hewat when he said that he had heard that some of the pupils of institutions like this were not a success in life.  Owing to prejudice against institutions of this class, the question is put: &ldquo;Where did this particular non-success come from?&rdquo; and the answer is: &ldquo;Oh!  from a reformatory!&rdquo;<Col N="1283" /> If the non-success came from Trinity College, these people would say: &ldquo;Oh, the poor fellow!&rdquo; If the non-success came from the National University, they would say: &ldquo;What a pity; he had a good father and a good mother.&rdquo;  But in the case of the reformatory: &ldquo;Oh, we knew that; it was bound to come.  What could you expect.&rdquo;  One does not explore the history of those who have been real successes and who came from this particular place.  But if the Deputy, or any of the soft-hearted mothers that are knocking about, have any fears on the question, I will bring them to a place where they will see a number of those boys who are a credit, not alone to this institution, but to the State.</P>

      <P>May I add a few words in supplement to what I said?  I have been making a little examination of another account, and I think that if one would take into account the cost of maintaining a patient in Dundrum Asylum&mdash;£29 a year&mdash;and add to that the cost of teaching, one would find a sufficient difference between what is at present paid and what would be involved to save the institution from the necessity, as I suggest, for closing.  I thought I might have been able to finish the calculation before the debate closed, but I just draw attention to <Col N="1284" /> these two points now.  There is the cost of maintenance of a patient in Dundrum Asylum&mdash;food and clothing&mdash; and the cost of teaching 138 boys.  One can bear in mind that Deputy Hewat's comparison is not quite right, because of the fact that there are no charges in this Vote for the superintendence or care of the institution.  The grant that is paid is towards the cost of rationing and clothing the boys.  Is there any chance that the Minister is going to respond with any promise of an additional sum to that which is at present given as capitation grant?</P>

The programme on which the Forestry Branch of the Department of Agriculture is working is to reach a wooded area of 200,000 acres&mdash;that is to say, land either planted by the Department of Agriculture or actually wooded when they take it over. They hope to reach that area by the planting of about 2,500 acres per <Col N="1285" /> annum.  Up to date, there has been acquired about 29,561 acres.  They have planted about 9,957 acres, so that we have the nucleus of a State forest. We are in the position at the moment that we can get land rather easily, because the Forestry Department and the Land Commission are working in co-operation.  When land is acquired by the Land Commission which is not usable for any other purpose&mdash;it may be scheduled in the returns as mountain or bog&mdash;it can be dealt with by the Forestry Branch, because you do not require really good land for forestry. The Forestry Department being in touch with the Land Commission can acquire land pretty easily and pretty reasonably.  The main item in this Forestry Estimate is £24,000 for forestry operations, as against £21,000 last year. That contains a charge of a possible £6,000 for the acquisition of lands in the coming year.  In that sub-head also is included a sum of about £10,000 for maintenance charges on existing forests, also £3,000 cultural charges in connection with existing plantations, and £4,200 for actual planting and nursery work.</P>
      <P>As I have said, the normal programme would be about 2,200 acres a year.  This Vote was eked out to a certain extent last year by a grant from the Relief Grant.  Deputies will have to remember these two things about forestry, that forestry operations do not mature for a comparatively long time; they will not even begin to mature for ten or fifteen years, and substantial results are not shown until about thirty years.  Deputies also should remember this, that forestry, or operations in connection with forestry, are not particularly fruitful from the point of view of giving employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of employment given in this connection for any definite sum of money, is much smaller than the amount of employment that could be given for the expenditure of the same sum of money on practically any other operation.  Some people hold the point of view that forestry operations are an ideal way of giving employment.  Well, they are not; they are rather a costly way, because you give very little employment <Col N="1286" /> for a very big expenditure, and because the results of the employment you do give do not mature for a number of years.  I think that that is the only item in the Vote that requires explanation.  Advances for forestry operations are advances to county councils who have small nurseries of their own for trees, and for advice and assistance.  Forestry education is in connection with the training of apprentices who will become foresters afterwards, and the £50 for agency and advisory services is to cover certain incidental expenses in connection with people who wish to plant this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if we are taking a sufficiently important view of this branch of Governmental activity. It seems to me that this subject is treated as being a very insignificant portion of the economy of the country. As a result of the devastation from which the country has suffered, partly through the sale of land, and partly through the war and the high price that timber was fetching during the war, the country to-day is very poor as regards timber.  I do not think that there is a real inclination on the part of people who have cut down trees to re-plant, though some estates do so systematically. I never do, and never will, in this House advocate Government interference in things that might properly be carried on by the people themselves, but the Government have shown no hesitation heretofore in telling various sections of the people that they must do their duty by the country, and that if not the Government will come in and do it themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This seems to me to be a branch in which&mdash;under the circumstances that have operated for the last ten years, and under the present state of affairs, when the world's supply of timber is getting very much depleted, and the demand for it makes it necessary to go further and further afield to secure the ordinary timber that is required in these countries&mdash;the Government ought to insist, as is done in some other countries, that a reasonable area should be planted, and that the deficiency in the forests of the country ought to be made good at an early date.  We have heard a good deal here of making Ireland <Col N="1287" /> self-supporting, shutting out everything foreign and making or growing everything we can ourselves.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy Wilson cannot accuse me of being inconsistent in that respect.  From that point of view, and estimating the amount of timber that we bring from the ends of the earth to build our houses, and estimating the amount of timber that could easily and naturally be grown, much more easily grown than beet or tobacco, and much more naturally in some ways owing to the geography and topography of the country, a policy might reasonably be instituted whereby it would be put up to the people that they should replant, or if not, that the Government should insist that a reasonable area of the country should be devoted to the growth of timber to replace the timber that has been used at home or that has been sold.  In suggesting that I have no hesitation in putting forward an argument which does not emanate from me, but which I endorse in this case most heartily, that if you can grow all the timber you want, then grow it.</P>

The Minister says that the programme is 2,200 acres a year, and his object is to have a State forest of 200,000 acres.  It would take him a hundred years to get anything in the nature of such a forest, and the total sum of all his efforts up to the present, and of those who preceded him, is a State forest of 19,000 acres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>This year you had £2,000 unexpended.  But I contend that the added areas&mdash;I am not speaking now in the intoxicating sense&mdash; necessitates the employment of extra custodians for those forests, fresh fencing, and so on, and as you increase your area by 2,200 acres per annum, you automatically raise the dead weight of supervision, and you reduce the money you have available for development. I put that seriously, because that is really a fact, and it is the reason why, if it were at all possible inside the limits of our expenditure to increase this Vote, I say that this is a Vote under which the money would be very well spent, and we would get in ten or twelve years some of the benefits of the planting that has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was some talk of a Forestry Bill being brought in last year.  I have been wondering whether it is one of the slaughtered innocents, whether it will ever come to life, whether it is moribund, or suffering from that terrible disease in this country called contagious abortion.  The cutting-down of trees without permission and without replanting should be made an offence, and, therefore, this Bill ought to be introduced at as early a date as possible in the interests of the State. I hope the Minister will agree to increase this estimate at least to £60,000. It is now that the money would be useful. <Col N="1289" /> There is no use giving it in the fall.  If the money could be spared, it would be well spent and would produce benefits which expenditure in other directions does not produce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to see that it is proposed to have an increase in this grant.  I am a great believer in tree-planting.  It must be evident to anybody who knows anything about this matter that since the year 1885, the country is becoming more and more denuded of trees.  Since the Land Acts began to work, unfortunately, the owners, instead of planting trees, have been cutting them down to a very great extent.  That is generally true over the whole country and I hope it will not go on.  There is great room for tree-planting over vast areas of the country on ground that would not be useful for any other purpose. County Kildare has been foremost always in the matter of forestry. Since about 1900 the Kildare County Council, of which I was then a member, has been buying woods continuously and planting them, or getting a present of them sometimes, and the Council has now extensive woods in different parts of the county.  By now they must be beginning to be profitable, because after about twelve years, through the thinning of woods, there ought to be a certain amount of return.  The result is becoming evident in parts of Kildare.  Kildare is not a beautiful county.  It has not the advantages of Wicklow, with its mountains and so on, but the woods in Kildare have been taken care of to a great extent by their owners.  The much-abused ancestors have at least done that much good.  They were great tree-planters in years gone by, and, in a good many cases, the result has been of great benefit to the county and to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago there was a great shortage of timber throughout the world.  Great fires in Canada destroyed millions of acres of woods, and had we been ready to meet the demand without denuding the country of trees, we should have made a large amount of money.  As it was, there was a great deal of timber sold here, <Col N="1290" /> but generally it was timber that should not have been taken away and was not replaced.  I hope that some of the money that the Land Commission is providing for improving estates can be used for replacing shelter belts that have been cut down on lands taken over.  Apart from the shelter that they afford, trees have a great effect on the drainage of lands.  Where a county is well wooded, as a rule, flooding is not so prevalent.  That has been proved in France where, owing to the denuding of the forests, they have been troubled very much by the flooding of the Seine, and that has been put down to the want of timber in the upper reaches of the river.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal in having good timber throughout the country both from the point of view of beauty and of profit.  Tree planting would give a great deal of employment.  It would be profitable, not like making roads, which is like pouring water through a sieve, as there is no return for the money.  There is a profit from the timber at the end of a certain time, with very little expense in the meantime, except possibly for a caretaker and the careful thinning that is required. Sir Walter Scott made a very true remark about timber.  He said that while men sleep, trees grow.  There is a good deal in that.  If it were only from the point of view of the useful employment it would give, I think the money would be well spent in planting the country.  The country will be beautified, particularly by planting the lower parts of some of the hills.  I am glad to see the increase in the grant this year, and I hope that there will be a further increase next year, and that we shall see the result of it in the extra employment given and the increased beauty of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the advocacy of all those Deputies who have urged a slight increase in this Vote. Particularly, I welcome the disinterested advocacy of Deputy Hewat, because only a business man can know what an unprofitable business it is to plant trees.  Coal brings in a dividend in the year.  It is quarried and sold and paid for within a year.  A bullock <Col N="1291" /> brings in its dividend within two years or two years and a half; but if you plant larch it takes thirty years for the trees to come to maturity, and if you plant any trees that grow less quickly, naturally they will take very much longer.  It is not at the present moment a business proposition to plant trees.  That is possibly why the Government is taking it on.  Deputy Wolfe has invoked the Lay of the Last Minstrel, and he has told us that while men sleep, trees grow.  While men sleep, trees grow very slowly.  A man might sleep his lifetime out and he would see a tree grow to no more than a puny height, certainly not to a marketable height.</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly both men and trees in Kildare grow to an enormous height, but these natural advantages are not enjoyed by other districts.  I do not think, as a matter of fact, setting the joke aside, that Deputy Wolfe would argue that investing money in trees is like investing money in gilt edged securities. You do not get your dividend quite as punctually or as quickly through money invested in forestry as through money invested in normal industrial or banking securities.  Obviously you do not. That is why it is necessary for the Government to come in and slightly increase the grant that they gave for forestry operations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot; but the banking security will enable you to transfer yourself to a country where there are very shady trees and very pleasant conditions in existence.  When I hear talk about the abnormal cutting of trees and timber, I am forced to say <Col N="1292" /> that there was such cutting during the war.  There was a lot of timber required for trenches, and young ash was needed for aeroplanes.  But I do not think there is any market for timber now.  If you have a particular type of timber, such as sycamores, from which they could make rollers for use in cotton mills, or something like that, there would be a sale for it; but for the most part it is not easy to sell timber at the moment.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Wilson says that no person should be allowed to sell timber without replanting, I agree with that so far as it refers to the people who never planted any timber and who merely acquired timber through purchasing it. Where timber has been grown as a commercial proposition, where every year you cut a certain number of trees and plant a certain area, you should not there make your conditions so rigid.  As a matter of fact, the market is in a bad condition now, and you cannot sink any enormous amount in replanting.  If you are fortunate enough to sell you do not get a price that would be sufficient to pay you, and that would encourage you to replant.  I do not think Deputy Wilson or anybody else so contends.  I should like to see in this Estimate, not merely the slight increase indicated for State forestry operations, but something greater in the direction of advances for afforestation purposes. I would sooner see this thing done by the individual, and not by the State.  I desire to call attention particularly to the ludicrously low Vote for forestry education.  Forestry is a science just as much as any other science.  It can probably be best studied in India, where they have enormous State forests.  It could be studied also in France and Germany.</P>

      <P>Anyway, if there is further provision in the Education Vote, I am extremely glad.  I do not know that we can learn all that is to be learned about forestry within the limits of this country.  An arrangement with the French Government, by which we could send a number of specially qualified students of forestry to France, would be of great advantage. In that country they regard forestry as a business proposition.  They have to cut down and re-plant a certain area regularly, and as far as I know, that has never been done here.  The Department has had this forestry school for many years, but I have never found anybody who could say: &ldquo;I studied at the Avondale School.&rdquo;  I have never found anybody to put that forward as a qualification.  It ought to be the normal process for anybody anxious to develop forestry to be able to obtain a man with this qualification.  At present, however, that does not seem to appeal.  Perhaps there may be people who have land of their own and who wish to learn and develop forestry.  If there are, it is a good thing.  At any rate, the school does not seem to have spread its influence sufficiently.</P>
      <P>While £100 is really a farcical amount, I am glad that provision is made under other sub-heads.  I would urge upon the Minister to see that a real knowledge of this very important subject, a subject which may influence our weather and our climate to a very great degree, is spread among the new owners of land and among the people who are now in a position either to plant or to sell.  If they only learn that felling is not entirely profit and that planting is not entirely loss, we shall have gone a great way towards improving the climate and the health of our country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper began by informing the Dáil that forestry could not be conducted on a commercial footing, and he wound up, or <Col N="1294" /> said ultimately, that in France forestry is conducted in a commercial manner, and evidently suggested that we ought to follow the methods adopted in France.  Those are the methods I intend to advocate.  England has to send her forestry students, the students that they send out to India to take care of the enormous forests there, to France or Germany.  They have to pay for that, and they have to give the students an allowance to pay their way. I regret this question of forestry is not approached in a more business-like manner by this Government of ours. It is not approached as it is in France. Up to the present we have been only tinkering with it, and it is time for that tinkering to end.  Large areas of this country, so-called mountain lands, have been cleared by the C.D. Board from time to time, and have been split up into small holdings which have been given to tenants.  It takes large areas of those lands to support a dozen sheep or a half a dozen cattle and with a great deal of difficulty the land may be made grow potatoes and cabbage.  I do not see why 20,000 or 30,000 acres should not be taken and placed under a regular Forestry Department.  The Minister for Finance, of course, may object to the expenditure, but you can get the money without putting up the Estimates in any way.  You are giving to the farmers this year £600,000 as an agricultural grant.  This money, I suggest, could be put to the credit of the Forestry Department, and the whole scheme could be carried out in a regular form.  The farmers have kept the country in turmoil now for about fortyfive years.</P>

      <P>I will not deal with the suggestions made by Deputy McBride. I hope I am not disappointing the other Deputies in that.  In dealing with this question, I want to know what is the mind of the Land Commission about it. The policy in this country for a long time has been to plant a certain class of timber of the earliest maturing varieties, but not the most desirable or the most valuable varieties.  What we have been producing mostly is pit-wood. Deputy Hewat referred to the necessity of providing suitable materials for building.  We are not growing the class of timber here that will make suitable building timber.  Neither larch nor deal grown here is suitable.  A considerable amount of money is going out of the country annually for building timber, and we have made very little effort to produce that class of timber, if the country can produce it.  I think we ought to get away from this, more or less, bad timber, and get on with the growing of building timber. It is possible that the other countries which grow timber will arrive at a position in which they cannot supply building timber, and their supplies may fall off, so that we cannot rely on them.  I gathered from the Minister's opening statement that this side of the Department's activities give very little employment for the money spent.  I take it that the expenditure will come under a different heading from employment, or am I right in saying that it would be for procuring young plants?</P>

      <P>Very good.  I understand that grants were made to the county councils to try and get on with the nursery business.  I do not know what the results are or whether they have proved satisfactory.  I would stress the point of getting a better class <Col N="1297" /> of timber which will be more useful than the timber we have.  Some Deputy said that nobody should be allowed to cut down timber.  Anyone with any sense knows that when timber has reached a certain stage of usefulness and a certain stage of ornamentation it would be good policy to cut it down, for it becomes useless as well as unsightly after that.  Even oak must at one time come down.  We have also too much hedge timber in the country.  I would impress on the Government the advisability of planting a more valuable kind of timber which will be useful for building and which may be necessary in the future.</P>

      <P>Last year on this Vote I expressed the hope that more would be done by the Government in this direction in the future.  The other day, on another Estimate, I made the point which Deputy Cooper has made, and I would like further information as to what would be the benefit to the climate if a considerable portion of the country had forestry operations carried out upon it.  There is a strong concensus of opinion that the climate could be altered to some extent beneficially by operations like those.  If it is possible that that could be achieved through spending money under this head it should not be lost sight of as it is a national necessity at present. I think also that it is not right that this Vote should be regarded from the point of view of the amount of employment to be given.  I think it would be entirely inaccurate to be guided by that point of view.  There are some other aspects of this problem to be considered. From the point of view of the rural dweller I certainly think we must admit that if there is to be any sort of technical training in the country amongst the rural population, the growing of timber is absolutely essential towards that end.  If you have to get a person like a handy man in the country you will find that he has become a handy man because he has had opportunity of working on cheap timber available around his home.  There is no doubt that there are possibilities for our people to get a sort of technical <Col N="1298" /> training in the manufacture of timber if more timber were available and if it were cheaper and more easily procured. That has to be considered and it is a point that should not be lost sight of.  We have to consider what we can do to make more timber available for ordinary use, even around the farmsteads.</P>
      <P>I believe it is a national necessity that reafforestation should be proceeded with on a very much greater scale than has been done up to the present.  I do not know where any of the areas are that this work is being carried out on, whether they are on the western seaboard or on other areas in the country.  As Deputy McBride has said, there are very many areas which are available for afforestation that could not otherwise be made an economic asset at all.  The allocation of these areas is something I want to hear more about.  I would like to know what is the policy in regard to the problem of attempting reafforestation on the western seaboard.  Deputy O'Connell says trees would not grow.  I have been trying to collect some information from people who have had some experience on this matter to see how far it is possible to carry out the work of reafforestation in congested areas.  I think that should be a matter of policy under this Vote for the Government. I think that, apart from what the State might do towards planting on a large scale areas in the possession of the State itself, perhaps the problem might be tackled in another way.  That would certainly bring considerable benefits from the point of view of the number of trees cut down and the improvement in the appearance of the country and from the point of view of making more timber available at every farmstead in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few years ago, under the auspices of the old Sinn Fein organisation, a National Arbour Day was proclaimed. In my district I was responsible for getting 1,000 trees put down.  I think if consideration were given to this by the Government and a National Arbour Day proclaimed it would put a responsibility on everyone, every individual in the State, to go out on that day <Col N="1299" /> and do a certain amount of work in this direction and try to stir up a certain amount of enthusiasm to get our people to recognise the national necessity of reafforestation.  In that way I believe very much could be done.  As a matter of fact a great deal will be done and thousands of trees more will be put down by this means than certainly will be got by the method pursued by the State at present.  I do not say that, apart from that, the Minister should not take action on a much wider scale than he has so far.  It is not right to suggest that because the return is not immediate and the employment small, the expenditure under this heading will not justify itself.  It will improve to some extent and regulate the climate of the country probably and that will have something to do with the improvement of the health of the people generally year after year.  It will make an improvement in the conditions and the appearance of the country and make an asset to the State of the territories that have been planted by them and repay the State a hundred fold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the plea made for a bolder policy on the part of the Government with regard to forestry.  I would like to see a policy almost on the dimensions of the Shannon scheme with regard to it but I do not think that we will ever reach success even if we adopt the compulsory growing policy advocated by Deputy Wilson, or the harsh measures of interference with private property urged by Deputy Hewat. The Minister for Agriculture in looking over the farms of the Free State in one of his later speeches asked us to picture the farms of Ireland as generally ranging in size from 20 or 40 to 50 acres.  I am accustomed to looking at farms one-half, one-third, or one-fourth that size.  I think we will never reach anything in the way of afforestation on these small farms. Deputy Wolfe referred to the beneficial effects that would follow from having belts of timber.  I agree with him on that but you can never have belts of timber if you look to the small <Col N="1300" /> farmer to start putting down a tree here and there.  I think what he said in regard to the work done by the Kildare County Council, to my mind suggests a better line of working.  The private individual, the farmer, in these hard times cannot look for much profit from a timber crop.  Why should not the farmer regard his timber as a crop like any other crop?  He looks to it for profit and a farmer cannot wait for thirty or forty years to get a profit out of this crop.</P>
      <P>It is, I suggest, a matter more for the County Councils or the State.  It is the business of the State.  For every acre of forestry in Ireland, on the continent you get 18, 20, and 40 acres. Ireland is the barest country in the world in the matter of timber.  That is a disgraceful position to be in, considering that our country was, in the past, the best country in the world for timber.  When the British were building their Houses of Parliament and wanted the best timber in the world for the roof they got Irish oak and I am sure Ireland can grow as good oak to-day as it did in the past.  I hope we have not lost faith in Irish oak as we have in Irish wheat.  I suggest to the Minister that he should not look to the small farmer or to the larger farmer for this, not that I am opposed to the farmer planting trees.  I would like to see him planting as much as possible but you can never do anything on these lines.  I would support Deputy McBride's statement that there are stretches of land for miles along the Western seaboard that cannot grow any crop.  The Department of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture has a lot of them in its possession and can get get more of them.  I would like to see those hills and valleys clothed with timber.  The Deputy need not be afraid that the timber will not grow.  If he goes to the estates of the Marquis of Sligo or to the estate at Cong he will see as fine timber as any in the world growing there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter that the Department should be congratulated on.  It may seem a small thing.  That is the display of plants at the recent Spring Show.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> I think it was the most interesting feature of the show.  It showed the different species of trees, and also the soil to which these trees were suited.  I am sure that a great many people got very valuable information from these exhibits. I would like to ask the Minister on what system grants are made to county councils or to committees of agriculture in connection with county councils.  Deputy Wolfe has alluded to the work done by the Kildare County Council.  They were very favourably situated, because, through the generosity of the trustees of the Duke of Leinster, they got a number of woods throughout the county made over to them practically free.  I believe in one or two instances there was a small charge, but, on the whole, they got them made over practically free of charge.  They have worked very well since, and I think they are very well deserving of whatever grants are available for them.  They have also set up a nursery, and it is open to any landowner in the county who desires to plant a half of an acre of trees to get them free of charge.  That is a great encouragement.  The State at present is not in a position to deal with a large area of State lands.  There is, however, one particularly large tract of land in Deputy Wilson's constituency which has been used as an artillery range.  Last year I asked the President what use was to be made of that tract of land, and he said it would be kept over for a while until they would get some munitions out of the way. Whether that has been done or not, I do not know.</P>
    <P>As to the class of trees to be planted, that is a question that should be studied very closely.  Deputy Gorey has alluded to that, and said that we should produce a useful class of trees that would produce wood suitable for building purposes.  That would be very important. In the planting of larch there should be discrimination.  It should be native larch instead of Japanese larch, which is not so valuable.  These things, I am sure, have been studied by the Forestry Department.  I think we are all agreed that tree-planting is the most valuable work in which we can be engaged. <Col N="1302" /> Whether it would be a success in exposed areas bordering on the sea is an open question.  But there is a good deal of mountain land which is not good for grazing, and it might be utilised for this purpose.</P>

      <P>Deputy Baxter and Deputy Conlan are exercised as to the suitability of the soil, or climate of Ireland, or of the seaboard of Ireland, in so far as the growing of timber is concerned. I would advise both these Deputies to study the history of similar tracts of land in France.  There they had a country with a cold sub-soil.  It was exposed to the Atlantic gales.  It was covered with water in the winter and with sand in the summer.  The people went about there originally on stilts.  At present the whole department is covered with forests.  There are about 500 saw-mills, and at the moment I cannot say how many villages are now in that department. What was done there is an example that ought to be followed in the mountainous parts of our country. You cannot have saleable larch in 10 years.</P>

      <P>I am sorry Deputy Hewat has left the House, because I wanted to congratulate him on his conversion to compulsion.  I remember he urged here some months ago that there should be no compulsion on the man who kept a bad bull or who sold bad butter.  He is now out for compulsion in the matter of the growing of trees. I admit that there cannot be much done for a long time in this matter of reafforestation. If possible we ought to arrange for the co-operation of the people in the matter of forestry; but when you come to consider how you could most usefully co-operate your difficulties begin.  It is not easy to compel people to plant trees.  You might pass an Act of Parliament to that effect, but when you come to the administration of it you would find difficulties. There are very great difficulties now in either compelling people to plant trees, or refusing them permission to cut trees.  Some Deputies pointed out that apart from any other reason, when trees come to maturity they should be cut. <Col N="1303" /> Deputy Gorey mentioned that there is too much hedge timber in the country. There are a hundred and one good reasons for cutting down trees, and there might be a thousand and one bad reasons for cutting them.  It would be costly and difficult to administer an Act of Parliament for the purpose of preventing people cutting down trees, and in many cases it would lead to litigation. I do not see how you can go along the line of compulsion in this regard. I disagree with Deputy Hewat in that matter.  You may have compulsion in other matters, but I do not think you can have it along the line of forestry.  Deputy Baxter suggested something in the nature of an arbor day.  It is a suggestion worth consideration, but it is a question as to whether anything in the nature of an arbor day would be successful for some years.  You must have a change from the point of view that trees ought to be cut down regardless of any future considerations, and just because it suits to cut them down at the moment.  Deputy Cooper put it rather well when he said that the cutting down of trees is not always profit, and the planting of trees not always loss.  You have to take long views of forestry.  It is necessary to have a real change in the point of view of landholders generally before you can have a successful arbor day; but it is certainly well worth while keeping it in mind, so as to be able to take advantage of the time when it does arrive.  It may have arrived already, but I have my doubts.  I agree with Deputies with regard to the development in the line of encouraging county councils to do the sort of work that is being done in Kildare, and that is more likely to lead to results.  I agree also that this is a small sum to devote for forestry, and that forestry will have ultimately to be tackled in a big way, and when I say ultimately, I hope it does not mean too long.  I think there is little in the proposition that forestry would improve the climate.  I would suggest to Deputy Baxter that he has to consider exactly <Col N="1304" /> what area of forestry he means.  There are plenty of shelter belts, and these are very important for the farmers who do it judiciously.  Many farmers who treat their land well suffer considerable loss of stock because they have not made provision for shelters in their farms.  I take it, however, that that is not what is in the Deputy's mind.  He is thinking of big areas of forestry which would change the climate.  I think the theory the Deputy put up has not been proved. In any case, how long would it take? Deputy Baxter's great, great grandchildren would probably be debating the question as to whether 350,000 or 400,000 acres of timber&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It would take a long time to develop anything up to 400,000 or 500,000 acres of timber, and that would be really lost in a country like this.  It would take a couple of million acres scheduled as barren mountain wastes, and that, I think, is what he has in his mind.  I doubt very much if timber to that extent would influence the climate, but in any event it is a proposition that could not mature for a great number of years.  On the other hand, I agree that forestry has not got the attention it would get under ordinary circumstances.  More urgent matters have to take precedence.  It is a case of taking first things first.  If there were fewer abnormal circumstances, I agree that forestry would get more attention.  I am not satisfied that the Vote represents what is adequate to the needs of the situation, but I say it is the best that could be done in the circumstances, and I go no further than that.</P>
