      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that the claims of Mr. J. Gilbride, Garage Proprietor, Sligo, were heard before the Circuit Judge on the 17th April, 1924, and that the Judge reported in favour of payment of upwards of £1,400, together with costs, and if he can state why Mr. Gilbride has not yet received this money, and the reason for the delay in payment.</P>

      <P>Reports totalling £1,417 15s. 0d. in favour of Mr. Gilbride are under consideration in my Department and they will be disposed of without avoidable delay.  I am informed that payments exceeding £3,000 have been made to him by the Department of Defence and a detailed examination of the claims was necessary to ensure that there should be no duplication of payment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should understand that in report cases there is no right of appeal, but there is a right and duty for the Minister for Finance to examine a claim if he has reason to think that any details are excessive, and that examination may take as much time, perhaps, as an appeal would take, if an appeal were possible.</P>

      <P>My statement of the 6th May last was to the effect that I was in communication with the Minister for Education with a view to arranging for the additional payment of the sum of £267 1s. 8d., mentioned in the Question, on satisfactory evidence being furnished that liabilities up to that limit had been in fact incurred and that satisfactory work had been done.  The information, so far as supplied to me, does not enable me to authorise a payment on this basis.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state what sums have been paid to date, whether as the consequence of decrees or <i>ex gratia</i> grants, under the heads, respectively, of Damage to Property, and Personal Injury; and if any estimates have been made of moneys that may yet remain to be paid under these heads, and what these estimates are; and if any other moneys are due to be paid, or are estimated to be paid, as a consequence of Irregular activities, and what the amount of these moneys are, or may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount paid up to and including the 7th instant in respect of compensation for property losses is £6,838,000 cash, while £437,000 has been paid in stock.  In respect of personal injuries payment has been made to the 7th instant of just over £701,000.  While personal injury cases have to a large extent been disposed of, a large number of property cases still await hearing in Court, and it is accordingly not possible to estimate what moneys yet remain to be paid.  Government property has also suffered extensive damage, of which no account is taken in the foregoing figures, while a number of mixed cases of commandeering and damage are dealt with through the Public Works and Buildings Vote, which are also excluded from the figures given above.</P>
      <P>The latter part of the question is not fully understood.  If the Deputy means that items such as the increased cost of the Army, consequent on Irregular activities, are to be taken into account the figure of the total payments would be much enlarged, but for obvious reasons is not capable of measurement at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say whether there is any system whereby vacancies in one department can be filled by persons employed in other departments who are about to be dismissed? Can there not be transfers rather than dismissals and re-employment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always desirable where permanent employees are required <Col N="100" /> that we should have permanent men doing the work rather than temporary men.  It is most desirable to reduce the number of temporary clerks and a considerable number of men were appointed to the grade of clerical officers as a result of a recent competitive examination and they should be employed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister, following upon that proposition, admit that men who have been temporarily employed for a considerable time are more likely to give efficient service than new people brought in?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether his attention has been drawn to the very acute distress that prevails amongst one hundred and six congests in the townlands of Borraderra and Old Grange, Monasterevan, Co. Kildare, owing to the loss of their oats and potato crops by the flooding of their lands caused by the choked-up condition <Col N="101" /> of two tributaries of the Figele or Black River, and whether he will send an Inspector to enquire into and report on the conditions of living of those congests with a view to making a grant for the drainage of this area, which work would also give employment to those people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The River Figele is a tributary of the Barrow, and is one of the streams proposed to be dealt with under the Barrow drainage scheme. That scheme will relieve the lands referred to from flooding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the occurrence mentioned by the Deputy. In a case of the kind the Department of Defence is not legally liable for compensation. <Col N="103" /> Moreover, the military driver was using the lorry without authority, and the driver of the horse appears to have been guilty of contributory negligence, inasmuch as the horse was crossing in front of the lorry unattended.  It is, therefore, not proposed to make any payment to Mr. Farrell.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, in this case there was contributory negligence. As I have stated, in answer to the question, this man allowed his two horses, which were in tandem, to wander across the road.  I am sure, were it not for that fact, that some reasonable compensation might be paid to the man, but he seemed to take no care at all with regard to his business.</P>

A scheme for the <Col N="104" /> expenditure of this sum was, however, received.  The county council were informed that all schemes for the relief of unemployment in the county were being carried out under the direct supervision of the Land Commission. About the time of the receipt of the council's scheme a sum of £8,750 had just been made available by the Minister for Finance from the Relief Vote for works to be carried out in the county through the Land Commission. In view of the fact that the Vote was almost entirely allocated, a further grant could not be made, and the council was informed to that effect.  Particulars of the most suitable works in the council's scheme have been forwarded to the Land Commission for consideration. The Deputy may wish to make representations to that Department.</P>

The attendance at the school is very small, the average for last year having been only 11.  In 1922 the question of the erection of a new schoolhouse was investigated, but it then appeared that, having regard to the sparse population of the district and <Col N="107" /> to the absence of the likelihood of new families settling in the locality, the prospect of the school being permanently required was very uncertain.

      <P>The restriction of benefit to men discharged before 29th June, 1924, is specifically provided for by the terms of the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  Army service is not insurable employment, and  normal circumstances, therefore, does not entitle a soldier to benefit on his discharge.  In the abnormal circumstances created by the demobilisation of large numbers of men temporarily enlisted for an emergency it was decided to ease the transition to civil life by the special grant of a certain amount of benefit, and the date 29th June, 1924, was selected as corresponding to the end of the demobilisation period.  To grant benefit to men, without regard to the date of their discharge would, in effect, be to treat Army service as insurable employment which the Acts specifically declare it is not; as between ex-Army men, however, preference is given as a general rule for employment on relief works to the men who are not in receipt of benefit.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy has already been informed it would be necessary, in order to provide telephone call office facilities at Kilcock, to erect a pair of wires from Maynooth Telephone Exchange to that place. The estimated annual receipts from a call office would fall far short of the annual expenses involved in providing and maintaining the service; and it is not the practice of the Department to open call offices under guarantee in cases like this, where there is a wide disparity between the estimated revenue and expenses and there is little prospect of the call office becoming self-supporting.</P>
      <P>Consideration has been given to the question of the establishment of a telephone exchange at Kilcock, but it is found that the amount of local support is not sufficient to enable the Department to offer exchange lines at the normal rental of £7 10s. a year.  In order to make the project remunerative higher rentals would, therefore, be necessary from each of the eight prospective subscribers, but only three are willing to pay more than the normal rental.

As Deputies know, measures must go through their First and Second Reading before they can be taken in Committee.  No business was left over from last Session, and it was thought that the Local Government Bill would be before us with what amendments the Seanad chose to put in.

      <P>The Bill is in four sections.  The first section defines the term &ldquo;Dáil Supreme Court.&rdquo;  Section 2 grants pensions to certain former Judges of the Dáil Courts.  It lays down that the Minister for Justice may, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, grant to any person who held office as a Judge of the Dáil Supreme Court a pension for his life at such rate as the Minister for Justice shall, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, think proper but not exceeding two-thirds of the annual salary of which such person was in receipt as a Judge of the Dáil Supreme Court immediately before he ceased to hold office as such judge.  Every pension granted under this section shall, subject <Col N="116" /> to the provisions of this Act relating to the suspension of pensions and the avoidance of double pensions, be payable to the person to whom such pension is granted as from the date on which the annual salary of such person as a Judge of the Dáil Supreme Court ceased to be paid to him.  Every pension granted under this section shall be charged on and payable out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof.  Judges of the courts that were set up under Dáil Eireann in the days prior to the Treaty were appointed for life on a salary of £700 per annum.  Their courts having ceased to exist, the question of making appropriate pension provision arises and this Bill is brought in to that end.  The Deputy will, of course, have an opportunity of discussing the matter fully on the Second and other Stages.  I trust that this general statement regarding the object of the Bill will be deemed sufficient at this stage.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is mistaken in saying that the Dáil Cabinet had not the authority of the Dáil itself.  The times were exceptional, and the Dáil, realising that, delegated to the Cabinet very exceptional powers, so that in making these appointments the Cabinet of the Dáil was not acting in any sense <i>ultra vires.</i>  When the Dáil met from time to time, perhaps at intervals of three or four months, all the doings of the interval were laid before it and received retrospective sanction. The Deputy may reserve his fulminations until a later stage of the Bill, when we will be prepared to meet the point which he seeks to establish, that those persons ought not to be taken seriously as judges of a system of courts which were established with the sanction and consent of the Parliament of the country, and which has now been disestablished.  If that is the position, then they are entitled to legislation of this kind to provide pensions for them, just as under other legislation and other regulations, pensions have been provided for judges of another system which has been also disestablished.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the absence of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who is unfortunately ill, I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  It seeks to place on a statutory basis an institution which was brought into existence for the first time towards the end of 1921, and which has since been functioning under some little difficulty.  In the Second Dáil I was able to explain what an improvement had been effected in prices by reason of combined purchasing. I think some Deputies are aware of the fact that since this Department came into existence a number of articles not formerly produced in the Saorstát have been manufactured in it. One of the difficulties that beset this department in the beginning was the extraordinary diversity in the number of articles of much the same kind used in the various institutions in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To those who have had some experience of what may be called local politics within the last twenty years one particular claim was made, that standard articles should be adopted for use in the various institutions.  After some conferences with local authorities a list of standard articles was drawn up, and in consequence it will be conceded that the prices of these standard articles, by reason of being able to buy in bulk, would be fairly considerably reduced.  Very considerable reductions in prices have taken place as a result of combined purchasing.  As I said already, a number of articles that were not formerly manufactured in the Saorstát are now being manufactured in it, and a trade for some of these articles has also been opened up in other directions.  Local authorities purchased a certain quantity of these <Col N="121" /> articles and that has enabled the manufacturers to place goods in markets which otherwise might never have been thought of.</P>
    <P>In addition to the standardising of particular articles for institutions, there has been a considerable reduction in prices of goods which came from outside the Saorstát.  In one particular case the price list was furnished and the customary method of tendering was to give a percentage off the published price.  When I was Minister for Local Government I remember seeing the various percentages which, on the average, amounted to 17 per cent. off the list price.  The Trade Section of the Local Government Board increased the percentages from 17 per cent. to 25 per cent. generally over the country, and in the case of Dublin and Cork it was 28 per cent. of a reduction off the list price.  Articles which had formerly been purchased by local authorities were of an inferior quality and I am quite sure some of the articles purchased by the Department will probably suffer from the same charge, but they can be corrected.  There have been cases in which articles were not up to the standard, but through the co-operation of local authorities that can certainly be corrected.  I can understand that, given a number of articles purchased by local authorities, separately and independently, they would suffer perhaps from the very same fault.  That fault was not usually discovered with the same alacrity or industry as the faults alleged in the case of the Trade Department.  In other words, there is no interest in preserving the integrity of the Trade Department, as it is there for analysis and criticism. Any one who has experience of local authorities knows quite well that there are many reasons why no such allegations and no such analysis are made in the case of purchases made by themselves.</P>
    <P>In addition to the work this particular section has done for Local Government, it has also been brought into play for some of the Government services and, as a set-off, satisfactory <Col N="122" /> prices were obtained whenever their services were requisitioned.</P>
    <P>It was put to me when I was through the country recently that there is a discrimination in favour of Dublin by this Department.  I have examined the list of places where contracts have been placed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a list of places where contracts have been placed outside Dublin.  The charge has been made that this system is for the advantage of Dublin, and I am meeting that argument by citing places where contractors live who have succeeded in getting contracts from this Department. This particular section of Local Government is not a statutory section and, in consequence, there are some difficulties in connection with the law which compel a local authority to advertise for goods.  That is settled by one of the sections in the Bill which enables them to satisfy the requirements by purchasing through the State Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this Bill because it seems to me that it is another declaration by the Ministry that the people are incapable of managing their own local affairs.  The President has told us about the amount of money that has been saved by this combined purchasing, and he referred, in passing, to the fact that there have been complaints that the goods supplied were not up to the standard.  There were <Col N="123" /> complaints undoubtedly and there were very good grounds for them.  It is quite easy to save money by getting inferior stuff supplied.  There were commodities supplied under this system which had to be returned by the public bodies concerned, because they were practically useless.  I came across one instance lately where a lot of tar for roads had been supplied under this system.  When the county council concerned started to put this tar on the roads, they found the stuff was so bad that they had to send their men to scrape it off the roads again.  I could give other instances of where county council vans, which were supplied, were found to be not at all as good as those previously got when the county council were purchasing them themselves.</P>
      <P>The same complaints have been made with regard to the supply of food, but my real objection to this Bill is that it gives the Minister new powers and takes away from the local authorities the powers they have already.  It asks us to assume that the Minister and his officials know all about Local Government administration, know all about local conditions and requirements and that they will be the best judges as to the quality of the different commodities.  Under Section 3 the Minister is empowered to apply for official contractors and to appoint from the list of applicants any persons he may choose without any regard to whether they are going to supply the best commodities at the lowest prices or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that there is no call for this Bill at the moment.  I do not believe it is going to be a success, and I believe it will do a lot of injury to many small industries throughout the country and cause greater unemployment. It may be a good Bill from the point of view of helping certain industries in Dublin and Cork; notwithstanding the list of places the President has read out in which contracts have been placed, we know well that when a contractor is asked to tender for a certain commodity for perhaps every public body in the twenty-six counties, the small manufacturer or the small merchant will have very little chance against the merchants of <Col N="124" /> the cities of Cork and Dublin, who will be able to send out and sell at a much lower price a commodity not, perhaps, as good.  We may have some gentleman here in Dublin importing potatoes from the north of Ireland and sending them down to Cork to be consumed in a county home.</P>
    <P>One section in the Bill to which the Minister did not refer was that which states that the Minister may appoint his officials and that the Minister's expenses as well as those of his officials are to be paid by the local bodies whether they purchase or not.  We have often heard of the principle of taxation without representation.  I think we have it here, and further we have the principle of taxation without control of expenditure.  I think myself that the Bill is a bad one.  Certainly most of the sections, particularly 3, 6, and 8 are bad.  I do not believe that the Bill will do any real good or that it is in the interests of real economy, or of the poor people in the county homes or hospitals throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Morrissey.  I do not think this Bill is going to be a success.  You are delegating the powers of the public bodies to a public contractor.  He might not be from the particular district at all. In a particular district where these institutions exist farmers believe that they have the first claim on the supply of vegetables and butter and articles of that kind.  If the institutions are to have such satisfactory results as were anticipated, in connection with the changes in local government, I think the bodies administering them should be trusted for a little while, at least. I am told that there is butter supplied at 1/3 and 1/4 per lb., while the butter buyers are paying 1/6 per lb.  That is an economy, no doubt, but there is somebody going to suffer.  The poor in the institutions or the soldiers will suffer.  I do not agree with the principle of the Bill at all.  I do not believe it will tend to economy and, even if it does, there is somebody going to suffer for the economy.  On these grounds, I oppose the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to <Col N="125" /> support the principle of this Bill.  I have some recollection of the genesis of this trade department, and I have some recollection of the ideas which underlay and the motives which prompted the change.  Substantially, they amounted to this: that in a time of considerable financial stringency for local authorities, by reason of very substantial losses in grants, arising out of the action of the Local Government Board, it was necessary to explore every possibility of economy.  It was found that institutions in the various county towns were ordering the same supplies in small quantities and paying very high prices for them.  The consideration emerged very definitely that if, by pooling orders of that kind and by being in a position to place orders for large quantities, money could be saved for the local authorities and for the ratepayers, that would be a step well worth taking.  That was, at any rate, the root and genesis of this departure, that goods of the same or even better quality could be secured on better terms by reason of larger orders being placed.  What is at present known as the Trade Branch of the Local Government Department developed out of that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one further consideration. It is one which the President touched on briefly in moving the Bill, that nascent industries in this country can be fostered, and even enterprising persons may be encouraged to embark upon new industries, if there is a possibility of securing, over a period, contracts of this kind for the supply of goods of one kind or another to the local institutions.  In the pre-Treaty days, that aspect of things was considered by the political organisations of the time&mdash;Sinn Fein and other bodies&mdash;and it was certainly appreciated that if the local authorities of the country, through some body acting for all, were in a position to pool their contracts and place large orders, much might be done towards fostering nascent industries and even developing new ones.  The claim is urged against this Bill that the quality of the goods is not the same as when they were being bought through persons here and there in the various county towns, and generally that it is a bad Bill, that it is <Col N="126" /> sure to hurt somebody and that it is not going to do any good to anyone. I wonder if that is the considered opinion of any Deputy.  I wonder if that is the considered opinion of any ratepayers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest, and nobody suggested, that the Bill was not going to do any good to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather gathered that from the Deputy's remarks.  I understood him to say that it was a thoroughly bad Bill, with nothing to commend it to the Dáil, and that it was not in the best interests of the people of the country that it should pass.  I want to examine that, if the Deputy will allow me.  I wonder if, apart from vested interests, any thoughtful body of ratepayers through the country examining this Bill and the considerations underlying it, would agree with Deputy Morrissey that this is the kind of Bill which the Dáil should reject ignominiously. The test question, I imagine, for them would be whether the Bill is going to save them money, whether it is going to enable the rates to be reduced, whether it is going to mean the same service, or better service, at lower cost.  If it is, I think, in a plain, blunt kind of way, without any undue subtlety, they would say they would like the members of the Dáil to pass this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be prepared to admit that in connection with this Bill, as in connection with many other matters, you have an opportunity of favouring the individual at the expense of the general public or of favouring the general public at the expense of the individual. You have got to choose.  It is always easier, and nearly always pleasanter, to respond to the appeal of the individual, to do him the favour, because you are only, after all, bludgeoning the general public, and the general public sometimes does not know it is being bludgeoned and very seldom hits back; whereas the individual will be ever so grateful for the favour you do him at the expense of the general public.  You can continue the old system by which you divide up the purchases and dissipate them through various towns amongst various retailers, and the big <Col N="127" /> unthinking public, the big mass of the ratepayers, will continue to pay high prices where they might pay low ones for the same or better quality of goods. That is, apparently, what Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Daly would wish. On the other hand, you can, through a system of joint purchasing, a system of pooling contracts under the supervision of the Department, ensure better value to the ratepayers of the country and enable a sadly-needed reduction of rates to be effected.</P>
    <P>As in so many other matters, you can scarcely take a step of this kind without walking on someone's corns, and Deputies have to choose between walking on the corns of the few or continuing to trample on the corns of the many, by needlessly flinging away the people's money.  There will be nothing new urged against this Bill.  There will be nothing urged that was not urged away back when we made this departure first.  &ldquo;It is going to mean that so-and-so, in such a town, will not make as much as he used to make.&rdquo;  Perhaps it is.  But it will mean that a great many &ldquo;so-and-so's&rdquo; in such a county will not pay as much as they used to pay.</P>

      <P>We suggest that the people, through their representatives here, should do their business, and do it much more sanely and more wisely than it was done in the past. The Bill is before Deputies for their consideration.  That is not denied, I take it.  We are urging certain facts in its favour for the consideration of Deputies, and we put it to Deputies that they can do a benefit to the masses of the people at some possible loss and expense to individuals, or they can continue to benefit individuals at great loss to the general community.  That is the real issue, and the Deputy knows that that is the real issue.</P>
      <P>There is a list here showing reductions that were effected in the cases of specific goods by the system of pooling the orders and buying in bulk, for subsequent distribution to the institutions. We have here a list showing the reductions in about fifteen or twenty cases. Check for aprons was 2/1½ per yard, and the price through the trade branch was 1/2.  Calico (blay) was 1/3½ per yard, and through the trade branch the price was 9d.  Fine flannel was 2/6 per yard, and purchased through the trade branch it was 1/8.  I could go down through a long list of articles, showing substantial reductions of that kind.  There will always be the cry of the individual who is hit by some change or some departure from the old way.  There will be the individual conservatism of vested interests, for which Deputy Morrissey speaks, and because it is natural, and because it is human nature, there is not any use in protesting against it.  It has always come when any change was proposed, and it will always come when any change is proposed.  The person who is affected by the change will protest, and it so happens that the people who will benefit by the change are so little aware of it that they do not even rally in its favour, are not enthusiastic for it, and only appreciate it subsequently in its effects, without thinking as to how it was brought about.</P>

      <P>Up to a point, the Deputy will agree that it is our business to do their work for them.  It is our business to consult the general interests of the community and to favour the general interests of the community, even when they conflict with the particular interest of individuals.  It is in that capacity of stewardship for the general public that we bring forward measures of this kind that are for the good of the general public.  We recognise that it does happen occasionally that a measure brought forward for the good of the general public will not be particularly welcome to individuals.  It is not claimed for this Bill that it is one that will be of great benefit to all the people.  It will be of great benefit to the vast majority of the people and, unfortunately, for the sake of that benefit, individuals will have to sacritice something that accrued to them in the past.  The Deputy can make his choice.  He seems, in fact, to have already made it.  He stands for the continuance of the individual's benefit at the expense of the general public. We stand in the other lobby, so to speak&mdash;for the good of the general public, even when some loss and sacrifice is involved to the individual.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister who has just sat down, and the President, advocated the Second Reading of this Bill because the principle of it, as they alleged, is centralised purchasing.  That is not the principle of the Bill.  They have adduced certain figures to show the value of centralised purchasing.  But centralised purchasing is not the purpose of this Bill.  Centralised purchasing is at present in operation.  I am one of those who believe that in certain cases centralised purchasing would be an economy and would be very valuable for the development of the country. But that system is at present in operation and does not require a Bill of this kind.  The principle of this Bill is not to empower local authorities to purchase co-operatively or centrally or collectively, but to put into the hands of the Minister and his officials power to insist that local authorities shall buy certain things of a certain quality from certain people.  The proposition in the <Col N="130" /> Bill is to impose upon the local authority the duty of buying certain things from certain people, which an official of the Department says they should buy. That is a principle that we do not approve of&mdash;not the principle that there should be centralised purchasing.  The object of this Bill is not, as one would imagine from reading Section 2, to enable local authorities to obtain, by centralised purchasing, certain things.  If that were the purpose of the Bill I should be quite in favour of it.  But that is not the purpose.  The purpose is to place in the hands of the Minister power to appoint contractors, to place in the hands of his officials power to inspect, and to place in the hands of his auditors powers to impose penalties upon local authorities which do not conform to what these officials think is the duty of the local authority in all matters of purchasing.</P>
      <P>That is the principle that you are asked to support.  The Minister has again suggested that it is the business of the Dáil to do the work of the people in the country, denying implicitly that the people who are elected to look after local affairs are capable of purchasing commodities, choosing qualities, or entering into contracts for items which, in any degree, depart from the standard set up by the central authority.  One would imagine, from what the Minister for Justice suggested, that none of us ever heard of faults arising from centralised purchasing; that none of us ever heard of failure to satisfy the best interests of the community through a system of centralised purchasing or that there had been suggestions of personal aggrandisement through the same system.  He spoke to us as though central purchasing was the only thing possible for the purpose of safeguarding the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this were a Bill merely intended to legalise existing conditions, making it easier for local authorities to use the Trade Department and enter into formal contracts with that Department, that would be one thing and I would support it.  The proposition, however, is to place in the hands of the Ministry a certain rigid and absolute power to insist on the local authorities doing what the Minister intends they shall do <Col N="131" /> in the matter of purchasing.  The intention is to prevent members of local authorities exercising their own discretion. Sub-section (3) of Section 6 practically tells local representatives that they must not go outside the official contractor for the standardised article set up according to the wisdom of the official in the Minister's Department. They could only go outside of that standard under pain of surcharge.  It would be essential for the local authority to prove to the auditor that it was acting <i>bona fide</i> in going outside the official standard. If the auditor in the future continues as in the past to act more or less on the suggestion of the Minister in indicating that such and such a policy should be followed, every representative on a local authority will be afraid to go outside the Minister's prescribed list of contractors and list of articles.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Johnson would not like to do an injustice to anybody.  I have always noticed that he is particularly anxious to avoid doing injustice to anybody. I know the officers in the Local Government Department, and I know the nature of the work they carry out.  I am aware that at no time have they discussed with the Minister what his policy was in regard to surcharges.  I think it is only right that I should make that statement.  The auditor has a particular responsibility which he cannot share with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting for a moment that the Minister discusses surcharges with the auditor; but I do suggest that as the auditor is an officer in the Minister's department, removable by the Minister, and an officer for whom the Minister has responsibility, he inevitably takes his cue from the Minister's general outline of policy as stated in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to correct that impression.  I have had some experience of Local Government auditors, even at a time when we had no respect at all for the Custom House as the headquarters of the Local Government Department.  They had <Col N="132" /> there a very definite line.  Very often the Minister or the Chief Secretary at the time would have liked to have influenced the auditor, but they could not, dare not, and did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has his own opinion on that matter, and I have mine.  I say that an official of a department, not an accounting auditor, but practically a detective auditor, who is not in an independent position such as the Auditor-General, but is merely a departmental official responsible to the Minister, is inevitably influenced by the policy of the Ministerial Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only disagree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>If matters were as the Minister suggests, things are possibly worse, because the auditor will have even more authority.  He need not know anything about the standard of quality, about the conditions of purchase or manufacture, or, indeed, anything at all.  All he need do is to refuse to satisfy himself that the local authority is acting <i>bona fide</i> in making a certain purchase.  Then he can surcharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to be intervening too often, but this is rather an important matter.  I take it Deputy Johnson does not wish to do anything unfair in this matter.  There is one thing the auditor would be bound to do.  He would be bound in certain cases to surcharge.  For instance, in a case where a contract was entered into, the contractor undertaking to supply goods at a particular price on the understanding that he was getting an order for a certain quantity of goods. any reduction of that quantity must necessarily alter his price.  Suppose he tendered to supply 50,000 yards of a particular material at 5/-, and if the quantity was reduced by half, the price would be consequently affected by that difference.  The contractor must be protected in that case, and the auditor's action in protecting him would not be influenced by the Minister's policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would direct the President's attention to sub-sections <Col N="133" /> (1) and (3).  The Auditor is to be the judge in all respects.  If the authorities, for instance, thought it desirable to supply milk containing three per cent. of butter fat to the inmates of a hospital, and the auditor thought that they could have got the milk at a halfpenny a quart cheaper, with two and a half per cent. of butter fat, then the auditor could, subject only to a decision of the Minister on appeal, surcharge the local authority for their contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Off-hand I would say that would be a case for the immediate dismissal of the auditor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so; but supposing the Minister approved, and supposing the auditor was in fact following out, as I suggest, the inspired message of the Minister, then the Minister is certainly going to approve. I submit that the position you would be placing the auditor in may not be very much stronger, but, in connection with this particular power in respect to contracts, it is a position which will largely make the local authority an absolute nonentity.  Under the Local Government Bill you are centralising authority, in many respects, in the Minister and his officials.  Here we are doing the same in another form in respect to purchases by a local authority.  You are going to have a list of contractors, and the local authority must purchase anything they require from one or other of those contractors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I protest against the continuance of this method of centralising authority in respect to purely local affairs in the Minister or his officials in Merrion Street.  Give powers to local authorities to combine for central purchasing by all means, but in this measure you do not give them such power.  You take the power out of their hands.  You remove from the local authority all responsibility and you are giving absolute control to a central authority in a manner absolutely contrary to the whole trend of modern legislation.  You are taking the responsibility from the people and centralising it in the Minister or his officials.  To a greater degree <Col N="134" /> than before you will be centralising in a few wholesalers the power to combine for purchase and distribution, which will, I believe, act detrimentally in many cases, not merely on the local contractors, but on the people actually concerned in the consumption of the articles purchased.</P>
    <P>Every member of the Dáil has, I suppose, sympathised at some time or other with the protest against new methods of marketing commodities of common consumption.  We get articles made up in Chicago and sent to our doors in boxes.  A generation ago those same things were grown within a few miles from our own houses and were sent to our doors perhaps in a different way, but possibly in a more wholesome form.  This idea of over-centralisation is being emphasised in the Bill.  You are not allowing fair play to local competition when you put in a centralised authority.  You are going to destroy rather than increase local development, and you are doing that by imposing on the local authority a certain duty to follow the behest of the Minister.  Give the local authorities a chance of combining and enable them to obtain jointly such supplies as they may require. Do not impose on them the necessity of going through the doors of Merrion Street, leaving all responsibility on the Minister; that responsibility is a very attenuated one so far as the local people are concerned.  It is not a good thing to throw responsibility for local administration upon a centralised authority only responsible to a legislative body such as the Dail.</P>

It has, practically speaking, been in force for two or three years.  This collective buying by a central authority here in Dublin has been operating for two years to my own knowledge in a good many local bodies.  I happen to be a member of a local body and when the contracts are taken quarterly or half-yearly they <Col N="135" /> are advertised in the ordinary way.

      <P>If I might interrupt the Deputy for a moment, I would say I was not aware until 2 o'clock today that I would have to move this Bill instead of its being moved by the Minister for Local Government, and it was during the interval that I was able to make up the case.  I have explained that Section 6 has reference to the disability under which certain, if not all, local authorities labour in respect of accepting contracts entered into by the Trade Department of the Local Government Department.  The Trade Department makes a contract at a certain price.  The local authority, as things stand, should advertise for any contract over £100.  This particular section enables them to dispense with the advertisement, which is no longer necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not dealing with any particular section.  I was dealing with the principle of the Bill.  I hold the view that any part of this Bill can be altered in Committee.  When we come to deal with the sections afterwards, it will be a different matter.  I, as a member of a local authority, have found very great assistance from this <Col N="136" /> official list that was sent us by the Trade Department.  There is no doubt that thousands of pounds have been saved in a half-year's working of local bodies because of the facilities afforded through this central buying. There is not anybody here, even Deputy Morrissey or Deputy Johnson, if he knows anything about it, but is aware of local rings that have crept into districts.  There is the milk ring and the meat ring and rings of every description where they divide the profits and put in a certain fabulous, ridiculous price and get it because there is no competition.  It is a very good thing, as the Minister for Justice said, for the individual, but a very bad thing for the public.  Some machinery should be found to deal with that sort of thing, and this machinery of central buying is an immense help in dealing with anything like rings.  I admit that the intention of the Bill is right.  I am prepared to admit that it is necessary, and anybody who has been a member of a local authority and who wants to be honest on the question must admit that I also know that in some particular instances, in items for the half-year's supplies, if local authorities had not the option of considering other tenders than the local tenders, there would be a loss.  Some of the prices, and some of the samples sent down by the central authority can be beaten by local prices in the district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want, when this Bill goes into Committee, to preserve the right of the local authority where they can show a good cause that where they are able to take contracts lower than those of the central authority, they will be at liberty to do so.  I want that right preserved.  It has been the custom for the last few years that the Local Government Inspector was present, and he must be always present in the matter of tenders&mdash;and if he objects to a particular article being accepted it is for the local committee to show cause why they should accept it.  I do not see where the case can lie at all that the auditor can come in except in a glaring case of the misapplication of public money.  In my opinion this Bill is a necessary Bill.  I can understand <Col N="137" /> how the matter will work out.  I have been a member of a local authority for perhaps twenty-five years now.  I have known of a meat ring and milk ring, and rings in almost everything that was supplied locally.  The public was fleeced for the benefit of a few individuals. It is pretty nearly time that some machinery was devised to get behind these smart local people.  But in connection with this matter I do not anticipate any instance in which the Local Government Minister or his auditor can do anything glaringly wrong.  The Minister for Local Government here is an Extern Minister. He is responsible to the Dáil for his conduct.  He is also responsible for the conduct of his auditors, and, if the Minister or his auditor is doing anything wrong it is perfectly open to the Dáil to bring up the matter here, and to thrash it out.  I, more or less, welcome the Bill, and I hope that the few more or less objectionable provisions in it will be amended or erased when the Bill is in Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask whether, under this Bill, contracts will be entered into yearly, half-yearly, or quarterly, or whether the local authorities, if they can buy better in outside markets, will have an opportunity of doing so with the concurrence of the Local Government Department?  I will put a case in point.  During last year my attention was drawn to the question of a contract for seasonable goods &mdash;say eggs.  At certain times of the year eggs are scarce, and the contract was entered into.  Owing to some mistake and the failure to advertise, the contract was continued two months beyond the time and well into the season at which eggs could have been purchased much more cheaply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know if there is any protection in the Bill, or if the Minister will take steps to see that a contract will not be entered into at a certain period of the year when articles are searce and that that contract will be allowed to go into a period of the year when these articles are plentiful and cheap.  I know the incident that I mentioned occurred last year, and while <Col N="138" /> not opposed to the Bill in any way I would be glad if the Minister would take a note of that and see that by no mistake, or flaw, or oversight in the Bill such a thing would occur again. It is quite possible that if a contractor gets a contract he may, in one month out of the six, make a huge profit.  Had the competing contractors known that the contract would have extended into that month they would have put in a tender at a lesser figure.  I mention that because my attention was drawn to it last year on the matter of the supply of eggs and butter to a certain department.  The contractor managed to hold the contract during the cheaper period at the price of the dearer period.  If, in any circumstances, that is likely to occur again, I hope the Minister will see that there is nothing in the Bill that will allow it to happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that there is no necessity on behalf of my colleagues and myself to say that we are as anxious as Deputy Gorey to break up local rings.  But there is a worse thing to be encountered in public life than local rings, and what we want to guard against is to prevent the Minister from making a national ring against the best interests of the councils and the local people who have to pay the rates.</P>
      <P>I have been a member of a public body or two as has Deputy Gorey, and I have had some experience of the working of this Trade Department.  Invariably I have found that the prices submitted to us by this Trade Department, that has been functioning for the past two or three years, could not at all compare with the prices submitted to us by local contractors.  In some cases it was an advantage to a public board to get into touch with that particular section of the Local Government Department in order to get certain commodities. But I might say that in eight out of ten cases we found it to our advantage to deal locally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" /> I would also like to complain about the delay which we practically always encountered in dealing with this Department and I will cite one case.  At the beginning of last year the Wexford County Council entered tentatively, at any rate, into a contract with a firm to supply them with engines, steam rollers, stone breakers, etc., and they wanted to have them ready by April so as to do the work on the roads.  The particular firm that they were in negotiation with agreed to supply the machinery that was wanted by April.  The Local Government Department or the Trade Section of it came along and objected to the Wexford County Council entering into any particular contract with the particular firm for engines or stone breakers, though their engines and breakers were equally as good as the ones they agreed to take.  The Local Government Trade Department entered into a contract with the particular firm that they had in their list, and the result was that the machinery was held up and was not delivered to the Wexford County Council until October with the consequences that the roads in Wexford are in a bad condition on account of that machinery being held up.  That is not a desirable state of affairs.  If this Bill is going to be passed in an amended form or otherwise, I think we ought not to have a state of affairs like that prevailing.  Another matter which I think should be dealt with is, that a section should be inserted, or a regulation made to ensure that firms accepted as contractors to local authorities should pay fair wages to their employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not.  As far as printing is concerned, I am wondering if contracts would be made with the Trades Section of the Local Government <Col N="140" /> Department the same as for other commodities.  I do know, so far as printing is concerned, that there is a fair wages clause insisted upon and agreed to by the Local Government Department in connection with tenders accepted for printing by public bodies. It is absolutely necessary that we should have that, because the interests of one town might be worked against those of another town or city, and a certain town or city might suffer.  The principle of the Bill, or what the Minister has in his mind, I dare say would be acceptable to practically every Deputy. But, as Deputy Johnson says, the present draft of the Bill does not carry out what we believe the Minister intends, and what we are satisfied should be done.  We are as anxious as Deputy Gorey to remove the local rings, but we are not anxious that the Minister should be permitted to establish a national ring in place of local rings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that Deputy Johnson greatly exaggerated the effect of Section 6.  It will probably be desirable in future, as it was in the past, that a local authority in a particular case should purchase from some local contractor, rather than from the official contractor.  They have full power under the Bill to do so.  They are exempted from the necessity for advertising for contracts that they have hitherto been obliged to advertise for, but they are not prohibited from advertising for tenders if they feel that the prices on the official list are not as good as, or are no better than, prices they could obtain from some other contractor by advertising. If the tenders which they receive seem to them tenders which could be accepted with advantage to the ratepayers, rather than having supplies procured from the official contractor, they can enter into a contract with the people who sent in tenders. The only thing is that they must be prepared to justify their action, and that seems to be a fair and reasonable condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the full advantage is to be got out of central purchasing, then, as the President has indicated, it is desirable that the largest possible orders should <Col N="141" /> be given to the official contractor so that the best prices may be got from him.  The object of the scheme will be defeated if there is any unnecessary giving of contracts to people other than the official contractor.  But, in case some advantage can be got, or even if no loss will occur to the rates through going to another contractor, then there is no danger of a surcharge to the members of the local authority, and they can quite safely enter into another contract.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether any amendment by way of loosening Section 6 could be shown to be necessary.  As far as I have heard the discussion, I do not think a case has been made that Section 6 tightens the law unduly.  As the Bill stands, if at any time a supply of a particular commodity is wanted by the local authority, and they think they can get it from anybody else cheaper than from the official contractor, they can advertise in the usual way.  If a tender comes in which shows a price below that of the official contractor they can enter into a contract and get the goods in that way.</P>

      <P>I would like to correct the Deputy on that point.  If my recollection is correct, what happened was that the contracts were running for four months.  I suggested <Col N="142" /> that they should run for six months. Two months are still to run.  I said we were prepared to extend the contract from four to six months, conditional upon getting certain reductions.  The Deputy may not have heard of the reductions, but I believe reductions were got.  If the Deputy were to ask me in what particular items, I could not say, but I believe eggs were one of the items.</P>

      <P>The principle underlying this Bill, as set out in Section 2, is one that should have the support of every Deputy.  One of our real grievances against the Government is the heavy burthen of taxes imposed on the taxpayers.  But there are other bodies that run the Government very closely in burthening the unfortunate ratepayers&mdash;the different local authorities. Anything that would tend to relieve the ratepayers ought to have the support of Deputies.  For that reason I hope that Deputies will unanimously support the principle underlying this Bill, notwithstanding anything that Deputies Morrissey and Johnson have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Tell us what the principle is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle, as I have said, is set out in Section 2, which I will read for the Deputy:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall be the duty of the Minister to take all such steps as may be desirable to enable local authorities to obtain jointly from one or more suitable contractors such supplies of any commodity as may be required by them in the performance of their duties.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is obvious that local bodies have to purchase commodities from contractors.  These commodities can be purchased in bulk on behalf of local authorities from one or more contractors. There can be no doubt of that fact, and it is so obvious that it needs no argument.  When the same principle was put forward when other Bills, such as the Railways Bill, were being considered, it had the support of Deputy Johnson and those who sat with him.</P>

      <P>It was admitted in connection with that Bill that one of the advantages to be derived from it was the collective purchasing by the different departments on behalf of the unified railway instead of from separate entities.  We have yet to see the advantage of that purchasing, but that was certainly one of the points made.  I do not know whether Deputy Johnson is a member, but I am sure he is a supporter, of the many co-operative concerns in the country, and would he tell me what is the basis of the success of these concerns?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Unified purchasing is the basis of the success of co-operative concerns. Take another illustration, if it be necessary.  The State, or local authority, is only carrying out a bigger business on the lines that the same business is carried out by what we might call an ordinary business firm.  Take such a concern in the Free State, having a central department in one of the largest cities, and with sub-offices in different towns or in every town.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Would anyone suggest for a moment that the policy of such a business concern would be to purchase locally in the different towns, rather than centrally through the head office? As I have said, the advantage of purchasing centrally is so obvious that it needs no argument.  While the principle is laudable, we must, in adopting it, be sure that we are not going to get into troubles, if I might call them such, that might take away some of the advantages of that principle.  First of all, I do not see that it is incumbent on the Ministry under this Bill&mdash;of course it is one of the things that can be put right in Committee&mdash;to advertise its intention to accept tenders in bulk for <Col N="144" /> these different commodities, as required by the different local authorities. I think there should be a section in the Bill that just as it is incumbent on the local authorities, for reasons I need not go into, to advertise the fact that they are about to receive tenders for such and such commodities, so, for similar reasons, it should be incumbent on the Minister to advertise the fact that he is about to receive tenders for such and such commodities in bulk. But, as I have said, that is a matter that can be put right in Committee.</P>
      <P>Another matter I would like to mention, and it is the only point regarding which I have some difficulty, and that is in connection with the setting up of a central department.  There will have to be officials who will draw up specifications for these different commodities, and ensure that the samples sent in by those who are tendering for these supplies are up to a standard that could be approved of.  That means the setting up of a new department, and one of the difficulties I have at the moment is as regarding the expense involved in the appointment of numerous officials in that department.  In fact, it is possible if that department were carried out on the same generous scale as some of the existing departments in the Government, the expense possibly of carrying on such a department might more than outweigh any advantage that might accrue from centralised purchasing.  But I hope the wisdom of some of the Deputies will enable us to insert amendments in Committee that will prevent that state of affairs arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can learn the principle that combined purchasing is good business is admitted. Where exception is taken, is with regard to the way in which we arrive at combined purchasing.  It was in consultation with the General Council of County Councils that this Department commenced to function in the first instance. Deputies who have had experience of joint bodies will admit that there is rarely satisfaction in their management of a particular institution. The management of the Trade Department of the Local Government, or of <Col N="145" /> joint purchasing by, say, the General Council of County Councils, would not be as satisfactory as if it were under the Ministry.  It would mean a very large number of meetings of the General Council, and possibly there might be a difference of opinion as to whether or not support should go to one part of the country or another.  If you are committed to combined purchasing the only point in dispute is as to whether the department having control of it should be under the local authorities or under one central authority.  My opinion is that the most satisfactory way is to have it under a central authority, and the best central authority, and the one most disinterested, would be the Department of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Efforts have already been made to standardise articles.  Deputy Johnson, I think, made the case on one occasion that there should be standardisation of building materials, and that is an excellent principle.  We are certainly coming to the stage that centralisation is a most important thing.  All big businesses in successful countries are now centralised.  While I would prefer, if I got my choice, a collection of small industries throughout the country, as mentioned by Deputy Morrissey, I would like to know where are the <Col N="146" /> small industries and how they can possibly be supported nowadays, and be able to compete with huge institutions, with the inexhaustible sources of supply at their command, so far as capital, bulk purchases, and things of that kind are concerned.  The small industries are going, if they are not already gone. We may regret it, but the fact is there. As far as the local authorities are concerned, much the same thing would prevail.  No single local authority can be in a position to buy as well, or as cheaply, as one particular department purchasing for the lot.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

      <P>Could the Minister also supply a list counter to that&mdash;that is to say, where the Trade Department quote a price and where the local authority has made a contract at a price lower than that quoted.  This list, of course, has been drafted for the purpose of supporting the case for this Bill.  What I want to know is, if the Minister is prepared to produce a list showing where the Trade Department prices were higher than the local prices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be pleased to get that.  The point is that it would be a wonderful advantage to the Trade Department and I would be very glad to get it.  Here is a case where the advantage is all on the other side, and is it to be refused?  This particular list, from which I am reading, was compiled on the 29th January, 1924, that is 12 months ago.  There is a later  out in order that it could not be stated that I was unfair, this is a report made by the Trade Department at the time to justify its existence, or to point to certain lessons that might be learned from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The point of objection to that is that this is all possible and all this case is made in respect of the Trade Department that is functioning up to now where there has been a choice given to the local authority to act through the Trade Department. Now you want to impose an obligation on the local authority, in effect a rigid obligation, to buy through the official contractors, and in effect, I say again, not to allow any local choice on the part of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a local choice always in the case of a local price being more favourable.  The Deputy's case was in respect to articles produced locally.  On looking through the list I <Col N="148" /> find some difficulty in finding articles that might be produced locally.  For instance, in the case of Hennessy's brandy the Trade Department price is 15/- per bottle, while as regards local prices I find that they vary from 16/6 to 20/-.  I could give a list of the local authorities which paid the heavier price if the Deputy wishes to have it, but I imagine that the reading of the list is becoming somewhat wearisome to the House.  The percentage is much the same down along.  If the case be made in regard to eggs, bacon or butter or articles of that sort, certainly, the local contractor might do much better.  There is one article that I have come across in the course of my perusal of this list. It is that of margarine, in which the percentage of fat was as low as five per cent.  That was an imported article. As a result of the intervention of the Local Government Trade Department, an article of Irish manufacture was I believe provided at a lower price, in which there was a very much higher percentage of fat.  I would like to know if the case is that the unfortuate people in these districts are to be deprived of the extra fat and the advantage of the lower price, and the further advantage of having Irish manufacture, simply because some particular local contractor happened to get a better price for the foreign material.  I observe, too, in reading through the list that in one case a local authority up north specified for soap which was manufactured in the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price they paid was beyond the price at which the Trade Department was purchasing soap manufactured in the Saorstát.  I came across another case in which a certain local authority had in stock a considerable quantity of English goods.  The corresponding items in the Local Government list were of Irish manufacture and the quality was much superior in the case of the articles prescribed by the Department. I think it will be generally admitted that if there is anything to be done for Irish industries it is through Government contracts and through contracts given by local authorities.  In certain cases there is competition between the local contractor and perhaps an Irish <Col N="149" /> manufacturer living in another county or at the other end of the Saorstát, and it is no justification to say that you are helping the local person by giving him a price in excess of what the goods could be bought at elsewhere when they are all of Irish manufacture.  That is what entered into a good deal of the opposition to this central buying.  I do not mean to say that everybody has made a case against the central purchasing, but that is one instance.  I am sorry I cannot find the particular item that I mentioned, but it was very interesting.  Deputy Corish, I think, made a complaint about road machinery. Now, in the case of the supply of road machinery, I do know that many delays occurred.  In looking through the files dealing with that, I think there is very little doubt that if the local authorities themselves were dealing with that separately, much greater time would have elapsed. There was considerable delay and delay in many ways, but there is no doubt that the Department took every possible step that could be taken, at the time, to ensure delivery at the earliest possible moment.  In that particular case, so far as I know, there was a ring amongst the suppliers, and perhaps no great advantage was derived by central buying, except in the matter of early delivery.  But in the event of machinery of the kind being required again, it is likely we will be able to make some inroads upon that ring.  Quite a number of articles which had not previously been manufactured in this country were subsequently manufactured by reason of the orders that were given from this Trade Department. Deputy Corish knows of one in regard to bedsteads, where, apart from what was required by the local authorities, as a result of the Department's acting, it was possible to supply merchants in various parts of the country.  I observe, on looking over the list of purchases, that one local authority had actually paid 11/- per bedstead for foreign manufacture over and above the price at which home-manufactured goods could have been supplied.  The same thing applies to shovels and to two or three other items.</P>
    <P>This is the report: &ldquo;I inspected a <Col N="150" /> particular institution, checked books and stores.  I enclose you a list of compared prices.  I opened the sample mattress and found it was filled with fibre, although the specification was for half fibre and half hair.  So far, only one sample has been sent in.  I have sent you a sample of the shawls, which you will see for yourself are useless. The tweed, of which I have also sent a sample, you will notice is only single width at 3/9 per yard, while ours is 56 inches at 3/10½.  The quilts, which are supplied at 8/6 each, are only 54 inches by 69 inches and weigh 33 ozs. against ours at 8/10 each, 60 inches by 80 inches, forty ounces.  The quilts purchased by this institution are English manufacture.  The blankets, of which I have sent you one, have been delivered, but I do not think the sheep have suffered very much in the supply of the blankets to this institution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a sample of the return submitted in respect of a certain institution. Surely, the people for whom these goods are supplied are entitled to have the very best articles money can buy, and at the cheapest price.  If the Department is at any time inefficient, if they purchase goods that can be bought cheaper or better, there is an opportunity here of dealing with the Minister and of criticising him in respect to the Department.  I would like to case the mind of Deputy Good in respect of the cost of this institution.  It is in existence now for about three years; it is in its fourth year, and the cost is known.  It is, I think, £4,000 per annum.  In the first year of its existence, from the most careful calculations that can be made, a saving to the country, in respect of purchases, has been effected of something like £100,000, and, apart from other advantages, it has secured the purchase of Irish manufacture as against foreign manufacture. and it enabled certain goods to be manufactured here that were not previously manufactured here.</P>

      <P>It will be remembered that by Act No. 36 of 1923 a Judicial Commission with very extensive powers was set up to ratify and enforce decrees properly given by the Dáil Eireann Courts, to correct mistakes, if any, made by these courts, and to conclude the hearing of cases which were left unfinished when the authority of the Dáil Eireann Courts was withdrawn.  This first Act did not deal at all with Land Settlement cases.  The work under this first Act has been practically completed, and the figures are perhaps of some interest. 4,961 decrees have been registered, i.e., 1,657 of Dáil Parish Courts, 2,808 of Dáil District Courts, 486 of the Dáil Circuit Courts, and 10 of the Dáil Supreme Courts.  There remain some appeals to be heard and some warrants to be issued, and the papers generally require to be codified and indexed, so far as that process has been postponed owing to pressure of more urgent work Broadly speaking, however, all that can be done by the Commission, under the Act of 1923, will have been done by the end of March.  It is impossible that any new cases should arise, as the date for registration has long passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be asked why it is necessary to transfer the authority of the Commissioners at all, why the Commission should not simply be allowed to expire and leave no successor.  It is, however, necessary that the powers of the Commissioners should be preserved in some manner for an indefinite time, as it will be readily understood that some of the cases dealt with are of such a nature that they cannot ever be said to be definitely completed&mdash;a perpetual injunction against trespass, for instance, <Col N="152" /> would be one example of what I mean&mdash; and in general it will be clear that it is not enough that the decisions of the Commissioners should be on record.  It is also necessary that there should some permanent authority, authorised to enforce these decisions one year hence, or ten years hence, if necessary. The proper authority is the one proposed in the Bill, the High Court of Justice.  So far then as the original work of the Commission is concerned the position is briefly that that work will be completed before the 31st March, 1925, and it is proposed that the High Court shall inherit the powers of the Commission in order to prevent the decisions of the Commission from becoming inoperative owing to the absence of any enforcing authority.</P>
    <P>Another and an even more important reason for the transfer to the High Court of the powers of the Commissioners presents itself when the Land Settlement aspect of the Commission is considered.  As I have stated, the Act which set up the Commission&mdash; No. 36 of 1923&mdash;gave the Commission no jurisdiction in Land Settlement cases, and what I have said up to this point, as to the work of the Commission, has no reference to Land Settlement cases.  It is not necessary to state again here the reasons which led to the original decision to omit Land Settlement cases from the first Act, nor the reasons which led subsequently to a reversal of that decision.  Those matters were before the Dáil when the Amending Act was introduced.  By that Act&mdash;No. 32 of 1924, enacted in July last&mdash;the powers of the Commissioners were extended to cover Land Settlement cases.  A date was fixed, the 14th November last, up to which applications might be received for the registration of Land Settlement decrees. About 100 applications were received, of which about fifty appear, so far as they have yet been examined, to be cases in which there is at least a <i>prima facie</i> case for registration, and about twenty have been registered. The period for application having expired, it is therefore known definitely that the Land Settlement aspect has resolved itself into the examination of these applications for registration of <Col N="153" /> decrees or orders of Land Settlement Courts, the registering of such as are found to be <i>prima facic</i> in order, the hearing of appeals against such registration and the enforcement of the registered decrees.  This work is certain to be spread over a considerable period and to necessitate the employment of a staff exceeding, both in numbers and technical knowledge, the small staff which is at present engaged on the Commission.  Hitherto the Commission has dealt with cases where the question involved was generally whether A. owed B. a definite sum of money, or what damages should properly be paid by A. to B. in respect of some injury done to B.  In these cases the Court could come rapidly to a decision and the under-sheriff could enforce the decision. if necessary, by the simple process of seizure.  The typical Land Settlement cases are on a very different footing.</P>
    <P>Questions arise of enquiries into dealings with trust property extending over several years and lands have to be inspected and divided.  It was clearly realised when the Amending Act of July last was passed, that the Commission would be unable to carry through those cases unless its existence were prolonged and its staff strengthened, and the reason why in face of these considerations the business was imposed on the Commission was that it was desirable to act quickly.  The High Court was in a state of transition and it was thought that the best course was to allow the Commission, with its experience of other Dáil Court work, to make a preliminary survey of the field, to decide any urgent questions, and then, when the probable scope of the business was known and the more immediate difficulties solved or postponed, to transfer the work to the High Court so far as the work was judicial, and to the Land Commission so far as the machinery side&mdash;inspecting and valuing&mdash;was concerned.  That is, in fact, the effect of the present Bill and the course followed appears to have been the best that could have been adopted.</P>
    <P>Summarising, this is a Bill, the object of which is to put an end to the existence of the Dáil Eireann Courts (Winding Up) Commission as a separate <Col N="154" /> court as from the 1st April, 1925, by transferring to the High Court of Justice the powers now vested in the Commission.  The business transferred falls into two sections&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  the decrees of the ordinary Dáil Courts, and</P>
    <P>(2)  the decrees of the Land Settlement Courts.</P>
    <P>The former business has been almost finished and what is being transferred to the High Court on that side is a mass of records in good order.  On the other hand, only the surface of the Land Settlement work has been touched and the work taken over on this side will occupy the Land Commission for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>I may perhaps claim for the Government that it has fully carried out its obligations towards litigants in the old Dáil Courts.  No person who has not actually seen the records of these courts as they came into our custody can easily realise the task that was inherited in this respect.  It was our duty to reduce these records into order and to solve as best we could the formidable difficulty which inevitably arose from the fact that for more than a year two opposing sets of courts, neither recognising the jurisdiction of the other, were in full swing, and that we inherited both sets of courts.  We may claim.  I think, to have attacked this problem with a certain amount of resolution.  The Saorstát Constitution had not been in force for nine months before a Judicial Commission with full statutory powers was at work on the problem, a Commission of four, two of whom were judges of the Dáil Supreme Courts and the remaining two of whom are judges of the Circuit Court.  These Commissioners and their successors not only held court in Dublin almost continuously during the last 18 months, but went out on several circuits, and there is no place in the Saorstát so remote that its inhabitants were not afforded a fair opportunity of appearing before the Commissioners. All that was, of course, an obvious duty on the part of the Government. but I am perhaps entitled to point out that these things were not done without some expenditure and without <Col N="155" /> some organisation, and that they were done, or at least commenced, at a time when we might have pleaded with some show of reason that we had very little money to spend and very many <Col N="156" /> urgent calls on whatever organising capacity was at our disposal.  I move the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

    <P>In moving the motion before the House it is necessary that I should examine to some extent the history of the subject, both in this country and in England, and explain the present position in the Saorstát.  This has already been done to a very considerable extent in the careful report of the Joint Committee on Standing Orders dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>In England prior to the year 1857 the Courts had no power to dissolve the Sacrament of Marriage.  The Ecclesiastical Courts, as then existing, had a limited jurisdiction in connection with matrimonial matters.  They could grant decrees for divorce <i>a mensa et thoro,</i> and give declarations of nullity of marriage on the grounds of impotence in one or other of the parties, existing at the date of the marriage. The Courts had certain other powers in connection with matrimonial matters, such as the granting of Orders for the restitution of conjugal rights, to which it is not necessary for me to refer.  A decree for divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> was merely a decree for separation from bed and board.  It did not dissolve the bond of matrimony, and did not entitle persons so separated to re-marry. The only way in which the bond of matrimony could be dissolved was by Act of Parliament, and a great many Acts of this nature were, in fact, passed.</P>
    <P>In 1857 a statute was passed known as the Matrimonial Cause Act, 1857. which applied only to England.  It established a Court known as the Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes, and transferred to that Court the jurisdiction previously exercised by the Ecclesiastical Courts in respect of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro,</i> and other matrimonial causes.  It further gave the new Court jurisdiction on the grounds mentioned in the Act, to pronounce a decree declaring the marriage to be dissolved, and gave power to the Court to make provision in its decree with respect to the custody, maintenance and education of the children of the marriage, and with respect to the settlement of property, for the benefit of the innocent party and of the children.  This Act obviated in England all necessity for having recourse to Parliament in matrimonial causes.</P>
    <P>The Ecclesiastical Courts continued to function in Ireland until the year 1870, when the Matrimonial Causes Marriage Law (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1870, was passed.  That Act established a new court for Ireland, known as the Court for Matrimonial Causes and Matters, and transferred to that Court the jurisdiction then vested in the Ecclesiastical Courts in respect of divorce, <i>a mensa et thoro,</i> suits of nullity of marriage, and other matrimonial <Col N="157" /> matters.  It did not in any way enlarge the pre-existing jurisdiction of the Ecclesiastical Courts, but, on the contrary, provided that the new court should proceed to act and give relief on principles and rules which should be as nearly as possible conformable to the principles and rules on which the Ecclesiastical Courts had theretofore acted, and given relief.  That jurisdiction was subsequently transferred to the King's Bench Division (Probate and Matrimonial) of the High Court of Justice in Ireland, and is now vested, so far as the Saorstát is concerned, in the High Court set up by the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.</P>
    <P>As I stated before, the jurisdiction of the Ecclesiastical Courts was not in any way enlarged, and the courts in Ireland had no power to grant a decree for divorce <i>a vinculo matrimonii,</i> or, in other words, to dissolve the bond of matrimony, nor had it power to make any orders in connection with the settlement of property, or in respect of the maintenance, education and custody of children save in so far as the children were made wards of court.  Persons desiring a divorce <i>a vinculo matrimonii,</i> or relief with reference to property or custody of children were compelled to promote a private Bill in Parliament. Such Bills were passed in the Irish Parliament down to the Act of Union, and subsequently in the Parliament at Westminster down to the establishment of the Saorstát.  The Standing Orders of the British Parliament dealing with divorce provided that before such a Bill could be presented the person claiming such relief should have proved his right thereto in court, and obtained from the court a decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro.</i></P>
    <P>At the present time there are no Standing Orders in the Saorstát relating to matrimonial matters.  This does not prevent the introduction of Private Bills dealing with such matters.  On the contrary, it leaves it open to persons to introduce such Bills without complying with the formalities and safeguards which such Standing Orders would require.  It is, therefore, essential that Standing Orders on this subject should be prepared.  In order <Col N="158" /> to enable the Joint Committee satisfactorily to prepare the necessary Standing Orders, it is necessary that the House should come to a decision on the question of divorce <i>a vinculo matrimonii.</i> On this subject there are different points of view, but I have no doubt but that I am right in saying that the majority of people of this country regard the bond of marriage as a sacramental bond which is incapable of being dissolved.  I personally hold this view.  I consider that the whole fabric of our social organisation is based upon the sanctity of the marriage bond and that anything that tends to weaken the binding efficacy of that bond to that extent strikes at the root of our social life.  For these reasons I move the motion in the form in which it appears upon the Orders of the Day.</P>
    <P>It may be that in the future, and possibly the near future, legislation may be introduced to confer upon the Courts jurisdiction when granting decrees of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro,</i> to make provision for the children of the marriage and in respect of property. Such legislation would probably have the effect of relieving the Oireachtas of all matrimonial business, but it would not obviate the necessity for some Standing Orders to provide for cases in which such decrees are given from the date of the establishment of the Saorstát down to the date when such legislation may come into effect.</P>
    <P>A well-known periodical recently stated that:&mdash;&ldquo;A Joint Committee of the Seanad and Dáil was set up to advise what facilities should be granted for divorce, and failed to agree on any recommendation.&rdquo;  The Joint Committee which made the report was not a committee set up specially to consider divorce, but is the Joint Committee on Standing Orders (Private Business).  This committee did not set out to consider what facilities should be granted for divorce.  The object which they had in view was to put the issue as to divorce in as concrete a form as possible before both Houses&mdash; distinguishing types of Private Bills, coming under the title of Bills for Matrimonial Matters, and for which Standing Orders would be required; setting out the history and state of the <Col N="159" /> law with regard to such Bills in Great Britain and Ireland, both before the Treaty and since, and finally asking a definite decision as to whether the introduction of Bills of divorce <i>a vinculo matrimonii</i> was to be permitted.</P>

      <P>I rise with very great reluctance indeed to speak on this motion, but I feel it a personal duty to express my own views about it.  Further, at a meeting yesterday, at which some Independent members came together to talk over the matter, it was decided that one of them should express the views of those members, and, unfortunately, the lot fell upon me.  I feel the responsibility attaching to that, and can only set against it, if I may take that position, that there will certainly be more consideration paid to what I say than if I were expressing my own feelings.  Personally, with reference to the actual question of divorce.  I would like to make my own feelings quite clear.  I would personally hold, I think, just as strong views as the President as to the sanctity of marriage, and my own inclination would, undoubtedly, go against the setting up of any facilities to obtain divorce, but there are very hard cases, and I do not feel that in a matter of conscience of that kind it would be permissible for me personally to say what view other persons ought to take on that question of divorce.  As I have said, my inclinations are in favour of the motion, but we feel&mdash;certainly I feel&mdash;that this motion opens up wider questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the greatest reluctance to utter any word in this House which can be interpreted as having anything of a religious character, but I fear I cannot avoid saying that I regard this motion as one which will have the effect of imposing on the whole population the religious views, in respect of divorce, of the majority of the population.  I have often said in this House, and I have a strong conviction that fair treatment of all sections of the community was the wish and aim and actual action of the present Government.  I may, perhaps, <Col N="160" /> be allowed to say, expressing my own opinion for what it is worth, that I think they have acted up to the words, which I may be allowed to quote, of Arthur Griffith.  They were great words.  He was referring to his action in discussing with those who were then called &ldquo;Southern Unionists&rdquo; a solution of the problems that were then before them.  I might make a long quotation, but I will content myself with quoting a few words from that speech.  Probably members of the House will recollect it.  It was made when the Dáil of that time was debating the Treaty in January, 1922.  He said:&mdash;&ldquo;If we are to start as an Irish Nation, we want to start on these lines of obliterating all that kept us apart before.  If we are to have different parties in the Irish nation we do not want those parties ranged on the lines of pro-English versus pro-Irish.  We want them ranged on national lines, and the person who thinks that you can make an Irish nation, and make it successfully function, with eight hundred thousand of our countrymen in the North up against us and four hundred thousand of our countrymen in the South opposed to us, is living in a fool's paradise. You want every Irishman in this Irish nation.  You want all of them, and the way we are going to get them is to ensure for them absolute justice and fair play in the Irish nation.&rdquo; These were great words.  I believe that the Government have endeavoured to act up to them.</P>
    <P>I would like to supplement them by recalling to the minds of Deputies words which they probably read only last week in a speech delivered by the Most Rev.  Archbishop O'Donnell, a speech for which I have nothing but admiration. I will ask the House to pardon me if I make two quotations from that speech.  They are worth quoting. &ldquo;Love of Ireland is not the perquisite of any one section of Irishmen.  It is a universal possession among them.  By Ireland I mean the people even more than the island.  Governments have special obligations to protect the rights of minorities within their borders. That obligation holds in respect of the sparse minority in the twenty-six counties, and it holds similarly in respect <Col N="161" /> of a large minority in the six counties.  It is the duty of the Government in both parts of the country to see that the minority has fair play in education, local government, and public life.&rdquo; Whilst I have believed, and I hope to continue to believe, that the Government desire to carry these principles into effect, I cannot but feel that in this motion I see the first sign, I will not say that it is a prelude to others, of what is not fair play to all sections of the community.  It is imposing on a section, in a way which I contend is not permissible, the views of the majority of the population.  By our presence here since the Dáil met, having accepted the Treaty, I think we have shown that we have accepted to the full the principle that majority rule must prevail in all matters, civil and political.  Into the extension of that principle to matters, whether appertaining to matters of religion or the rights of conscience, I cannot go.</P>
    <P>I take my stand in all such matters, wherever a matter of conscience comes in, and I think Independent members wish me to say so on their behalf, that on such matters an individual cannot submit to control by the majority, but must obey the dictates of his own conscience. In this case, that conscience of the majority proposes that divorce is not to be allowed in any circumstances whatever.  I admit that, but I say you cannot extend that and say that that feeling, as a matter of conscience on the part of the majority, has any effect whatever upon the conscience of any individual of the Saorstát. So far as my own conscience goes, I believe that I would have just as strong feeling as the President on this matter, but whether I would have that, or whether he would have that, or whether every person but one in the Saorstát would have that, I say that it would not interfere in the slightest with the conscience of a single individual living in the Saorstát.  I do not think that we can be too strong on that point.  It is one of the essential principles of our Constitution&mdash;I will quote from Article 8, which, I think I cannot be too strong in referring to &mdash;that freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion <Col N="162" /> are guaranteed to every citizen.  It has been the case in the past that those whose conscience permitted them to take advantage of such privileges as there were, were able to do so by a certain bye-law in accordance with the civil law and were able, in a perfectly legal way, to obtain power to re-marry. I do not want to discuss the question as to whether that is right or wrong, but, I say that if we pass any motion which will remove that privilege from the power of any person whose conscience will permit him to do that, we are encroaching on his rights as a citizen.  I wish to lay my principal stress on liberty of thought and independence of conscience.  I think it is also a matter for consideration what the effect of this motion will be, if it is passed.</P>
    <P>I cannot pretend to put before the Dáil all the facts, but I would like certainly to mention some of them.  One would be that if a man is rich enough, if he is a citizen of the Free State, if he considers himself entitled to divorce according to his own conscience, he will be able to leave the Free State, set up or obtain a domicile elsewhere and, after a certain short time has elapsed, he will be able to secure divorce outside the boundaries of the Free State.  The first point in that connection that would occur to me is this: that we are putting outside the sphere of action of the Free State the determination as to what such a person ought or ought not be permitted to do. All he has to do is to go and live outside the Free State, put himself under the control of someone else, and, if his conscience allows him, get a divorce. That is to say, we are leaving it to other people to settle as to whether a person of this State is or is not entitled to the divorce he claims.  Supposing he does domicile himself elsewhere and obtains a divorce, if he ever returns to this State as an unmarried man, or if he marries abroad and returns as a married man, has it been considered what his position will be and also that of his children, if any? How would that marriage abroad stand in relation to the laws of the Free State?  I think very grave legal questions will arise if this motion is passed into law.  Further, the fact that a man can go and obtain a domicile abroad <Col N="163" /> puts him into a different position from that of a woman.  An aggrieved woman could not obtain a domicile abroad without her husband's consent, so that she would be put under a disability as compared with the man.  A man will have to have plenty of money, but, if he had enough of money, he could do what I have stated.  A woman could not do so, as, without the husband's consent, she would not be able to domicile herself abroad.  I contend that is putting one citizen in an unfavourable position as compared with another.</P>
    <P>The passing of this motion will raise up one more barrier against a possible union between the north of Ireland and the south of Ireland, not because, I believe, they are more disposed to divorce than we are&mdash;as I am glad to say there are very few cases of divorce in Ireland.  There are, however, a few, and it is not really a question of divorce or not.  It is a question as to whether the passing of this motion will, or will not, leave the individual the liberty of conscience which our Constitution gives.  I have spoken with the feeling that a strong protest against this motion was necessary. Whether that protest will have any effect or not I cannot say.  Even at this stage, I hope the President will see sufficient force in the arguments I have put before the Dáil to, at any rate, reconsider this matter, which I regard as an exceedingly grave one, and fraught with very serious consequences to the freedom of the individual in this State.</P>

      <P>Although I do not worship at the same altar as the majority&mdash;I believe I belong to the same denomination as Deputy Thrift&mdash;the late Established Church here&mdash;I hold with the majority of my fellow-countrymen that the tie of marriage should be considered more than a legal one, as binding, and as meaning something higher. Deputy Thrift stated that there are very few dissolutions of marriage in this country.  To a great extent I put that down to the fact that there have not been facilities for getting divorce. In other words, the difficulty of getting a Bill through Parliament was so great that many people who would have <Col N="164" /> sought divorce thought better of it, made up their differences, and the cases were not brought before the public, thus saving a great deal of scandal and unpleasantness.</P>
      <P>In other countries divorce is only too common, such as in England or America, where the result has been to loosen the tie of marriage.  In England, before the law with regard to marriage had become as loose as it is at present, applications for dissolution of marriage were not a tithe of what they are now.  In many cases, since the war, they have had to put on extra judges to hear an accumulation of scandals that come before the courts.  America is even a worse example.  In different States there are different laws, one possibly looser than the other, giving facilities for the dissolution of marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion that can have nothing but the most deleterious effect on the social and, I might say, the economic life of any country in which looseness of the marriage tie prevails.  Deputy Thrift says it is a curbing of freedom to prevent people having facilities to get divorce in this country.  I say that freedom may degenerate into licence.  I am not one of those who, although I recognise the hardness of many cases, would, for two or three cases, subject the country to a looseness of the marriage tie, which, after all, is a national safeguard.  It concerns not only the present generation but future generations and their status. I, certainly, will not vote for any law that would loosen the marriage tie.  Let us look at England.  There we see hundreds and thousands of those cases going on and ever increasing, whereas in Ireland such a thing is practically unknown.  We may take it that it is the giving of facilities for loosening the marriage tie which has increased the demand for dissolution of marriage.  I will never give a hand in that.  Ireland has been almost completely free from anything of this sort.  We have still got the power of judicial separation, which is what is ordinarily meant by divorce in this country and that, I think, is sufficient for anyone who holds anything approaching Christian principles <Col N="165" /> Of course, I recognise that there are extremely hard cases of habitual drunkenness, of insanity and of physical incapacity and I have always held that in a case of that kind the marriage <i>per se</i> ought to be annulled.  It is not a legal marriage.  Where it is shown clearly that these three incapacities existed before marriage, and that after marriage those incapacities or defects were hereditary, the marriage should be dissolved, but for no other reason. I hold that marriage is a sacrament and should be held as such, and that no accident or disease that may occur after marriage should be used as a means to dissolve what is meant for life and should be held for life.  When a marriage takes place it is for better or for worse.  It seems to me that in many countries that is not held.  I hope it will never be the same in this country. If it should be, I hold the country will go down just as those other countries have.</P>
    <P>There are certain legal questions that have to be settled, which might be held as a nullification of marriage, but that is another question.  The question of children, and all that sort of thing, are matters that can be settled by the law. The question before us is the question of dissolution of marriage, which I hold to be sacred, and which cannot be dissolved. As I said before, I hope that will never be the case in this country. Deputy Thrift says that if we adopt this resolution, the North will never come in.  He assumes that the people of the North as a body are in favour of divorce.</P>

      <P>Otherwise I do not see what the Deputy's argument is.  They will, he said, consider it as one more injustice. I think, from what I have seen of Northern people, that a big number of them are as much against divorce as we are, and I hold that it is not a matter that will prevent us from coming together.  In any event, I think, notwithstanding what other countries may do, that we should do what we consider right and best, not only for the people here to-day, but for the generations that are to come.  Marriage <Col N="166" /> in this country should be held to be indissoluble, and I hope that will always be so, no matter what other countries may do.</P>

      <P>I suppose this question is for a layman or non-theologian about the most difficult question he could speak on.  But I think it is necessary for me to say a word or two entirely for myself, and to say that I do not, on several grounds, agree with the arguments which Deputy Thrift put forward.  I cannot understand the argument of conscience in this matter. We are in fact dealing with a state of things which means that there is no law at the present time in force in this country allowing for the dissolution of marriage. Deputy Thrift's argument, I think, really would be valid as an argument for the enactment of a divorce law, but it is hardly valid when he quotes conscience in a case where the question is to allow Bills for enactment to be brought into the Legislature.</P>
      <P>The President has indicated the history of this question.  He has shown&mdash; I think we are generally aware of it&mdash; that there is no law operating at present, which allows dissolution of marriage. It has been suggested that it should be made possible here as it has been possible hitherto for the Legislature to enact special laws to deal with separate contracts, each separate case to be dealt with on its merits, and a special enactment to be passed by Private Bill legislation to deal with those cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that in the consideration of this question in that light, the only point is the legal contract&mdash;the contract that has been entered into between two parties of a legal, civil character.  It is proposed to allow legislation to dissolve and abrogate that contract, and to make legal certain consequences of that contract.  I am afraid I have to look with a little cynicism on this question, and I feel there can be no question of conscience in respect of a person being deprived of an opportunity to get a special Act passed for himself through the Legislature to annual what is to him a civil contract. That is not a question of conscience. Would the individual conscience not <Col N="167" /> come into play, nay, to a very much greater degree would it not be more sincerely and honestly a matter of conscience to the persons who were asked to consent to that enactment being passed?  Would the aggrieved person be benefited&mdash;would his conscience be in any way relieved if he were allowed to come to the Parliament of the nation and ask for a special enactment on his behalf and it was refused on the grounds of conscience?  I cannot see that conscience comes in, and I cannot see that there is an abrogation or act contrary to Article 8 of the Constitution in the proposition of the President. I said I am afraid I had to be a little cynical in this matter, and I feel the issue is not a question of conscience, but a question of property and the inheritance of property.  In matters relating to property rights, I am inclined very strongly to the view that the general will of the community has to prevail.  Where you have 95 per cent. of the people of a clear opinion, and as against that perhaps .01 per cent. of the other 5 per cent. of the contrary opinion, the vast body of opinion of the community must prevail. We should not run the risk, for the sake of that .01 per cent. who may feel aggrieved, of alienating 95 per cent.  If it were a question of conscience I would put .01 against 99 odd per cent., and let conscience stand against the world, but I say this is not a question of conscience at all.  There is nothing in the law to prevent a man who has sought a divorce if he wishes to go and live with another woman, from going to live with her, only you do not legalise it, and you do not legalise the offspring. That is what is sought apparently by those who advocate the enlargement of the powers of divorce.</P>
    <P>I want to raise an objection to this resolution on quite different grounds. I think it has been badly devised and I think it may have consequences which the President has not foreseen. If he has foreseen them, and despite that foresight proceeds with the resolution, I think he is going in a direction which he may have grounds to regret at a future time.  It seems to me that if we adopt this resolution as it at present <Col N="168" /> stands we are seeking by the resolution of one House of the Oireachtas to insert a prohibitory clause in the Constitution.  We have not in the Constitution deprived the Oireachtas of the right to legislate on any matter in respect of matrimony.  The President is now seeking that we shall pass a resolution instructing the officials of the Oireachtas to refuse to receive a Bill dealing with a legislative matter. Thereby I say we are tying our hands and depriving the Oireachtas of certain authority which it has under the Constitution. The procedure that is referred to in the motion deals with Standing Orders relating to private business, Private Bills relating to matrimony, but the distinction between Private and Public Bills is more a matter of convenience than anything else.  They become Acts of the Oireachtas whether they have gone through the Private Bill procedure or the Public Bill procedure.  We have adopted Standing Orders which say that every Bill promoted for the particular interests or benefit of any person shall be treated as a Private Bill.  That is a matter of convenience for the Oireachtas and does not alter the character of the Bill when it becomes an Act.  I think, you, sir, have laid it down publicly more than once that you would not rule whether a motion brought to the Dáil was within the Constitution or outside the Constitution.  I think you have ruled rightly.  That is not a matter for you to decide upon.  What we are doing now, if we pass this motion in its present form is to say, not to the Ceann Comhairle, but to the Clerk, that he shall not receive the proposed enactments for consideration by the Oireachtas. You are placing it in the power of the Clerk or official to say: &ldquo;This is a matter I will not present.&rdquo; We are tying our hands by this form of resolution in respect of what, so far as the Constitution goes, we have a perfect right to do&mdash;to deal with a matter of law relating to matrimony.  It may be and I think is desirable that we should not make divorce easy or this complete divorce, spoken of, possible.  I am quite prepared to support that proposition, but I am distinctly against a motion which deprives the Oireachtas of power <Col N="169" /> to legislate in connection with any matter affecting the peace, order and good government of this country.</P>
    <P>Let me illustrate the point in another way.  It is within the knowledge of Deputies that when the Constitution was being considered, there were proposals made respecting water-power and the retention of water-power by the State; not to allow&mdash;to make constitutional provision against allowing&mdash; the leasing-out of water-power for any extended period to private companies.</P>
    <P>That was not embodied in the Constitution. Supposing we were to pass a resolution saying to the officer who has to deal with Private Bills that he must not receive any Bill of a private nature that proposes to take over water-power, we would be doing, by resolution, what the Constitution refuses to insert.  There is, in Article 11 a proposal regarding lands and waters and public rights&mdash;natural resources&mdash; and it winds up by saying: &ldquo;provided no such lease or licence may be made over a term exceeding ninety-nine years.&rdquo; If the President's proposition is taken as a precedent, the Dáil or Seanad might pass a resolution instructing that no private measure exceeding in existence twenty-five years should be brought forward.  It could not then come before the Dáil or Seanad.  It would be amending the Constitution by means of a resolution of either House.  That is a bad and a wrong course to adopt, and I am sure the majority of the Dáil would not like to see it brought into effect.  To what I am saying it may be retorted that this proposal only deals with Private Bill legislation and that we are not depriving ourselves of the right or authority to deal with the law relating to matrimony by legislation.  If that is suggested in reply to my criticism, I would suggest that we ought to insert in this motion some words to the effect that this would be without prejudice to the authority of the Oireachtas to legislate by the method of Public Bills in respect to any, or a particular, matter affecting peace, order or good government.</P>

I approve of the general purpose outlined in the President's motion, but I would rather that the rights of the citizen should be exercised, with the sure and certain expectation, if not hope, that any such Bill of Divorce would be inevitably defeated. I would take the risk of allowing the citizen who wanted to promote such a Bill to run that risk, rather than that we should, by a deliberate act, endeavour <Col N="171" /> to prevent the Oireachtas from legislating on any matter within our competence.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that to talk of liberty of conscience in connection with this matter is, as has been indicated by other speakers, a misuse of terms.  It does not help us to consider the matter to talk in any extreme language on the points we are dealing with.  For my part, I would like to deal only with the social side of the question and to look upon the matter as a social problem.  I think few people will deny that in modern times the extension of divorce facilities has become a great evil in many countries.  It is clear, too, that where divorce facilities exist, there is a steady pressure for their extension; that is, a pressure which has failed to meet with success in few countries.  On the other hand, I think it will be admitted that the extension of divorce facilities has not led to any social benefit or any greater happiness amongst people; it has really brought about unsettlement, instability and unhappiness.  Leaving out the religious question altogether, I would be prepared, looking at the matter merely as a social question, to say that the State, legislating for good government and for prosperity and happiness amongst the people, ought to arrange that facilities for divorce would not exist.  That might hit individuals hard, but it would be better that individuals should suffer than that greater suffering should fall upon the whole community. Any suffering that might fall upon individuals through failure to get divorce from the bonds of matrimony, as distinct from the limited type of divorce available, would not, in reality, be a serious matter.  Deputy Thrift dealt with certain minor aspects of the effects of this resolution.  I think the passing of the resolution will make very little change.  It will not prevent anybody who would have got divorce before from getting divorce now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is certain that no Bill would be passed in the Dáil if the consciences of Deputies were opposed to it.  I believe Deputies would be opposed to such a measure.  They would <Col N="172" /> vote against any Bill of that sort, and consequently no Bill would be passed. Even if such Bills were to be passed, we could not prevent the rich from seeking domicile outside the country, and getting divorces through courts elsewhere, if they felt that would be a cheaper and more satisfactory way than by getting it by means of a Bill in this House.  I think the difficulties that Deputy Thrift anticipates will arise from this resolution, are no greater than the difficulties that would have arisen otherwise.  I do not believe, as somebody has suggested, that this is going to make partition permanent. That is trying to lift the matter into a question of high politics&mdash; trying to make it a big political question, as distinct from a social or religious question, as it was looked upon before.  I do not believe there is any great body of opinion in favour of it. I believe, as Deputy Johnson has pointed out, that there was no sort of constitutional right to divorce.  Even if there were, it is, and can be, regarded by any Parliament as a social matter with which it is well within its competence to deal.  I do not believe there is much in the point Deputy Johnson raised.  It is better there should be no facilities for bringing in certain Bills than that people should be put to the expense of introducing Bills which are sure to be defeated. This resolution will avoid having people, perhaps in extreme cases, using all sorts of special efforts to get Bills through somehow.  In the circumstances, I believe it is better to have this resolution, although there is a sort of general validity in the argument Deputy Johnson put forward.</P>

      <P>I have very little to say on this motion.  As the seconder of the motion, I would like to put very briefly my own point of view with regard to it.  It seems to me that it raises one issue only, and it raises that issue quite clearly, and that is whether or not this Dáil believes that it is within its competence to consider a Bill which purports to dissolve the marriage tie so that the parties will be free to re-marry.  Now, as one member of the Dáil I do not believe that.  I believe that the great majority of the Dáil does not believe that.  I believe that if that is so, that it is a proper thing for the Dáil, by means of this resolution, or by some such means, to make that clear.  To put it no higher, it is a saving of the time of the Oireachtas.  It is better that we should spend some little time in discussion and consideration of a resolution like this than that Bills should be coming before the Dáil of a nature that the majority of the Dáil would believe that they were not competent to consider, and were not entitled to pass.  I have been trying to visualise here while this discussion was proceeding what the position would be if we passed any such resolution, and if, in fact, Bills of divorce <i>a vinculo matrimonii</i> were to come before the Dáil.  You would have one section of the Dáil discussing Bills of that kind on their merits, and taking it that the decision was to turn on an examination of the facts, and another section, as I believe the majority, holding the view that they were not entitled to consider cases of the kind on their merits at all, or entitled to advert to what the attendant facts were, but that they were in conscience debarred from the consideration of such a Bill.  They would not hold that the Dáil was competent to dissolve marriage in a way that would leave the parties free to re-marry. Now, if I am right that there is in this present Dáil a majority of Deputies who hold the view that they are debarred from considering the merits of any such Bill or considering the facts of the case with which they purported to deal, then, I think it is much better <Col N="174" /> that we should take a matter like this in the abstract by means of a resolution of this kind, rather than simply leave things alone and have a farce perpetrated from time to time.  The issue is raised here, and Deputies who believe that we are in conscience excluded from considering Divorce Bills of the particular kind mentioned here, will have an opportunity of recording their views on the matter.</P>
      <P>To act otherwise and to allow Bills of that kind to go before the Dáil, would seem to be open to the interpretation that the fate of any such Bill would be a matter of the merits of any particular case, and would turn upon the examination and investigation of the facts in a particular case.  As I see it, with the majority of us that is not the position.  Our view would be, simply, that this is a matter outside the competence of the Dáil, a matter that the majority of the Dáil would be excluded in conscience from considering. That issue comes up clearly in this resolution. I do not quite understand Deputy Johnson's point.  It does seem to me that if the complexion of the Dáil were to alter, and if a Dáil were to come into existence containing a majority of members who did not feel that they were excluded from considering Bills of this kind on their merits, with advertence to the attendant facts and circumstances, all that would be required to meet that situation would be an alteration in the form of the Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely it is simply a commonsense matter, if this present Dáil contains a majority of members who feel that it is not merely a question of the merits of particular cases, but a question of conscience with them, and that they are not free to consider Bills of a particular nature, that it is better that the matter should be disposed of in the way in which the President proposes to dispose of it, by test on a resolution of this kind.  We would then be saved the farce and anomaly of some members of the Dáil purporting to discuss a Bill on its merits, while others, probably the majority, would simply feel that, utterly apart from the facts or merits or circumstances of the case, there was <Col N="175" /> a consideration which debarred them from supporting such a Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Thrift, speaking, as he said, for the first time, I think, on behalf of a united independent party, made a very moving speech in opposition to this motion.  I have no doubt that Deputy Thrift was speaking on behalf of people who have good and well-founded conscientious objections to this motion.  But Deputy Thrift appears to overlook the fact that if unlimited facilities are given to people to loosen the bond of marriage, it is the people who have no conscience who will be in the majority in looking for such liberty and freedom, and not the very few that the Deputy, I have no doubt, speaks on behalf of.  Deputies could make very moving appeals on behalf of their constituents, or any particular section of the community, or individuals who have conscientious objections to this, that or the other.  I can imagine, for instance, a citizen foolishly thinking that his conscience compelled him to object to every law that is made in a Parliamentary institution of this kind.  I could not imagine Deputy Thrift in a case of that kind coming forward and saying that he felt that the law should ignore and overlook a citizen of that type.  I would rather he inclined to think that Deputy Thrift in a case of that kind would say that the individual concerned should take the consequences of his foolish thinking.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I can regard myself as one who has rather an elastic conscience, but I feel in a matter of this kind that I can vote for the motion although the wording of it appears to be undesirable and such as may create a very undesirable precedent.  From what I have read of divorce cases across the channel they appear to be brought by people who have no conscience of any kind.  I feel, therefore, that we should not follow the example on the other side of the channel and create unlimited facilities for a section of the citizens who would follow in the footsteps of people in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Thrift made some serious <Col N="176" /> statements&mdash;although the Minister for Finance appears to regard them as minor statements&mdash;with regard to the likely effects of the passing of this resolution. He indicated that its passing would, in his opinion, mean that there was going to be no unity with the Six Counties.  I am not able to visualise the price which we may eventually be called upon to pay for the friendship and co-operation of the Six Counties, but I would rather not purchase that co-operation and friendship at the risk, as the Deputy's view would indicate, of national dishonour.  Deputy Thrift correctly stated that there are many cases of hardship which would disappear if the law was loose enough.  These cases of general hardship to which he refers are not peculiar to any section of the community.  I would like that the young men and women of this country who are looking forward to marriage would look upon marriage as a journey, limited or unlimited, for which no return tickets are issued, and that when people decide, taking financial and other risks, to undertake that journey, they should undertake it at owner's-risk rate and conditions.</P>
    <P>I did not intend to speak on this matter only that I rather inferred from the speech of Deputy Thrift that the passing of this resolution would convey to him the feeling that the majority of people who happen to hold certain religious views are trying to impose their views upon a minority, who are not in agreement with them.  That is the very last thing I would like to be accused of doing.  It is immaterial to me as an individual what altar a man worships at, and I would not, under any circumstances, like to be accused of imposing my religious views upon any other man, who might think fit to disagree with me.  I hope that the Deputy has exaggerated his view as to the likely effect of the resolution, particularly as regards the Six Counties, as we all look forward in the near future to some kind of a working arrangement with the people there.  I take  to the inference in the Deputy's statement that by voting for this motion I would be endeavouring to force my religious views upon the people for whom he speaks.</P>

      <P>I wish to say one or two words in order to make my position quite clear, because of one issue that has been raised, namely, interference with the liberty of the individual. I had hoped that issue would not be raised, but as it has been raised, I wish to say a few words on it.  As the Minister for Justice has pointed out, it is a question, not so much of the constitutional competence of this Dáil to pass legislation of this kind, as of the moral competence, so far as individual Deputies represent the moral conscience of the Dáil.  I do not exaggerate when I put it this way.  Constitutionally I presume it would be in the competence of the Dáil to pass legislation that all red-headed men should be beheaded, but I do not think it is within the moral competence of the Dáil to pass legislation of that kind. So far as I am expressing my own view, and the views not merely of my co-religionists, but, I believe, also of a large number of those that differ with me on this particular matter, I do not believe it is any more within the competence of the Dáil, or any government, or legislature, to pass legislation for the dissolution of the marriage tie than it is to pass legislation for the beheading of red-headed men.  That is so far as the question of passing general laws legalising divorce is concerned.  I do not think this Dáil can give to judges, by means of general laws, power that I do not believe this legislature morally has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other view of the question is a matter which this particular resolution tries to guard against.  When an individual Bill of Divorce comes before this House, if you read one of these Bills you will see that if you and I take it upon us to vote for the Bill, then we, as members of the Dáil, declare that that particular bond of matrimony is dissolvable.  Remember that we are not compelling others to do things that they think they are not to do.  What is the argument that is now being used?  Is it fair to persuade the majority of the Dáil to take on themselves responsibility for dissolving a particular marriage, say, between A and B?  How a person who does not believe in divorce can take upon himself <Col N="178" /> the responsibility of taking that step of dissolving a marriage, I cannot see, because remember that it is the individual who votes for it dissolves the marriage according to the form of the Bill.  I think the one liberty that is in question is the liberty of conscience of the individual member of the Dáil.  That is the reason I want to deal with that particular point.  The general question has been dealt with by the Minister for Finance and other Ministers.</P>
    <P>There is very little demand for this Bill.  I would be sorry to think that there is any Article in the Constitution which prevents the Dáil from deciding what I believe to be one of the most fundamental questions as regards the moral future of the country.  That there is an Article in the Constitution that would prevent the Dáil from dealing with an issue that affects the whole moral welfare of the country is a matter I do not believe.  I do not believe that that is in the particular Article of the Constitution referred to by Deputy Thrift.  Let me put it in another way. There may be some people who believe in polygamy.  Does it follow because of that that the Dáil ought to legalise polygamy?  There may be a certain number of people who believe that private property should not exist.  Is it because a number of individuals believe in that that the Dáil should abolish private property?  I do not think so.  Remember that there is a very large number of people whose conscience makes them believe that divorce <i>a vinculo matrimonii</i> is simply a step, and if followed by subsequent re-marriage is polygamy.  I do not think there is any Article in the Constitution which compels the Dáil to legalise polygamy.</P>

      <P>I had no intention of taking part in this discussion, and I do not speak with any pleasure on this subject.  I can assure the Dáil that I am opposed to divorce, or rather to re-marriage. I have as strong views as any of my colleagues in the Dáil on the subject of the sanctity of marriage. Still, I hold that there are two voices on the Government side in supporting this motion.  The Minister for Finance asked us to discuss it from the social aspect only.  That I would gladly do <Col N="179" /> as a matter of fact, and could speak at length on it.  On the other hand, the Minister for Justice said that there was no use in discussing it from that point of view at all, because to the majority this was a matter of morals, of dogma, and conscience.</P>
      <P>I am not going into the religious aspect of the matter&mdash;I do not like even to mention it&mdash;but I would like to stress the point that I think was at the back of Deputy Thrift's mind.  There is for the majority of the citizens of the 26 Counties no possibility of the annulment of the sacrament of marriage, but for the very small minority who would choose to take advantage of it, there was the possibility of a dissolution of marriage <i>a vinculo.</i>  Now, by this proposal of ours, it seems to me to be putting that small minority under a disability from which there is no escape. Sometimes, somehow, tragedies do occur, and I do not take it upon myself to judge in these matters, from the religious point of view, but I cannot help saying that the sacrament was not there, and that there was no real marriage. I do not wish to be taken as urging that a Bill for divorce should be brought in.  I would make divorce difficult and almost impossible in this country, so convinced am I of the sanctity of marriage, and of the fact that the social fabric of the country is built up on the sanctity of marriage.  I do not see from what point we are to discuss this motion.  The Minister for Finance says it should be discussed from the social point of view.</P>

      <P>As a vote may be taken on this question, I want to give our point of view on these benches.  We approach the matter from an absolutely disinterested standpoint.  We are not personally interested.  As I understand the position, we are no worse situated now than we were before the Constitution was drawn up, except that before the Treaty those who had plenty of money in this country could go to the British House of Lords and promote a Bill for divorce. That, to my mind, was a luxury for the very wealthy, and it did not reach the mass of the people Deputy Thrift has spoken about.</P>
      <P>By allowing matrimonial Bills to come before this Dáil it would still be a luxury for the few.  It would be no use at all for the mass of the people except you go so far as the English, or even so far as the American model.  I do not want to treat this from the religious point of view, but from the purely civic point of view.  Do we want the American model, I ask.  We are unanimous that we do not want the American model, but if you start once on the road for divorce, who can give us a guarantee as to where we are going to end?  America started on the road, and they are not ended even yet, and God knows, from our point of view, I think they might at least end at their present position.  I think that when this thing does not affect most of the people, we should not introduce facilities for purely wealthy people alone.  As I say, if you once start upon this road you do not know where you are going to end. It would destroy society absolutely.  I believe it has destroyed society in America, where there is no sense of civic responsibility. I heard of a man who went through his eleventh marriage in America&mdash;one every month.  He told a friend once that he would introduce him to one of his weddings some time. I say this is an evil from the civic point of view, and should not be encouraged, and I say that once you start on the road you do not know where you will end.  You may end in the same fashion as the monkeys on the trees.</P>

    <P>This motion is a request for certain information, of a statistical kind, in respect of income tax.  Up to yesterday everybody seemed to be interested in income tax, but now I gather that the President is favourably considering the possibility of the abolition of the income tax altogether.</P>

      <P>If I thought that <Col N="183" /> there was any strong likelihood of the Minister for Finance abolishing income tax in his Budget, this year, I would not proceed any further with this motion.  I cannot say, however, that I am impressed with the probabilities in that direction, and therefore I feel that it is necessary for the proper consideration of any question relating to income tax or reduction of income tax or variation in the incidence of income tax, that we should know where the money comes from and who pays it.  The schedule which is attached to my motion is more or less in the form which has been adopted by the British authorities in respect of their statistical returns.  It may be thought some of the heads do not fit in with available materials, but the Minister can make that right.  I submit that it is essential that the House and the country should know under which head income tax is collected; what number of people there are who pay income tax under the various heads, and to find out, with some regard to accuracy, exactly upon whom, and on what section of the community this income tax, which is complained about, falls with the greatest weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it has been frequently stated that there is only a certain small number of people paying income tax on sums of £100,000 a year or even £10,000 a year.  Very few people, I think, pay income tax on very large annual incomes. These figures, of course, are easily available, and I submit that before we can consider, with any clarity, the problem of income tax and income tax reduction, we should have available the information I seek for in this return. I think it would be essential, for instance, that we should know the amount assessed and the number of people paying income tax on Irish Government securities, British Government securities, and other Government securities.  I think it is essential that we should know the number of people paying income tax from their own businesses and professions, and the number of people assessed on incomes from sources other than their own business. In a general way it is necessary, I submit, that we should know the basis on <Col N="184" /> which the Minister is going to make any change, if he does propose to make any change, in the incidence of taxation in respect of incomes.  I do not think there is any need to argue this case, it is so obviously a reasonable request.  I also think we should have this information at some considerable time at least before the Minister's Budget statement will be made.  Perhaps if it was given immediately a considerable amount of public discussion would be dispensed with, and perhaps there might be a much more enlightened discussion in public on income tax matters if we had the information which I seek for in this return.  I beg, therefore, to move that the return asked for in my name be presented to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>There is one difficulty that arises in connection with this motion. At the head of it, and before the Schedule, the Deputy asks for &ldquo;The aggregate amounts assessed as income for the last year for which returns are available.&rdquo; No returns that would give precisely that information have ever been available or are ever likely to be available. The returns that have been published from time to time have been of assessments in a particular year, but sometimes these assessments related to previous years.  A certain proportion of the assessments always related to previous years, either because of non-discovery or something else.  Assessments were not made for the year of the income, and consequently all that could be given at any time would be the aggregate amount of the assessments made in a particular year.  You could not give, without waiting for a very long period, the actual amount of assessments in respect of the incomes of a particular year, and that has not been done.  I think Deputy Johnson would be satisfied if he could get returns of the type that the British Government has published.  I would like to say that we are desirous of having information ourselves for our own use, and we are desirous of publishing the information as soon as we get it.  The amount of work and the delay that must occur in these cases can be estimated by Deputies, <Col N="185" /> when I tell them that the British returns for the year 1921-22 were only published in August last, that is about 2½ years after the end of the year to which they related.  The returns for the year 1922-23 will be published by the British next August.</P>
      <P>During the year 1922-23 the income tax in this country was collected by the British for us on an agency basis.  It was also collected on the basis of the United Kingdom income tax.  Even if the British were able to get separate figures for the Saorstát for the amount collected here, that would not be equal to the amount of the Saorstát tax.  For instance, income from British securities was not assessed here at all.  There were firms, the entire profits of which were assessed here prior to the beginning of the first year in which we dealt with income tax ourselves, and which are not now assessed here or are only in part assessed here.  Even if the British were able to give separate figures for the Saorstát for the year during which they acted as our agents, these figures would not be of any value as showing what our returns will be for the first year of Saorstát tax and the first year of Saorstát administration.  Such figures as will be available relating to the year 1922-23 will be all-Ireland figures, and they will be published by the British authorities in August next.  We are preparing certain of the figures asked for by Deputy Johnson.  Under Schedule A we propose to give two divisions instead of three.  We propose to give the figures for land and the figures for houses and other property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards item (iii.) in Schedule A, that would be infinitesimal in this country, and no preparation has been made for giving separate figures for it. B we will give.  As regards Schedule C, we propose to sub-divide it into two divisions, that is Irish Government securities and other Government securities. So far as the material that we have got at the present time, we are not making a distinction, say, between British Government and Dominion Governments, and it would not be possible in the first return that we will publish to sub-divide that into more than two sections.  With regard to Schedule D, we will not be able in the first return <Col N="186" /> we publish to sub-divide that very much.  We will be able to give the Irish railways separately, because they are separately assessed by the Special Commissioner, but the other sub-divisions that are asked for could not be given.  Some of them may be given, and if we can we will give some of them.  We might give item (ii.) as it stands.  If the words &ldquo;other than Government securities&rdquo; were not in&mdash; there are British Government securities from which tax is not deducted, that come under Schedule D and not under Schedule C&mdash;we might be able to give some modification of (ii.) and then give the rest of D separately.</P>
    <P>The position is, as Deputies are aware, that the Revenue Department is very much under-staffed.  It is almost impossible to do the ordinary work of collecting tax, making repayments, and the necessary work that is to be done in a Department as well as to contend with the enormous pile of arrears.  We have taken all the steps we could to recruit the staff.  Deputies may be aware that it takes three or four years to make an inspector of taxes.  We are not in a position in which we can afford to say to an inspector: &ldquo;Let £100,000 of revenue stand by and get us all these statistics.&rdquo; We must only get all the statistics which can be got without loss of revenue.  When you are dealing with arrears it is necessary not to postpone them because as arrears become more stale more of them become irrecoverable.  We will give what division we can on D, but I do not think we can give the amount of sub-division that Deputy Johnson suggests.  I am not able to say at the moment what precisely we will give.  In regard to Schedule E we would be able to divide it in this way: Government officials. Their salaries can be given easily, and then &ldquo;all other salaries,&rdquo; because as Deputy Johnson may be aware, &ldquo;all other salaries&rdquo; were added to Schedule E, except quarterly assessments in the case of manual workers.  Therefore, it will not be possible to sub-divide it in the way Deputy Johnson suggests. It will not be possible to give the number of persons assessed in each year of the above Schedules.  I believe the British authorities at one time did attempt <Col N="187" /> to give that, but they certainly have abandoned it, and they gave no such figures in the recent returns.  An individual might be assessed under Schedule A for farms in Kildare and houses in Dublin, and there might be quite a considerable number of assessments. He might be assessed for directorships of companies in various places, and it would be a work of enormous difficulty to get accurately the number of persons assessed.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the matter in No. 3 here differs from No. 1. No. 3 asks for the &ldquo;aggregate gross amount of income assessed under each year of the above Schedules.&rdquo; I do not know how that differs from No. 1, except that it is simply making a tot of the sub-divisions into which it is suggested the various Schedules should be divided.  As regards the amount that will be allowed by way of exemptions and deductions, that will be given, of course, when the figures are ready, but it is one of the matters that will prevent a speedy production of the figures because, as a matter of fact, we are dealing every day with exemptions, deductions and discharges of assessments which cannot be supported.  As a matter of fact, there are many assessments yet to be made in respect of the years 1923-24. Some of these arose out of dividends that were brought in from Great Britain where we did not deduct the tax, but under an arrangement got particulars from the banks.  The banks supplied particulars in respect of the deducted taxes.  When the particulars came to us, some of them at the end of the year and at different periods, assessments had to be made.  All these assessments have not yet been made. The trouble is that we are very far from being at a period where we could arrive at the amount of the various deductions, exemptions, etc.  In regard to No. 5 we could not give the number of persons assessed whose incomes do not exceed a certain amount, at least we could not give useful figures for the reasons that I have already indicated. Then there is the fact that a great deal of income tax, which is paid by way of deduction, is not assessed, and the <Col N="188" /> figures that would be supplied in that way would be misleading.</P>
    <P>You have, as I have already said, Schedule A assessments, which are actually made on the houses and lands wherever situate.  We can give the figures of the number of super-tax payers, and we can give the figures that have been given.  I do not think the British authorities have ever given the particulars suggested in Number 5.  At any rate, it would be a matter of enormous labour, but, to put it in a rough way, we are preparing to give substantially all the information without quite the same sub-division, at any rate for the first year or two, in some of the schedules, as is given by the British authorities.  But it cannot be expected that we will be able to do that more quickly than the British authorities, with their well-established machinery, and without the same enormous burden of arrears as we have, can do it. The British authorities will not publish their figures in regard to 1923-24, which is our first Saorstát tax year, until August, 1926, and I think if we are able to publish figures before or even a short time after, August 1926, we will be doing very well.  It might be possible to get certain gross figures in regard to the various schedules before that, but those gross figures are not figures I would care to publish.  They would be of very little value, because of the amount of exemptions and deductions that would have to come off in each case, and they might vary very greatly from anything that we have already to judge by.  We know that the amounts exempted in Ireland, taken as a whole under certain schedules, differ very much from the proportions deducted in England and Scotland.  It might readily be that the amounts deductible by way of exemption and so forth from the gross assessment in the Saorstát might differ very widely from the amounts that were deducted in Ireland taken as a whole, because we know that the economic conditions differ considerably here from the Six Counties, and, consequently, such gross figures might be very misleading.  I would be disposed to decline to publish these gross figures, for the reasons which <Col N="189" /> induced the Minister for Industry and Commerce to stop publication of certain figures in regard to unemployment. He stopped publication because they were misunderstood and misrepresented.</P>
    <P>I would be prepared, when we can get such figures, to give them to Deputy Johnson or to anybody who is interested. But, from the point of view of publishing them as a Parliamentary Paper, I think it would be wrong. Their value would be really negligible to anybody unless to an individual who was prepared to appreciate that they were rough approximations, which might be 20 or 30 per cent.  wrong, and who just gathered what he could from them.  It is a most unfortunate thing for us that we have not all these figures. But we started the Saorstát tax with a separate year and a separate system, and the modifications involved in double income tax and so forth in 1923-24.</P>
    <P>We cannot go more quickly in the matter of getting figures than the British machine goes, and it simply means that however desirable the figures are, we must wait until the work has been done.  The work of allowing various exemptions and so forth, is work that will occupy some time, and until that has been done and we can give something like the net and exact figures, there will be no use in publishing figures which might be entirely inaccurate. It is all very well to take one gross figure and say that income tax might yield so much, because inaccuracies in building it up might cancel one another, but when you go to delve down, inaccuracies might become greater, and to attempt to draw deductions from figures that would be constructed in that way would be misleading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose that there is nothing to be done except to bow to the inevitable.  One cannot press a motion upon the Minister or upon the House when the Minister says that he could not with any reasonable possibility get a return ready until August, 1926.  I do not think it would be desirable to adjourn the House until then.  I think, whatever may have been the position in recent years, that up to a <Col N="190" /> few years ago, before the war, the particulars asked for in this Schedule that I have attached to the motion, were presented by the British authorities, at least they have been worked out by statisticians from the British returns, and I think were actually formulated by the British authorities.  But I will ask the Minister to make available whatever figures he has, at least to help us to form a judgment in respect of income tax and other matters, which enable him to consider this question of income tax and the incidence of that tax.  At least, let us have similar information, whatever is available, in a general way, although there may be a possible ten or fifteen per cent. of inaccuracy. I can only leave the matter with the Minister himself to give us whatever information he has, and I am sure that the Commissioners have, somewhere in their private desks, more information than the Minister himself would suggest is available.  He may not be able to stand over it as being accurate and reliable, but I think that before he is asked to make any alterations or to retain taxation on its present level, in order to form a judgment, he must have some information available, and I ask that we be equally informed in these matters.  I ask leave to withdraw the motion.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he has received any representations from the Post Office Department regarding the payment of National Health Insurance contributions by boy messengers in the Post Office who qualified in educational examinations held in November, 1923, and June last, and whether he is yet in a position to announce a decision on the matter, and, if not, when it may be expected.</P>

      <P>Under existing regulations boy messengers in the Post Office are required to pay National Health Insurance contributions until the issue in their favour by the Civil Service Commissioners of Civil Service Certificates.  In view, however, of the fact that the delay&mdash;which is unavoidable&mdash;in the issue of the Certificates is in no way attributable to the boys, representations have been made to the National Health Commissioners as a result of which the obligation to pay contributions have been waived.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether an application has <Col N="113" /> been made by Mr. P. Durkin, of Tubbercurry, County Sligo, for back pay unpaid between 1st August, 1922, and 16th September, 1922, and, if so, when this application will be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>An application for back pay does not appear to have been received from Mr. P. Durkin.  I would add that it is not practicable under regulations to entertain an application of the kind received after the 1st December last.  Furthermore, records are available which show that Mr. Durkin was duly paid for at least portion of the period mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
