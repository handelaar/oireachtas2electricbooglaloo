      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether a claim in respect of personal injuries received by Mr. William Quane, of Lackendarragh, Angles-borough, County Limerick, at the hands of British Forces, was lodged with the Personal Injuries Committee in June, 1923; whether the decision of the Committee communicated to the claimant's solicitor in September, 1925, was to the effect that no compensation would be paid in respect of the claim; whether he is aware that claimant can produce medical evidence in support of his claim, which was not considered by the Committee, and if he will have the case re-heard by the Committee.</P>

      <P>The application of the person named by the Deputy was carefully considered by the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee in accordance with their terms of reference.  The Committee had sufficient particulars presented to them in the form of application submitted to enable them to form the conclusion that the applicant did not sustain any injury of a serious or permanent nature and that he did not suffer any impairment of earning capacity.  They accordingly recommended that no compensation should be paid.  This decision was conveyed to the applicant's solicitor on the 25th September, 1924.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> I agree with the finding of the Committee in this case and I am not disposed to vary their recommendation.</P>

      <P>When the material for the revised List was ready, it was deemed advisable to incorporate the extensive Budget changes resulting from the Finance Act, 1925.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he can name the date of prohibition of importation into Saorstát Eireann of articles of apparel such as gloves or handkerchiefs through the post other than by parcel post, and if he can state the penalties normally enforced against persons who violate such regulations, and what statutory powers the Revenue Commissioners rely on for their enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the regulations of the Department for Posts and Telegraphs goods liable to duty may not be imported into Saorstát Eireann by letter post.  Personal clothing and wearing apparel, including gloves and handkerchiefs, became liable to duty on the 24th April last, and the prohibition of importation of such goods by letter post took effect from that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 18 of the Post Office Act of 1908, the Minister for Posts and <Col N="822" /> Telegraphs is empowered to detain any postal packet suspected to contain any contraband goods and forward same to the Revenue Commissioners who, if contraband goods are found therein, may detain the packet and its contents for the purpose of prosecution.</P>
    <P>The statutory powers of the Revenue Commissioners in respect of goods irregularly imported are set out in the various Customs Acts and more particularly in Sections 177, 178 and 186 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, which provide that such goods are liable to forfeiture and that persons concerned in the irregularity are liable to a penalty of £100, or treble the duty-paid value of the goods, at the election of the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>In the case of goods imported by prohibited post the Commissioners do not normally institute proceedings or enforce the penalty of forfeiture unless there are aggravating circumstances in the case or the offence is repeated after the parties concerned have been warned.  Cases which present no objectionable features are usually dealt with by allowing release of the goods on payment of the duty involved with or without a small fine.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a statement to make on a question of Order.  Since the Dáil adjourned on Friday, I have given careful consideration, in consultation with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to the proceedings on the motion regarding Agricultural Credit Societies, made by Deputy Baxter on the 18th instant and on the amendments since proposed to the motion, and, with the permission of the House, I would now like to state my views and conclusions regarding certain points of procedure and order arising out of those proceedings.</P>
      <P>Firstly, I am of opinion that notice should have been given of the amendment moved by Deputy Tierney, put forward as it obviously was after due consideration and consultation.  Deputy Baxter's motion first appeared on the Order Paper of the 12th November, and as the motion was not moved until six days later, sufficient time was given to have an amendment drafted, and inserted on the Order Paper, before the Debate took place.  The fact, however, is, that the amendment was only handed to me, while in the Chair, after Deputy Baxter's motion had been proposed and seconded, and after another Deputy had spoken to the motion.  I have come to the conclusion that the practice of putting in, without notice, amendments to motions of which due notice has been given, is unfair to the Chair and to the Dáil, that it debars adequate consideration of the terms of such amendments from the point of view of order and procedure, and that it ought to cease&mdash;without prejudice to the power of the Chair to accept motions or amendments on grounds of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, when Deputy Tierney's amendment had been carried on the 20th instant, and had been proposed from the Chair as a substantive motion, Deputy Johnson proposed a further amendment without notice.  In the circumstances I have no objection to Deputy Johnson's amendment on the score of notice, but I have come to the <Col N="829" /> conclusion that the amendment is out of order.  It proposes to delete from the amended motion words that the Dáil had already decided should be therein inserted.</P>
    <P>The amended motion is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil is of opinion that the establishment of Agricultural Credit Societies affords a reasonable method of relieving farmers who have lost stock through fluke, and also considers that the development of these societies will provide a credit system particularly suitable to the permanent needs of small farmers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson's amendment is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;to delete the words &lsquo;affords a reasonable method of relieving farmers who have lost stock through fluke, and also considers that the development of these societies&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is to say, when Deputy Tierney's amendment had been fully considered, and when the words contained in that amendment had been substituted for certain words in the original motion, Deputy Johnson proceeds to delete the words which had been inserted; in other words, to reverse a decision already arrived at.  When the House has agreed to insert certain words in a question, it is irregular to propose any amendment to those words, as the decision of the House has already been pronounced in their favour.  The only amendment that Deputy Johnson could have moved would have been an amendment proposing to add words not inconsistent with the previous decision of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Johnson had wished to delete certain words from Deputy Tierney's amendment, the proper course for him to have adopted was to have proposed his amendment to Deputy Tierney's amendment before a decision on the latter had been obtained. Having come to the conclusion that the amendment is out of order, I have decided that when the proceedings on the amended motion are resumed I shall not put the question on Deputy Johnson's amendment.  That amendment will accordingly lapse.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I am of opinion that the motion, made by Deputy Connor Hogan at 3.50 p.m. on Friday, for the adjournment <Col N="830" /> of the debate, should not then have been accepted.  The debate would, under the Order of the Dáil, have been adjourned automatically at 4 p.m., and if no Deputy offered to continue the debate after 3.50 p.m. on that day, the question on the amendment should have been put.  The decision of the House, as shown by the division, was that the debate should not be adjourned&mdash;a decision in conflict with the Order which made the adjournment of the debate, and of the Dáil, obligatory. One interpretation of the division that suggests itself is, that the House did not desire to continue the debate and that the proceedings on the amended motion should be regarded as having lapsed.  Any such interpretation might be held to conflict with Standing Order 75, which gives certain rights to private Deputies' motions.  This point does not now fall for decision, but I would suggest to the Dáil that to get over the impasse, and remove any doubt as to the effect of the division on Friday, a formal order, if so desired, should be made to-day in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the proceedings on the amendment proposed to the amended motion relative to Agricultural Credit Societies be resumed on (a given date).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When the proceedings are resumed, I shall, if they are resumed, as I have already stated, rule Deputy Johnson's amendment out of order, and the amended motion will be before the Dáil for decision.</P>

      <P>Before the Dáil proceeds with the business of the day, I desire to raise a question.  I do not know whether it can be called a point of order or a question relating to the decency of the House.  In connection with the debate on agricultural credit societies, certain statements were made by Deputies last Wednesday.  On Sunday last, a Deputy who was listening to the debate was down the country and he misrepresented certain <Col N="831" /> statements.  I could use a stronger word in regard to his action.  This Deputy who went down the country, who was present during the debate, and is present now, said that &ldquo;some of the Farmers' representatives, Messrs. Gorey and Heffernan, got up in the Dáil a few days ago and said that 90 per cent. of their cattle were diseased.  Was not that a nice way to run down their country?  Was it any wonder the store cattle trade should be as it was?  They said last year the country was reeking with fluke.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, what was said with regard to the 90 per cent.&mdash;as far as it was connected with my name&mdash;was this: &ldquo;If you ask butchers in our slaughter yards about English, Scotch and Irish cattle, they will tell you a considerable percentage of the livers of these animals, with our rainfall, was not in anything like perfect order and is not yet.&rdquo;  That is what was stated here, and yet we have a Deputy going down the country making the statement I have referred to.  I will not make any comment.  If I do so, I might say a little too much.  Some of us do not wonder what comes from that particular Deputy.</P>

      <P>This is the very same point that arose while Deputy Nolan was speaking last Friday. If I can recollect my own words aright, I said I would give Deputy Gorey, Deputy Heffernan and the Minister for Lands and Agriculture an opportunity of explaining what they meant.  That, in debate in the Dáil, is the best thing I can do when a misunderstanding as to what has actually been said arises between Deputies.  As to what transpires outside the Dáil I have no jurisdiction, and I feel that it is not for us to go into questions that arise outside the Dáil in debate between Deputies or between parties. Deputy Gorey has read out his own statement, and that, I think, is sufficient for the moment.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to allow Deputy Nolan to intervene in this at all.  I do not think Deputy Nolan can make things a bit better.  This is the identical question, as I said before, that arose last Friday. At one stage of the proceedings Deputy Nolan proposed to tell the Dáil what some unnamed person had told Deputy Nolan, what that unnamed person thought of the Farmers' Union.  I did not allow Deputy Nolan to do that.  It would have been a very improper thing to do.  But I cannot ask Deputy Nolan to withdraw something he said outside the Dáil.  On Friday, when he made a statement as to what he thought Deputy Heffernan said, I gave Deputies Heffernan and Gorey ample opportunity to explain what they meant.  I think I also allowed the Minister for Agriculture to intervene and explain some matters of fact relative to that particular circumstance.</P>

      <P>With regard to the President's motion dealing with Order No. 7, I would like to know what the proposal is.  I take it that it is obviously useless at this stage to proceed with the discussion of details of the Education Estimates, but there is a question on the motion which stands in the name of the President, and I suggest that it is important to consider the desirability of coming to a conclusion upon that motion and at as early a stage as is possible.  If the motion is either carried or defeated, the future Minister for Education will take it either as approval or disapproval of the policy of the Ministry of Education in the past.  As a motion has been moved by the President and discussed and is before the House, I think it is necessary that it should be concluded and a decision of the Dáil taken.  It would be well that we should have that decision at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>I am willing to consider any proposal for the insertion of this motion on another day.  I do not think it is likely that it would lend itself to consideration by the House pending the appointment of a Minister for Education.  I want at the same time to make it perfectly clear that as far as the Executive Council is concerned, it is quite prepared to give time for discussion of the Estimates as originally undertaken.  I take it that the insertion of the motion will be a matter for agreement as to where it comes in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is that by agreement the discussion of this motion was concluded, and then, on your suggestion and by your ruling, sir, no decision was taken at what might be considered the appropriate point in normal circumstances. The decision was deferred so that discussion of the details might be conducted in order.  If that discussion of details is to be deferred until the new Minister for Education has made himself master of the departmental work, it means that a decision on the policy of the Ministry of Education is deferred for a considerable time.  I submit <Col N="835" /> that the circumstances require that a decision upon the debate which has already concluded in fact should be taken, and that the debate, since the original one was concluded, has been on the details of the Estimates.</P>

It is a question of the policy of the Executive Council in education.  It has been discussed and the debate is concluded, and I think the Dáil is prepared to deal with it now.  I think that should be done.</P>

That could be done by adding the words &ldquo;and for other purposes&rdquo; or something of the kind, in order that points of detail not yet discussed might be discussed, and at the same time a decision on the policy of the Ministers might be come to as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it this will be the best opportunity for saying what I want to say on this Bill.  This motion is moved, I have no doubt, as it is believed to be better than the motion which should make it impossible for any acts done under the new Charter to be valid until there has been a formal assent.  It is certainly better than to have no such provision inserted in the Bill, but on the earlier stages of the Bill, on the amendment which I moved, the President practically challenged the citation of a case where the Adaptation of Enactments Act was <Col N="838" /> used to make changes not strictly necessary by virtue of the political change that had taken place and consequentially necessary.  Under the Adaptation of Enactments Act there was, in fact, a change made which was more than a consequential change.  I refer to the Central Midwives Board. The position of that Board was altered on the Minister's own admission, not because an alteration was inevitable as a consequence of the change in the political situation, but because the Minister thought another composition was better.  Originally the Board was obliged to include two representatives of the local authority.  After the alteration by virtue of the change made by the Ministry under the powers given by the Adaptation of Enactments Act, there is now no guarantee that the local authorities who are charged with enforcing the Midwives' Act will be represented on the Board. The Minister also altered the method of appointment without consultation.  On that point I asked a question as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To the Minister for Local Government :&mdash;If he will state why it was considered necessary to alter the statutory composition of the Central Midwives Board by Order under the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922; whether an effect of the alteration is to deprive the local authorities, charged with the supervision of midwives in their areas, of their specific representation on the Board; whether none of the midwives' representatives recently appointed to the Board is a member or representative of any organisation consisting exclusively or largely of working midwives; and if he will state why recommendations of the Irish Nurses' Midwives' Union, which was duly consulted in accordance with the statutory requirement, were ignored in the appointment of midwives' representatives on the Board.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This was the answer:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The procedure for consultations prescribed in Section 3 (1) (a) of the Midwives (Ireland) Act, 1918, was found cumbrous and useless, and was consequently omitted in the Adaptation Order.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> It was found cumbrous and useless by the Minister, but it was an Act of Parliament which had been taken over by the Oireachtas.  The Adaptation of Enactments Act was declared to be clearly for the purpose of adapting Acts in such a way as was necessarily consequential on the change made by the Treaty.  The Minister makes a change of the actual content of the legislation, and that is done by Order. I have protested that it is the exercise of an authority which I will admit is a consequence of the remissness of the Dáil, including myself, in allowing a phrase, saying &ldquo;at the discretion&rdquo; or &ldquo;which in the opinion of the Executive Council is desirable,&rdquo; to be inserted. We have given to the Ministry power to adapt legislation by Order in such a manner as he may think desirable. Now the President contends that there is no case in which the Ministry have used their powers under that Act to alter legislation.  I have cited a case which may not be of the utmost importance, but it is of considerable importance.  It is to this effect: it shows that the possibilities being there, Ministries may take advantage of the possibilities.</P>
    <P>The effect of that precedent upon the Adaptation of Charters Bill is very marked.  This amendment will be inserted, no doubt, but it throws upon the Dáil the obligation to search for every projected change.  Those changes are not specifically brought to the notice of the Dáil.  They will be laid upon the Table, and any act which may be done under it, even though the Dáil eventually disagrees with the Order, becomes valid and of effect.  The giving of power to the Ministry to alter Charters in the same way as they have been given power to alter enactments, on the precedent which I have quoted, shows that they may alter Charters radically without the formal consent of the House.  I think that the position ought to be safeguarded by some form of words which I cannot devise, so that nothing but changes which are consequential upon the political alteration should be permissive, and that there should be a rigorous protection against any such change by merely the Order of <Col N="840" /> a Minister.  I am informed that it is unheard of in respect to Charters that they should be altered.  They may be annulled, they may be extended, but it is unheard of that they have been altered in the past, and I am only uttering this as a warning of the powers that we are giving to the Ministry under this Bill to alter the actual content of Charters with only a limited safeguard such as is contained in this amendment.  The powers of the Adaptation of Enactments Act have been used under the same form of words as is proposed in this Bill to alter the content of an Act dealing with the Midwives' Board, merely because, as the Minister said in his explanation, it was found cumbrous and useless.  That may be a justification for new legislation. It may be a justification for bringing forward a Bill to the Dáil to amend legislation, but it is not a justification for altering the law by an Order of the Minister, and I say that the Dáil ought to be warned of the powers they are giving to the Ministry under this Bill to alter Charters which may be of very much greater importance to the persons concerned, and possibly even to the public, than the alteration which has been made in the Midwives' Bill.</P>

      <P>On the Committee Stage of this Bill I raised such legal points as Deputy Johnson has now been referring to, as well as some others, because I was seriously apprehensive as to what was the real effect of the Bill and as to the powers which it did confer on the Government.  Since the Committee Stage the President has been good enough to give me and others similarly interested in the effect of this Bill an opportunity of going into these legal questions with him and of getting satisfaction as to what is the real legal content of the Bill.  The effect on my mind of the President's representations was that he and his advisers were perfectly satisfied that the legal implications in the Bill were just those which he had expressed himself as the intentions of the framers of the Bill and that it gave them no other legal powers.  The legal argument was to this effect: that this Bill was to be taken side by side with the Adaptation of Enactments Act, and <Col N="841" /> that it did for Charters what the Adaptation of Enactments Act did for statutes, and that stress must be laid on the words &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; and of &ldquo;full force and effect&rdquo;&mdash;that acting under the Bill the Government would be only empowered to make such changes as were necessary in their opinion no doubt but still were necessary, and that such changes could only be of a kind that would make the Charters fully operative in the Free State.</P>
      <P>The President gave instances of how that could be effected.  So far it is quite satisfactory, I think, to hear that the legal opinion of the Government is that legally they are only asking for powers to carry out what they stated in the House were their intentions in this Bill Deputy Johnson has raised afresh the question as to whether the legal effect of the Bill is more than that or not.  I do not profess to be a lawyer.  I only profess to be able to form my own judgment on an argument when it is put up to me, and I see that the force of this legal argument raised by the President is very strong.  I should have been, I would like to say, better satisfied if the Government had agreed to insert such words as &ldquo;on the application of the parties concerned,&rdquo; or to leave out the phrase &ldquo;in the opinion of the Executive Council.&rdquo;  I think that would have satisfied me completely.  It is perfectly clear from what the President said that the intention of the Government is to make such minor changes as have become necessary owing to the changes in the Constitutional position.  The only question I have in my mind then is the one as to whether the legal meaning of the Bill is that or more.  I have admitted that the President has put up a very strong legal argument, and I hope that he is right in his contention that the legal effect of the Bill is no more than that it enables the Government to make such minor changes as have been indicated already.</P>

      <P>I rise to express my disappointment that the President has not seen fit to make the change that was suggested to him on the last <Col N="842" /> day&mdash;namely, that any change made in the Charters should be made at the request of the persons holding the Charters. I have been told that the Government is now taking more power to themselves than the King himself ever sought or ever put into force.  Even Kings who have given Charters never at any time interfered with these Charters unless at the request of those holding them, and then when a request was made the King was prepared to grant a supplemental Charter or to make some amendment in the one that existed.  What has aroused the fears of those who hold Charters is that the Government, in taking these very wide powers now, seem to have taken the power to alter Charters at their discretion without any reference whatsoever to the bodies who hold them.</P>
      <P>I was to some extent responsible for the introduction of this, as I stated on the last occasion, but, as I said then, I had no idea when I made application to have a change made in a charter that the Government would do more than either change the individual charter or at all events take power to make such changes in the charters as the bodies holding them wished to be done.  Deputy Professor Thrift explained to me since the last occasion that the President had made it pretty clear to him that they did not intend, or rather that the meaning of the change was nothing more than what we had been seeking for, namely, that the Executive Council would only make changes at the request of the chartered bodies. If that be so, or if it is anything like that, I express my satisfaction with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am perfectly satisfied with the statement of the President that he himself had no intention whatever, nor had the Executive Council any intention whatever of going further than that and without the slightest reservation I accept that statement.  On the other hand, it is quite clear the President cannot give any promise for his successors&mdash; I suppose he will have successors some time or another.  At any rate, it is clear if it is made law that when the President gives up the reins, which I hope may not be for a long <Col N="843" /> time yet to come, and when perhaps Deputy Johnson comes into his shoes, Deputy Johnson will find himself in the possession of a law that will give him power to make changes without any reference to the people who hold these charters, and if the matter comes into the law courts the lawyers would have to read the Act as they found it and not in accordance with any promises made by the President in respect of them.  However, while expressing disappointment that the President was not able to meet us in this matter, I have no intention of raising any objection except to express my disappointment that he had not gone the full way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill must be taken in conjunction with the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922, and I think if Deputy Sir James Craig reads the title of that Act and this Bill, a good deal of his apprehensions would be very easily satisfied.  The Adaptation of Enactments Act is &ldquo;an Act to interpret and adapt to the circumstances of Saorstát Eireann certain Acts of the British Parliament having the force of law in Saorstát Eireann and certain statutory rules, orders and regulations and certain contracts.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill is a Bill &ldquo;To provide for the adaptation to the circumstances of Saorstát Eireann of charters which have the force of law in Saorstát Eireann and to apply to chartered bodies certain enactments relating to statutory bodies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied from the case made by Deputy Sir James Craig that there is any likelihood of the Executive Council getting outside of its authority in connection with Orders that will be made under this particular Act.  The very first section says that &ldquo;the Executive Council may, from time to time, by Order make all such adaptations of and modifications in any charter which by virtue of Article 73, of the Constitution, has the force of law in Saorstát Eireann, as are in the opinion of the Executive Council necessary in order to enable such charter to have full force and effect in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sir James Craig knows of the weakness in one particular institution <Col N="844" /> having a charter for its operations. There are others.  Some of them will not make application, and some operate as if there were centred in themselves all the powers that ought be centred in the institution if it was in full working order, and to put in any such qualifications as would limit the power of the Executive Council to take such action as would appear to them necessary in order to make the charter have full force and effect, would be placing a limitation upon it.  I did not know, and I have not heard before about the Central Midwives Board Order, but the Executive Council, if it made the Order, was open certainly to criticism here if it exceeded its authority in making the Order.  I am afraid I do not feel satisfied that a case has been made for putting a resolution through the House, instead of the proposal that we have outlined here in the amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not feel satisfied that we should adopt that suggestion rather than the other, and make the working of the two Acts different, for no other reason than that some persons whose business it was to see whether the Orders placed on the Table, in respect of certain Acts, were advisable in the circumstances, failed to do so, or whether unusual power was taken.  It is not a good case in my opinion.  It is the one case mentioned within three years, and from the fears that have been expressed one would think that the Executive Council would be sitting up all night making Orders in connection with all the charters in existence. I should say that the Executive Council moves rather slowly in respect to these matters, very, very slowly.  And it moves always fortified by the best advice that can be given, and very few Deputies have any cause of complaint in connection with the legal advice which has been tendered to the Government since the first meeting of the Dáil here in September, 1922.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the Executive Council should only move when it is requested to move.  Cases have been brought under my notice where in the case of certain charters certain persons holding judicial office or other office in the Saorstát had certain duties in connection <Col N="845" /> with certain chartered bodies. I know in one case certainly where that was not brought to the notice of the Executive Council by one of those bodies although it ought to have been. If in the granting of the charter the Lord Chancellor, or the Lord Chief Justice, or some other person occupying a somewhat similar position, was laid down as having a certain office of responsibility, in connection with the working of the charter and that the persons functioning the charter neglected to bring to the notice of the Executive Council such infirmity or such omission by reason of the passing of the Courts of Justice Act or by reason of not having a Lord Chancellor, I say it would not be advisable in my view to limit this Bill to cases where the Executive Council would only come into operation when, and if representations were made to them, in such cases.</P>
    <P>As regards safeguards this Bill is, properly speaking, an addition to the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922. No case has been put forward with the exception of the one made by Deputy Johnson, and even that one does not evidence a strong case against the Executive Council.  Provision is made in the Bill for having laid upon the Table Orders made by the Executive Council.  Now if there is one class of people with whom I have come in contact in recent times who are jealous of their rights and privileges which they have acquired I should say it is those who are in possession of charters. Never in all my experience have I come across a more conservative body of men, and I cannot imagine the Executive Council making an Order that these people would not hear about in quick time and take steps to have the Dáil or Seanad put in possession of every possible infraction of their integrity by reason of the Order made by the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>The position is further strengthened by the fact that we have, first of all, the security I have already mentioned, that this is really an Adaptation Bill; secondly, that any Order made must come before both Houses and that a resolution annulling such an Order passed in either House nullifies the Order.  I do not know of any reasonable security <Col N="846" /> that could be asked for in addition to that.  Thirty-one members of the Seanad can hold up an Order and also a majority in the Dáil, and the discussion which would take place in the Dáil would be before the Seanad in making up their minds as to whether or not they should annul any Order made.  I think that I have met the case fairly and fully by the insertion of this amendment.  It would be a great reflection upon the Executive Council to insert any stronger safeguards in this Bill than there are in connection with every statute that has been passed or that we have adopted by the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922.  It would certainly in the minds of the citizens put the holders of charters in a superior position to the ordinary citizen.  It would in my view place them in a very privileged position and a position which I am satisfied they would not claim after the matter had been explained to them.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill as amended be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On that question, I want to repeat the warning that I was giving.  I am not claiming that the position of the charter holders should be better than the position of the public. What I pointed out is that there was a mistake, a loophole, shall I say, in the Adaptation of Enactments Act by which a Minister was enabled to make an alteration in a statute without the formal sanction of the Oireachtas. In the case in question it may not have been very serious, but the fact that the Adaptation of Enactments Act conferred upon Ministers such power as to allow this alteration of a statute to be made by Order shows that we were remiss and that a loophole was allowed in that Adaptation of Enactments Act which ought not be repeated.  The obvious thing, of course, is to amend the Adaptation of Enactments Act to prevent such a thing happening again, but as the matter before us is the Adaptation of Charters Bill, I urge that there ought to be inserted some section which, at least, will be explanatory, which would enable the Courts to decide that the <Col N="847" /> change that was being made was necessary to enable a charter to have effect &mdash;not an altered charter, not a charter granting new powers or diminishing or changing the power effectively, but showing that the power is taken to alter the charters and adapt them to the purposes of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>The case I am making is founded entirely upon the proposition that the Ministry was empowered to make an alteration in a statute which went beyond the intentions of the Dáil or the claims of the Ministry; that it was framed in such a way as to give Ministers greater power than they sought, and that when a minor occasion arose they took advantage of that excess of authority, they took advantage of the loophole and altered the Act respecting midwives.  They altered the Act respecting midwives and the constitution of the Midwives Board by an Order. That certainly was not intended, and certainly was not referred to in the discussions on the Adaptation of Enactments Act.  Possibly, if an attempt were made in the courts to nullify that Order it might succeed.  I do not know. But, as it appears to the layman, the power which was given under Section 12 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act, which is now being transferred in respect to the Adaptation of Charters, was greater than the power they actually sought.  It went beyond merely giving power to adapt enactments or, as in this case, charters, to make them effective in Saorstát Eireann, by giving power to alter the composition of bodies which were set up.  That is what I want to urge upon the Dáil and upon the Ministry, because I do not expect the Dáil is going to take any action now.  I urge upon the Ministry the importance of amending this Bill in such a way as to make it quite clear that there is no power given to alter the charters beyond such powers as would enable the Government to make these charters effective in Saorstát Eireann.</P>

Supposing there were an educational body which, under charter, comprised representatives of certain classes of persons and the Ministry comes along under these powers and say: &ldquo;In future we are altering that charter, and one particular set of people representative of one particular interest or point of view will be eliminated.&rdquo;  There you have the perfect analogy of what was done by Order under the Adaptation of Enactments <Col N="849" /> Act in respect to the Midwives Board.</P>

      <P>The power taken in connection with the Adaptation of Enactments Act is embodied in Section 7.  Section 7 has four sub-sections. It was laid down clearly and distinctly in that that there was such power and that the Executive Council should enter into the possession of such power. Presumably, when asking for such power and entering into possession of it, the Executive Council intended to exercise it.  What was really the case for that very big section?  At one time, it was alleged that there were sixty-five Boards or Bodies of Commissioners who had statutory authority in this country.  It was not intended at the time the Adaptation of Enactments Act was under consideration that all these bodies should be continued.  In order to permit the Executive Council to deal with that situation, Section 7, embodying four sub-sections, was put into the Adaptation of Enactments Act.  Properly speaking, it might be held that it provided a sufficient amount of material for a separate Bill or a separate Act, but that was not done.  It was made perfectly clear&mdash;certainly in the discussions we had in the Executive Council, if not in the Dáil&mdash;that it was intended to do exactly what has been complained of by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I hope the President will excuse me for calling attention to the fact that he has laid down a serious principle.  Discussions in the Executive Council are not, I think, reported. They are, and they must be, absolutely and strictly confidential.  I hold that the President would be justified in preventing Deputy Mulcahy or Deputy MacNeill from mentioning anything that had been said in discussions in the Executive Council.  We cannot, therefore, have it given as an argument that a fact is demonstrated because of discussions that took place in the <Col N="851" /> Executive Council.  Clearly and obviously, a fact cannot be demonstrated in this way to Deputies here or to the public outside who are entitled to a certain amount of knowledge in regard to these matters.  I hope the President used that argument on the spur of the moment, and that he is not going to set it up as a considered doctrine of State, because it is a dangerous doctrine and one which would damage the Government and the Executive Council far more than any other body.</P>

      <P>Before we begin consideration of the amendments in Committee, I would like to suggest some points to Deputy Conlan regarding his amendments.  Amendment No. 3, by Deputy Conlan, does not seem to me to be relevant to the subject matter of Section 6, to which he is proposing it as an amendment.  I suggest to Deputy Conlan that he should move his amendment as a new section for insertion before Section 5.  By this means, he would be able to test the Committee's views on the principle of the amendment.  If he succeeds in having the principle affirmed and this new section inserted in the Bill, before next Stage he could arrange a consultation and formulate a further amendment giving full effect to the principle. If the Deputy agrees to that suggestion, I will take amendment 3 after amendment 1.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;To insert a new section before Section 5 as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The fencing of land taken under <Col N="855" /> this Act shall be carried out at the expense of the local authority acquiring same and shall be maintained in good and proper repair by such local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it is only equitable that where land is taken for the purposes of allotments the expenses of fencing that land and of maintaining the fences should be borne by the local authority. In all cases, or certainly in most cases, the fencing would not have been rendered necessary but for the taking over of the land for this particular purpose, and in these circumstances it is only fair and right that the landlord should be made responsible either for the erection of the fence or for its maintenance. It is on these grounds that I move the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that this amendment is unnecessary, as it is already implied in Section 2.  It says: &ldquo;Whenever a local authority is of opinion, as a result of representations made to them or on their own motions, that there is a demand for allotments in their area, and are further of opinion that the costs and expenses incurred by them in providing and maintaining the land for such allotments and otherwise in relation thereto, may reasonably be expected to be recouped by the rents and other moneys to be received by them for the allotments, such local authority may resolve to provide land for such allotments under this Act and may thereupon carry such resolution into execution under and in accordance with this Act.&rdquo;  In other words, the whole intention of the Bill is that the local authority shall not undertake to provide allotments unless it is able to pay for the expense of providing them, and naturally the building and the maintenance of fences are works included in the scope of maintaining the allotments.  I think the amendment is unnecessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why there should be any objection to having that obligation stated clearly in the Bill.  Take a case of trespass.  In a case of trespass on these allotments the question would naturally arise: &ldquo;Who is responsible, if the trespass took place through neglect of the local authority, <Col N="856" /> to maintain the fences in a proper state?&rdquo; The very first question on which a decision would turn would be whether it was through that neglect that the trespass occurred, and it would be very desirable, I urge, to have that clearly stated in the Bill.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(d) is used for the holding of agricultural shows, race meetings, athletic sports, or the playing of games.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is generally admitted that it is most desirable that land should be available, especially in the vicinity of towns for the purposes of holding agricultural shows, for athletic meetings and the playing of games of various kinds, and also that land used for this purpose should not be open to invasion, if I may so call it, by people seeking to mark out allotments.  It is most desirable that young people especially should have the means of recreation <Col N="857" /> and amusement, and there are some particular games that might not be viewed with very much favour by a dominant party in a local authority. Grounds such as I have specified, in the amendment should be exempt from allotment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's point is generally covered in the expression in sub-section (a) : &ldquo;is or forms part of a demesne, garden, or pleasure ground.&rdquo;  If we were to permit of a number of exceptions of this kind, athletic sports or the playing of games, etc., it would be very hard to get any land in the vicinity of a town or city for this purpose, because, as we all know, vacant places around cities and towns are very largely utilised by children for the playing of games, and it would be very unwise to restrict the local authority within too fine limits in a matter of this kind.  The Deputy must also remember that in the case of any hardship the aggrieved person has an opportunity of appealing either to the Minister or to a Judge, so that there is no danger of a place like Ballsbridge, or any show-ground of that kind, being handed over for allotments. It is a matter for allowing some opportunity for the display of reasonable judgment on the part of local authorities and of allowing some discretion to the Minister or to the Judge who will have a final say in the matter.  If we were to accept this amendment it would practically mean that this Allotment Bill would be a complete failure.</P>

I know of a case where a sum of £18,000 has been spent within the last couple of years.</P>

That in itself is a safeguard.  As well as that, the individual would have an opportunity of appealing, either to the Minister or to a Judge, so that there are at least two safeguards.</P>

I cannot see why there should be an objection to that.  Does the Minister maintain that it should be open to people to go in upon these lands and to break them up into allotments?

      <P>With regard to the amendments tabled to this Bill, Amendment No. 1, by Deputy Magennis, and certain consequential amendments, are out of order because they contravene one of the principles of the Bill, the principle being the giving of authority to confine examinations to members of one sex.  When the question is put: &ldquo;That Section 2 stand part of the Bill,&rdquo; it is open to the Deputy to speak and to vote against it, but it is not open, when a Bill has been referred to Committee, to alter the principles of the Bill in Committee, and the effect of Deputy Magennis's amendment would be so to alter the Bill, that the Bill, if it was so passed, and sent back to the Dáil, would be a Bill different in principle from the Bill referred to the Committee.  That applies to Amendments 1, 4, 5, and 8.</P>

      <P>(2)  The said Section 4 of the Principal Act shall be construed and have effect and shall be deemed always to have had effect as if the following sub-section were inserted therein in lieu of the sub-section (3) now contained therein, that is to say:&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Sub-section (1), line 20, to delete the word &ldquo;word&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;words&rdquo; and in the same line after the word &ldquo;sex&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;(except in examinations for Junior and Senior Administrative and Executive posts in the Civil Service).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is intended to give statutory authority to a pledge given by the Minister on the Second Reading of this Bill.  The Minister then said that it was not intended to close the higher grades of the Civil Service to women.  This amendment, which is possibly faulty in drafting, is an attempt to give effect to that, because any pledge given by the Minister binds only Deputy Blythe.  A future Minister may ignore or disregard it.  When the Minister was asked what safeguard there was in the Bill against the wholesale closing of the Civil Service to one sex or another, he replied that &ldquo;we must trust to the general trend of events in the outside world.&rdquo;  That is the sort of safeguard that Ministers are very fond of offering to the Opposition, but which they never rely on themselves.  The Minister said that this Bill was necessary because, <i>inter alia,</i> two men had applied to go in for an examination for shorthand-typists, which was intended to be only for women.  If I told the Minister that this Bill is unnecessary because the general trend of events in the outside world renders it unlikely that many men will go in for an examination of that character, where the wage is a woman's wage and the work is women's work, he would not be satisfied. So I want something more specific, something more definite, than the mere suggestion that there is no present intention, and that no future Ministry will attempt to do it because of the general trend of events in the outside world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="861" /> This is a moderate amendment.  It suggests that in the lower grades of the Civil Service, in minor posts in the Customs and Excise and in the Post Office the Civil Service Commissioners may make such regulations as the Minister desires.  It confines itself to the higher administrative and executive posts and says that these should be open to both sexes.  That is a natural consequence of the provisions in the Constitution and of the opening of Parliamentary franchise to women, and of admission of women to seats in the Dáil and Seanad.  It is quite true that there may be posts for which a woman is less fitted than a man, but I would say that some of the higher posts in the Civil Service are equally suited to either sex.  It may be better to have a man rather than a woman secretary to the Minister for Defence, but, on the other hand, I can imagine a woman being quite as good a secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health&mdash;particularly the Public Health Department&mdash;as a man.  I do not wish, of course, to displace the present secretary.  A woman may be a satisfactory secretary to the Minister for Education.  I hope I carry Deputy O'Connell with me in that, since the teaching profession employs both men and women.  Therefore, I think this is a most moderate amendment which goes no further than the expressed intention of the Minister and I hope he will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment, as Deputy Cooper says, is certainly a moderate amendment.  I would not see any point myself in, say, including the executive posts in such a provision, because, as a matter of fact, an examination has actually been held in which women competed for executive posts and were successful.  There is not a bit more reason for including executive posts than there is in the case of clerical and other posts.  On the other hand, if you confine it to the only remaining type, that is, junior administrative posts, there is no examination for posts higher than junior administrative. People go to higher posts by promotion.  It seems to me that it would be incongruous in the Bill to <Col N="862" /> insert a provision stating that the examinations may be confined to persons of one sex, except junior administrative examinations.  In view of the expressions of, shall we say, doubt that have been heard, I would be prepared to do this much to meet the Deputy, and I think it would meet him satisfactorily. I would undertake to insert a sub-section providing that no examinations should be confined to persons of one sex except by special regulation which would be laid on the Table of both Houses at least one month before the examinations.  It seems to me that would amply meet anything that might be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the entire agitation and the cloud of suspicion that have been raised in connection with this matter as somewhat absurd.  There is, despite whatever Deputy Cooper may say, a movement of events in the outside world, and in every sort of sphere women are entering and are being admitted.  Recently in Dublin a woman was admitted for the first time as a member of the Stock Exchange.  There was a good deal of agitation about it and members of the Stock Exchange opposed it. Members came privately to me and asked me whether I would refuse my certificate in the event of her name being passed by the majority of members. I said that I would not, but that immediately the name was passed in the ordinary course a certificate would be issued.  That sort of struggle is not going to occur again.  That is an outpost carried by the advancing army and there is not the slightest danger of a change.  The same thing applies in the Civil Service.  There is not, except in cases where some very definite and cogent reason can be put forward, the slightest chance that anybody can change what has happened within the past ten or twelve years, and people who have suspicions in this matter are people whose minds are still clouded by the atmosphere of struggle in 1912, 1913, and round about that period. Certain suspicions were cast on the motives and intentions of the Government because it was intended in the case of the first junior administrative examination to confine it to men.  I explained on second reading of this Bill why that <Col N="863" /> was being done.  It was our first examination for the junior administrative grades which is a grade from which the great majority of the heads of departments must eventually come.  It is a grade the members of which must not be treated, if we are to get value from them, as clerks.  They must be given opportunities immediately they come in of dealing with administrative work. They must not be put into a cul-de-sac.</P>
    <P>We are in a position where there are very few women in the higher Civil Service and where people coming in under these examinations would be controlling men of mature years.  We felt that if, say, in the first examination for junior administrative officers, five women were to be appointed out of six vacancies the result of that in existing circumstances would be that the entrants to these offices probably would not have been given proper work and not given the opportunity and training that people of this grade should be given.  The result would be that a wrong twist would be given to the whole question of training people for this grade, and it was felt that what was necessary in the first instance in order to give people proper opportunity and have them properly treated in the offices was that, at any rate, the big majority should be men.  There was absolutely no intention at any time of suggesting that this grade should be confined to men as a permanent thing. It was simply because the whole position has altered very greatly in recent years, a matter of taking steps to see that the grade was given proper work and that the best was made of the people who were to come in.</P>
    <P>Up to that time the British Civil Service in examinations for the corresponding grade did not admit women. Since then a Class 1 examination has been held, and it was open to women. There is absolutely no intention, and the Government could not, if they desired, exclude women from the higher grades of the Civil Service.  As a matter of fact, there is practically ready for issue, as I understand it, a notice from the Civil Service Commissioners covering a period of years.  It has been suggested that in order to get the best <Col N="864" /> competition and examination a sort of programme of examination covering a period of years should be published, and that it should be stated that in such and such a month in each year for a number of years ahead, an examination for a certain number of vacancies in a certain grade will be held.  That notice will be published, and, when it is completed, it will show that all these main service grades, clerical, executive and junior administrative, will be open to women.  I think that that, coupled with the sub-section providing that an examination shall be confined to one sex only by special regulation, to be laid on the table of both Houses at least one month before the examination is to be held, should meet any reasonable doubt or suspicion which anybody may hold.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister's offer might be accepted.  With regard to the Minister's explanation, it would seem that the agitation, if I might call it so, was useful, for it has drawn from the Minister a definite decision and the statement that owing to special circumstances the examination was confined by the Civil Service Commission to the male sex.  Those reasons may sound very excellent as coming from the Minister, but the fact is that had no representation been made in connection with this Bill the probability is the practice might have continued.  At all events, we have an assurance from the Minister that regulations are being made with regard to the future, and I think a reasonable safeguard is being provided inasmuch that when any exceptions are being made to the general rule the regulation would be laid on the Table of the House, so that members should have an opportunity of criticism in the matter.  So far as I am concerned, I think that covers most of the ground.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance speaks this evening, as he did on recent occasions, as if agitation were something to be deprecated, in fact something to be strongly condemned. Does he forget how much has come about in the amelioration of the condition of the Irish people through <Col N="865" /> long, steady and devoted agitation? Because women graduates of the two Universities, because women who have received expensive education in the secondary schools, feel that the avenues to occupations of emolument are being narrowed, and the doors are being closed against them, neither they nor their representatives are to protest, or to have the matter discussed here in the one great forum in which such matters can properly be discussed. What is the history of this?  The Minister himself says that it is a false alarm that the higher positions are to be closed to women, but the explanation he gives for the irregular advertisement, which had to be withdrawn, is that it is desirable&mdash;rather he said the higher positions must be filled by men and, consequently, you must begin at the lower stage in order that they may receive the proper training.  What is that but sex disqualification?</P>

An advertisement was issued by the Civil Service Commission reserving certain posts for competition amongst men.  I protested against it at the time in my capacity as representing so many educated women who are University graduates.  That advertisement was withdrawn.  It was illegal and unconstitutional.  What did it indicate?  It indicated the desire of the Minister, the desire as expressed again, to reserve the majority of the higher posts for men.  That is not free competition.  Women according to the Constitution are equal before the law <Col N="866" /> with men.  They have equal right to equal opportunity, and the declaration here, by which sex is made like ability, character, or any of those meritorious things to be requirements, is unconstitutional.

      <P>In order to be quite clear as to what is out of order let me recall our procedure.  A Bill is prepared, leave is given to introduce, the Bill is then circulated, and a motion is made that the Bill be now read a second time.  Under that motion it is in order to discuss the principle or principles of the Bill.  The Bill is then referred to the Committee.  In Committee the Committee must remember that the House has assented to a certain principle.  The Committee can alter the Bill if it so desires, but without altering the principle.  Deputy Professor Magennis's amendment was to delete sub-section 1 of Section 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get the matter of what the ruling is, quite clear.  The amendment to delete sub-section (1) of Section 2 is to take out of the Bill one of the principles which the Dáil has assented to, and amendment 4, to which I think Deputy Magennis now refers, introduces a new <Col N="867" /> principle.  The principle originally in the Bill was that authority shall exist to confine examinations to persons of one sex.  The suggestion in amendment 4 is that after examination appointments should be confined to particular members of one sex.  That is a different matter, and the result of passing that particular amendment here, if it were passed, would be that the House would receive from the Committee a different Bill from the Bill the House sent to the Committee.  We must be clear on that as a matter of procedure. On the other hand, any vital section of a Bill can be rejected by the Committee on the motion that that particular section stand part of the Bill. Deputy Major Bryan Cooper in amendments 2, 6 and 7 is endeavouring to do something which is in order.  Amendment 2 is endeavouring to restrict application of the principle of the Bill. That is in order.  It would even be in order to move such restrictions of the principle as might, if adopted, make the Bill as amended useless to the promoters.</P>
      <P>Amendments 6 and 7 seek to put conditions to the application of the principle. Again, in that case it would be in order to move such conditions as to put the person in charge of the Bill in the position that the Bill so amended would be of no use to him.  These considerations are arguments against the amendments, and not questions of order.  Amendment No. 4 proposes to do something different to what is in the Bill.  It is out of order for the reasons which I have given.</P>

      <P>I do not put any great faith in the disclaimer of the Minister that he does not intend to exercise certain powers if he takes those powers.  We are making an Act of Parliament and, conceivably, there will be other Ministries and other Ministers, and it cannot be pleaded in the courts that such a thing was not the intention of the Legislature or that such a thing was the intention of the Legislature. The court will decide according to the enactment in the statute and not otherwise.  I do say again, with Swift, that wherever one depends for one's rights upon the goodwill of <Col N="868" /> another, he is a slave to that other. That is the very definition of slavery.</P>
      <P>There are powers being taken here to introduce sex disqualifications.  There is no limit to the extent to which these powers could be used, except the feeling that the Minister may have, as expressed here by the Minister for Finance, that public opinion would not stand it.  How do we know what decadence may set in later on, by virtue of which the word of a Minister may go down with the mob that forms the majority? That is not democratic rule, and it certainly is not founding civil liberty.</P>

      <P>I realise the Minister has made a very considerable concession, and I am grateful for it.  If I make one or two suggestions, I hope he will realise that they are not made in a hostile spirit.  A month is not a long time for a person preparing for an examination.  If the rules are laid on the Table a month before they become operative, you will have persons preparing for the examination uncertain as to whether they will be permitted to sit at the examination or not.  I would rather extend the time.  I would suggest that the Minister's proposal to issue a schedule over a number of years might be made statutory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be possible in the later stages of this Bill that in the Dáil or Seanad the Minister would accept a schedule in the Bill setting out what examinations were open to men and what examinations were open to women, and what were open to both sexes.  Such a schedule would have to be revised from time to time, and it might be operative over a period of three years.  I suppose to revise it would require further legislation.  I believe that would be a fair position in which to place the candidate for the Civil Service.  I am only putting that forward as a suggestion.  I am, of course, not convinced by the Minister's argument.  I never am convinced by the Minister's arguments.  He talks about the impossibility or the undesirability of women controlling men of mature years.  I know very few men of <Col N="869" /> mature years who are not controlled by women.  They are controlled in the domestic hearth, perhaps.  It might be conceivable, particularly if a woman got into the Civil Service in comparative youth, that she might control the men in her office.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Minister has gone some way to meet my arguments.  I do not suppose the Minister would have done it had he not known that the heavy artillery of Deputy Magennis was in reserve.  I think we can come to no further decision on this matter until we see the amendment that the Minister proposes to put up on the Report Stage and therefore, with the leave of the Dáil, I am willing to withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <P>I did not take part in the discussion on the last amendment, but I do not think that in securing the protection of persons who are proposing to enter for examination for junior and senior executive posts, it would be right to exclude from that protection other persons who are seeking to enter the Civil Service.  I think that whatever is going to be said in regard to the higher offices must be said with equal emphasis in regard to the junior posts, the clerical grade, and the lower grade generally.  I have not yet been convinced that there is any necessity for any regulation or for any enactment to make a sex distinction. As far as I understand the work of the Civil Service with regard to appointment after entrance, I should say the fitness generally will make the selection that is necessary, and we should not make provision in an enactment <Col N="870" /> for disqualifying any person from entering the Civil Service or from receiving any appointment merely on the ground of sex.  The post itself, and the qualifications for the post, are quite sufficient to make the differentiation. There is a selection, and the fitness for the work is presumed to determine the selection that is made.</P>
      <P>I cannot see that there is any wisdom at all, or any necessity at all, for inserting the provision disqualifying a woman because she is a woman, or disqualifying a man because he is a man. If I may say so, I am concerned for the men on this side as well as for the women.  I am not satisfied that even a case has been made for disqualifying a man from taking a post as a typist or shorthand clerk.  It may turn out to be in the course of experiment&mdash;in many people's opinion it has been already proved&mdash;that men are much more efficient as typists and shorthand clerks than women, and I am not going to vote for any provision that is going to disqualify a man from a post as shorthand clerk or typist.  They are likely to give better service and be more efficient for the job.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that Departmental arrangements and the general plan of the service make such a possibility undesirable. Well, so much the worse for the plan; so much the worse for the regulations.  I think the regulations should adjust themselves to the constitutional requirements rather than that the Constitution should be amended or that even legislation should be enacted so as to conform to what has hitherto been considered Departmental requirements, organisation in the offices and so on.  We are not only dealing with the disqualification of women; we are dealing with the disqualification of men, and, as has been pointed out more than once, if the women in the country were to use their power by virtue of their franchise, it may be that they will turn the tables, and that the various regulations that are to be made under this Bill would disqualify men from many posts that they hitherto held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the whole, whether we are dealing from the point of view of men or from the point of view of women, it seems <Col N="871" /> to me that we ought not to make any disqualification or allow any disqualification on the ground of sex alone to be made under the authority of an Act of the Oireachtas.  I say that in the ordinary working out of the Civil Service, selection will go by virtue of fitness and that women will not be appointed to posts which they are physically incapable of filling.</P>
    <P>I think one may fairly say that sex prejudice enters into this matter.  Then, there is the question of custom, which takes a good deal of time to overcome, having regard to the conservative minds of officials.  Officials and departments and Ministers, but particularly officials and departments, become habituated to a course of things, and that in itself is a very great obstacle to a change which the country outside probably has long accepted.  I think the case that has been made by the Minister is not sufficient.  It does not warrant us in agreeing to the insertion of this section which gives power to exclude women because they are women, or men because they are men, from entering the Civil Service or from taking any posts in the Civil Service. I think the process of selection on the basis of fitness is quite sufficient to prevent women being appointed to posts for which they are naturally unfitted.</P>

      <P>I had not an opportunity of speaking during the Second Reading debate; it was impossible for me to be here.  I do not intend to make a Second Reading speech on the present occasion, but I cannot let this opportunity pass without recording my opinion, and my very strong objection, to the introduction of the word sex in this section.  I think there should be no difference whatsoever, as far as legislation is concerned. I think the matter will right itself very easily when the posts are declared vacant; women will not go up for posts for which they are physically unfitted, and men will not go for posts for which they are physically unfitted. For several years I have had a good deal to do in connection with the education of women in a certain direction. So long as we allow women to enter <Col N="872" /> into the higher courses of education, they should receive the same chances and opportunities in every direction of improving themselves, as men do.</P>
      <P>I think some Deputy remarked on Second Reading that this was a very retrograde movement; I do agree with that statement.  I think it is a very serious mistake to introduce into legislation here any disqualification of sex. I know that there are many posts that women will occupy much better than men, just as there are posts that men will occupy much better than women.  I say that quite frankly.  I do not think there is any reason for introducing a sex distinction.  I said to some ladies, some of them my own graduates: &ldquo;Why do you not use your own powers and fight your own battles?  It is your own fault if you have not more people representing you here and speaking for you in the Dáil.&rdquo;  I do not think there is any doubt that, if the ladies used the franchise as they ought, they would have sufficient people here to put their case so that they would not be placed under any disability.</P>
      <P>It is a serious thing, after we have allowed women to enter the higher branches of education, that they should have to go outside this country in order to seek their livelihood.  The case has been put up to me in another direction that we are qualifying too many people and sending them out of the country, having spent our money upon them. We are educating women in the higher branches of education, and now we are going to introduce a rule that may at all events disqualify them from entering for posts for which they are quite fitted.  There is nothing left to them but to go to other places where they will get employment.  I was very pleased to hear the Minister suggest what he had done in the way of meeting Deputy Cooper.  I suggest, if he is framing this amendment, he should at least extend the period for three months, so that anyone who is reading for the examination would not find that a month preceding the examination he would be cut out.  I do not think there would be any difficulty on the Minister's part in extending this period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree it would <Col N="873" /> be most unjust and improper, after an examination were announced, that it would be confined to one sex.  Advertisements should be issued months before and the particulars should be fully indicated in the advertisements.  I will look into that point and see if that can be embodied.  It is not reasonable to say that the question of fitness will decide the whole matter inside the Civil Service.  We appoint our Civil Servants from lists resulting from an examination and you cannot say that you will exercise any discretion when the candidates who have passed come along.  If there is work for which it is desirable to employ women, and you have only men on your successful list, then you must put the men to it and vice versa.</P>
      <P>It is perfectly clear that you must, in the Civil Service, have some means of discriminating between the sexes.  That arises in cases such as I have mentioned of Customs Officers and Customs Preventive Officers.  You cannot send out a night patrol of women along the border to prevent smuggling.  On the other hand, it might be that at the examination for Customs Preventive Officers only women would pass and you would have nobody else to send out. If you mean to have men, you must have power to limit the examination to men.</P>
      <P>You have cases of sorters in the Post Office.  It has been a custom in the Post Office not to employ women on night work and I think that it is, in all the circumstances, a good system. Sorters work at night and return home at 2 or 3 in the morning.  On the whole, it is desirable that men only should be employed on night work.  Certainly there would be objection to the other arrangement as long as the arrangement in regard to men has been recognised in the Post Office.  Unless you are to have men doing all their years of service on night work, you must be able to keep such a proportion on the staff that they will get their turn of day as well as night work.  There again is a case where you must be able to discriminate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you come to the question of shorthand typists and telephonists, there is no doubt that men could be employed  the work.  In the past in the Civil <Col N="874" /> Service there were men shorthand typists and it was found that they were very much less satisfactory than the female staff.  If you threw the typists' examinations open to men undoubtedly a considerable number would enter.  In the recent examinations very few entered because they were not fully aware that they were open to men, and very few men had made any preparation that would give them a chance of passing. There is no doubt that a considerable number of men would enter.  Most of these men would remain in the service. Some of them might leave because the pay might not be as high as in the clerical grade.  A very considerable number would stay on.  On the other hand, I suppose that a big majority of the present staff would marry and leave the service.  The result would be, if you had only the same number of men and women passing the examinations, in fifteen or twenty years you would have that branch of the service consisting of a percentage of three women to each man.  It is all very well to say that the pay is very low and that men would not enter.  They would enter and marry and have families and they would be pleading on our doorsteps for married men's pay and allowances. They would get them, and would have to get them.  You would have additional costs, and at the same time you would have, as in the past, a service not really very contented and definitely inefficient.  That was the experience of Government offices in the past, that they had men typists who were not so satisfactory, and the grade was done away with.</P>

      <P>No.  Competitive examinations show what a man or woman can do in certain respects, but it often happens in all grades that people who pass well are not of very much use in the offices.  For instance, for Class 1 of the British Civil Service there are always a large number rejected during <Col N="875" /> the year of probation.  Even supposing that an officer will not be dismissed during the probationery year, it does not follow that he will be as satisfactory in actual work as another officer who is lower on the pass list.  You cannot eliminate the inefficient solely by examination.  Of course, you can prevent complete &ldquo;duds&rdquo; from entering, although people who have experience of the First Division Clerks say that cannot be always done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has one great merit, a merit on account of which I steadily admire him&mdash;he states very frankly what is in his mind.  One knows from what the Minister for Finance says what the Minister for Finance means.  We have had from him a declaration just now that the Finance Department is all out for Chinese cheap labour.  The secret is disclosed.  If men go into the typists' and shorthand-typists' Department they would marry, rear families and demand a living wage, and they would have to get it.  Therefore, this must be kept a special reserve for women whom we can force to take a lower wage; thus shall we be more economical in our administration. Although the Minister is remarkable for stating what is in his mind, his mind often confuses other intentions.  He has confused two very different things.  The speciousness of his argument lies in this, that he lays special stress on the obvious fact that women are not fit, nor men all fit, for the same occupations.  Now by the Constitution men and women are equal before the law and consequently must be provided with equality of opportunity. We deny that they are identical. No one but the most frenzied feminist would allege that women and men are identical; that there is no distinction of nature in physical capacity and that therefore the functions allotted to one in the Civil Service must be equally divided, without the slightest detriment to the public service. I agree with the Minister for Finance that it is not desirable that a young woman employed in the Post Office should be in the night Department in an occupation that entails going home through the city at an early <Col N="876" /> hour in the morning.  I think every one will agree that neither will it be desirable to have a solitary soldier woman doing night patrol on the Border. Are we to agree that in order to make it possible to prevent some fool from undertaking a position of that type we should introduce into our law a restriction which is contrary to the Constitution, namely a sex disqualification? That is what we challenge here. It will be challenged later on, as the Minister knows well, in the Supreme Court, for this is contrary to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>No one would in seriousness, unless for providing a paragraph in a comic paper, suggest that any man would apply for the position of matron in a woman's hospital or wardress in a woman's prison.  There the circumstances are sufficient notification to a man not to apply.  <i>Mutatis mutandis,</i> a woman is bound not to apply for an obviously unsuitable position.  What we stand for under the Constitution is that an advertisement should state that such and such a position must be competed for as there are so many vacancies and that it shall not be in the power of a Department of State to say that no man in one case or no woman in another case is to apply.  The selection and discrimination should be at a later stage.  There is a process, Deputy Johnson has elaborated the point, of natural selection.  Why should we empower a Minister to do what according to his own admission would be against the trend of development of public opinion?</P>

      <P>We contend that it is asked.  It is a debatable matter of opinion.  We had on the Order Paper for a great many days a motion: &ldquo;That the Dáil approves of the policy of the Minister for Education.&rdquo; That occupied a lot of time. The Minister for Education and the Minister for Finance are both members of the Executive Council, and according to the Constitution they have collective responsibility, so that I take it that the Minister for Finance would have voted for approval of the policy of the Minister for Education.  In <Col N="877" /> effect this Bill negatives that.  One of the important things in the Estimate for Education is a grant of public money for secondary teachers, for the secondary schools, and for the higher public schools and the universities. While in the name of our policy of education we encourage the development of women along the most modern lines, on the other hand the Department of Finance is taking away the very obvious element of inducement to women to embark upon these careers for which special education is a condition&mdash;the higher Civil Service is not to be a career for women.  The Minister replies.  &ldquo;We are not shutting them out.&rdquo;  No, that courageous action is not possible under the Constitution, but he will shut them out practically. That is what it amounts to.  Here you have the Ministry with one voice advocating one policy of education and with another voice condemning it.  That is not consistent.</P>

      <P>I thoroughly agree with the observations of Deputy Magennis that the Minister for Finance has not made his case.  That is patent.  What he is doing in this matter is, he is setting up a domestic boundary question.  Heaven knows we have had enough of that during the past week.  In most matters of importance that come before the Dáil in which Deputy Sir James Craig intervenes we have the essence of commonsense, but in the present instance the Deputy must have come to the conclusion that he was on the side of the angels, as I hope he will be.  That does not restrict the Minister for Finance. He raises the question that if ladies are employed in the Civil Service what are they to do in the new navy which we shall probably have in Donegal over this boundary question.  Can you employ them on night patrols in Donegal; can you employ them in the Post Office up to the early hours of the morning, so that they will have to return home at an unusual hour?  It was on the Post Office Department that he relied for the basis of his argument.  I would like to hear from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs what his opinion is. Are those ladies less efficient in the <Col N="878" /> Post Office service, and is the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs less considerate in looking after the interests of those ladies?</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners under the Minister for Finance have to deal with one of the thorny questions at the present time.  Within the last couple of years, when work in this Department was extraordinarily complicated, I am informed that the ladies employed in that Department have shown a higher capacity than male companions, even those who had a longer service.  I do not know whether the Minister will controvert that, but I say he has made no case to this House for supporting the view he takes.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister, when he recovers his temper, will regret that he spoke of my advocating underhand means.  It is the first time in my life that even a suggestion of that kind has been levelled against me.  I am quite willing to be accused on any other point.  I have suggested no underhand means.  I have pointed <Col N="879" /> out to Ministers before that they have a mania for legislation.  They have got law-making on the brain.  They cannot discriminate between commonsense administration and the taking of inordinate powers by law.  I have called this already, burning down the house to roast the pig.  It is quite obvious under the Constitution that Woman, though before the law there is sex equality, is not capable of becoming a soldier, and the exercise of common sense by women and by the recruiting officer, is quite enough protection for the State.  We do not need law for this at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister's idea were carried out to its reasonable conclusion we should have Acts of Parliament regulating us with regard to all manner of things.  This is the grandmotherly legislation ideal, as I have called it, of some of our friends on the Government benches.  I had thought that in an <Col N="880" /> Irish Parliament Irish ideas and Irish ideals were to prevail.  I had thought when there was an agitation for the restoration of Irish that the spirit of Irish life also would prevail, that Irish thought would prevail, that the desire to revive it would be triumphant.  But here you have the middle-class Manchester mind that worships machinery, the machinery of legislation for everything. Everything is sacrosanct that an Act of Parliament will produce. The good sense and right understanding of the public! These are not allowed to operate as sanction for actions, commission and omissions of acts.

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    <P>The Principal Act shall be construed and have effect and shall be deemed always to have had effect as if the following section were inserted therein in lieu of the Section 6 now contained therein, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;(1) Whenever the Minister in charge of a Government Department and, where such Department is not the Department of Finance, the Minister for Finance shall consider that any particular situation to which this Act applies in such Department requires knowledge or experience wholly or in part professional or otherwise peculiar and not ordinarily to be acquired in the Civil Service or that it is expedient that the person to be appointed on any particular occasion to any particular situation to which this Act applies in such Department should have such knowledge or experience as aforesaid, the Commissioners may by special regulation prescribe the method by which they will select the person to be appointed to such situation and may by such regulation confine the right to apply for such situation to persons who have paid the fee (if any) prescribed in that behalf by such regulation and also if they think fit to persons who belong to a specified class delimited in such manner or by reference to such matter as the Commissioners may think proper, and in any such case the Commissioners may grant their certificate of qualification for such situation on any evidence which is satisfactory to them that the person selected pursuant to such <Col N="883" /> special regulation is qualified in respect of sex, age, health, character, knowledge, and ability for such situation.</P>
    <P>(2)  Whenever the Executive Council, on a recommendation made to them by the Minister in charge of a Government Department with (where such Department is not the Department of Finance) the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, shall consider that it would be in the public interest that a particular person should be appointed to a particular situation to which this Act applies in such Department, the Commissioners, if they think fit, may dispense on that occasion with compliance with the provisions of this Act and the regulations made thereunder in relation to examination or selection for and appointment to such situation and may grant their certificate of qualification of such person on any evidence that is satisfactory to them that such person is fully qualified as to age, sex, health, character, knowledge, and ability for that situation.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where a person in respect of whom a certificate of qualification shall have been issued by the Commissioners is appointed by transfer or promotion to a situation to which this Act applies and such person is not exempted by this Act from obtaining a new certificate of qualification in respect of such situation, the Commissioners may, if they think fit, dispense with the whole or any part of the examination for such situation and may issue a certificate of qualification therefore on any evidence which is satisfactory to them that such person is qualified as to age, sex, health, character, knowledge, and ability for such situation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 8, page 3, after the words &ldquo;if they think fit&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and if authorised thereunto by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is intended to control the power, which I hold is an excessive power, of exempting persons <Col N="884" /> from the competitive examination.  I realise that, as it stands, it is not an amendment that the Government will accept, because, as the Minister for Finance said on Second Reading, there are a number of posts for which special or technical qualifications are required and which are not suitable subjects for examination such, for instance, as the post of State chemist.  I put down the amendment in order to raise the question, and suggest to the Minister, that it might be combined in the Schedule to the Act giving a list of the posts that are to be filled without competitive examination. The Minister said on Second Reading that it would be impossible to draw up a complete Schedule.  Very well.  This amendment gives a way out of drawing up a Schedule as far as you can for those posts which are to be filled without examination and which require technical qualifications and certain individual qualities not to be ascertained by a competitive examination.  Then if that Schedule proves incomplete, the Government can come to the Dáil and the Seanad for a Resolution authorising them to fill any other posts that may arise.  There is no use disguising that there is a considerable amount of suspicion in this matter as to the power of exemption from examination. It was reflected, I think, in the division on Second Reading, and to a certain extent also I think in comment in the public Press.</P>
    <P>I really think that the Ministry would be well advised to make it perfectly clear that the procedure of exemption from competitive examinations was an exceptional procedure only to be employed in exceptional cases where there was no possibility of getting a post filled by competitive examination. There are certain posts like, say, that of labour advisor to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce that could not be filled by competitive examination.  That post, for instance, would be best filled by a man with real experience of Trades Union work. Posts like that must be filled outside the ordinary sphere of competitive examinations. I think if this amendment were combined in the Schedule that you would be making it evident to the world, to the public outside as well as <Col N="885" /> to the public here, that there was a real discrimination in these matters and a real desire to prevent any jobs being perpetrated.  I do not believe that it is the desire of the Government to perpetrate jobs and I have not put it down in that spirit, but I have put it down for the purpose of binding, not only the present Government but future governments, to limit their discretion in dispensing with examinations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to know that Deputy Cooper's mind was in agreement, at first, with mine at present. If it was laid upon the Table of the House that would be one advantage. I daresay the safeguard proposed by Deputy Cooper is much stronger. There is no doubt about it that anyone who reads this clause will see that although it is meant to meet a particular difficulty it confers a power which ought to be exercised in the interest of purity of administration very cautiously and only with the assent of parliamentary representatives.  Otherwise it would leave room for jobbery. I am not going to discuss whether or not a particular Ministry will or will not desire to perpetrate jobs.  The question does not arise whether there has or has not been jobbery.  I deal with this matter in its broad features. The Minister on the Second Reading pointed out that in effect the whole section is an improvement upon the principal Act, because instead of patronage being exercised by a Minister the whole Executive Council is involved in the matter, but the important point is that that is not enough.  It is a commonplace that it is not enough <Col N="886" /> not to excite suspicion, but you must not go out of your way even to incur the suspicion, and the cleaner we can keep the hands of the Ministry the better.  The best position in the case of corruption is, of course, not to be willing to be corrupted, and the second best is not to have any opportunity or facility for it.  Now, if it were only for example, it would be advisable to adopt a qualification or some such qualification as that in the amendment. Then when one of those particular special appointments has to be made, when the public interest requires that someone who by his standing, his reputation and his known capacity, is above examination, who would not subject himself to examination, in order that the Ministry should be at liberty to select him and to dispense with these things, it should be well that the public should have the fullest assurances that the appointment had not been made in the dark, that it was open and that the design of the Ministry in making such selected appointment had been communicated to the parliamentary representatives and had received their sanction.  I cannot conceive of a Parliament so unreasonable as to resist a case where it is possible for the Minister to make a case for appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is no Government that can boast of cleaner hands than this Government, and I believe that there never was another Government in similar circumstances that exercised less power of patronage. I believe that if we erred at all in times of some disturbances we erred on the side of not exercising patronage. If we erred at all that was the direction in which we erred.  I want to say at this moment that these suggestions that we hear from time to time are suggestions that are groundless and suggestions that are based sometimes on disappointment and jealousy.  We have been most anxious to rid ourselves <Col N="887" /> of the trouble that any form of patronage involves.  I think that while a Minister may exercise patronage if that is the system prevailing in a country and he may exercise patronage widely no Minister in any country where a better system exists would desire to return to the system of patronage.  Patronage does not make you friends.  It makes you enemies. If the Minister has discretion in appointments he can only appoint one person and he can make a hundred enemies, and in appointing a friend that friend will think he has only got his due and will not be grateful for it. Although as the principal Act was drawn we could have used Ministerial discretion, in many appointments, we did not do so.  In classes of appointment which in Great Britain at the present time the Minister makes the nomination we have refrained from making it.  Our whole desire is to have it done through a system of machinery set up under this Act and for the Minister to have no discretion.  We want that as the principle and practice. We do not take that stand because we are forced to do so.  We are not lagging behind public opinion.  We are not being forced on ahead against our will in this matter.  We have deliberately decided on this as a system that will give a higher standard of purity and efficiency and a system which will in every respect be best in the interests of Ministers themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have gone far beyond the British Government in this matter.  As a matter of fact, our whole system of selection boards, which we employ widely in cases of appointments where people are required who could not be tested by the ordinary written examination, is only being gradually adopted in the British service.  But we do not think that we should introduce a rigidity which may prevent what is necessary in the public interest being done.  We do not want to tie ourselves into such a knot that the right and necessary thing in certain circumstances cannot be accomplished.  We take this power of putting up, in the public interest, the name of an individual to the Civil Service Commission as the emergency <Col N="888" /> power that is necessary to cover cases which cannot be foreseen and cannot be provided for.  In my own view that is a power which should and will be used very sparingly.  In spite of the fact that there were people who had rights, you might almost say, arising out of the military struggle which we went through, there have been, since the setting up of the Civil Service Commission, only five public interest cases, cases of men who rendered military service and who had to be dealt with in this way.  That is not even an average.  That is more than there ought to be in normal times.</P>
    <P>We will have to deal with one big batch of cases under this Bill as a special measure, the cases of the Congested Districts Board officials who were not civil servants, who were not paid out of the voted funds in the ordinary way, but who have been graded according to their merits as clerical and executive officers and who will have to be certified as such.  Cases like that might arise.  For instance, there is the case of the restoration to the civil service of some individual who had been dismissed, perhaps rightly dismissed, where it might be desirable to reverse in altered times the action that had been taken.  There are these sorts of cases.  There is the case of the man of special eminence and qualifications who may be required for some very special appointment and who would not apply, who would probably have to be approached.  These are the sorts of cases for which you must have some such power as this.</P>
    <P>I do not anticipate that there will ever be in office an Executive Council that is going to use this power for the purpose of jobbery.  I have said this before, but I think it is absolutely apposite and true, that if we have not in power an Executive Council with some reasonable measure of honesty and integrity, there is no paper qualification that can be provided that will be effective.  On the other hand, no matter how much you depend on the honesty of individuals, reasonable precautions should be taken.  If you have a man handling money, his accounts must be checked from time to time and <Col N="889" /> audited.  He may be perfectly honest, but you do not want to trust him too much or to put a strain upon him.  I believe there are objections to enabling a single Minister or a couple of Ministers to use a discretion such as is given here, and the discretion which was given to a single Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the principal Act, because whatever is to be done may be done privately there.  Some one individual may be approached and he might decide on doing something that would not be really necessary or justifiable under this section, but as for getting the whole of the Executive Council&mdash; any Executive Council that may ever be in power&mdash;to concur, as they must concur under the principle regarding collective responsibility, in doing some job, is a matter that is not to be contemplated. I do not contemplate it and I do not think it necessary to contemplate it.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I think that a provision involving discussion of persons and appointments in the Dáil would not be good.  I do not think that a question of the appointment of an individual should come before the Dáil.  If that were done, you would have lobbying and canvassing and the Dáil would be reduced from the position of watcher to the position of participant. I believe that you would have worse results if these cases were brought before the Dáil than you can possibly have if they are not brought before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Assume that we want to appoint somebody as head of the whole Shannon electric scheme to manage it when completed.  Suppose there were nobody in this country that we believed suitable to undertake such a big task and we proposed to appoint somebody from outside.  We know very well that there would be fifty people who would be at any rate united in this, that they would try to keep that fellow out so that one of them might get it.  You would have them round Dawson Street and Merrion Street approaching and canvassing Deputies, and you would have a situation that we ought not to bring about.  It has to be remembered that all Civil Service appointments are at <Col N="890" /> the will and pleasure of the Executive Council.  Executive Councils will change, and if one Executive Council does a thing that is wrong, at any rate there will come in others who knew not Joseph, and perhaps Joseph's job will not be so easy, if anything wrong did happen.</P>
    <P>There has been an attempt on the part of certain people outside to suggest that we have a jobbing Government, that they must be watched and restricted and hemmed in in this way and that.  I think that that atmosphere is based upon a misapprehension and, to a certain extent, on libel and falsehood.  I certainly feel that this Government can stand absolutely in the open in this whole matter and that it has nothing to fear from any investigations. We are not putting forward this measure as people who want to hold patronage or the power of jobbery in our hands, because our whole desire and policy has been to rid ourselves of it.</P>

      <P>The greater part of the Minister's speech has been in favour of my amendment.  I stated explicitly that I made no charge of jobbery against the Government.  I reiterate that.  I do not believe the Government has been guilty of jobbery&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I did, and I repeated it to-night.  I think I made my position very clear, that I object to legislation in a form which allows of that being done.  The whole speech of the Minister just now is to this effect: &ldquo;You must put perfect faith in an Executive Government while it is an Executive Government.&rdquo;  Now let us shift our vision to 3,000 Anno Domini.  There is an Executive Government then.  According to the Minister, we are to put absolute faith in that Executive Government.  If that be the case, then there is an end to Parliamentary Government altogether.  That is Government by a Junta.  Surely we are at liberty to try to hedge in the possibilities of corruption, so far as we can conceive of their being hedged in, <Col N="891" /> without being accused of alleging underhand methods.  I repudiate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall also have to make my position clear.  I did not put down this amendment because I believed that the Government intended to use the powers in this measure to create jobs or to perpetrate jobs.  I do not believe that they have been guilty of that in the past, and I agree with the Minister for Finance that probably their record of patronage would compare very favourably with that of any other Government in Europe or in the world.  I desire to say fully and frankly that that was not my reason for putting down the amendment.  My reason for putting down the amendment is that this is exceptional and abnormal procedure which should only be resorted to within certain limitations, whatever Government is in.  The Minister said that a limitation such as specified in the amendment might prevent what is necessary in the public interest from happening.  Has the Minister such a low opinion of the Dáil as that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I took it down as the Minister said it&mdash;that a limitation of this section might prevent what is necessary in the public interest from being done.  I think if the Minister came to the Dáil and made a case, as he could make a case, for any appointment under the procedure adumbrated in my amendment, he would be able to convince the Dáil.  The Minister thinks it is undesirable that the Dáil should discuss the affairs of individuals, but the whole machinery of the Constitution contemplates it.  We have to discuss individuals when we are appointing extern Ministers.  We have to vote for individuals when we are forming a panel for the Seanad elections.  We have been exposed to lobbying and we have come through it with comparative virtue.  In a past Dáil, we actually had to nominate the members of the Seanad.  It is not a new principle, it is not a revolutionary principle, that the appointment of individuals in exceptional cases should come before the Dáil.  The Minister said that he realised <Col N="892" /> that it was undesirable that these things should be done privately and that, therefore, this Bill provided that instead of the Minister for Finance alone, or another Minister with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, putting forward a name to the Civil Service Commission, the whole Executive Council would have to do it.  But the doings of the Executive Council are as private as the doings of one Minister or of two Ministers.  That is what I want&mdash;the safeguard of publicity.  That can only be given by open discussion and open debate.  Nobody can tell what has happened at meetings of the Executive Council except members of that Council.  Nobody knows how many Ministers attend the meetings.  We do not know if they have a quorum even at times.  These things might be rushed through, not under the present Executive Council but at some future date without the safeguard of publicity that the Minister lays so much stress upon. The only safeguard, the only way of preventing things being done privately and of preventing unfair imputations of which the Minister has complained with justice, is to have absolutely frank and open discussion in either House or in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is the only way you will prevent the slanderous tongues of the disappointed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>You may set them going but you will provide very much less receptive soil for the poison they wish to sow.  The Dáil is not an unfair assembly in these matters.  If the Minister can convince, I will not say all parties, but two parties or three parties, that the course he proposes to adopt is a fair one, there will be very little public response to the slanderous tongues&mdash;except there is a real case and that the Minister cannot convince the majority of the House.  But that is a case I am sure the Minister does not contemplate will arise.  As an assertion of principle, as the Minister has met me in this way, I am afraid I must persist in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I understand the position taken up by Deputy Cooper in this amendment. <Col N="893" /> According to my understanding of it, some Deputies who have taken part in the discussion have quite a wrong view of the intentions of Deputy Cooper. The amendment may be read that in the case of a person to be appointed to a particular post, the appointment itself would have to be sanctioned by the Oireachtas.  If that be the effect of the adoption of the amendment, I think the Minister's objections are good and valid.  On the other hand, I think that if the appointment&mdash;that is the office which is to be filled&mdash;is to be taken out of the ordinary round of Civil Service appointments and advancements, that the office is one which the Ministry, on the advice of a Minister, think should be filled in this manner and that permission to do that should be sought from the Executive Council, it is, I think, a sound proposition.  But even if that be the intention, I will vote for the amendment, because the proposition of the Minister, in its present form, would enable selections to be made even for ordinary posts in any Department of the Civil Service, thus taking the place of the ordinary method of advancement.  If the Executive Council, having had representations made by a Minister, thinks that a particular person should be put into a particular place, to the detriment of other people equally fitted, with experience, perhaps, within the Department, then the sanction of the Civil Service Commission may be sought, and if it is obtained then that person may be appointed to that place.  The safeguard that the Minister puts forward is, first, that the Executive Council has to be satisfied that the application of the Minister is a sound one and, having got that sanction, that the Civil Service Commission must be satisfied with the fitness and qualifications of the person in question.  To make the latter a real safeguard, it would be necessary that the Civil Service Commission should be entirely independent of Departmental chiefs and Ministers.  The very fact that the Civil Service Commission is, to the extent of two-thirds of its membership, composed of persons who are subject to the authority of one or other of the Ministers who is making this recommendation, destroys the validity, to <Col N="894" /> some extent, at any rate&mdash;perhaps to a considerable extent&mdash;of this reference as a safeguard.  I think it is unquestionable that some provision should be made, so that special appointments that are outside the ordinary course of Civil Service advancement should be made possible.  This section does not confine itself to such positions.  But on the assumption that it does and that that is the intention&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Then so much the worse for the section.  It is not the intention to confine this preferment to special and abnormal posts.  So that I think it is undoubtedly necessary that if, within the ordinary working of any Department of the Civil Service, a special provision of this kind should be allowed, then the facts of the case apart from the person who is proposed to be nominated should be made known to the Oireachtas and sanction given beforehand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, perhaps, desireable to give an illustration.  There is at the present moment a vacancy in the office of Clerk of the Seanad.  The section in question says that the Executive Council on the nomination of the Minister&mdash;I do not know in this case who the Minister would be&mdash;may make a recommendation that a particular person should be appointed to the Clerkship of the Seanad.  It is not an office the qualifications for which are necessarily very well known to the Civil Service Commissioners inasmuch as it has not been within the course of their particular experience and they are not able to bring any better information to bear on the matter than Ministers themselves.  It seems to me that experience within the Civil Service, experience within the work of the Oireachtas, or at least experience that would qualify a man or woman to fill that post, should be quite clear, and that there should be a prohibition against putting any person who has, perhaps, no qualifications except military service into such a position. The Executive Council or a Minister may easily persuade a Civil Service Commission which is not directly concerned or, on the other hand, which is subject to the good will of the Ministers <Col N="895" /> who are making the recommendation, that they should consent to such an appointment.</P>
    <P>I think that the proposition Deputy Cooper put forward would safeguard any attempt at an appointment of that character.  Notwithstanding the general agreement amongst those who have spoken that there has been a minimum amount of pitch-forking, there has been pitch-forking.  I cannot say the dates.  It may be that there has been no pitch-forking since the Civil Service Regulation Act of 1924 was passed, but I think Deputy Cooper's proposition would at least still further minimise the amount of pitch-forking that would be possible.  I have given one illustration of the kind of posts that is outside the ordinary run of the Civil Service, at least what is considered the ordinary run of the Civil Service, which might be filled in a manner which is possibly objectionable. As to posts within the Civil Service, I think there should be a very special case made for any departure.  When I say within the Civil Service I mean within the general run of departmental work in the Civil Service.  There should be a very special case made before any departure is made from the process of appointment by experience, length of service and qualifications such as has been the habit in the past.  I therefore support Deputy Cooper's amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems not to appreciate the very wide extent of the application that these words possess: &ldquo;Whenever the Executive Council with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance shall consider that it would be in the public interest that a particular person should be appointed to a particular situation to which this Act applies, the Commissioners, if they think fit, may dispense on that occasion with compliance with the provisions of this Act and the regulations made thereunder, etc.&rdquo;  On the Second Reading I alleged, and I see no reason to change my mind, that that amounts to empowering the Executive Council to do away with the Civil Service Commission altogether in regard to any particular appointment.  That is <Col N="896" /> an extraordinary power to give any Executive Council&mdash;&ldquo;whenever the Executive Council considers that it would be in the public interest that a particular person should be appointed to a particular post.&rdquo;  What they deem to be in the public interest surely should be reviewable and that at the very earliest possible moment by the Oireachtas, where it is so serious a matter as setting aside the operations of an Act of Parliament and the regulations made under it.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my voice to the voices that have resounded through the chamber in condemnation of this sub-section.  As far as Deputy Cooper's amendment is concerned as improving the position, in my judgment the best way to improve that clause is to eliminate it altogether. Perhaps that will not be accepted in sections of the House, but my reason for saying so is this: The Minister, in defence of this, instanced a case where he might want a director of the Shannon scheme, or something of that sort, and that he would have to go outside the Civil Service to get him.  I would like to emphasise my judgment, that the operations of the Executive Council should be, as far as possible, confined to Civil Service activities, and that it is not desirable that the House should encourage the Executive Council in embarking into a form of activity outside the range of their own particular sphere.  The Executive Council, with the authority of the House, have taken steps to enter into commercial activities, and one rather fears that in the course of time the Executive Council may be encouraged to extend their operations in that direction.  From my point of view that would be undesirable. At all events, as far as the scope of the activities of the Executive Council is concerned, they ought not to require any powers for appointing any special persons, within the radius of the ordinary work of the Government, that the Civil Service could not amply supply.  I, therefore, would support Deputy Cooper's amendment, which would bring under the notice of the House any appointments that might be made in connection with this clause, but, as I said before, I would prefer to <Col N="897" /> go further and eliminate the clause altogether.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson referred to the Seanad Clerkship as an instance.  I think that that is not a position under the Civil Service of the Government of Saorstát Eireann.  In any case the person that would have to be consulted there would be the Chairman of the Seanad.  It is not a position to which this particular sub-section could apply.  I said to Deputy Johnson that these powers would apply to ordinary posts.  This provision really deals with individuals.  The way in which it might apply to an ordinary post is this: Suppose we have an efficient temporary clerk, a man who is past the age for sitting for any examination, and suppose that that man, showing great intelligence and zeal, succeeded in saving the State a very large sum of money&mdash;an analogous thing did occur recently&mdash;it seems to me that it would be a very proper thing that he should, by means of this section, be made an established instead of a temporary civil servant, in spite of the fact that his age would preclude him from entering by the only gate through which he could enter, because if a temporary clerk is 40 years of age he cannot become an established officer except by some such provision as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be very desirable and proper that a man who had given some very signal service of the kind I have referred to should be established.  Something would be done for that man in the commercial world, shall we say. Any certificate issued under this sub-section <Col N="898" /> must be gazetted immediately it is issued.  If the attention of any Deputy is directed to it the House can have the whole facts out if it wants them.  I would repeat that I believe that if these questions of individual jobs are to be matters of canvassing and voting on in this House it will have the effect of tending to bring some of the atmosphere of the extinct rural district councils into the House.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Johnson I would like to say that the intention of my amendment was such as he stated.  I possibly departed somewhat from it in following the Minister's argument, but I intended that it was the post, and not the individual who was to fill the post, that should be brought before the Oireachtas.  As regards the Minister's illustration about an exceedingly deserving clerk, does he not think that he would be able to convince the Dáil in a case of that sort?</P>

      <P>I am quite prepared to go on, though I think it would save time if the Minister would report progress.  My amendment is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To add at end of section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Whenever the Commissioners shall issue a certificate of qualification under this section, the fact of the issue of such certificate, together with the name of the person to whom it is granted and a brief statement of the reasons why it has been issued, shall be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> within twenty-one days of the issue of such certificate.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That amendment is intended to qualify the proposal contained in the section.  Broadly speaking, the amendment is intended to give the fullest possible publicity to the issue of any such certificate as contemplated in the section.  It provides that whenever it is found necessary by the Civil Service Commissioners at the invitation of the Executive Council, on the prompting of the Minister for Finance and one other Minister to issue a certificate of exemption from examination, the fact that a certificate has been issued, together with the name of the person to <Col N="901" /> whom it has been issued, and the reasons why it has been issued should be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  I do not think that is an extravagant proposal.  It is a development of the provisions contained in the principal Act, but I think it goes a little further inasmuch as it makes it necessary for the Civil Service Commissioners to state the reason why they dispensed with the examination.  That is an important and essential point.  It is important that the Oireachtas and country as a whole should be informed when a certificate of this kind is issued, and of the reasons prompting both the Executive Council and the Civil Service Commissioners issuing such certificate. The Minister in his argument on the previous amendment brought forward many cases where it was desirable that such a certificate should be issued.  What I ask in the amendment is that these arguments which are produced to the Dáil as general arguments should be available as specific arguments in support of each case and made known to the world through the medium of our official gazette.  That is a proposition which seems to safeguard public life.  There are one or two instances which one might give to show how desirable that safeguard is. I have one in my mind, but I think I will not give it as I would like to make a little further investigation.  As a general proposition, I feel safe in laying down the doctrine that it is desirable, whenever this exceptional and abnormal procedure is resorted to, it should be marked by a definite act and made public officially, and not, for instance, by a private statement to the Press, but by an official act of the Commissioners over their seal and signature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving the <Col N="902" /> Second Reading of this Bill, I feel that an explanation is due to the Dáil since it has for its object what I might call the repeal of an Act that was passed by this House as late as July last.  It will be remembered that the Shop Hours Act on that occasion was passed by 22 votes for and with 20 against it.  It would appear that the determining factor that secured even this meagre majority was that the House was called upon to give statutory effect to an agreement. Subsequently when it became known that some 500 small traders denied the agreement, certain members who voted for the Act regretted that they had done so, and certain members who absented themselves regretted that they were not present to vote against it. With regard to the agreement, many statements and resolutions were circulated in this House, and the effect of these resolutions was that there was unanimous agreement arrived at and that this House was asked to give it statutory effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrThomasHennessy" hpid="Dr. HENNESSY Dr. HENNESSY">
      <NameTxt>Dr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, it was sought to give statutory effect to the agreement, and an agreement is generally unanimous.  The impression we all got was that it was an unanimous agreement, though the word unanimous was not used.  In 1923, in connection with this very Bill, there was a proposal for an alteration of the 10 o'clock closing hour, and that the hour for closing in future should be 7.30 p.m.  A vote was taken, I believe, by the Corporation of Dublin, and the result was that out of 654 drapers, outfitters, and boot and shoe dealers, 392 voted against 7.30 closing and 262 for it.  We can see that there was a large majority for the continuance of the 10 o'clock trading.  That, I think, disposes once and for all of the agreement. There is no agreement.  The Act of 1925 affected only the Borough of Dublin and the adjoining townships. The Dublin Corporation had no power to take the vote of the townships.  With regard to the townships, I will not go so far as to say <Col N="903" /> there is unanimity, but there is an overwhelming majority against the 7.30 closing.  I will ask you to bear that in mind, because I know from the feelings of Deputies who voted for the Act in July, as well as of those absenting themselves, that they based their action on the fact that they thought they were asked to give statutory effect to an agreement.  I have now disposed of that contention.</P>
      <P>As to the question of hours, I will compare the hours under the present Act with those which we are now proposing in the Bill.  Personally I have an objection to long hours.  I told that to the promoters of this Bill, and they have met it fairly.  Instead of 49 hours under the old Act we propose to have 47½, that is, we are giving an hour and a half extra to the assistants, so that they will be better off by that time.  The hours under the 1925 Act are: on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, it is permissible for drapers, and other traders mentioned in this Bill, to keep their houses open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. On Wednesday, for those who have the half-holiday, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., and on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7.30 p.m. In the Bill the hours I am proposing will be: Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.  They will be bound by statute to close at 6 p.m., so that is a substantial gain.  On Wednesday, the usual half holiday, the hours are from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., and there is no change there.  On Thursday and Friday the hours are from 9 a.m. to 6.30 p.m., and on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.  That is the concession they ask you for.  They propose to give 47½ hours instead of the 49 hours under the present Act, and it is asked that you will extend their time on Saturday by an hour and a half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the people concerned in this Bill and the Act of 1925 want the hour and a half, simply because it is essential to their existence, and the continuance of their solvency, as well as to the continuance of the employment of their present staffs.  They tell me, and I have reason to believe it after close inquiry, that if they do not get the additional hour and a half, if <Col N="904" /> the closing time is not extended to 9 p.m., they will have to go out of business. I do not think that is desirable in this time of commercial depression. We have enough closed shops&mdash;for instance, go up Grafton Street&mdash;without adding to the list.  Then there is the question of public convenience, for it is a public convenience of certain people to deal between 6 and 9 on Saturday evening.  I do not think there would be much business done by these small traders except during these hours. Certain people cannot get out earlier than 7 o'clock to do their business. These people, as you know, are domestic servants, and the wives and children of wage earners who are engaged during the day, partly at work until 1 o'clock, and after 1 o'clock they follow some pastime like football.  When they have come back and taken their tea or supper it is up to 7 o'clock.</P>
    <P>That is the hour their women-folk are free to go shopping, and that is the reason why we ask for this extra hour and a half.  Everybody knows that is the hour in which these traders can do most business, and the bigger shopkeepers do not do it, as they are not under the necessity to work at that time for such a trade.  They do a sufficient trade during the week to relieve them of the necessity for that, and they have another arrangement by which they can open on Wednesday and have the half-holiday on Saturday.  Fully upwards of 60 per cent. of the weekly trade of these traders is done on Saturdays, and 50 per cent. of the Saturday trade is done between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m.  There is another matter that I would like to bring to your notice. Under the proposed amendment Sunday trading will be absolutely abolished, a matter that was not dealt with under the last Act.  The time at my disposal, or rather the time at the disposal of the Dáil, is limited, and I cannot say all that I would like to say in support of the Bill.  If I did I would be, perhaps, anticipating the objections of certain Deputies.  I will therefore reserve for myself a little time, with the indulgence of the Dáil, to answer those objections later.  I formally move the Second Reading of the measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'CONNOR</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second <Col N="905" /> the motion made by Deputy Doctor Hennessy, who has covered the whole ground plainly, and, I am sure, to the satisfaction of the Dáil.  He has proved that this Bill is a most reasonable Bill. It is a Bill that every Deputy who has heard the speech in support of it will have no hesitation in voting for.  It simply asks that the small traders be allowed to carry on their business up to 9 o'clock on Saturday evenings instead of closing now at 7.30; that is, an hour and a half of an extension on Saturday evenings.  Against that they are reducing the working hours per week by one and a half hours.  It might be argued against this Bill that it is giving an advantage to the small traders over the larger firms.  It is quite plain to anyone who would wish to look into the matter that those people who deal in the larger houses are not the class who deal in the smaller shops for which we are pleading for these one and a half hours on Saturday evenings.</P>
      <P>I also plead for these one and a half hours extra opening on Saturday for the accommodation of the people of Dublin and the surrounding districts. In a city with the population of Dublin, it is not too much to ask that these shops would remain open up to 9 o'clock for the accommodation of the people who patronise them.  Deputy Dr. Hennessy has pointed out the great advantage and the help this Bill would be to the wives of the workers who are busy in the middle part of the day getting the dinner ready.  It is certainly a hardship on those people who have to do their shopping on Saturday evenings to walk down town and to find all the shops closed at 7.30.  I know I have only to appeal to the common sense of the Dáil and I have no doubt it will give a Second Reading to this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DOHERTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I interpose in this debate because of my special knowledge of Dublin.  I was interested during the last fifteen years in philanthropic societies dealing with the people who are dealt with in this Bill.  I thought when the last Act was brought in, that this matter of Saturday evening closing at 7.30 was a real blot upon the Bill, and for the reasons set forth by Deputy Hennessy and Deputy O'Connor, the <Col N="906" /> mover and seconder of this motion for Second Reading.  Now we have several Ministers here, including the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who, I hope, will not leave.  I ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with his knowledge of unemployment in the city, does he think it an advisable thing for his Department that further unemployment should be created?</P>
      <P>I know, fairly intimately, large numbers of people who are in this particular trade.  I say they are a credit to the city of Dublin.  They are poor, hardworking respectable people to whom the Bill of 1925 did gross injustice.  The only argument for including them in the Bill of 1925, with which this Bill is dealing, is that the assistants and the other people who are employed in the big firms and who are in trade unions would suffer.  That is all tommy-rot. These people suffered nothing.  The larger people and the larger shops are well able to look after themselves, and their interests are looked after in the Act of 1925.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is only common justice that these unfortunate people who are struggling along under difficulties and in circumstances that the big shops have not to meet, should be given this extra hour and a half.  Their trade is a catch trade and their trade may be at 6, 7, 8 or 9 in the evening.  It may be at such a time as the residents of that district get the money to spend.  Are these people at that hour to be precluded form selling their goods and making an honest livelihood?  We all know very well, and I suppose nobody better than President Cosgrave himself, who knows Dublin&mdash;I was going to say nearly as well as myself&mdash;better than myself, and who knows these people, how hard this restriction presses upon those decent and honest people.  The case is made that as they are not employing Trade Union labour &mdash;and I throw out that information for the benefit of Deputy Johnson&mdash;they are to be interfered with.  These people are providing for themselves and their families and doing it decently and are these restrictions that were placed upon them in July to be retained? I strongly support the arguments put forward by Deputy Hennessy <Col N="907" /> and Deputy O'Connor, and I ask the Dáil to give this Bill a second reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I have not been convinced by anything that I have heard up to this that there is a case made for repealing an Act which has passed through the Oireachtas so late as July of this year. Now I want to put to the Dáil, apart from the merits of this case altogether, the peculiar position in which the Oireachtas is going to be placed.  There are in one year two contradictory measures dealing with the same subject. I think it very undesirable that a thing of that kind should happen. Going a little further and examining this case, I find that Deputy Hennessy in July moved that Saturday opening should be extended from 7.30 to 8.30. He has had the advantage of adding half an hour to this proposed amendment.</P>
      <P>I submit that the Oireachtas passed this measure in July on the faith of the statement told us that there had been substantial agreement between two bodies of people, the employers and the employed.  The Dáil was told that friction would be avoided by the passing of the measure here which was passed then, that some agreement had been entered into in 1920 to close the drapery houses early, and that this agreement had not continued in force &mdash;I suppose that would be the best way to put it.  A number of people had entered into a trade who were not in it in 1920, and this particular measure was supposed to accommodate largely the majority of people affected.  I am using the word majority in its wider sense as comprising the majority of the people engaged in this particular occupation.</P>

    <P>I am not disposed to agree to a Second Reading of this measure.  If this measure were put forward in the way in which I think it ought to have been put forward, as a Private Bill by persons affected, a Private Bill which would be open to the examination it should get under ordinary Private Bill procedure, when, if there is a case to be made in regard to big damage being done to certain people by reason of the <Col N="908" /> measure we have passed, due consideration could be given to it, it would assume a different aspect.  The Dáil, however, is now placed in the position of having to take the simple statement that people are going to be ruined or are in process of being ruined, and so on.  I deprecate those statements.  If I were to agree to everything I heard both inside and outside as regards the ruination of people, there really should not be a man solvent in this country. In regard to every action taken by individuals, corporations, institutions and the Oireachtas, it would seem that everybody is going to be ruined.</P>

      <P>If I were to estimate their solvency by their physical perfection, I would say they were certainly very solvent.  I am not in a position to speak to this measure on its merits.  I am only speaking on it because of the debate that took place in the two Houses of the Oireachtas last July.  In view of that debate Deputy Hennessy has not made a case for the Second Reading.  Deputy Mulcahy, who introduced the original Bill here, the Bill having come from the Seanad, had the better of the controversy, as far as I could make out from the debate, over Deputy Hennessy.  In one case 400 houses were mentioned by Deputy Hennessy as being opposed to this Act now in operation.  In another case 250 houses were counted.  The number mentioned was 250 and, of the 250, 204 are houses in which assistants are not employed.  I would like to know if that statement is challenged, as I want to be perfectly correct in anything I am saying.  If there are 250, or even 400 houses, and considerable numbers of them are houses in which the members of the family do the business, how many houses are really concerned in the change as against the number who do not want it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned Private Bill procedure because those matters could be gone <Col N="909" /> into there.  If there has been a serious shrinking in receipts, a shrinking which compares badly with any shrinking which might be put up on the other side, on the side of the larger houses, then a case would be made for reconsideration of this matter in the light of the injustice that the measure passed in July would have brought about.  I am not satisfied with the case that has been made for reversing a decision arrived at only four or five months ago. I do not know what particular reason there was for changing the hour from 7 o'clock to 8 o'clock.</P>

Deputy Mulcahy drew attention to the fact that it was 8.30, and I think Deputy Hennessy did not contradict him.  Now, to leave the matter beyond all doubt, 9 o'clock is put down.  In all the circumstances I could not see my way to vote for the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>This is a proceeding in which an amending Bill is brought forward, as the President properly said, to a Bill passed in this House a few months ago.  I am in no way enthusiastic about the amending Bill.  I want to address the House on the subject of responsibility in connection with Bills of this sort.  The original Bill, to which this is an amending Bill, was brought into the Seanad and passed on to the Dáil, and the principles underlying that Bill, to say the least of it, are peculiar.  We are told that in an important trade in the city there was an agreement entered into between the parties concerned, but that agreement was not carried out.  To put that matter right, a Bill was brought in which restricted the hours of opening in this particular trade, and that Bill was passed by this House.  The essential feature in connection with that Bill was that it did not deal with the whole trade; it did not deal with any principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very seriously criticise the wisdom of dealing with trade matters in this <Col N="910" /> way.  I think it is far from desirable to legislate in this fashion.  Let us realise what this House has done in this matter.  The President says the amending Bill should properly have come forward as a Private Bill.  Surely if that applies to the amending Bill, it applies with still greater force to the original Bill?  This Bill came before the House without any examination, practically speaking.  There was certain criticism and it went through all its stages.  I claim as a person engaged in business, a business representative, that it was a very undue interference in trade matters with which this House was not made sufficiently conversant. The legislation enacted did not apply to even the whole of the trade concerned.  Is this House wise in dealing with such matters?  Any small section of any particular trade can come forward here and promote a Bill. What are we to do?  On what grounds can interference be justified?  Is the Dáil going to allow itself to become the medium by which one, two, or three people can come here and say that they want to restrict the liberties of people who are competing with them in trade? I am not concerned in this matter.  If anything, my sympathy is with that section of the people who say that it is a good thing to close houses at a certain hour on Saturday night.  If that is the principle that is being advocated why confine it to the drapery houses?  If I go down Talbot Street I see one house, an ironmongers; next door is a publichouse and next to that is another house in another trade.  The owner of the latter house is a man who sells boots and shoes.  He is going to be closed arbitrarily, but the adjoining houses in the street are to be allowed to remain open.  What I am concerned about is that there is a very serious principle underlying legislation of this sort.  Deputy Johnson will, I think, tell the Dáil that it is impossible to enforce certain working hours on people in these shops.  Is it right or proper to do so?  Have we to legislate to please everyone?  How can you select a particular area in the city or country in which certain houses are to close because the employees are being worked unduly long hours?  If the <Col N="911" /> Dáil is going to legislate in that way I am afraid Deputies will have their work cut out for them, as they will have a very confused mass of legislation to deal with.</P>
    <P>Trade unions have, I think, shown themselves very capable of dealing with the question of shop hours and other matters, and I must confess that I look with very grave apprehension on the Dáil taking any action such as was embodied in the original Bill.  Now this amending Bill comes along trying to impose conditions on people who promoted the original Bill.  It says that shops are to close on Wednesdays from nine to one.  In dealing with this question, the Dáil is bound to be utterly confused.  There is nothing to prevent another Bill coming along to amend this one.  I did not follow or oppose the original Bill, as it was my duty to do. I would suggest to the Dáil that the less interference there is with the flow of business the better for all concerned. If there is legislation of a general character to be enacted, let it be general and not be applied to any particular trade. There will be hopeless confusion if there is differentiation between trades.  I would be glad to hear what justification there is for such legislation as this. I think those who are asking for the amending Bill have a right to the relief they ask as regards Saturday closing. I maintain that their liberty should not be restricted any more than the liberty of shops next door to them.  No people should be singled out by law.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Hewat that the promotion of legislation in the Dáil to settle local trade questions is really a misuse of the Oireachtas.  I had that objection to the first Shops Act that this Bill seeks to amend.  I objected that it was too limited even in the trades affected, and even for those trades limited in regard to area.  If legislation of this sort is to become a habit the Dáil will be choked with legislation either originating or amending certain local trade matters.  Take this Bill on its merits.  It really effects three changes.  It cancels, for some <Col N="912" /> reason that I have not yet heard explained, exemption given in the previous Bill to businesses run completely by an employer's family.  Secondly, it fixes rigidly the areas in which businesses may be opened, and, thirdly, it inflicts a half-holiday compulsorily on certain days.  The first change I know nothing of.  I do not know what the explanation is or why the exemption clause of the last Bill is being cancelled.  The other two are more important.  I put it to the House for its serious consideration that the method of fixing hours under the old Shops Act by the local authority after local inquiry into the local circumstances was much more reasonable and a much more just method of dealing with this type of matter than introducing a Bill into the Oireachtas of the Saorstát effecting a small number of businesses in a particular place.  Supposing this Bill passes is there not going to be from Cork, Waterford and every other city a demand for legislation of a similar type?  Bills affecting business in these particular places will be brought up here and possibly go through the same procedure, one Act and then an amending Act.  The third point was put up to me based on a specious plea with regard to unemployment&mdash;the question of the weekly half-holiday. I hold that is dealing with unemployment.  If this Bill became law the situation in Dublin with regard to a big number of trades is that there will be two half-holidays.  There is a trade custom of arranging with workers of certain Unions for a holiday on a particular day and there is going to be enforced a holiday on another day and I ask: Let us posit the state of stagnation in trade which apparently it suits the convenience of the Dáil at this time to express, and see how it is going to be affected by two half-holidays in the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hennessy makes a plea for a nine o'clock opening on Saturday.  It cost me a certain amount of amusement. I do not pretend to quote accurately his words but I think he said that the wife and children of the wage-earner went to do business on Saturday. Work was finished at a certain time and they decided to go to a football <Col N="913" /> match.  After the football match Dr. Hennessy said, apparently realising that football matches do not go on to 7.30, they have their tea.  Why not make the hour in the Bill 11 o'clock and say that after their tea they have to go to the pictures?  If you go on like that you are going to fill up the Bill with a host of conclusions.  I do not think the case, based on the particular arguments of Deputy Hennessy, is going to meet with the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I was waiting for Deputy Johnson to voice his opinion on this Bill but, like a fox, Deputy Johnson has always a sly turn in him.  I will give him all the credit due, and on behalf of Labour I say he is a real Labour representative.  The President, in his remarks, laid great stress upon having two contradictory Bills introduced in the House within five months. He said he acted, more or less, as a kind of a medical adviser to Dr. Hennessy. He was, as it were, administering a soothing powder to Deputy Hennessy to keep him quiet.  To my mind the President's idea, as to the necessity of this Bill, was far-reaching. Although he is President of the State I think he must have been canvassed by somebody who is trying to influence the Government against passing this Bill.  I do not agree with the Minister for Industry and Commerce with regard to the workman and his family getting their necessaries after the pictures. If the Minister for Industry and Commerce has sufficient salary to enable him to go to those pictures, I can assure the Dáil that the majority of the workers have not sufficient means to go to the pictures.  Consequently the necessity does not arise for workers to get necessaries after the pictures.  I am sure I shall be asked why, as an independent Labour man, I support the Bill.  I went against the Bill introduced in the Seanad because at the time I thought the Bill was unjust. I think the same now.  I hold it is unjust to deprive a man who gives employment from opening his shop when you gave the privilege to a man who gives no employment.  If I am a draper and have sons, daughters or a <Col N="914" /> wife to manage a shop I can keep my premises open until 10, but because Deputy Johnson gives employment he must close at a certain hour.  Surely that is not fair.  If a person gives employment we want to keep, in employment, the people he is engaging.  Unless this Bill is passed by the Dáil you will have on the Labour Exchange more unemployed than you have now.</P>
      <P>Some of the Deputies may say people can get anything they want before 9 o'clock.  I agree that they can, because they have the means of getting it.  Some may say also that the majority they represent in this Dáil can also get anything they require before 9 o'clock.  That may be so, but take the man, working in the suburbs of Dublin, who cannot go to the pictures. Farmers hold on as long as they can before they give wages to the agricultural worker, and it is 6 o'clock before that employee receives his wages.  He gives a few shillings to his wife to support the family.  The wife finds certain boot shops closed but the huckster is open.  That huckster can profiteer if he so wishes.  The persons with no assistants to pay are open, but the traders who have to pay assistants are closed.  Consequently the wife of the industrious worker will have to pay more for her necessaries.  I want to see, if it is possible, that justice is done to every section of the community. The Act only applies to Dublin city and the suburbs.  I see nothing in the amending Act introduced by Deputy Hennessy as to why it also should not be accepted by the Dáil.  I agree with the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he said that Waterford, Cork, and other centres might attempt such legislation as this.  We are supposed to be a Free State, and if we are then why not allow citizens that freedom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have tied them down in the other Act of 1925 to a certain hour. You have decided that the shops must close at 7.30, but let me take the case of provision stores.  As regards these it does not matter how many assistants are employed in them they can remain open until 10 o'clock.  I suppose we may soon expect some legislation in connection with the liquor trade, but at <Col N="915" /> any rate the law at present is that public house bars can remain open on a Saturday night until 9.30.  Why should this difference be made in the case of a draper and why should he be victimised? I fail to see why the draper or boot merchant carrying on a respectable trade should be victimised in the matter of closing hours when there is no such regulation in the case of hardware merchants, provision merchants and others.  I think that Deputies representing not only the city and county of Dublin but every other constituency in the country would be doing an act of justice by supporting the Bill introduced by Deputy Dr. Hennessy.  In my opinion if Deputies fail to support this Bill it will mean that at least 20 per cent. of the assistants employed in drapery houses will have to join up in the labour exchanges. I have asked the opinion of several assistants in the city on this matter, and they have all told me that they are in agreement with the hours in this Bill.  Unless you want to have 20 per cent. of the drapers' assistants on the unemployment list, if not before Christmas certainly after it, I think Deputies should support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am impressed by Deputy Lyons' advocacy of the same cause that Deputy Hewat advocates&mdash; of freedom from legislative interference with trade.  They are both agreed that there should be no restriction on the hours that shops may open&mdash;in fact they are in favour of having shops open at all times so long as the proprietors desire it.  That is consistent with Deputy Hewat's usual advocacy, but I did not understand before that it was Deputy Lyons' view.  It is well, however, to learn as we live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I desire to say that I did not advocate that shops should be open all night.  What I did say was that I did not see why shops that employed assistants should be closed while shops that employed no assistants could remain open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand now that Deputy Lyons dissents from Deputy <Col N="916" /> Hewat; that is to say, that Deputy Lyons favours a restriction upon the hours that shops may open and an interference with the right of shopkeepers to open, but that in fact he agrees that there should be a restriction upon traders.  However, that is immaterial.  The Deputy has made quite a good point regarding the anomaly that traders who do not employ assistants are free under the present statutes to remain open.  That point was raised during the discussion of the earlier Bill, and when Deputy Nagle spoke on that point and agreed that there was a hardship in the matter, Deputy Dr. Hennessy said: &ldquo;I regret I cannot accept Deputy Nagle's suggestion, because it does not get over the difficulty of the public inconvenience.&rdquo; That is a quotation from Deputy Dr. Hennessy's speech.  If Deputy Dr. Hennessy has changed his views and agrees now with Deputy Lyons I put it to both the promoters of this Bill, that there may be a reasonable amendment to the original Bill, passed comparatively easily, I think very easily, to bring within the scope of the existing Act all traders, whether they employ assistants or not.  That, I think, would be a distinct amendment to and an improvement upon the present Act, and it would satisfy whatever is legitimate in the contentions of those who are behind the present proposal.  I put that forward to Deputy Dr. Hennessy and those for whom he speaks as a proposition about which, I think, there might be fairly general agreement, except perhaps that there may be other Deputies who would stand for the shopkeepers who do not employ labour. Nevertheless, I think we could get over the difficulty that Deputy Lyons has stressed by that method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hewat, supported to some extent by the Minister, decried this method of legislation, and in the abstract perhaps they have some justification, but we must bear in mind that both the Minister and the Deputy, and most, or all of us, did agree upon taking over the social legislation of this character which was already in operation and we have not up to now repealed it.  Now that legislation in respect to shop hours did, in fact, <Col N="917" /> discriminate between trade and trade, between shop and shop, for under the Shop Hours Act the trade itself had to decide in respect to shops within that trade&mdash;not in respect to their neighbours in other trades&mdash;so that the legislation we carried over was of this differential kind which Deputy Hewat deplores.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Hennessy referred to the agreement on which he said the original Bill of last July was passed. He quoted certain figures regarding the proposal to limit hours of closing as being taken by a plebiscite of the trade under the Shop Hours' Act.  He said that out of 654 votes cast, 392 were against and 262 were for the proposed limitation of hours.  I would remind Deputies that the electorate who vote under such elections are the owners of the shops, irrespective of the number of persons employed in the shops or the number of persons affected by the proposed closing order.</P>
    <P>Every small shopkeeper, employing any number of persons, no matter how few, had equal votes with the largest shopkeeper, employing, perhaps, hundreds, and in this plebiscite the 262 persons who voted for the proposed restriction on the hours, proposed at that time, probably represented ten times the number of persons engaged in the trade, as the 392, who voted against the proposal, and the effect of the situation undoubtedly was that you had small traders who had one or two or three assistants, or no assistants, taking advantage of the extension of the hours beyond that which the employers and employed had agreed upon, eating into the business of the organised employers who had agreed with their employees about the hours of closing.  There has been, of course, a considerable increase in the number of such trading shops in recent years.</P>
    <P>The agreement that was referred to was an agreement entered into by representatives of the employees who covered 80 per cent. of the shops in the city, and covered probably 80 per cent., possibly more, of the employed persons in the trade.  At the present time 90 per cent. of the people engaged either on <Col N="918" /> the employing side or the employed side are in favour of the present hours in regard to Saturday nights, and are against a change in the existing hours in the direction desired by this Bill and the number opposing is a very small minority.  Now it is said that the people affected do 60 per cent. of their trade on Saturdays, and 50 per cent. of that 60, that is 30 per cent. of the whole week's trade, between the hours of 7 and 10 on Saturday nights.  That is a matter that I ask Deputies to take into account, and it is probably a growing proportion.  The amount taken on Saturday nights between the hours of 7 and 10 is a growing proportion, and unfortunately owing to the laxity with which the recent Act is administered we find there are existing business houses quite prepared to defy the law, and, in view of the fines inflicted, to take little account of the prosecutions that may and do take place, and are doing a very considerable business in these three hours.  But that is by the way.</P>
    <P>There is said to be 400 traders affected by these provisions who are anxious that this Bill should extend the hours of traders on Saturday nights. That figure has been named in any case and I will take it.  If we assume as a small average that the week's trade is, say, £40, a little calculation will show that the three hours' Saturday night trade is of a value of £11,000 to the traders who are open during these hours.  Now that is a considerable plum.</P>
    <P>The traders who have agreements with their employees look with envy upon that £11,000 of trade.  Whatever the sum may be it is enough to create a feeling of envy and anxiety at the loss of it to-day, and a desire to get it back, and the proposal here is to extend the hours to 9 o'clock, and by such means to force owners of other shops, who are keeping their agreement with their employees, to open during these hours and to take back the trade which those, unorganised-and-unbound-by-agreements traders have already succeeded in obtaining.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SEAN LYONS</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is now as it was before, that if there is to be a general extension of the hours of opening on Saturday nights, then very many of the traders who at present close, and who have agreements with their employees, will be forced to break these agreements for the purpose of getting back some of that trade.  We are going to have the position created that the small trader who refuses to enter into an agreement with his employees, is going to force the larger trader who is willing to enter into an agreement with his employees, and carry on his business in a properly organised fashion, to retaliation, and to create general disorganisation.</P>
      <P>It is not of very great importance to deal with what has been stressed about the probable increase of unemployment. It would be of importance if there was any foundation for such a suggestion. As a matter of fact, the boot is on the other foot, and what will happen, if this Bill becomes law, will be that there will be disorganisation and consequent unemployment arising out of the proposals in the Bill.  I suggest to Deputies interested in this matter, that they would do far better to endeavour to meet the people concerned in the organisations concerned, whether the Merchant Drapers' Association or the Irish Union of Distributive Workers, with a view to coming to a proper understanding as to the kind of legislation that would be acceptable to meet the reasonable objections that have been suggested, such as that objection about the single family shop.  There is something good in this Bill, and that is the abolition of Sunday trading.  That is a consequential result of this Bill.  I think there could be general agreement upon that point.  There could be agreement on the point that it is undesirable to exclude from the operations of the present law the single family shop, because they are really taking an unfair advantage of people who have consented, in the public interest, to limit their trading activities.</P>

      <P>There is, of course the very big objection to this Bill that was mentioned by the President, that it is, in effect, removing the option that has been in force for a long time regarding the day on which traders will close for the half-holiday.  This Bill compels every trader to close for the half-holiday on Wednesday, and the probable result would be to endeavour to force open those shops which are at present closed on Saturday.  Very many of the shops in the city, particularly in the centre of the city, choose the Saturday closing instead of the Wednesday closing, but the effect of this Bill will be to compel them to close on Wednesday which, in effect, would be to compel them to open on Saturday. That is not going to ease the situation for the small trader.  The small trader is going to lose more than he is going to gain by this Bill if that happens.</P>
      <P>Without dealing with other effects of the Bill, I leave the matter with this proposition: that Deputy Hennessy should not press the Bill at this stage and run the risk of having it defeated and never hearing anything more about it or any other Bill of the kind, but that he should withdraw the Bill and enter into a conference with the organisation of the employees or their representatives and see if there could not be an agreement come to to remove the defects of the present law.  Then there might well be an agreed measure with a view to amending the Act passed as late as July last.  An amendment of that Act, which is really an amendment literally as well as technically, would not create the same objection as a reversal of the policy outlined in that Act.  Although we were told a day or two ago that we were never going to agree with the President, I agree with him that it is undesirable to reverse policy within three months in a matter of social legislation of this kind, unless there is very strong grounds of an emergency character to support such a proposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to offer a few remarks in support of the Bill.  When <Col N="921" /> the Act that is now in force was being discussed in the Dáil last July, I felt that it was one that had not got the consideration that it was entitled to, and I think that that is evidenced by the fact that an amending Bill has been introduced and is supported in a good many quarters that were indifferent about the matter before.  I quite agree with Deputy Johnson that there ought to be an effort made to try and solve this problem, other than on the lines of the existing Act or the Bill before the Dáil.  A section of the traders are favoured by the existing Act.  A large section of traders are victimised by it.</P>
      <P>I admit that there is something in the argument put forward on behalf of the assistants as regards the matter of later hours.  It is to the credit of those who have worked on their behalf that they have secured for them much of the comforts that they now enjoy in that respect.  At the same time, I think there is an inclination to overdo the matter by suggesting that the one and a half hours on Saturday will cause them any hardship.  It seems to be overlooked in introducing legislation of this kind that the public ought to be considered to some extent.  Marketing on Saturdays is an old-time custom in Dublin, and it is very difficult to change it on the lines of the existing Act, which only deals with a section of the trade.  At present shopping may be stopped at 7.30 on a Saturday evening. Anyone who goes through Dublin between six and nine p.m. on a Saturday can see that there is a considerable amount of marketing done by the working classes.  Having regard to the arguments put forward in favour of this Bill, it is my intention, at any rate, to support it for the present, but I think some consideration ought to be given to the suggestion of Deputy Johnson to endeavour to deal with this question on broader lines than those suggested in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I feel constrained to vote against this Bill.  It is a direct reversal of the Act put on the statute book last summer.  By passing this amending Bill, in my opinion, the Dáil would be stultifying itself by voting what is really a direct <Col N="922" /> negative to the legislation passed in July last.  I am quite ready to admit that the Act passed last summer has been prejudicial to a limited number of people in the drapery trade who are interested in this Bill.  It is inevitable that almost any useful Act, no matter how ameliorative, should hit a few, but we should always try and legislate for the majority.  It has been put up to me, and I firmly believe it, that taking the drapery trade alone, the majority of those engaged in it are in favour of this Bill.  Deputy Johnson put the case very fairly.  He said there are a certain number of people in the drapery business who employ a large number of assistants and who have carried out this agreement and closed their shops, out of loyalty to the agreement, at 6.30 p.m. on Saturday.  Take a street in my own constituency.  This Bill, if passed, would make this differentiation, that certain traders on one side of Talbot Street would be allowed to keep open until 9 p.m. on Saturdays, while other traders, in order to carry out their agreement, would have to close their shops at 6.30 p.m.  Is it fair to these traders that on account of their loyalty they should be victimised and lose the huge amount of trade which Deputy Hennessy tells us is carried on between 6.30 and 9 p.m. on Saturdays?  There is now a happy state of affairs existing between the traders I speak of and their employees.  Does the Deputy think it fair to interrupt that happy state of affairs?  If only in the interests of good citizenship, I think Deputies should vote against this Bill.  I do not believe in trying to face both ways, and if we want to keep up the reputation of the Dáil as a deliberative assembly, we should not record our votes in favour of a Bill that is a direct negative to the legislation passed last July.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer to the point made by Deputy Johnson.  If there is anything in the Bill to make it compulsory on all the people concerned to observe Wednesday as the half-holiday, we are prepared to accept an amendment that any shop having Saturday as a weekly half-holiday may remain open until 6.30 on <Col N="923" /> Wednesday evening.  If the Second Reading passes, we are prepared to include an amendment such as that I have just referred to.  I find that an attempt is made by different speakers to uphold the statement that was made on the passing of the 1925 Act and the statement that succeeded in getting the 1925 Act passed by the small majority of two.  That was the statement that the Bill was giving effect to an agreement. I have given figures to show that 392 of the traders affected in Dublin voted against the closing at 7.30, and 262 for it.  That leaves a substantial majority for the continuance of trading until 10 o'clock.  In face of those figures, arrived at under the guidance of the Corporation of Dublin, it is useless to speak of the existence of any agreement.  To trot out that agreement in order to uphold the Act that was passed under a misunderstanding, I do not think is really fair.</P>

    <P>A good deal has been said about the procedure of the present Bill.  If the procedure adopted in the present Bill is objectionable, it is owing to the objectionable procedure adopted in the Act that was passed last July.  The President's objection is one that would have a good deal of substance in it under certain circumstances.  He says &mdash;and Deputy Mrs. Collins O'Driscoll repeats&mdash;that it would be stultifying this House to repeal an Act passed as late as last July.  I think it would be more discreditable to this House to allow an Act to remain on the statute book that was based on a misunderstanding and that inflicted a serious injustice on a body of deserving citizens. I realise that we are up against very influential opposition and against a rather unexpected combination.  We <Col N="924" /> had the Vice-Chairman of the Seanad interesting himself in the 1925 Act. We had the President supporting it.</P>
    <P>The President is in opposition to the present Bill and so is Mr. Johnson.  I admit it is a very doughty combination, but I would ask Deputies not to be influenced by personalities.  It has been said that the giving of 1½ hours to these people&mdash;that means the difference to them between solvency and insolvency &mdash;will injure the larger traders.  I do not agree with that, because these people are simply acting as retailers for the wholesale traders at certain hours.  In acting as retailers, they are making it a commercial proposition for the larger wholesale houses to close at 6 o'clock and give their assistants the opportunity of having their half day and those early hours.  In the present Bill, we are only asking 47½ hours' work.  In fact, we would be satisfied, if the demand be made at a later stage, to give 46 hours as against 49 hours in the old Act.  We are only asking for the 1½ hours because it is necessary in order that those people may support themselves and their families and keep their assistants in employment.  We are giving a good deal instead of those 1½ hours.  I have no personal interest in those small traders, but many of them are in my constituency and I think it right to give them an opportunity to live.  I would ask Deputies not to be swayed by the great personalities opposed to us.  Do justice above all things.  I object to the principle of repealing an Act which is only a short time on the statute book, but I prefer to repeal an unjust statute than to create a greater injustice by allowing it to remain.</P>
