      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether a claim has been received from Messrs. J. Fahy &amp; Co., Ltd., Commercial Buildings, Galway, for compensation for goods commandeered by British Forces in 1921, to the amount of £115 11s. 9d., and if he can state how soon settlement of this claim may be expected.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, in the administration of the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923, agreements have been arrived at between applicants on the one hand and the State Solicitor and the representatives of the Executive Council upon the other, whereby both the form and amount of compensation were fixed, subject to the judge's decision as to whether the Act applied; whether in many such cases where the judge decided <Col N="2320" /> that the Act did apply, his reports for the sum so agreed upon were not acted upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that I have many individual cases in mind.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware that in one case, where the amount agreed upon was £86&mdash;it was agreed upon by the State Solicitor, the accredited Government representative, and by the applicant, and it was submitted to the Judge, and the Judge decided it came within the Act&mdash;the amount sent by the Ministry of Finance to the applicant was £1, with £12 costs to the solicitor.  I need scarcely say that the £1 and the £12 were returned.  I have many instances which I hope to be able to bring to the notice of the Minister when the Estimates come on.</P>

      <P>I think it would be better if the Deputy would ask the questions and bring them to my notice now.  It is utterly useless to bring them to my notice at the time of the Estimates.  I must have notice, so as to enable me to have cases investigated. In certain cases fraudulent claims have been put forward, and perhaps there has been a provisional agreement, but if the fraud is discovered afterwards, as I suppose is the case in such instances as that mentioned by the Deputy, of course the agreement would not be confirmed.</P>

      <P>In July, 1923, a grant of £326 13s. 4d. on an estimated expenditure of £490 was sanctioned towards the cost of erecting a class-room to provide additional accommodation for 32 children in the case of Killoran National School.  This grant was notified to the Manager and the Board of Works on 17th July, 1923.</P>
      <P>In reply to a communication from the Department of Education as to the delay in utilising this grant the Manager stated, on 22nd January, 1925, that he found difficulty in providing the local contribution, and he asked that the classroom be erected in a different position to that proposed by the Board of Works, as this would reduce the cost of the work.  The matter having been brought under the notice of the Board of Works, that Department stated that the plan suggested by the Manager would necessitate the erection of a second porch and the cost of this work would exceed the cost of trunking around the classroom as already designed; they, therefore, considered that the original plan should be adhered to. The observations of the Board of Works were conveyed to the Manager, who, however, renewed his application for an alteration in the plan and stated that his suggestion would be more economical and as suitable as the plan proposed by the Board of Works, that he had the site examined by an experienced builder and that in the opinion of the latter the cost of trunking would run very high, probably to £70 or £80 and that there is no necessity for a second porch.</P>

      <P>On a claim to unemployment insurance benefit made by Christopher Ryan on the 28th March 1925, he appeared to be entitled to benefit for 90 days, being the maximum number of days payable in the current benefit year before any payment was made, however, information reached the Department which made it necessary <Col N="2323" /> to enquire whether one of the statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment insurance benefit was, in fact, fulfilled by Mr. Ryan.  The claim is still under investigation, and it is hoped that the enquiries will be completed at an early date.  Meanwhile benefit cannot be paid.</P>

      <P>A claim to refund of contributions made by Mrs. Julia Dempsey, of Powerscourt, Eyre Street, Droichead Nua, was received in this Department on 30th March, 1925.  As the number of the unemployment book quoted on her claim was incorrect, inquiries had to be instituted to ascertain the correct number.  In addition, the fact that the evidence of birth furnished was in her maiden name made it necessary to obtain a certificate of marriage.  The papers have been referred to the local office, Droichead Nua, for this purpose.  As soon as the required evidence is received the claim will be dealt with without delay.</P>

      <P>An appointment as inspector of mines and quarries was made in March, 1925, under Section 6 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1924.  The vacancy was duly advertised in the Press, the insertions in the Dublin and Cork daily papers appearing between the 16th and 19th December, 1924.  Over 250 inquiries were received in answer to the advertisement and 63 candidates completed the prescribed application form, the selection being subsequently made from amongst these candidates by a Selection Board appointed by the Civil Service Commission.  The qualifications required were that the candidate should <Col N="2325" /> hold a first class certificate under the Coal Mines Regulation Acts and should have been employed within the last five years for not less than two years as a manager or under manager of a coal mine, or in some other responsible capacity requiring regular underground attendance in a coal mine. Practical knowledge and experience of metalliferous mining and of quarrying, as well as a knowledge of the use and practice of electricity in mining and quarrying were treated as additional qualifications, and a knowledge of the laws relating to mines and quarries was stated to be also desirable.  A candidate, to be successful, was required to satisfy the Civil Service Commission in respect of age, health and character, the age limits being 25 to 35 years, and it was specified that preference would be given to ex-National Army candidates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place the candidate would have to be fully qualified.  If there were any particular qualifications that were specified as being essential he would have to have them.  If there were other qualifications that would be regarded as desirable additional qualifications, they would be weighed against the fact that he had National Army experience. But allow a man to be taken on if he not allow a man to be taken on if he had not the essential qualifications and experience.</P>

      <P>I hope the discussion will be closed upon the special points replied to.  We are now embarking on the third day's discussion of these Estimates, and I think it is only right that the various points brought out in the previous days' discussions should be replied to, and I hope to be able to reply to them to the satisfaction of the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the earliest points raised in these Estimates bore on the charges collected for the delivery of telegrams in rural areas.  This charge was introduced practically two years ago.  It had existed in the old British days in a more modified form but during the war it was discontinued.  We found after examination that it was necessary for financial reasons and from the point of view of equity to reintroduce it.  The amount collected for the porterage of telegrams, in the first year, amounted to about £41,000; the present collection will be somewhat less than that amount £41,000 is not a small sum of money, and, as I pointed out, we are already losing cent. per cent on our telegraph business.  The State must try to draw the line, in its losses, somewhere.  It may be that a sum of forty or forty one thousand pounds or whatever the figure may be could be lightly glossed over, and worked into the general national finances without being <Col N="2329" /> seen.  It only takes twenty-five such sums to make a million of money, and a million of money is a big factor in our general finances, and it is by overlooking sums like this that we neglect the millions.</P>
    <P>That is one feature.  Another, from the same view point, is that this sum of forty thousand pounds could be usefully applied to industry.  It would help agriculture, and it might help a variety of things in the State and, certainly, a variety of things that would be more useful to the State than merely parting with it in the way it has been done hitherto.  I see no reason whatever, nor did I at any time, why the recipients of telegrams should not pay for the cost of the delivery of them. We are asking for that to-day, and no more.  We make no profit on the transaction and certainly we are not prepared to accept anything less.  It is just one of those ordinary transactions for which the citizens must pay and there is no reason why they should escape it simply because the State is the agent.  If the rural resident desires to have delivered to him some article of ordinary consumption from a neighbouring town, well, I am very sure he would have to pay for it either directly or indirectly.  Likewise, if he wants a telegram delivered it is only just that he should pay for it.  If he does not wish to have it delivered he can inform the local postmaster that he does not desire that his telegrams should be delivered to him by special messenger, in which case they can be posted and delivered through the medium of the post the following morning.  He can have it one way or another.  We intend to continue the present charges.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hewat has suggested that the present Civil Service bonus should be absorbed in a common wage.  I do not know whether the Minister for Finance has gone into that question or not.  I have not, at any rate, gone into it.  My own view is that it is premature. However, it is a matter for general Governmental policy, not for one particular Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin urged the Post Office to extend its insurance business.  The Post Office has been doing some insurance <Col N="2330" /> business in a limited way, and it does not look at the moment as if it were likely to extend very rapidly.  I personally consider that there are grounds for the consideration of this business.  The nation is parting with some £4,000,000 to foreign companies just now, and I doubt if it is getting very full value in return.  Anyhow, that is a debatable question and one on which many people have different views.  However, it is a question that should receive early consideration. Whether a Department like mine should go deeper into this question is a matter on which I do not venture an opinion, though I feel that it is a Department that could extend in that way.  I feel that there is room for extension and I would not be averse to it. As a matter of fact I would rather like the idea of the Government taking up consideration of the whole insurance business.  As far as the activities of the Post Office in that direction are concerned, they are not very hopeful at the moment.  Deputy Davin also seemed to conclude that the Post Office administration had something to say to the retirement of 657 officials from this Department under Article 10 of the Treaty.  It had nothing whatever to say to the retirement of these officials.  Immediately after the Treaty, practically every one of these applicants for retirement availed of that opportunity&mdash;at least gave an intimation of their intention to retire.  That decision on their part was come to at a time when they could not have anticipated either good or bad treatment at the hands of the Department.  The fact is that a big number of the civil servants were nearing the normal age of retirement and the Treaty Article gave them an opportunity of adding some years to their term of service that would not ordinarily have been included.  Besides that, there were at the time a great many people who concluded that the advantage of a substantial pension would make them very much better off in the outside world, seeing that a lot of people thought in the years 1921 and 1922 that we were likely to be in for a kind of <i>El Dorado.</i>  That did not materialise. Nevertheless, that was the viewpoint and they concluded that the <Col N="2331" /> addition of a pension would simply make them.  It has not worked out that way.  Many people who went out on pension, and availed of Article 10 of the Treaty, would be very glad to get back again.  They now find that they made a serious mistake.  That is their own look out.  My Department resisted, as far as possible, the extension of the provisions of Article 10 to anyone.  We could not see that men who denied that they were Nationalists, had any justification, or that there was any truth in the contention, that they could not serve a native Government. We never believed that story, and we did our best to prevent the extension of the provisions of Article 10 to the overwhelming majority of those people.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCullough and a number of other Deputies urged that we should either discontinue the collection of the sixpenny tax on parcels or introduce some kind of clearing house scheme, which would facilitate business people. I take it that the Deputies who spoke on this point were mainly concerned with business people.  Very few have sympathy with those who avail of the advertisements in English newspapers to buy articles on the other side, instead of buying them at home.  I certainly have very little sympathy with that class of trade, considering that the finances of our Exchequer, and the rates of the country and employment in the country are dependent, to no small extent, on the business that these shopkeepers do.  We have a certain amount of sympathy, no doubt, with the shopkeeper who is put to a good deal of inconvenience in these daily collections.  If the shopkeepers, or the business people, can see any way by which the charge may be reduced or its collection facilitated, a suggestion from them will be sympathetically considered. I cannot promise more, because on a matter of this kind I am bound up by the regulations of the Ministry of Finance.  Certainly, I am prepared to give sympathetic consideration to any proposals that may come from business people.  The imposition of this tax has been a useful one to the traders of this country.  They are now <Col N="2332" /> realising that fact.  At first they jumped to the conclusion that it would be of no assistance and give a good deal of trouble.  In the interval, the number of incoming parcels annually dropped from 2,900,000 to close on 2,000,000&mdash;or a drop of nearly one-third in the space of twelve months. The former import of these parcels was 3,000,000 and the export one million, leaving a margin of 2,000,000 parcels in favour of the exporter on the English side.  We had to deliver those 2,000,000 excess parcels.  We had practically nothing for the work, except a sum of threepence per parcel for delivery and everybody will agree that threepence would not go any distance in meeting the expense of delivery. The delivery tax of sixpence enables us to go a long way to meet the deficit suffered from the excess import.  It has not entirely met it, but it has increased our revenue by £50,000, and it has deflected a considerable trade to Irish shopkeepers, the volume of which can be measured in terms of one million parcels.</P>
    <P>These two facts are sufficient justification for the introduction of that charge of 6d.  When we have arrived at the stage that the incoming and outgoing parcels balance each other, we may consider whether it will not be possible to remove the collection altogether. If we arrived at such a balance of outgoing and incoming parcels, the removal of the charge could be reasonably considered.  I gave that promise at the introduction of this charge, and I have not departed from it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan referred to party-lines for rural telephones.  There was no necessity to remind us of the importance of party lines from the standpoint of economy.  You cannot have an extensive extension of telephones in rural parts, because of the expense of individual installations.  You can do it only through the party line system.</P>

      <P>I can assure Deputy Heffernan that the party system, from the point of view of expense, will be fully availed of on every opportunity, now that we are arriving at the stage when we should be able to extend 'phones into farmers' houses.  The Deputy also mentioned the hardship suffered by country people through the withdrawal of bank holiday deliveries. That withdrawal was not initiated in our time.  It existed long before our time, and if we were to reintroduce deliveries on those days it would cost the tidy sum of £10,000.  I ask the Dáil whether we would be justified in letting loose a whole army of postmen through the country on bank holidays for the delivery of a letter or two in some districts.  I do not think we would.  In rural England, with all their money, they have not thought that an extension of this kind was justified.</P>

      <P>Yes.  We are always glad to get suggestions for the running of a Department of this kind.  When a useful suggestion is made, it is taken up and developed as far as possible.  For that reason, I am glad that several Deputies suggested the introduction of the &ldquo;zone&rdquo; system for parcels and letters.  Without very careful examination, we cannot say whether the &ldquo;zone&rdquo; system would be practicable or not, but we will promise to examine it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooper urged a direct exchange of parcels with France, because of the new silk and other import duties in England.  These duties do not affect our trade with France in any way.  Our <Col N="2334" /> parcels come direct and untouched.  In any case, our means of direct communication with that country are too restricted to enable us to concentrate on a parcels business there.  Comparisons were made with the more general delivery of letters in Switzerland.  We give here&mdash;with the exception of a few rural areas&mdash;one delivery per day.  In a great many towns we give two deliveries and in certain cities we give three deliveries.  My own opinion is that in no case should we give more than one delivery to a private house. Any additional number, I believe, is superfluous and a loss of public money. In a number of cases we are giving a second delivery, but whether that second delivery will be wiped out or not I cannot say.  Certainly we have no intention of increasing it.  It is easy to make comparisons with foreign countries.  Switzerland is a large hotel. We are in a very different position. The Swiss people must necessarily spend money in this particular way to get money.  We have no intention, at the moment, of making any increase in our deliveries.  I believe that this money can be better spent otherwise, and we cannot have deliveries without expenditure of public moneys.</P>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan, I think, referred to the increase of expenditure on the headquarters staff by £8,125.  Five thousand pounds of this increase is due to increased cost-of-living bonus.  The balance is accounted for by ordinary increments. Our headquarters staffs are, in the main, composed of new men consequent on retirements due to Article 10.  Their salaries increase from year to year.  There is no undue expense incurred in connection with our headquarters, but we find it necessary to keep headquarters strong.  We find it is good business.  Expenditure at the head is very often expenditure in the right direction.  At any rate, we have found it to be so.  Deputy Johnson seems to be somewhat alarmed at the proposal that we should part with any of our factory operations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>During the debate on the Shannon Bill somebody&mdash;I think it <Col N="2335" /> was the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;referred to the possibility of some big electrical manufacturing company getting going in this country.  In the last year, according to a booklet dealing with trade and shipping statistics, the amount of money sent out of this country for electrical goods reached the formidable figure of £400,000.  With the Shannon scheme, and with a growing development in telephones, that figure will be materially augmented in the next three or four years, and it may, perhaps, be doubled.  Clearly, there is room here for an electrical industry.  Whether it should be run by the State or by private enterprise is a matter on which people hold different views.  In either event, it will mean a big expenditure, a very big expenditure, of initial capital.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the State ought to embark on a great electrical industry. I do not think it would be able to handle it as effectively as, let us say, some English or foreign electrical people.  I cannot conceive how it could. I would be very glad to be told how; but I am not satisfied that we could. At the same time, I am satisfied that we ought to encourage the setting up of an electrical industry.  There is really too much money being sent out of this country in this respect.  In any case, it is a key industry and we cannot get on without key industries.  If a foreign industry is started here, one of the initial requirements will be that the Post Office work, the total Post Office electrical work, outside the area of repairs, should be its monopoly within reasonable prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pretty sure, at any rate, that no foreign industry will start here if the Government intends to maintain a rival factory.  I do not <Col N="2336" /> think it would be justified, from its own viewpoint.  Now, there is just one other point that I have to refer to. During the last week I have had a number of discussions with the Minister for Finance on the question of broadcasting. The Minister has agreed to my proposal to run broadcasting by the State.  It is intended to erect a main station at Dublin and a subsidiary station at Cork.  At a later stage this plant will, no doubt, be supplemented. For the present it is intended to confine ourselves to those two stations.  The cost of the main station and the substation&mdash;the laying down cost&mdash;will, we estimate, reach the figure of £9,000.  We anticipate that the mechanical upkeep and the cost of programmes will work out at something like £20,000 a year. We believe&mdash;though this is a guess and there is nothing to guide us, not very much anyway&mdash;that the first year ought to bring about 10,000 subscribers, at £1 per subscriber.  This would leave us in the first year with a loss of about £10,000.  In the second year it is thought that the number of subscribers ought to reach 15,000, or perhaps somewhat more, and we have concluded that in the third year the station will pay its way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware there are 15,000 crystal set users in Belfast city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Within five years we believe the original loss will be wiped out.  Now, there are 20,000 subscribers in the Six Counties.  We have endeavoured to ascertain what part of this number is due to the installation of a station there.  It will be agreed that the Belfast mind is a little more pro-English than the Dublin mind, and that the development of broadcasting in that city had reached a higher degree at the time of the introduction of the station than has been the case here, where we have had only somewhat over 2,000 people owning up.  The number may have been somewhat more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say how many crystal-set users, who have only a short radius&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not been able to ascertain that.  We are inclined to think the number of non-crystal sets were pretty numerous at the time of the introduction of the broadcasting station.</P>

      <P>Anyhow, we have come to the conclusion that these figures which I have quoted fairly well represent the position.  Everybody knows you can quote different figures, but you have nothing to support them. At the best, it is a calculation only&mdash;a guess.  In the course of the debate information was sought regarding the statistical tax authority.  Deputy Cooper desired to know whether we had any authority for the introduction of this tax in the first instance.  At the time I stated that the Dáil was notified in the previous Estimates that this tax would be introduced.  Anybody who takes the trouble to refer to my statement on that occasion will see that it was very definite.  I said, subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance&mdash;an approval which I anticipated securing&mdash;that the tax of 6d. on parcels would be introduced at a certain date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose moving under Standing Order 93 for a reconsideration of this Vote for a certain reason which I propose to set out, very largely following on the statement that the Minister has just made, but largely owing to the very nature of the Vote that we have before us.  I suggest to the Dáil that it is quite impossible for the Dáil to give the consideration that a Vote of this kind requires with only one side of the Department's balance sheet before it.  We have got before us here the Estimates.  I have not intervened in this debate before because I was waiting to get hold of the official report of the Minister's speech in introducing this Vote last Thursday. I have gone through that speech, and I still fail to find in it any statement of some of the essential figures representing <Col N="2338" /> the revenue side of the balance sheet.  All we have got before us in this Estimate is the expenditure side of the balance sheet.  I will touch upon this more fully later on.  The Minister has already mentioned certain important decisions which he has taken.  He has intimated other decisions that he probably will, or may, take in regard to the delivery of telegrams and the delivery of letters.  All these decisions follow upon information at his disposal respecting the balance of revenue as against expenditure.</P>
      <P>Those decisions, I suggest, are not Government decisions, under the Constitution. They are the decisions directly of the Minister responsible to the Dáil, and therefore we ought to have this particular service brought before us in a form different from the form that has been adopted for other Departments.  It is quite right and perfectly just that the Department of Finance should be brought under the review of the Dáil only in respect to expenditure and in the form of Estimates for expenditure, because there is no revenue on the other hand to balance the matter.  It is perfectly correct that the Department of Industry and Commerce, where there is an expenditure but no revenue, should have the expenditure placed before us in the ordinary form of the Estimates.  But in the case of the Post Office, I suggest that is not a practicable or a wise course, and particularly that it is an unwise course, having regard to the fact that the Constitution has made this particular Minister who is in charge of the Department so accountable, specifically and deliberately responsible to the Dáil as a whole.</P>

These extern Ministers are nominated by the Dáil, and there is a distinction laid down in the Constitution. Apart from that, the Minister for Finance will not deny that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is different from every other Department in this: that its decision should be very largely motived on questions of economy, and these questions of economy cannot be determined until we know not merely what are the outgoings, but also the Dáil should be able to know what the incoming is.  I am not entering on a criticism of this particularly.  I know this is a form of estimate that the Minister has received.  It is one that has been adopted before in the practice of another country, and we have taken it over.  I do not say that the Minister should, on this particular occasion, have introduced his estimates in the form I now suggest.  If he had done so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very well. if it is the responsibility of the Executive Council to bring in estimates in this particular form, that is simply determined by the precedents that have prevailed in this particular case.  I suggest now, for the consideration of the Dáil, that these precedents are not applicable to a Department of this kind, where you have not merely an outgoing but an incoming also, and where you have very important decisions, decisions not taken by the Executive Council, but decisions at least taken on the initiative of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

      <P>If the Minister for Finance is going to conduct a duologue with me I am quite content to conduct it and to go into matters <Col N="2340" /> that he and I discussed before.  I might remind the Minister for Finance that it was I who stated originally in the Constituent Assembly that the extern Ministers would be simply digits on the hands of the Executive Council, and that it was the Minister who denied that, and said that these Ministers would be separately and individually responsible.  If the Minister is now coming round to the point of view I then held I welcome him as a convert, though I am not particularly glad to see it.</P>
      <P>In any case, there are various matters that the Dáil is asked to take a decision in regard to.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, last Thursday, informed us that the Department was now losing less than it did at the beginning. The loss has fallen now to £600,000.  I want to make it clear that when I ask that future reports (I will not call them estimates) of this particular Department presented to the Dáil, should be presented in a form showing expenditure on the one hand and revenue on the other, I am not going to urge, what I believe Deputy Hewat has already, that no expenditure should be taken outside the revenue.  I am not urging that in the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson last year stated&mdash; quite correctly in my judgment, at least he expressed my view in so saying &mdash;that there are certain losses which might be incurred by a department that would be quite right and proper for that department to incur and that we could not look at the thing strictly from a business standpoint in that respect. We ought to know where that loss occurs and we ought to have that fulness of information before us by which we can detect: &ldquo;Here is a loss and here is a gain.&rdquo;  We ought to be able to decide whether these losses are justified or whether these gains are justified. Take the case that the Minister mentioned to-day&mdash;the question of losses on telegrams to which reference has been made.  This is what he said last Thursday: &ldquo;The charges for delivery are not included in the telegraph revenue.  They are treated separately. The telegraph revenue for last year&rdquo;&mdash;<Col N="2341" /> and he interposed here&mdash;&ldquo;I have not the figures here, because we are not dealing with a section of the revenue; we are dealing with the whole service &mdash;amounted to something in the neighbourhood of £200,000.  The expenditure exceeded £400,000.  It was something like £420,000.&rdquo;  Now I suggest that figures of that kind should not only be set out in that form before this Dáil but that the Minister should not say: &ldquo;I have not the figures here.&rdquo;  We ought to have these figures here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy referring to the expenses of last year and the receipts for last year, or the estimated receipts for the coming year?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the expenses for the previous year.  We ought to have them in order that we might be able to determine on them exactly what policy in particular respects the Department would be justified in adopting for the coming year. The Minister made another statement, for example, in regard to the delivery of letters.  There have been complaints. Deputies who live in and who may represent Dublin constituencies are frequently getting complaints with regard to the infrequency of deliveries of letters. The Minister stated that he believed that one delivery for each private house per day was all that would be justified, and he intimated that it was possible that he would come to a decision to restrict deliveries in the future to that one delivery.  He takes that decision according to the best knowledge available to him in consultation with his officials, just as he takes the decision with regard to the delivery of telegrams in rural areas in consultation with his officials, and takes it according to the best judgment and wisdom that he has.  I am not questioning all that in the least; what I am saying is that these are decisions in respect of which the Dáil ought to be consulted, and before the Dáil can be consulted I think the Dáil should have the revenue figures put before it for each closing year, together with the expenditures for that year.  This Department is very largely a business Department, and I guard myself there again by saying that when I describe it as a business <Col N="2342" /> Department I do not necessarily mean that the expenditure would always be kept down to the revenue; but fundamentally it is a business Department, different in that regard from other Departments, inasmuch as it is a revenue-earning department, and decisions taken should be decisions taken much in the same way as business decisions generally are taken, that is that the particular person, the managing director of the firm, or whoever it may be who has to take the decision, should report and consult with those to whom he is responsible.  I suggest that that would not only be desirable from the point of view&mdash;I do not say in every little detail, but on broad lines&mdash;of the Dáil, and necessary for its consideration of the estimates of the Department when they are laid before the Dáil each year, but that that is just as necessary and just as wise for the Minister to take in his own interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to another statement of his last Thursday, where he was dealing with the parcels tax.  He said: &ldquo;A good deal of agitation has gone on for its removal in the interval, but we feel that we would not be justified in making any change.  I do not think that this country can afford to be philanthropic in dealing with surplus incoming traffic.  We are merely asking these people who get parcels from abroad to pay part of their way.&rdquo;  Then he went on to indicate that there had been a very substantial reduction; the figures which he gave were that parcels had dropped from 2,900,000 to 2,000,000.  I suggested when he was speaking last Thursday that I would like to have fuller information in regard to that.  It has been said to me that items that previously were sent over in separate parcels are now being sent over in larger parcels, that a reduction actually in the number of parcels is occurring, but that the size of the parcels is larger, and that the reduction in the number of parcels is not commensurate with the number of articles that are sent.  Deputy Cooper, at the same time, asked if information would be given to the Dáil, not only in regard to parcels but to show the number of items that were sent over by book post.  I suggest to the Dáil that <Col N="2343" /> in the matter of this 6d. parcels tax, information of that kind is essential to the taking of a decision.  The Dáil took a decision to adopt this parcels delivery tax, and now when we come to the end of the first year of its working I suggest that information of this kind ought to be in the possession of Deputies in order that Deputies might be able to know whether not merely the parcels are dropping but, on the broader aspect of it, that the tax is justifying itself.  If I may revert again to the expenditure on letter deliveries, the Minister stated in regard to the reduction in the number of deliveries per day in different districts: &ldquo;The expenditure under this head is expenditure in the right direction.&rdquo; That may be, but it would be much better for the Dáil if it had before it the figures on the one hand and the figures on the other, so that the Dáil might be able to know whether the expenditure is justifiable expenditure or not, as it cannot take the cost of telegrams, or parcels, or letters, or any of the branches of this service, until it has in its possession information on both sides of the balance sheet.  I wish to add this, that the Estimates that are put before us are drawn out in very great and commendable detail.  So far as the expenditure is concerned the detail is far ampler and far more complete than for any other Department.  But the Minister did himself recognise the substance of the case that I am making.  I think it was last year&mdash;it might have been the year before, perhaps both years, but one of these two years in any case&mdash;before we came to the consideration of the Vote for the Ministry of Post and Telegraphs, Deputies were provided with a very full, a very satisfactory statement by the Minister as to the working of the Department, and it proved of the very greatest possible help and convenience to Deputies in discussing the expenditure that the Dáil was asked to sanction.  That practice might have been continued this year.  I am urging that that practice should be continued in future, not merely that an innovation should be made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McBRIDE</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all children of inconsistency, and I wish to call attention to a little inconsistency on the part of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  He is a standard bearer of protection; no one in the country is such a standard bearer in the cause of protection; and it rather comes as a shock to me when I open the envelope of a telegram and see an advertisement for Beecham's pills, or some tonic from across the water.  I am not a protectionist, but I am inclined to throw away the telegram when that happens, until it strikes me that I have paid sixpence to the Minister for this piece of paper advertising a foreign nostrum, or a foreign tonic.  I think that the Minister ought to give very serious attention to this.  Probably he counts it as one of the revenues which help to meet the enormous expenditure on the Post Office.  However, even though it may bring in a considerable amount of revenue, I hope that it will not be continued, that no foreign nostrum or commodity of any description will be advertised by any Government Department. Furthermore, I wish to have the postal communications worked more expeditiously than they are at the present <Col N="2345" /> moment.  It is a rather curious procedure to have the postal matter from several towns in Mayo brought up to Roscommon, Athlone or Ballmasloe and then sent back the following day to the towns to which they are addressed. This also requires some attention.  If the office expenditure would not allow this to be remedied I hope, notwithstanding the great loss coming from stoppage of advertisements of foreign matter, that the Minister will pay attention to that matter.</P>

      <P>I am not going to enter into a discussion with regard to advertisements, say of Beecham's pills, on the back of telegram forms.  I am not going to deal with that at all.  I want to approach this question and to prove logically that the attitude of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs with respect to this item of telegrams is wrong and unjust.  I want to put it up to the members of the Dáil that it is unjust, and I want later on to have, by a vote, a clear opinion given here by them as to what their view is with regard to the conduct of this service. The Minister, on Thursday last, told us that his actions were based on the action of the Dáil, and that the Dáil would not do this or that.  Therefore he has put it up to every member of the Dáil to consider what they think is right or wrong with respect to this policy.  While I am on this I may refer to a speech of Deputy Good, delivered here on Friday last.  Deputy Good said, when referring to this telegram service:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The telegraphic service is, I am afraid, more than any other of the postal services what we might call an abused service.  It is used very largely, as was pointed out, for betting and other purposes that cannot by any means be looked upon as national assets.  To withdraw charges about which complains have been made would mean that the service would be more largely used for these particular purposes, and that larger use would create very much larger losses.</P>
      <P>I want you to take particular note of this, because he referred to the charge for delivery outside a certain radius.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2346" /> Deputy Heffernan pointed out that it costs 1s. 6d. to deliver a telegram a distance of four miles from a post office.  His idea appeared to be, and I think to some extent it is Deputy Johnson's, although he did not express it very clearly, that there should be a flat rate for telegrams. The Deputy advanced in the argument he put forward a little along that road, but he did not go quite as far as Deputy Heffernan.  We know that in the West there are places eight, ten or fifteen miles from a post office.  In many cases the telegraph service is made use of for purposes that could be dealt with by ordinary letter post.</P>
    <P>There were some other references I am not able to trace, but from the one I am able to trace I can adduce an abuse of this particular service, and this particular abuse is connected with betting telegrams.  He stated that this abuse is connected with betting telegrams. He stated that this abuse is attributable more to the rural population than to anyone else.  I venture to suggest that not one out of one thousand telegrams in connection with betting have been sent from rural areas.  It is quite true that telegrams are sent by residents in rural areas, but those residents go to a telegraph office to send them.  Thus there is no extra cost to the State and these are received by Deputy Hewat's constituents, by the people who are living within his magic circle and are given free delivery.  If any telegrams are sent back it is between the recipient and his agents in towns and villages who are living also within this free delivery circle.  Deputy Good wanted to make out by implication that the abuse of those messages was confined to the rural population alone.  I say it is not.  I say it is a libel on the rural population.  There is no extra cost incurred by your rural population in respect to this, because when a man wants to send to a bookmaker he goes to the telegraph office and delivers his telegram.  I am sorry Deputy Good is not here.  He might have a little more to say on this.</P>
    <P>Now we come to deal with the charges for this particular service.  The Minister said to-day that £40,000 has <Col N="2347" /> been collected last year or the year before for the charges of this particular service for the rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be quite safe in taking £41,000 as a conservative figure.  It is not as much this year. There is a total loss on the service of £220,000 or about one quarter of a million.  The charge for extra delivery to the country is £41,000.  We have not the figures Deputy Figgis asked for but those figures give us something to go on with.  Adopting a very conservative attitude with regard to what those services are, let us say there is only a charge of 1/- for each telegram.  I know in a considerable amount of instances it comes up to 2/6, especially to creameries.  I can name three of them in my own constituency, so that the smallest average is 1/- for each delivery.  That will give you the amount of telegrams delivered in rural areas.  If there is a loss of 1/- on each telegram it is represented in £220,000. Therefore delivery outside the mile limit would stand in the ratio of 41 to 220.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something like 5½ telegrams are despatched within the mile radius to one despatched outside.  In that way again we get a very fair idea of the number of telegrams despatched and where they are delivered.  Everybody who receives a telegram contributes to this loss of £220,000.  The Minister puts the loss at one shilling for each telegram. According to the figures I have given, evidently every person living outside the mile radius who receives a telegram almost pays for the entire cost&mdash;he certainly pays the extra shilling.  £220,000 less £41,000 is the total loss within the mile radius, because most of our population, especially the business population, live within the mile radius.  I should like to have authoritative figures from the Minister as to the number of telegrams delivered both inside and outside <Col N="2348" /> the mile radius and the two mile radius.  Until we get these figures we can only arrive at an approximate calculation. But if you take one shilling as the average charge for delivery, it is easy to arrive at the number of telegrams delivered outside the mile radius. I want to know why people resident outside the mile radius should be asked to make good £41,000 while those inside get off scot free, and the State has to make up for a loss of £180,000 for the service within the mile radius.  I should like to hear the Minister answering those figures.  I feel sure that the Minister, as well as the Minister for Finance and the President, are broadminded enough not to look at the matter from the point of view of individuals, but from the point of view of the State and the right of every citizen.</P>

      <P>I made it clear at the outset that the porterage charges for telegrams are not included one way or the other in the loss on the telegraph service.  The loss on the telegraph service is about £220,000, not £180,000. The second point is this: the person who contributes to the porterage of a telegram also receives the advantage of the first mile free, the same as the person who lives within the mile radius.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has proved his contention to his own satisfaction evidently, but he has not proved it to the satisfaction of anybody else.  If he is able to dispute my figures, that £41,000 represents the <Col N="2349" /> total for telegrams delivered outside the mile area, I am prepared to admit that my case does not hold water.  If he is prepared to prove by figures that more than 41,000 telegrams, or an appreciable number that affects the total, are delivered outside the mile area, I am prepared to accept these figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean the number of telegrams represented by £41,000.  If the Minister's argument is good with regard to the £41,000 it is also good with regard to the £220,000.  If £41,000 is received from telegrams delivered outside the mile area, I want to ask the Minister if that sum does not represent the telegrams delivered outside that radius to the extent of a shilling per telegram&mdash; 41,000 multiplied by 20.</P>
      <P>I am aware that in the rural areas&mdash; this may interest Deputy Johnson; probably he knows it already&mdash;telegraph messengers are retained as part-time employees at a very small salary. I know of such messengers being paid 5s. per week for part time.  In exceptional cases I believe they receive 10s. The general rule is to allow the sub-Postmaster or sub-Postmistress so much for a telegraph messenger.  I would be very much surprised if these messengers are paid more than ten shillings per week for part-time work. Such a messenger, paid five shillings a week, would collect at least ten shillings per week in extra charges for delivery.  Therefore, the postal service makes 100 per cent. profit.  I know of a postal district where the messenger is getting ten shillings per week for part-time work.  For delivering telegrams to my house he would receive the whole of that ten shillings, and more, in extra charges for delivery.  I have often paid fifteen shillings within a week for delivery, and as much as twenty shillings.  Therefore, I paid 100 per cent. more than the boy costs the post office, not to speak of what he is paid for extra charges by other people.  He is doing the whole work of that district, both inside and outside the mile radius, for less than he is paid in extra charges for delivery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2350" /> I want to discuss the question in a reasonable way.  I do not want to approach it from a hostile, personal, or party point of view.  I am sure the Minister is as open as I am to discuss it reasonably and with sense and justice. I have very grave doubts if the Minister is not leaving himself open to an action at law by adopting this system. The Constitution, which we hear so much about, guarantees equal rights for all citizens.  Where is the equality in this system?  It would be just as reasonable to tell me that because I live outside the mile radius I am not entitled to equal service in respect to the Civic Guards, the Army, or any other service, as the man living inside the mile radius.  If that is carried to its logical conclusion I would be entitled to reply that if because I live in a rural district I am not entitled to certain State services, therefore I should not be liable for State charges.  That argument is as defensible as the other.</P>
    <P>Twelve months ago I asked that a Commission should be set up to inquire into this matter.  That request was refused. I ask again that a Commission should be set up to inquire into it. Perhaps the Minister and certain Deputies feel that as a result of the recent elections they have the absolute confidence of the country and can do what they like.  It is up to Deputies representing rural areas, as the Minister stated on Thursday last, to decide whether the present policy is right or wrong. The Minister very fairly stated that it was the Dáil decided this matter.  I ask Deputies from the rural areas: are they prepared to stand for discrimination as to who is to get a free service or who is not?  Is the population living outside the mile radius to make good the £41,000 of a loss while those who live inside the mile area, on which the State is losing £180,000 are to be let off scot free, because they happen to be a majority of the population?  It may be that the estimable services of these Deputies will weigh more with their constituents than their support of what I call the robbery that is perpetrated by this system in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I know creameries that in the ordinary course of business receive from <Col N="2351" /> five to ten telegrams every day on which there is a charge of 2/6.  I met two people who are connected with creameries on Monday last and both of them mentioned this matter to me. They are supporters of the Government and were present at the recent convention at which the economic policy of the Government was discussed.  One of the creameries is at Muckalee, and Mr. Conway, whose name I may mention, stated that 2/6 was paid on every telegram received.  At Mountgale and Ballybur creameries 2/6 is also paid for each telegram received.  That may be good business from the point of view of trying to make good the loss of £41,000 and also in order to give good service to Deputy Hewat and Deputy Good who live within the charmed circle at Carrickmines, Foxrock, etc.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Daly say a few days ago that he was perfectly satisfied with the present state of affairs.  Of course he is.  Deputy Daly's telegrams are delivered free, and of course he thinks of no one outside the mile area.  He stated that the service was a tribute to Cork and that it was only a Corkman could do what had been done.  I think it is only Corkmen could do so.  They can do more than that.  We had some historical books written by Corkmen recently.  Perhaps they dealt with facts, but perhaps it would be as well if more attention was paid to the Post Office and less to books.  The attitude adopted by Deputy Good and Deputy Daly make the people of the Saorstát desperate.  The people outside think that they should not be placed on a different plane to the people inside the mile radius.  I have a good deal more to say about this Vote, but I would not be able to conclude in the time at my disposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a motion moved for a reduction of £1,000.  Obviously, when that was rejected, there may be a case for a reduction of a lesser sum.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is accommodating Deputy Gorey by suggesting a lesser sum.  I would submit that having refused to reduce the Estimate by £1,000 there is a <i>prima facie</i> case that the Dáil has accepted the Estimate in so far as it would not reduce the Vote by £1,000. If there is no case for a reduction of £1,000, I submit that it would not be fair to ask the Dáil to refer the whole Estimate back.</P>

      <P>On a point of procedure, I submit that there is a possibility of referring the Vote back for reconsideration, not necessarily with a view to reduction, but, possibly, with a view to increase.  The question of referring back does not necessarily entail a reduction in the Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the same point which I want to make.  I do not want the Vote to be reduced, but I want the Government to consider the possibility of adjusting this Estimate.  I do not take it as a reflection on the Minister, or the Government, but I want to move <Col N="2355" /> that it be referred back for reconsideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>That is putting us in a false position, as we do not want to take a vote on this particular item but on the question of policy.  I submit that we are not being treated fairly in this matter, nor is the Dáil being treated fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Gorey will admit that sending back an Estimate is really submitting that the Dáil does not approve of policy.  The question of policy is a bigger one than a reduction of £1,000, and the bigger thing should be taken first in all fairness to the Minister, to the Government, and to the Dáil.  We have now entered on the third day's consideration of this Estimate. Taking into consideration its size, it has taken up in the matter of time much more than any other Estimate. To send it back now after a vote has been taken for a further reduction would, I think, be a reversal of the procedure we have adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold a different view. I hold that when the main question is under discussion any Deputy has a right to move any amendment he thinks fit.  I do not think that it can be held to be fair to the Dáil, because one Deputy thinks well to move a certain amendment carrying a certain amount of money, that it excludes another Deputy from putting another proposition. I think that a good case has been made for reconsideration by the Government of this Vote, and that they might very well consider it now and not next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that Standing Order No. 93 was apparently framed with a view to regulating how these matters should be dealt with.  It says: &ldquo;It shall be in order, before entering on the discussion of the items in a Vote, to move that the Estimate in question be referred back to the Minister in charge of the Department for <Col N="2356" /> reconsideration.&rdquo;  There was in mind there what the procedure should be on matters of the sort.  I submit that having allowed the items to be discussed, almost every detail in the Estimate, and having disposed of an amendment to reduce the Vote by £1,000, to move now that the Estimate be sent back is in contravention of the terms and spirit of the Standing Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I accept the explanation, and I accept the ruling of An Leas-Cheann Comhairle in accordance with the President's viewpoint. Therefore, I move that a smaller sum, a sum that will not affect the Vote, because I do not want to hamper the Ministry or to hamper the service in any form, be taken off the Estimate.  I propose an insignificant amount, so that the Minister will not be hampered.  In order that Deputies listening to me, and they are very few, can be given an opportunity of a clear vote, I propose that the whole Vote be reduced by £100.</P>

      <P>Make it in whatever legal form you like.  I am not good at that.  In moving this amendment I want a clear vote of the Dáil on this question.  The Minister has said that it is not his policy, but the policy of the Dáil.  Therefore the policy that is to be decided is the policy of every member of the Dáil.  The man who is satisfied with the particular policy as it is should vote against this reduction. That will not really affect the total vote, or the carrying on of the business of the Department, but it is well we should distinctly know what is the attitude of Deputies, especially rural Deputies in this matter.  Whatever decision is taken <Col N="2357" /> will be their responsibility and not the Ministers', and whatever they do in this matter should be done without hiding behind any party pledge, or being bound by a certain undertaking when elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>We take it if there is a division that all the Deputies will be in the same position with regard to this amendment as they were the other evening on the occasion of an amendment to the Fisheries Bill, that is that every Deputy will be free to decide against the Minister if he thinks fit to do so.  We assume that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will not place, or seek to place, any Deputy either in his own party or any other party, in a more unfair position than they would be if this were an amendment to the Fisheries Bill, such as I have already referred to, and that if the Minister's policy is not acceptable Deputies will be free to give an open declaration of that fact.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that perhaps he sees reasons from the point of view expressed by Deputy Gorey why his own policy ought to be reconsidered. If the Minister recognises that the rural inhabitants have not been treated fairly, and that he is prepared to look into the position and to reconsider the policy that has been pursued by him so far in the light of the case put before him by Deputy Gorey, I think if he is prepared to say he will do that, and will do it honestly, that Deputy Gorey will have achieved the end he seeks to attain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister says bluntly that he is not going to do that, but that he will make the rural inhabitant contribute more than his fair proportion as a citizen of the State towards the running and the losses of the Post Office, and that he is to pay an extra charge for facilities afforded by the operations of the postal service, naturally the rural inhabitants must take exception to that.  Their representatives here now may not be able to pass a sentence on the Minister that would be satisfactory to them, and may not be able to achieve what they wish, but the fact remains that the treatment of the rural inhabitants <Col N="2358" /> is not fair and just as compared with that accorded to those in the towns and cities.  That is a policy that can be pursued too far.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs ought to take into account that the collector of taxes will not discriminate between the man living on a hillside and the man living in a town.  When it comes to paying up they are treated alike, and if the State comes along to perform any service for the citizens, the man in the country, one and a half miles from the town, should not be expected to contribute more to the maintenance of that service than the man living in the town, when the taxpayers as a whole are bearing the burden of that service. That is the attitude we take up.  If the Minister says he is going to carry on that policy, and that he is not going to permit the holding of an inquiry into the whole position, into the administration of the Post Office&mdash;if that is to be his policy, and not the open policy of the Dáil, we have to accept it, but the Minister ought to recognise that he has a duty to the Dáil and to the rural inhabitants, and to the people in Athy, to whom he was talking the other day, as to the citizens in Cork city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand something like that arising.  In some cases it may happen that a particular switchboard is full, and that means that another board has to be put in. They may not be able to get another customer in that direction, and therefore the installation is occasioned by reason of a single application.  In that case, is it right that in order to convenience one particular person the whole cost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to end all this it would be well to have the position stated.  This telephone service has been held out to the public as a great boon, and I want the public to know what the exact position is.  It is going to mean a charge of £30 a year with a five years' guarantee.  I do not know where the boon to the public comes in there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There are special circumstances in connection with particular <Col N="2360" /> applications which impose extra costs on the Post Office and which, I think, ought to fall on the person occasioning them.  I know that in a particular case&mdash;I cannot remember whether it was my own or not, but I believe it was&mdash;I had to pay something more by reason of the fact that the &ldquo;board&rdquo; was full.  I was outside this line, and if I were to take this in a personal way I suppose I should vote with the Deputy. On the occasion of an entertainment given by my wife, five people from the country, who were unable to attend, sent telegrams which cost her one shilling each.  I think, if people want this sort of convenience, they have got to pay for it.</P>
      <P>This is an Estimate for a total sum of £2,551,540.  In a sense it is unfair to ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to allow this to be an open vote, after having agreed with the Minister for Finance&mdash;in this case the Minister for Finance is the Executive Council&mdash; that this is the amount of money that is to be found in respect of this service. It becomes a Government matter so far as that is concerned.  Of course that does not prevent the Minister from examining the service.  He has examined it during the last two or three years to see where economies could be effected and to see where an uneconomic branch of the service could be made economic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the telephone service, anyone who has been accustomed to using it during the last four or five years will, I think, admit, and generously admit, that there has been an enormous improvement in it.  I think it is due to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that reference should be made to that improvement.  It is one of the services that has been remedied. At one time I thought it would be necessary to call in an expert from some other country to see how its defects could be remedied.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, with the officials in his Department, took the matter in hand, and the result is, as I have said, that there has been an enormous improvement in this service.  As regards the particular service to which Deputy Gorey refers, it is an expensive one, and I have no doubt that the Minister <Col N="2361" /> will consider it, but he cannot consider it in the light of a loss of £40,000 to the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular thing would mean a loss of £40,000.  As far as the £180,000 is concerned, that deals with a much larger number than the proportionate number involved in the £40,000.  Deputy Gorey is engaged in farming and he knows that if he has to send to a fair ten miles away to buy one particular animal that the cost to him in respect of the purchase of that particular animal will be relatively greater than if he had to buy 40 cattle. The same number of men could as easily take the 40 cattle on the single journey as they could the one beast, so that the cost of the transport is relatively greater in the case of the purchase of the one animal than it would be in that of the purchase of the 40.  I am sure the Deputy will admit that.</P>

      <P>Question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the question: large business and small profits, small business and extra expense.  We all know that establishment charges are high against the small business and that they are relatively lower in the case of large undertakings.  There are many business concerns all over the country which could turn over three or four times the amount of money they do without incurring any extra establishment charges, for the lower the turn over is the higher proportionately the establishment charges are. That is the position of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  As far as I am concerned, I am against this reduction and I think that the Minister has made a fairly good case for the retention of the charges until the service becomes a more economic one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The President's <Col N="2362" /> usual smoke screen has been emitted. He has cleverly tried to cloud the issue.  I think that Deputy Gorey has not made clear what his desire is in this matter.  If he is contending that there should be no extra charge at all for the delivery of telegrams, no matter what the distance is from the telegraph office, then I am against him.  The practice of making a delivery charge is not a new one. Last year this matter was discussed. It was then pointed out that a reduction had been made in the distance, and that for over a mile from the office there would be no delivery fee charged. I think it is necessary, under present circumstances, that a delivery fee should be charged after a certain distance. Otherwise, the cost of delivery would be very excessive, indeed.  I think that limit has to be fixed more or less on the judgment of the Minister. A compromise is inevitable there, I suppose, as to what would be strict justice.  I think, however, that a free delivery area of one mile from the telegraph office is altogether too short.</P>
      <P>Cities, as Deputy Gorey pointed out, are undoubtedly specially well served in this matter.  In the city area you have free delivery within a distance of two miles, but from the office in the small town free delivery is limited to a distance of one mile.  That, I think, is an unfair proposition.  The zone which Deputy Heffernan suggested as worthy of consideration is too narrow in the case of the delivery of telegrams. I think that the Minister ought to have given further consideration and more sympathetic consideration to the proposal to extend the free delivery area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to support the motion, which aims at impressing on the Minister the view of the House that there should be an extension of the free delivery area.  Such an extension will not cost £40,000.  We have no estimate as to what it will cost.  It possibly may cost £10,000, but I am inclined to the view, inasmuch as the telegraph service as a whole is looked upon as an expense and as a loss to the Treasury, that the extra charge for an extended delivery area could be met <Col N="2363" /> by an increase in the cost of the telegrams. The number of persons within the free delivery area ought to be increased, and it is on that account that I feel that the Deputy is justified in asking the views of members of the Dáil to be expressed on this matter. The only way it can be expressed apparently is by requesting a reduction in the Vote.  There is no implication in the carrying of this motion, other than that it is the view of the Dáil that the free delivery area should be increased, leaving it to the Minister to decide the extent of that increase.  I think I am expressing the views of Deputies on the Farmers' benches.  If I am not, and if they are contending that there should be a free delivery any distance, then I would be obliged to vote against this, but if they are contending for an extension of the free delivery area, and that the vote will be simply to prove to the Minister that that is the wish of the Dáil, then I shall certainly vote in favour of this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the President does he does not generally miss the psychological point, but he missed it in this case.  He does not realise the irritation caused by a charge over which you have no control.  You cannot prevent people sending you telegrams. The President, as he told us himself, could not prevent five people sending him telegrams.  You can only refuse to accept the telegrams.  But human nature and human curiosity are too strong for that.  A telegram may contain vital matter or it may only contain the name of a winner&mdash;out of deference to Deputy Gorey I will say the winner of the Waterloo Cup.  But the average person does not like to send away a telegram from his door. At the same time if it is opened, and contains trivial matter, people feel great irritation, not only with the sender, but also with the Government. There is no means of stopping this, and that is what annoys people, and makes them discontented.  You cannot tell everybody not to send you telegrams. I remember the case of certain people living a long way from a post office <Col N="2364" /> putting on their notepaper: &ldquo;Telegraph office so far away, porterage 5/-,&rdquo; as a hint to people not to send them telegrams.  But it would be almost impossible for people to do that now.  These things that you cannot control are very irritating and they are bad policy for the State.  I agree if Deputy Gorey's amendment is intended to express the view that there should be a wider area of delivery it should receive the support of the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>It has always seemed astonishing to me that people who live in rural areas and have to pay porterage, perhaps a considerable sum, and who get a considerable number of telegrams in the year, do not go in for the party telephone system.  I have some experience of that for a good many years.  In my district, to the people who live around me the cost of porterage would be fairly considerable and the farmers and doctors and some veterinary surgeons and others in our district put their heads together and persuaded the Post Office to extend to us the party telephone system and we found it a most wonderful convenience. We send telegrams and receive them through this system.  Of course people say that in the party-system there is no privacy.  I do not think that any of us ever found the least inconvenience in that connection.  There are fourteen of us on the two lines that come into our district.  They are connected together and there never was the least difficulty or unpleasantness, or anything of that kind, arising out of it, nothing but the utmost convenience, and no one of us would give it up.  We get our telegrams delivered at once and sent on without any trouble about them.  I should recommend all people who do a lot of telegraph work to club together and have the party system established amongst them.  I can say, speaking from experience, that the convenience of that system is beyond measure.  But, apart from that, if people do not wish to pay for their telegrams delivered by messenger they can leave word with the Post Office to have them sent on by post.  I do not think that there is any grievance in the complaints that have been brought <Col N="2365" /> forward.  I think people have only themselves to blame if they do not come and make things better for themselves by having the party-system at their doors; and it is cheap also.  I only pay £1 12s. 0d. a quarter.  It was cheaper a few years ago when it was only £4 a year.  Now it is £6 8s. 0d.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the proposals put forward by Deputy Johnson for a reconsideration of this matter.  Before introducing it, I gave it the utmost consideration.  Since then I thought it over, and I have satisfied myself that there is no alternative that is likely to give satisfaction. If you increase the limit of a mile to two miles the people beyond the two miles will howl, and so on; if you increase the limit beyond two miles, the people three miles distant will complain.  You are not going to get rid of these complaints by a proposal of that kind.  Again, it is not too much to expect people to pay their way.  The argument comes badly from people who shout on public platforms that the State is recklessly over-spending, and who now ask for another trifle of £40,000.  You must draw the line somewhere.  I am out for economy.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows the Minister, apparently, better than he knows himself.  Business people who send telegrams can afford to pay for them.  I have no sympathy with their desire to shift the payment on to other shoulders.  Wherever we find a cooperative society or a creamery hard hit by these payments we endeavour to extend the telephone service to them, and we have done that in a great many cases this year with a very substantial loss to the State, and we will continue to do it.  Let us further examine this alleged grievance.  In the year 1923-24 we netted £78,000 in post office work in the city of Dublin, and similar sums in other cities and towns, varying according to business.  We made a profit in the working of this service running into some hundreds of thousands of pounds through urban work, and we lost that profit and £700,000 in addition in doing Deputy Gorey's work in the country.  Now, in contributing to these rural services, are we acting impartially? If we acted impartially we would spend in proportion to our returns in rural areas.  It will have to come to that.  That is the position at the moment.  I see no justification whatever for this further expenditure, and I regret that any Deputies should suggest that we should lightly handle a sum of £40,000 in doing this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder has the Minister weighed the consequences of the statement he has made, and that is, <Col N="2367" /> that there may be a necessity to reconsider the administration of these services, and I presume, every other service in the State, from the point of view of what any particular body of the citizens are prepared to contribute to the maintenance of the State service. That is the way the Minister has put his case.  If it comes to that we will have to divide our Exchequer into five or six or perhaps a dozen different compartments. Into each of them and out of each of them certain sums will come and go.  A certain service will get a certain contribution from each, and a certain body of people will be served. That, I do not think, is the aim of the Minister in some respects.  If it is to be decentralised like that, the sooner we make up our minds to dispense with such services the better.  That is the point of view the Minister expresses when he says that Dublin contributes so much to the maintenance of the Post Office and so much is lost because that service is extended down through the rural districts.  He goes on, further, to say that he will have to consider whether <Col N="2368" /> this can be continued in the future or not, or whether in the rural districts we may not have to pay a higher postal rate, a higher telephone rate and a higher charge for delivery of telegrams than the people who live in the cities and towns, simply because we live in the country.  If that is the way the Minister wants to put it, it is just as well that we should have it marked out definitely and clearly.  We accept that statement from the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Under sub-head (a) there are one or two matters of detail that have not been raised.  We have been dealing with the question of Departmental policy as far as the public are concerned.  There are one or two matters in connection with the administration of the Department internally to which I would like to draw attention. The first is the excessively large number of temporary clerks, telegraphists, and postmen, and I want to urge that as many as possible of these should be as quickly as possible absorbed into the established branches.  I think there have been a few recently absorbed from the temporary and auxiliary postal service.  Some six or seven months ago there was an announcement of an examination for temporary sorting clerks and telegraphists, to be held early in 1925.  So far no intimation has been given to the public as to when that examination is to take place.  I want to urge that the number of persons in these lists who are described as &ldquo;temporary employees&rdquo; is altogether excessive. In some cases the temporary employees are not denoted.  I see on page 231 of the Estimates an item which shows that there are &ldquo;5,443 outdoor supervising officers, postmen, cleaners and messengers, including unestablished force.&rdquo;  I think that that number &ldquo;including unestablished force&rdquo; is excessive.  I want to urge that there should be a reduction in the number of unestablished men by a very large proportion, that their position should be regularised, and that they should become members of the established branches.  There is, as has been suggested, a large number of persons employed in the Post Office as temporary employees who are very much underpaid.  The effect of that is not good for the service, not good for the public, and is not good in any way except from the point of view of cheap-and-nastiness. I would press upon the Minister the necessity of absorbing into the established branches a very large number of those who are at present, and have been for a long time, temporary. The same remark applies to auxiliary postmen.  The number at present in the service is about 2,500.  They are working from eighteen to thirtyfive <Col N="2370" /> hours a week.  It is suggested, of course, that these men are employed part-time in the Post Office and that they can obtain other employment.  But the hours and conditions under which auxiliary postmen work, make it, in very many cases, impossible for them to obtain other work to fit in.  The effect is that the auxiliary postman's sole employment is as a postman at wages which are entirely unsatisfactory, and not sufficient to enable a man to keep a proper standard of life.  I understand that there is a considerable number of vacancies in the established classes, and I urge that there should be opportunities now for including amongst the establishment a large number of those who are at present employed as auxiliaries.</P>
      <P>There is then a matter that is not easy to deal with unless one has details. It is, I suppose, known to every Deputy who has followed public matters for years, that in the Post Office, as in some of the other public services, there have been charges pretty freely floating of favouritism in matters of promotion. It was a long-established grievance in the postal service under the old regime, and I am quite sure the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs knows something about it.  Complaints of favouritism in matters of promotion were sought to be remedied by a general understanding &mdash;perhaps not very rigid&mdash;that seniority would play the greater part, and that seniority, given regular, satisfactory qualifications, would be depended upon in respect of promotion.  It is undoubtedly true to say that, whether well or ill-founded, there is a very strong belief throughout the service that favouritism in matters of promotion is rifer to-day than it was even under the old regime.  Part of that suspicion, no doubt, is due to conditions which prevailed during the last two years.  That suspicion was rife throughout the country, and many charges of a general kind arising out of prejudice, envy, or malice, accounted to some extent for the general suspicion of favouritism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is necessity for a facing of the fact that this suspicion and belief is very widespread at the present <Col N="2371" /> time, and it is not declining with the decline in the general dissatisfaction and dissension within the country.  To give an illustration, I am told that in respect of sorting clerks and telegraphists in Dublin, so far from the seniority list being relied upon in making selections for appointments, qualified officers have been passed over to the extent of 200 to 250 behind in the lists. In the case of, say, 5 or 6 particular officers who came in long after the earlier ones on the list, to the extent of the numbers 227 to 276, these men have been placed ahead of Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on.  That is to say, preferences have been given to people who came into the service last over other qualified officers who had been in the service for a long time and who were their seniors.  There may be a defence of that on the part of the Minister when he may say those particular officers had long service in the British Postal Department.</P>
    <P>I am told it has become quite a practice that in the case of transferred officers, officers transferred from London, it is almost inevitable that they will be given preference when promotion is in question.  This preference to transferred officers from London is one item in the general charge of favouritism. The preferences do not apply only to officers who have been transferred from London; but those seem to be the cases on which stress is laid.  I think it is desirable that the Minister should face this general dissatisfaction in the service and give some clear statement of the policy of the Department in respect to this matter of promotion and indicate what part seniority plays when the question of promotions arise.  I have raised these matters because I think it is desirable that they should be raised in public so that a public explanation and defence on the part of the Minister can be made.  This will give him an opportunity to make that explanation.</P>

      <P>That, I will develop. If I were to mention now what points I am going to speak on I would have no occasion to speak at all, because I would have covered the ground I intend to cover.  I want to deal with sub-head (a) (3).  I will not deal with items 1, 2, or 4 under that sub-head at all.  I want to deal with provincial offices.  Under the head of provincial establishments I find the figure, for the first time, dealing with boy messengers, and under Scale 2 the number is 94. Under Scale 3 the number is 358.  The total is 452.  The wages under Scale 2, for 94 messengers, vary from 6s. to 19s., and in Scale 3, for 358 messengers, the wages vary from 6s. to 18s.  I am <Col N="2373" /> not in a position to contradict the figure of 18s.  It may be paid in certain cases; I am sure it is, in the provinces, and that embraces the provincial towns.  Constant messengers have to be employed, and not part-time messengers, and for that reason I accept 18s. as obtaining in some cases.  If we strike an average, especially for the rural areas, of 10s., we are getting beyond what I think is paid to the rural messengers.  Taking the 452 messengers employed in provincial establishments, and giving those 452 an average wage of 10s. a week, which is really more than is actually given, we will find what messengers actually cost the State for the provincial service alone.  Multiplying the figure 452, not by 10s., which would mean £26 a year, but by £30, which would, in my opinion, be more than an average, we get a total cost of £13,560.  That represents the cost to the State of messengers who deliver telegrams in the Saorstát. I see one of the Minister's officers shaking his head.  If I am wrong, I am open to correction, and I hope the figures will be given.  As I see it, this service is for messengers.  If the cost set out under the head of messengers does not represent what the messengers really cost the Saorstát for their services, I would like to know what it is. Where am I to get the figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am making my assumption on a very conservative estimate, and I find that it takes £13,560 to defray the cost of messengers for the provincial establishments. That gives you in hard figures what the cost of telegrams in provincial establishments means to the State.  Perhaps Deputy Johnson will now have a clear indication of what the actual figures are.  For that service that is costing thirteen and a half thousand pounds you are recovering £41,000.  That is on the Minister's own admission.  He is recovering that money from portion of the people that the service is intended for.  These are the figures I want the Minister to explain. I hope he will be able to give a satisfactory explanation, some explanation that would satisfy me and ease my mind.  I only want to be satisfied. While I see something here distinctly <Col N="2374" /> wroig and distinctly as it should not be, you will have me, and every honest member of this Dáil who is not tied body and soul, giving clean votes and straight votes on this question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we could make some progress if I answered Deputy Johnson's questions, which do not come under any of these sub-heads and <Col N="2375" /> we could then advance from sub-head 3.  Deputy Johnson draws attention to the fact that we have, in his opinion, more temporary employees than we should have.  It is not our desire to retain disproportionate numbers of people, but it will take some time to get through the various Civil Service examinations. Temporary employees increased very much during the war period and up to the institution of the Civil Service Commission.  The increase is now largely disappearing and it is our desire that it should disappear as quickly as possible.  Auxiliary postmen, otherwise part-time postmen, are taken on with a clear understanding that other sources of employment are available. We employ them, and clearly set forth the conditions, for a certain number of hours per day and per week. Beyond that we have no responsibility. They are not eligible for appointment. Appointments are obtained for boy messengers and temporary hands in urban offices.  Auxiliaries were never included in the category of possible appointees, and I do not think that we would be justified in departing from that well and, I suppose, carefully considered headline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also refers to alleged favouritism in the Post Office.  I do not admit that there is any favouritism.  I may, at the outset, state that one at the head of a Department is largely in the hands of his subordinates in matters of this kind&mdash;very largely.  One must depend very largely on the advice given by his subordinates, but as far as I can judge&mdash;and I am responsible for all appointments in the service, and I go into them very carefully&mdash;I do not think my subordinates have ill-advised me in respect of these promotions.  Men have been selected for executive offices, over the heads of other men.  There are very few who will admit they should have been passed over, but we have to be the judges.  We are responsible for the service.  We have to discriminate between man and man in a matter of this kind, otherwise we will have a very indifferent service.  We have given more promotion in this service since the Treaty than would have been given in the English service in 20 years, <Col N="2376" /> largely by virtue of the fact that we have taken from the service for other Departments.  That has given an opening to our men that they never anticipated, and I think the number promoted to clerical officers has reached the 300 level, which is only part of the line of promotion.</P>
    <P>When statements of this kind are made&mdash;I notice that they are bandied round outside pretty much by associations, and I have seen them referred to in the Press from time to time&mdash;I would like something more definite than a bald statement.  I do not say that Deputy Johnson agrees with the statement.  He has merely stated what has been said, but I would like to have something more definite when favouritism is mentioned than the mere fact that it exists.  I am entitled to get definite instances, and if I get any I will go into them carefully.  I am pretty well sure that it will be found they do not come under that category.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Minister the names and the numbers of the men on the seniority lists.  They are: J.J. Carroll, No. 54; R.J. Daly, No. 91; H.A. Jones, No. 93; T. Gilmore, No. 96; B.

I would like to have some information to my own satisfaction as to what principle in respect of seniority is at work which removes seniority almost out of consideration in view of these numbers.</P>

      <P>Seniority and ability &mdash;these have been the constituent elements in selections for executive posts, for the higher posts.  We have to consider ability as well as seniority and that accounts for the apparent differentiation. No doubt it has given room for grievance to those who have not been selected, but, as I say, on us rests the onus of producing a competent service, and we are doing that.  I want further to say here that I have never had any sympathy with the promotion of an official on any grounds other than value.  Friendship plays no part in my judgment in matters of this kind; I have never believed that it is possible <Col N="2377" /> to get anywhere on the friendship line. There are comparatively few grievances in regard to promotion in the service, very few grievances indeed, and I would be prepared to examine that position minutely with the Deputy at any time if he so desires.</P>

This question of boy messengers has not been explained at all; it has been ignored by the Minister.  We want to get the exact cost, and the Minister refuses these figures.  If there is any truth in figures, or in this Estimate, for goodness sake give us the figures and let us understand it.  Do not be telling us that there are costs incurred that do not appear at all.

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to try to unravel the differences.  The amount which the Minister claims for sub-postmasters for this year is £92,250, and including the boy messengers at £10,000 you have a sum of about £100,000 for <Col N="2379" /> the services of the postmasters and the messengers.  A sum of £41,000 is collected for the delivery of telegrams, and Deputy Gorey's point is that £41,000 in respect of this service, which only costs the State £100,000 for the sub-postmasters and the messengers, is not a reasonable amount to charge for deliveries in the country.  Including the sub-postmasters, the whole all-in costs for that service is only £95,250. That is the point that Deputy Gorey wants to make.  Most of those sub-postmasters are paid a salary out of which they have to contribute towards those messengers, but the £41,000 which is collected, and which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has in his accounts, is money which has been paid to the credit of the State somewhere, and it cannot have been paid casually; it must have come into the accounts somewhere.</P>

I understand that it is recognised by everybody, even by the Minister himself, as being quite an unfit place.  It is said that the premises are damp, unhealthy, and altogether unfit for use as a sorting office.  I would like to have some assurance <Col N="2380" /> from the Minister that he is expediting the preparations of new premises for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to call attention to sub-head (h) (2)&mdash;Losses by default, accident, etc.  The sum of £10,000 which is set down appears to be rather a large one for losses by default and accident, and I want to ask the Minister whether it could not possibly be reduced to a certain extent.  If Deputies would refer to the Appropriation Account for the years 1923-24 they will find that under that heading, though there was a greater sum voted, more than double the sum, the bulk of that sum was devoted to meeting losses by raids and losses caused by fire to the Rotunda Rink Post Office, and in that year the compensation for loss and damage to parcels and registered and insured letters came to just over £6,000. In my opinion that is the only charge that ought fairly to come under this sub-head.  The Minister for Posts must compensate for registered letters that are lost, and <i>ex gratia</i> he compensates for parcels that are lost or damaged. But I do not think there ought to be a large provision for defaults of other kinds, ranging from deficiency in accounts of various kinds to a sum of 10d. for foreign and spurious coins collected in telephone automatic boxes. I think that the only legitimate charge that can be made under this head is for the loss of registered letters and loss and damage to parcels.  That loss was surely greater in the year 1923-24 than it is now.  Every Deputy remembers that at that time mails were frequently raided, and no doubt a certain amount of registered letters, and so on, went astray.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to have some details <Col N="2381" /> as to how this charge was assessed, and I do not think that embezzlement, funds misappropriated, and things of that kind ought to come under this sub-head at all.  I think we ought not to have a general head of £10,000, but that if money is misappropriated from the Post Office we ought to have definite and specific particulars.  We do get that eventually in the Appropriation Account, but that is two years late.  We ought, I think, to have a Supplementary Estimate dealing with embezzlements and matters of that kind, in order that we might test the financial control that the Minister is able to exercise over his subordinates. This is a large Department, dealing with large sums of money, and it is very important that the financial control in connection with it should be automatic, if I might say so, that there should be a careful and continuous audit, and that no temptation should be placed in the way of these servants that they may embezzle or misappropriate money without being detected.  I would like to ask the Minister for a few more details on this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>This estimate of £10,000 is based on our experiences for the second half of last year, when we had to meet, under this heading, a deficiency of about £8,000.  We hope the sum of £10,000 will be sufficient, and we hope we will be able to dispense with the whole of it.  Nevertheless, from our recent experience, we are bound to make a provision of this kind.</P>

      <P>Do we understand from the Minister that he accepts liability for registered letters, because I had a case where a registered letter was seized by bandits or irregulars?  Although the sender of the letter proved definitely that there was money in the letter, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs refused to pay compensation, although he agreed that such a thing could happen.  Compensation was refused under some regulation which operated under the British regime.  I wonder whether the liability for registered letters is still the same?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can understand it, the Minister's justification for this vote is, that because his Department lost £10,000 by default last year, they may reasonably be expected to lose it this year.  He asks the Dáil to be satisfied with that explanation. I think we should know what steps have been taken to check these defaults, and I think we should know a little more under what sub-heads they come: how much is compensation for loss of registered letters, and how much is for misappropriation or embezzlement of funds.  Can the Minister give us more information, and say what steps are being taken to bring this sub-head down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult for me to give the definite items of loss. They cover a rather wide field.  It may happen that the sum of two or three thousand pounds has been dispatched from the head to a sub-office and that a raider intercepts it.  You could then write down two or three thousand pounds under that head.  The next year it would be under some other head.  It would not be any guide to show under what particular head it occurred.  It varies.  The tightening up of our intelligence section will, we hope, reduce the losses which have resulted in that way during the last twelve months.</P>

I would ask the Minister for a clearer definition of the regulations, because a statement like what he has just made will certainly have a serious effect on people outside.  They can only gather that registration is not a safeguard at all.</P>

      <P>I rose because the Minister had made a definite statement, in reply to Deputy Wilson, that sometimes people are accustomed to make claims that they are not entitled to make&mdash;in other words, to make bogus claims.  As the Minister has put it, it can certainly be interpreted that people claim to have put amounts into registered letters that they never put in, and on that assumption that the responsibility on the Post Office lapses. If the Minister is satisfied to let the statement go that there is no responsibility on the part of the Post Office, and that they do not undertake responsibility, <Col N="2384" /> and if he is not going to give reasons why they are not responsible, what conclusion is to be drawn as to the benefit or otherwise of registering letters?</P>

      <P>Whatever information Deputy Baxter may be able to get from the Post Office guide, I cannot get the information I have asked for either in the Post Office guide or from the Minister.  The only inference I can draw from the Minister's reply is that the Department makes up its mind that it will lose £10,000 by default, that if it does not lose it one way it will lose it another, and, as far as the Minister can tell us, no special precautions are taken to prevent default occurring. That is profoundly unsatisfactory.  I do not think the Dáil is satisfied with the Minister's explanation, and I move to reduce this sub-head by £2,000.  That would give the Minister £1,000 margin, and £7,000 for his registered letters and parcels, and will, perhaps, compel the Department to be a little more careful.</P>

I see the item has decreased since last year, but there is no indication of what the expenses are.  Under a similar sub-head (1) (5), &ldquo;Engineering,&rdquo; details are given more or less.

      <P>I wish to raise a point on sub-head (h) (4).  I want to call attention to the very inadequate amount voted for police.  While the losses by default are £10,000, only £45 is spent on the police service to try and prevent losses.  It seems to me that is out of all proportion.  I would willingly pay more for police and less for compensation to people whose property is stolen.  That would, at any rate, provide employment, if nothing else.  I should like to know how the sum is made up, how many people are employed, and what wages they get, because £45 is ludicrous&mdash;less than £1 per week for police.  Is it some small extra payment made to the members of the Gárda Síochána for services rendered, or has the Minister a police force of his own, remunerated at what cannot be a trade union rate?</P>

When I ask a simple question dealing with a considerable amount of money I am told it is made up of items that could not be included under other sub-heads.

      <P>Under this sub-head there is an item of £45 for police.  I take it that the cost of the police is defrayed in the Vote for the Gárda Síochána.  If this item consists of expenses for protective work or something of that kind, I take it the amount is a present for someone who is employed at it.

      <P>I am prepared to meet the views of the House at any time on this motion, but might I make a suggestion?  We have now occupied eight or ten hours in discussing this Estimate, and we have forty other Estimates to deal with.  There was a wish generally expressed, and an admitted agreement that we should rise on the 26th June.  Unless I were to hear to the contrary.  I would propose that we shape our business to meet that particular date.  The only alternative is that of all-night sittings, but these are unfair to everybody, and they put a severe strain on Deputies who have been attending so long.  I would make an appeal for expeditious treatment of the Estimates.  I do not mean to gloss over them or to pass them <i>en bloc</i>, but I appeal for some consideration in view of the length of time which we have allowed for their consideration, and of the fact that the time allowed this year&mdash;I am not speaking from the actual record&mdash;is, I think, longer than we have spent on others.  I say no more than that at present.  I move that the Dáil adjourns until 7.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson has asked me when we would have the Estimates of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Land Commission.  I anticipate that it will be possible to take these in the second week of June, say, on the tenth of June.

I would, perhaps, be permitted to say that I think the Minister <Col N="2391" /> for Posts and Telegraphs appears rather to have resented criticism, and, therefore, has been very chary in his answers.

His attitude is very like that of the first Emperor Napoleon, and we resent it.  We thought when electing the Minister to his present office that he was a plain man who could meet us without a lofty, head-in-the-sky manner.  It has irritated us, and we do not think that that is either very good business or politics.  I do not think that he has met us in a fair way, and because of that we intend to use all the facilities that Standing Orders give us on this Vote.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a matter on this sub-head which is typical, I think, of other departments in the Government service, but it comes quite definitely and clearly under this sub-head in respect of the department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I refer to the question of the employment of civilian labour, and the refusal to employ men who have not been in the National Army.  This matter has arisen on many occasions during the last couple of years.  We are aware that an understanding was arrived at, and I think an instruction given by the Executive Council to the departments &mdash;an instruction was certainly given to local government authorities&mdash;that preferences were to be given to ex-members of the Army.  But, I gather that in respect to this branch&mdash;the engineering establishment&mdash;it has been interpreted, not as a preference, but as a natural barrier against any person being employed who was not a member of the National Army.  I do not know how <Col N="2392" /> long it is intended that this preference should be given or this barrier imposed. I am going to press for a complete revision of that instruction.  I think I am right in saying that in many departments&mdash;possibly in this department as much as in any other, if not more than in any other&mdash;it will be found that the restriction as to ex-members of the Army&mdash;the area of choice is so limited that the best value is not being got for the wages paid.</P>
      <P>I would have no very strong objection to preference, other things being equal, within limits, but I think it is not fair to the civilian element of the community to say that they are debarred from employment until every ex-National Army man has been absorbed in the public service.  As we have said many a time, men who were in the Army were at least fed and clothed and paid during the time they were in it.  They have now had a preference for a year or two years, and I submit that the time has arrived when that preference ought to be withdrawn, or certainly when that embargo upon non-Army men should be abandoned.  I could understand the case if it were said that here are fifty men unemployed; twenty of them were members of the National Army, and thirty of them were not; we are going to take men in proportion, so many from amongst the ex-Army men and so many civilians.  I maintain that if there is going to be anything like equity in the choice of persons to be employed at labour tasks, preference should be given to the men who have wives and families, and the greatest number of dependents.  As it is, what is happening is, that the man who has no dependents is in many cases taken on, while men who have families are left.  Many of these men with families have been unemployed for a long time.  They have run out of benefit under unemployment insurance, and are left to the mercy of home help, charity or something worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say, if there is going to be preference in the employment given in this branch of the service, it should be for men who have dependents.  I suggest, too, it is more likely that the men who have dependents would have had <Col N="2393" /> greater experience and be more efficient wage-earners, and that better and more efficient service would be obtained in the department by removing this embargo on civilian labour.  I have taken this particular department as an instance.  I think it is glaring in this case, because I understand from an official letter that the engineers consider they are bound only to consider applications from candidates who had hitherto been in the Army, and therefor all civilian applicants for employment are brushed aside.  The same complaint arises in respect to other departments. I want to press upon the Ministry, without arguing the question as to the rights or the wrongs of it in the past, that the time has arrived when that preference should be modified, and that at least a proportionate number of unemployed men who were not ex-Army men should be taken into employment, and that where there are preferences to be given it ought to be a preference for men who have families and responsibilities, rather than to young men who have no families and no responsibilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter which is not peculiar, as Deputy Johnson indicated, to the Post Office.  It applies to all Government departments. I admit at once the point made by Deputy Johnson, that the time must come when we will cease to give the degree of preference, amounting in certain cases to a monopoly, that has been given to ex-members of the National Army.  We reached a point when it became safe to demobilise the Army. We had some 55,000 men in the Army, and we turned them out in very large numbers within a very brief period, bringing the strength of the Army down to well under 20,000 men.  A great number of the men demobilised were married men with dependents. The unmarried men had, in many cases, the option of remaining on in the Army. We were doing away with dependents' allowances on the scale that we had been giving them, and it became impossible to retain a large number of married men in the Army.  That meant that something like 40,000 men who had been in the State service were being turned out on the streets.  We <Col N="2394" /> tried to reserve for them opportunities for employment in the service of the State.  We had several clerical examinations limited to ex-officers, and clerical examinations for Customs officers. We have abandoned the idea of holding any further examinations confined to ex-members of the National Army, or any further examinations reserved to that class, because the results of the more recent examinations have convinced us that we have got all the good material out of them.  It may be that in future men who served in the National Army will be given a certain preference by way of service marks, but examinations confined to those men will not be held.  So far as temporary employment was concerned, there was also a general instruction issued that in all cases the offices must employ only ex-members of the National Army.  Temporary clerks, and workmen, and so forth, were all drawn from the ranks of our ex-soldiers.  But the matter was never so rigid that if a department showed that suitable men, for the work to be done, could not be got from the ranks of ex-soldiers, they would not be permitted to go outside the ranks in particular cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether that was within a given area?  I understand there has been something like a ruling that even within a particular area, if men were required and ex-soldiers could not be obtained in that area, it was an obligation upon the official making the engagement to go outside the area and bring in ex-soldiers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be. I was really thinking where a particular type of skill or experience seemed to be necessary, if reasonably satisfactory ex-Army candidates could not be got the Departments were allowed to go outside the ranks of ex-service men. I realise very well that that sort of monopolistic preference is not a thing that could be continued indefinitely, and I recognise that it is a matter for consideration whether, very soon, there may not be some relaxation of the rule and whether we might not give people who have not served in the National <Col N="2395" /> Army a chance that they have not got at the present time.</P>
      <P>I think, therefore, in all the circumstances, we have certainly done no more for the ex-Army men than we should have done.  If they have not had the hardships, and all the dangers, perhaps, that soldiers have had to endure in some wars, at any rate, they did come in, and they did do service that saved the fabric of the State, and I do not think, whether the experiences that the soldiers have gone through have been very hard experiences or the reverse, that any State, or any Government, could afford, after what they have done, simply to turn them out on the streets and take no further interest in them.</P>
      <P>I think it is really necessary for a reasonable period, after a big batch of men have been demobilised, to use all the resources that we have in employing them in a proper way in the service of the State and for the purpose of meeting the claims that these men have, and, above all, which they feel they have.</P>
      <P>I have not gone carefully into the question whether the time has been reached when a change in the general policy should be made, and I, certainly, have not discussed it with other Ministers, but I admit Deputy Johnson's point, that we cannot continue that for years after demobilisation has taken place, and that, at some time, men must be presumed to have gone back to their ordinary avocations in some way, and to be in much the position that they would have been if they had not been in the Army.  And the same question must arise in all branches of the public service that has already arisen in the clerical grades.  As I have said, the position reached there is that we seem to have exhausted any suitable material that existed amongst the ex-Army men.  To some extent the same position is bound to be reached in other branches.  It is a matter about which I can only promise that careful consideration will be given to it.</P>

      <P>On sub-head (m) I want to make a few remarks and ask some questions regarding telephones. <Col N="2396" /> The Minister has said that they are very anxious to develop this service and that it would be a boon to the community.  I quite agree that the telephone service is a boon where there are communities, but where there are not communities and where the telephone has to be extended to private houses in rural districts, it is going to be a very expensive item.  I doubt if it is ever going to be a service that could economically be availed of by the average rural citizen.  I have had information, contained in a letter from the Minister's Department, as I mentioned earlier, where £30 was charged for an installation.  Not alone that, but a guarantee was asked for five years to justify the connection.  Rural populations will not always be as happy as the population to which Deputy Wolfe refers presumably is, where they have a doctor and a vet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Where there is no doctor or vet. within five or six miles, I am afraid the Deputy's idea cannot be carried out.  We know that doctors do not populate the country&mdash;fortunately for the country&mdash;quite so extensively as that and I rather think the results the Minister anticipates will not be realised.  I want the rural public to know that £30 is sought for an installation with a guarantee for five years.  That is what they have to contemplate for the service which is being dangled before them as something that they may avail themselves of in the future.  They can avail themselves of it at a price but that price is going to be prohibitive&mdash;whether it is justly prohibitive or not I am not prepared to discuss now.  But when this prospect is dangled before the rural population. they had better know what it means in money.  I am talking about the case of <Col N="2397" /> a man in County Dublin, who is living rather near the lines of communication. It seems to me that this is going to be a very expensive item to the average citizen of the country and one that is not likely to be availed of.  I would like to know what the Minister has to say about that and if he is going to charge on the basis of cost or on the basis of distance.  He should tell us what the charge is really going to be based upon.  That is a question that requires a clear understanding, and I hope the Minister will give us on that, at least, a clear explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the telephone service is one of the services in the Department for Posts and Telegraphs that is paying its way.  We hope, that being so, that the Minister will see his way to establish more call offices throughout the country.  I am quite sure that that would have the effect of bringing more business to the Post Office.  Everywhere about my district where there has been an office opened, it has been, so far as I know, a success. There are one or two other matters that I should like to allude to.  For a long time, the people of Kilcock have been most anxious to have a telephone office established there.  There were considerable difficulties in the way, but the Minister was good enough to say that if there were a certain number of guarantors got&mdash;I think eight&mdash;he would extend the telephone there.  I managed to get the names of fourteen guarantors but I have not yet heard that the telephone is in operation there.  I would like to know if it will soon be working.  There is no doubt about the guarantors and I am sure it would be a very paying proposition for the Post Office, because there are a certain number of racing men there who would employ it very much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain places where the call office and the telegraph office are not located together. People who have telephones in their <Col N="2398" /> houses cannot have telegrams delivered through the telephone.  It would be a great convenience to them to have telegrams delivered through the telephone and dispatched by means of the 'phone. Where the call office and the telegraph office are at different places, as I think is the case at Leixlip, it is a great inconvenience to many people who are under the necessity of sending and receiving telegrams.  I was asked if the Minister could be induced to establish trunk call offices on the Great Southern Railway, not at every station, but at important stations where fairs are held. If this were done, it would enable the people attending those fairs to communicate about the dispatch of stock to their own homes, so that it could be met at the trains.  Probably it would be a paying proposition for the Post Office, too.  Deputy Gorey alluded to the cost of installation.  My impression was that when the telephone was installed at my house and at the houses of my neighbours, we did not pay for the installation. At least, I have no recollection of having done so or of having paid anything beyond a certain yearly charge.</P>

Castledermot, in Kildare, has about 600 inhabitants, and the district about it is fairly populous.  They have been making representations there, for some time, to have the telephone installed there, and I would like to ask the Minister if it is his intention to provide telephonic communication to places like that.</P>

I am sure the Minister will take that into consideration and do the best he can for these betting people.</P>

      <P>I can assure Deputy Conlan that we are most anxious to extend the telephone to even the smallest villages.  We have got to cater for the larger ones, in the first instance.  Deputy Wolfe wants to know what are we doing about Kilcock. We hope to be operating in that particular quarter within the next three or four months.  We are suffering from a shortage of technical staff&mdash;a shortage which I see little hope of rectifying&mdash;and we do not anticipate being able to cope with this particular job at least for the next three months.  Some little time ago it was urged that we should introduce telephones to the important railway stations throughout the country, and erect call offices.  That can only be done in co-operation with the railway authorities, because it would not pay us to maintain officials there for that particular purpose.  We might, in the case of the Great Southern Railway, be able to co-ordinate the work of our own officials, who at present work the telegraph offices for the railway companies, with the telephone.  But that possibility only applies to the Great Southern Railway.</P>

      <P>There are other people <Col N="2400" /> interested in other lines.  There have been representations from the Great Northern, and also from the Midland Great Western section of the Southern Railways.  Deputy Gorey complains that we require our pound of flesh for the extension of the telephone, and that in one instance an annual fee of £30, plus a guarantee for five years, was imposed.  It was the custom of our predecessors, and it has continued in our time, to charge merely for the cost of capital expenditure, plus interest. Latterly, we have modified that somewhat, and made a sacrifice of State funds in order to expedite the introduction of the 'phone.  It must be remembered that the erection of a 'phone over a distance of four or five miles, entails the erection of new poles.  Then certain rights have to be got over land.  These things involve fairly heavy expenditure.  I do not see much hope of calling on unlimited State funds to aid in the installation of the telephone.  The hope of the telephone in the rural areas lies, first, in the opening of exchanges in these parts of the country that have even limited compact populations&mdash;I mean small villages&mdash;and secondly, by the extension of the party line, such as one finds in Scandinavia, the United States and in a few other countries.  The idea of extending a direct 'phone to every farmer's house is out of the question. The expense would be too much.  We will have to depend, in the first instance, on the opening of exchanges pretty well everywhere; and secondly, on getting the farmers to take on the party lines.  We believe they will, and we believe that will be the solution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>On this matter of telephones, I would like, if the Minister, before the debate is finished, would elaborate a little more on the question of the cost.  I do not know what the custom has been in the past with regard to charges, or what his intention is.  Is the idea that if the line is to be extended, say, to one farmer's house at his request, that that farmer is to bear the expense of the extension&mdash; that is, the cost of the extension to the Post Office?  If I understand that to be the case, I would suggest that that is <Col N="2401" /> not a good policy.  It is not a policy that is likely to result in the general utilisation of the telephone.  If one or two farmers in a district were anxious to get the telephone to their houses, it should be extended to their houses at the least possible cost, and not at the actual cost of the extension.  The very fact of these farmers getting the telephone and making use of it would encourage their neighbours, and where you would have one or two using it at first, you would have nine or ten in a short time.  I am a great believer in the use that can be made of the telephone in the country.  I differ in that respect from Deputy Gorey, because I have seen the use that can be made of it.  From a business point of view, and from the social aspect, great advantages can accrue to the people from the 'phone.  Great saving could be made with regard to time and expense if we could open up telephonic communication on a large scale throughout the country.  I would suggest to the Minister, if he is going to deal with this matter, that he ought to do it on a broad general plan, and resort to propaganda and publicity.  He should let the people know what it will cost and the advantages that will accrue to them if they avail of the telephone. If the Minister has not quite exhausted all he has to say, I would like if he would give us some idea of what the cost would be, and if the cost would vary from district to district, because I think this is a matter of great importance to the future development of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one question I asked the Minister, and he forgot to answer it.  That was about having the call office in all cases at the post office for the delivery by 'phone of telegrams sent there.  I think this is rather an important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not always possible to locate a telephone call office and a telegraph office in the same building. It should also be remembered that we have found a certain condition of affairs existing which is not easily changed, and cannot be changed without <Col N="2402" /> meeting with resistance.  Now, there is no difficulty at any time in utilising the telephone for either the receipt or the despatch of a telegram. Even if the offices are not located in the same building, arrangements can always be made whereby telegrams can be telephoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>Would there be any charge for sending the telegram from the post office to the call office?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>The telephone call office.  When a telegram arrives at the post office, would there be any charge for sending it to the call office for transmission by 'phone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>No; we never charge for transmission of a telegram by telephone, for the reason that we save messenger employment by that means. Now, we have a very definite scheme of telephone development.  I said at the outset that we are more keen on developing the telephone system than anything else.  We believe the country has more to gain through this medium. We have no doubt whatever about that. We regard the telegraph and the postal systems as back numbers, so to speak.  We think that the future of communication lies with the telephone. That has been proved to be the case in some of the most progressive nations in the world, and we hope to come within their magic sphere some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before you can really outline a scheme for developing telephones over the rural areas, you have to build up the main channels.  We found those channels semi-vacant, practically vacant and undeveloped.  There were very few telephones in use in Ireland.  We are building up those channels now.  The main channels are practically built up and we are getting on to the feeding sources, the smaller rivers, so to speak. From those we will go on to the streamlets and in that way we will go right down through the various stages of development.  We have not yet covered all the towns.  There are towns in parts of Connaught, for instance, not developed.  As a matter of fact, we <Col N="2403" /> are only entering that province.  We have to deal with the bigger centres before we come to the smaller ones. When we come to the smaller areas we will have to envisage a scheme whereby we will be able to get into the rural parts and so complete the final stages.</P>
    <P>There is nothing new in this respect. There is nothing confronting us that has not been done elsewhere.  We have a headline for everything, and the farmers need have no doubt about it that we are most anxious to extend the telephone all over the Saorstát.  Further, it will be the policy of the Department to subsidise the system from its own finances.  In other words, during the coming year we will net £30,000 or £40,000 after the concession that we made in this Budget, and I would rather favour the idea of a further concession. We must make the telephones cheap and general.  It is the great channel through which the public business can be done.  It is rapid and it is timesaving and it puts us in a position to do our business with the same efficiency and speed as our competitors.  That is why we are very keen on this question of telephones, and there need be no doubt that whenever and wherever we get an opportunity of establishing the telephones, we are going to do it with a will.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of points that I wish to bring under the attention of the Minister.  Deputy Wolfe has referred to those who have the telephones installed and he has touched on the question of having call offices different from Post Offices.  Would it be possible for the Minister to arrange that when a wire is sent, even where the call office is not at the Post Office, that a subscriber will be asked if he desires to take the wire by telephone? There is usually a charge for delivery, and it could be avoided in that case.  I know many cases of the sort, both personally and otherwise, through friends, and I am sure there are other Deputies who could instance similar cases.  I would suggest to the Minister that the number of subscribers considered necessary in small villages, <Col N="2404" /> small country districts, would be reduced to a minimum, provided that his Department does not lose by the installation of the telephone in that particular village or district.  I do not want to put it that they should not make any profit, but possibly the Minister could see his way to have the number of subscribers reduced somewhat. I know that to reach some fourteen or fifteen subscribers, wires have to be run a considerable distance and poles erected, and possibly, in some cases, rights over lands have to be acquired. and paid for; but in most of the small country towns and villages the telephone would be a decided advantage.</P>
      <P>Then, again, you have local creameries. In many of the creameries that exist they have already a telephone.  It is most important from their point of view.  If the telephone is extended as is suggested, it would be of great benefit, as Deputy Gorey and Deputy Conlan pointed out, to farmers in the country.  I happen to know that the telephone is the medium through which practically all the small farmers in Denmark conduct their business.  Of course you have more people of that type there than you have in this country, and therefore there is the possibility of securing more subscribers. The 200-acre rancher is not a great asset to the Post Office or to postal authorities, because he would cost too much to give a single installation to. There are so many small farmers in Denmark, it is easier to facilitate them in the matter of the telephone, and they can communicate direct with the bacon factories or the creameries.  It is certainly a great advantage to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point that I would like to touch upon.  It would be advisable on the evening before cattle fairs&mdash;I do not refer to markets; they do not count for much except, perhaps, in some areas&mdash;to have the telephone office left open for at least one hour longer than usual.  You have numbers of buyers coming from different parts of Ireland.  They might get into the town about 6 o'clock in the evening, and they might want to telephone at about 8 o'clock.  They may want the returns from markets on the other side; they might want to know particulars <Col N="2405" /> about the Dublin market on a Thursday, or about Smithfield, Birkenhead, etc.  Without the telephone office being left open they cannot get through to their principals in Dublin to ascertain the rates in relation to the cross-Channel markets.  They would need all that information in the morning for their business at the fair.  Numbers of complaints have been received from different parts of Ireland in regard to that matter.  I would ask the Minister to extend the time for telephone calls on the evenings before fairs.  I have no doubt the farmers will support me in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. COLE Mr. COLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to support Deputy D'Alton as regards the hours for telephone calls.  In the town of Cavan, for instance, the telegraph office is not open until 9 a.m.  That applies also to fair mornings.  Farmers and dealers going to the fairs want to have the earliest possible information in regard to city markets and cross-Channel markets, and 9 o'clock is too late.  It is really too late even on an ordinary day, not to speak of a fair day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to say one thing in connection with this matter. We would very much appreciate and welcome a greater development of the telephone service.  We, like the Minister, believe that as far as small messages go, the telephone is going to be the medium of the future.  We believe it is going to replace the telegraph service. It may, to some extent, replace the postal service, but I take it the postal service is something you can never abandon; I do not think we can in our time, at least.  It must be maintained. Therefore, how this service will affect the postal service is not a matter of much concern now.  Where it affects the telegraph service, we come to a big matter.  The Minister has told us that the loss of the telegraph service runs into a quarter of a million.  That is a thing we cannot look at and pass away from without having some food for thought.  Complaints have been made with regard to the delivery of telegrams, and I think a position has been put up that is rather unanswerable from a few points of view.  The citizen in the rural districts <Col N="2406" /> is placed at an extraordinary disadvantage.</P>
      <P>To help the Minister to develop this particular service and to bring more benefit to the rural community we are prepared to co-operate as far as possible in every way with the postal service in regard to the development of this service.  That is altogether different from what Deputy Heffernan thinks. I think we are of the same mind, but the question of cost in this individual case has been brought under my notice by a letter.  The letter has been sent to me but I have not it here now.  It is in order to remedy that state of affairs, to get a better understanding and to have a much better scheme, that I asked the question and I want an explanation about it.  If that idea of charging £30 a year for five years got abroad and if it was not going to be remedied and a better system adopted, I have no hesitation in saying that you could bid good-bye to rural development of the telephone for years.  I do think the Minister must go further, much further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that there have been considerable differences of opinion with regard to how this service is administered in the country and the Minister's viewpoint, considerable differences of opinion.  I do not think that an Advisory Committee has been set up in connection with this Ministry.  Advisory Committees have been set up in other Ministries, especially extern Ministries. The Minister for Lands and Agriculture&mdash;and when we talk about the Minister for Lands and Agriculture I think it will be admitted that we are talking about one of the most efficient Ministers and one of the most efficient Ministries we have&mdash;has thought it advisable to set up Advisory Committees under the special Acts.  Not alone has he set them up under one special Act but he thought it well in connection with the working of other special Acts to have an Advisory Committee. The Minister for Local Government has also an Advisory Committee. On the question of the roads he has the Roads Advisory Board.  I think in order to give the country confidence in this Ministry and in order to have a better working arrangement, a better understanding between the public and <Col N="2407" /> the Minister, that the appointment of an Advisory Committee would be something that would bridge over the acute difference of opinion that at present exists.</P>
    <P>I can see if arrangements are made, whereby a body of rural citizens can come together and guarantee a call office and deal with that question, that this service of telephones is going to be greatly extended in the very near future.  I want to assure the Minister and the Government that although in the early part of this Vote a certain spirit originated&mdash;I do not hold it was altogether our fault; there is no use going into it now&mdash;we are prepared to co-operate with the Minister if the Minister is prepared to co-operate with the rural population.  I say the best move in that direction would be the setting up of an Advisory Committee on which the rural population will be represented. The general public and the different interests will be represented on it and in that case any fault that is to be found will be attributed to that Advisory Committee and will not be so much a fault of the Minister.  It will bring about an atmosphere of more confidence and I think that is very desirable in this Ministry for the reasons we have debated earlier in the Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>To suggest that a Committee of that kind should come along and advise on a service of this kind is very nice, but I do not think it would work.  On the other hand, if a citizen requires us to run a private 'phone any number of miles through the country, we are prepared to run it if that citizen pays.  The fact of taking an individual of that type, where a payment of £30 annually is called for, as an example of what the telephone system should be or may be, is not, I suggest, fair, and has no bearing on the situation.  Our difficulty is not to get users for this system, but to meet the requirements of the users. I do not see much prospect within the next two or three years of our keeping up with the public demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy D'Alton has some doubts about the utilisation of 'phone offices for telegraph work.  There may be a few cases in the country where it is not possible to bring these two systems into play, but they are very few cases.  There is an instance in Foxrock&mdash;to take one case&mdash;where you have got a telegraph section in one building and, a mile away, a telephone call office.  In that case the telegrams are dealt with by the Central Telegraph Office here, direct to the addressee. I quite agree that there is something in the suggestion that exchanges should be kept open in towns or in rural centres on the eve of a market.  We may be able to extend the time for an hour or two, and certainly the matter will be carefully considered. It seems to be a very reasonable suggestion.  Deputy Cole tells us that some post offices on like occasions are not open until 9 a.m.  My information <Col N="2409" /> is that there are no such cases. There were up to twelve months ago. No exception was made on a fair or a market day.  We, at the request of some Deputies here, introduced a system whereby post offices were opened specially early on those days.  If there is any exception I would be very pleased to be made aware of it.</P>

    <P>The Message prescribed by the Constitution has been received from his Excellency the Governor-General.  The sums required under the heading of (a) are not really in the nature of new provisions at all.  The provisions of Section 1 of the Land Act of 1923 are re-enacted, with certain amendments, and they are dealt with under this head (a).  Head (b) deals with a new point, namely, the repayment to the British Government in respect of expenditure incurred by that Government in fulfilling any guarantee given by the British Government for the payment of the principal and interest on any land bonds created for the purposes of the Land Act, 1923.  This question of the desirability and the advantage of having land bonds guaranteed by the British Government has been discussed at considerable length, and I do not propose at the moment to add anything to what I have already said on the subject. It will be clear to Deputies, of course, that if we are to accept the guarantee naturally we must make arrangements to repay any sums that might be advanced on foot of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The last time this matter was discussed was on the Second Reading, and in the course of the discussion we were informed by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, and particularly by Deputy Egan, that this was not a matter to be considered in any other light than that of hard business.  Deputy Egan told us that he was not swayed to the slightest <Col N="2413" /> extent by any sentimental rubbishy talk about British interference or about the British stranglehold, and frequently in the course of his speech disclaimed that sentiment had any influence in his make-up so far as this Bill was concerned. It was pure hard business. Coming from a Deputy who sails under the flag of a party which has given itself a Gaelic name for sentimental reasons, and whose reason for existence lies very largely in sentiment, it is amusing, if not interesting, to find a Deputy insisting that, at any rate, he is not swayed by any sentimental interests or emotions.  While it is well to adopt a hard business attitude in dealing with purely business affairs, I wish to submit that this is not purely a business affair, and that it cannot be considered apart from sentiment.  The basis of this Bill is said to have been laid in the time of the Treaty discussions in London.  I have not been able to find any references in the Treaty debates in the Dáil touching upon any bargain or undertaking that was entered into with respect to the British guarantee of land bonds.  I suggest to Deputies that there would have been a different result of those debates had the House been informed that part of the arrangements with the British Government at the time was that there should be a completion of land purchase on compulsory terms, that the British Government would guarantee the bonds issued by the Irish Government and that any repayment that might be made to the British Government under that guarantee, would, of necessity, be paid in British currency. Had the contents of this Bill been laid before the Dáil that discussed the Treaty arrangements, I have no hesitation in saying that the Treaty would never have been approved.  In introducing in the British House the parallel Bill which undertook the guarantee, the mover, Lieutenant-Colonel Guinness, used these words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present plan is based on a financial agreement between the Imperial Government and the Irish Free State to deal with matters arising out of the Treaty, and which provided that the Free State Government <Col N="2414" /> should finance the completion of land purchase by the issue of an Irish stock at 4½ per cent. to be guaranteed as to capital and interest, subject to agreed provision for redemption, by the British Government. The security for the payment of interest and sinking fund will be provided in the Bill in the form of the Central Fund of the Irish Free State and on any special funds established for the purpose with priority over any future charges.</P>
    <P>Last year, in pursuance of this agreement, the Irish Free State passed an Act to deal with the machinery of land purchase.</P>
    <P>Mr. Runciman who had been a member of the Government, I think, which completed the Treaty, also spoke of this Bill being governed by the financial agreement which was a parallel to that Treaty.  Neither the Dáil of 1921-22, nor the Provisional Government, nor the Dáil which succeeded the Provisional Government, was ever informed that there had been an agreement in respect to the purchasing of land, with a British guarantee to the bonds, and that any payment would be in British currency.  That agreement was not disclosed at the time of the Treaty arrangements, or had not been disclosed until the production of this Bill.  The agreement, therefore, cannot be said to be one binding upon the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Minister responsible for introducing the parallel Bill told the members of the British House of Commons that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are only guaranteeing Free State legislation.  We stand behind their Bill (that is the Land Act) in order to see that the landlords shall not be losers by any temporary weakness of Free State finance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to dispute the obligation that we are under to give landlords who are being bought out under the Land Act any reason for going outside the ordinary securities which the Irish State can give and thereby formally, to however slight an extent, by an Act of this legislature place ourselves under an obligation to another State.  The landlords who are being bought out now have nothing to complain about.  They <Col N="2415" /> had their opportunity to come to agreements with their tenants under the old Land Acts.  They waited until they were compelled and, being compelled, they say: &ldquo;We will accept compulsion, but we are now going to refuse, in effect, allegiance to the Irish State which is buying us out; we are going to stand under the shelter, the guarantee, of the British Government, whose legislation hitherto we have refused to take advantage of.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture told us that we should remember that landlords belong to the State and had the same rights in it as every other class. Do they?  If they do, why do they want special treatment?  Why do they want the treatment of citizens of Britain and the guarantees of Britain?  Why are they not prepared to accept the risk that every other person with whom the Irish State entered into obligations undertakes?  Why do the landlords, who are to be given the same rights as every other citizen of the Saorstát, want special treatment?  The bonds that are to be issued are secured, first by the payment of annuities in respect to the sales.  They are secured also by the Central Fund.  The holders of National Loan are just as much entitled to security as landowners who may or may not be holders of National Loan. But the holders of National Loan did not seek the guarantee of the British Government.</P>
    <P>There is to be another loan some time, more or less soon, in relation to the Shannon scheme, Barrow drainage, and other drainage, and the persons who are willing to lend are prepared to accept the risks that citizenship of the Saorstát carries with it, or, if they are not citizens, they are prepared to accept the security the Saorstát can give.  But these other citizens, whom we are asked to remember as belonging to the State, are to continue to be granted exceptional treatment which is not in the bond.  We have never contracted, as far as I know, to give to the landlords exceptional treatment.</P>
    <P>The question was raised on the last occasion, and will be raised again, of <Col N="2416" /> the provision regarding currency, which is an entirely new proposition: that if it ever happens that the Saorstát is called upon by the British Government to make good its obligations, or if at any time any change takes place with regard to currency, whether the British Government enters into it or not, the holders of these bonds shall be paid in British currency.  The Minister for Agriculture told us he had never heard of any loan being floated the interest on which was to be paid in any other currency than the currency of the time at which the loan was floated.  I wonder can any Minister tell us what is the position, say, of pensioners whose claims for pensions ante-date or precede the claims under this Land Act?  Are they always to be guaranteed to be paid in British currency, or are they to run risks that any other citizen will run as to the value of any Irish currency that may at any time within the next 80 years be in operation?  The holders of National Loan stock may well, and certainly with the same amount of justification, demand that whatever happens their payments the value of their interests in the market, its purchasing power must never be lower in any case than the value of British currency in the market.  I do not understand what kind of answer would be given to holders of National Loan stock or to pensioners if they demanded, at least, that never at any time must they be paid in a currency which is of less value than British currency.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the effect of this provision is going to be to tie up the Saorstát to the British financial system, and to the British currency system.  We may voluntarily decide that it is better to continue to be tied up in that way. We may.  I think we shall not always but for quite a long time no doubt there will be a great deal to be said in favour of that view.  But why should we enter into this bond with citizens of the Saorstát, persons to whom the Minister refers as having the same rights as any other class in the community? Why should we be binding ourselves in respect to a contract already entered into without any such <Col N="2417" /> obligation to pay the interest in a currency which may be of more value at the time than the currency which is operating within this State, and of which they are presumed to be citizens? I have not yet heard any argument which, to my mind, justifies the passing of this Bill or for the Dáil to agree to enter into this further compact with the landlords.  They have a right to take all the risks that any other citizen of the Saorstát has to take.</P>
    <P>I said before that the kind of obligation that is being entered into here by Britain, undoubtedly gives an added interest on their part in the doings of the legislature here.  The Minister told us that there was already £130,000,000 worth of stock floated which would be exactly in the same position as this £30,000,000.  That may be true.  If that is one of the obligations we took over, if that was the position which we entered upon, I say we are quite wrong now in deliberately entering upon a new obligation of that kind to add another £30,000,000 to the £130,000,000, which invites the British Government to take a fatherly interest or a creditor's interest in the doings of the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what provision is made, for instance&mdash;there is certainly none in the Bill&mdash;for deciding when there had been default on our part.  In recent months we have seen the way nations and Governments have had to enter into arrangements with their creditors, being other states, and assuming at some future time there was depression and inability to meet liabilities on the spot, who is to say whether there has been absolute default or merely stringency?  The British Government is going to determine. They are going to pay our liability under these bonds, and then we are to be in the position of being absolutely dependent on their willingness to forego payment.  We would not be able to enter into a general undertaking with all our creditors for deferring payment of interest unless the British Government came along and said they agreed, and they could make their own conditions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson has his own views on this matter which, I think, are very <Col N="2418" /> well worthy of consideration; that by this Bill you are making more difficult the redemption of the bonds.  You may be making more difficult the redemption of the bonds, but I leave that for him to develop if he has anything to say on it.  I have yet to learn what value there is of a business kind&mdash;this hard business kind that the Minister for Agriculture spoke of, and that Deputy Egan emphasised&mdash;which is going to be heavier in the balance as between what may be called the political view and the desirability of maintaining to what extent we can a sense of self-reliance. I also want to know why we should give these exceptional terms to landlords that we refuse to give to any other creditor?  It may be said there was an undertaking in the terms of this Bill.  Will the terms of that undertaking and the date of it be made known to the Dáil?  If there has been no undertaking, then I am very anxious to know what are the arguments in favour of passing this Bill or this resolution?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson rightly asks why special terms should be given to the bond-holders, and I might well ask why the cost of these special terms should be at the expense of the tenant occupiers.  He claims that these bond-holders should not be placed in a better position than those who have subscribed to the National Loan. I claim that the <i>quid pro quo</i> for which they received paper is not at all on a level with a cash payment.  What does the State acquire for these land bonds? They have acquired an interest in the land held by people who at one time were spoken of as landlords, but who are now extinct in the sense of being landlords.  They gave a security which was undoubtedly a non-negotiable security, and the State, as a trustee for the tenant occupiers, acquired that security, not to become a State owner, but to pass that security on to the occupiers and the occupiers will be the ultimate purchasers of these land bonds.  Therefore, if by your Bill you inflate the value of the land bonds, by that much are you prejudicing these occupiers working on the land.  Most of us have been astounded to find that in connection <Col N="2419" /> with the £130,000,000 issued for the purchase of land in Ireland, this State pays a huge sum annually to implement the Land Commission in order to become a rent collector for Britain.  Is it intended that in addition we should still keep on the staff at our expense to collect this £30,000,000 and to pass over the interest on the £160,000,000 yearly to the National Debt Commissioners in London to manage how they will?  I say that is a bad way.  I say that we should use the Sinking Fund drawn from these tenants on the agreement that that Sinking Fund should be here and that every advantage which the fluctuation in the market, especially in the stock market, gives, ought to be obtained by those trustees for the people who are paying it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us assume that thirty million pounds worth of land bonds have been issued.  Were it not for these guarantees the price of that stock would be in the neighbourhood of 84 or 85, and yearly into the coffers of the Minister for Finance would flow £76,000, which he could operate by purchasing at 84 as paper, and thereby give the people who provide the Sinking Fund a benefit of 16 per cent.  That 16 per cent. would operate at compound interest.  The first year you would extinguish probably £90,000 worth of land bonds.  The following year you would have extinguished £90,000 plus that amount of interest for the previous year.  You will have the amount of £90,000 added on to your annual sum.  The result will be that the operations of the Sinking Fund would become very much accelerated and the tenant occupiers would be rid of their liabilities more quickly, and in the ordinary operation of the transfer of farms from one man to another, you would lessen the amount of tax which would go on these people. If a purchaser under the Land Act of 1923 sells his farm he has to pay transfer fees on the amount of money which he receives from the buyer plus the amount of his unextinguished debt held by the Commission.  That is, he has to pay interest on the amount of his unextinguished debt, added to the amount he pays in the open market, and that is the amount of money involved on <Col N="2420" /> every occasion when there is a transfer of a farm under the Land Acts.  If the Sinking Fund were operated on the price in the market the amount of each man's liability would be so much diminished, and the amount which the buyer would pay on transfer fees would thereby be diminished also.  If he desired to redeem his farm, the operations of the Sinking Fund on the Free State credit basis would give a much lesser sum.</P>

      <P>I have never known the Minister for Finance, nor anybody here, to take up a position to discredit our securities.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>My argument is that not alone are you giving certain special people, bond-holders, more credit than this State is able to afford, but by giving that extra credit you are taking it away from people who can very badly afford it.  In other words, you are applying in the very opposite direction the principles which underlie your tariff proposals.  In this case you are taxing the many for the benefit of the few.  You are making them pay more.  You are imposing a burden on the multitude for the benefit of the few.  I will not deal with this question from a high political or sentimental standpoint.  I am dealing with it as it affects the people I am supposed to speak for here, and these Deputies who prate about representing the tenants should go back to the tenants and tell them that &ldquo;In the interest of Free State credit, and in the interest of floating future loans, and in the interest of the community, we are singling you out to help that particular principle and you will have to pay the burden.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy, but he is occupying <Col N="2421" /> the time of the Dáil about a matter to which he does not seem to have given much attention.  If the Deputy looks at the opening clause of the Act of 1923, he will see provision for redeeming at par, and there is no new principle to be introduced as regards the rate at which bonds are to be paid, unless the Deputy wants some change made now so as to reduce credit.</P>

      <P>Certainly, but there was never a business transaction such as he is proposing now.  I say deliberately that sooner than benefiting any number of people in this country by the way the Deputy suggests, I would willingly retire from public life and advise every man to keep out of it. In my existence I never listened to the propounding of such a dishonest doctrine, and I know the Deputy is an honest man.  I never heard it propounded by either a financier, a banker, a business man, or even a tenant farmer.  If he buys a thing he will not seek to depreciate its value for the person who sells it.  The Deputy seeks to parade this country as if it were a beggar before the other nations.  I would not have that for the price of a thousand Acts such as this.</P>

      <P>The President stated to me that the yearly operation of the Sinking Fund was to redeem at the market value all the land stock.  That was the operation he was continuing.

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>You will not deny that the landlords got cash in 1903, and the land stock, such as it was, was placed in the market at its market value, and in order to give them cash we owe £130,000,000 for possibly £100,000,000 worth of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The President says I cannot have it both ways.  It was pointed out by the Minister for Finance that this £30,000,000 would be placed in the market.  If he adopts what I suggest they will not be placed in the market but kept in the safe, and, instead of depreciating the currency or credit, you will thereby be removing from the market a lot of paper, which landlords before the passing of the Act were willing to take, subject to the fact that they would not disburse any of these bonds for ten years.  I do not want to introduce any heat, or to speak as a Bolshevist, but I am speaking in the interests of the people who sent me here.  I am not speaking in any way as one who is anxious to do anything wrong, but during the operations of the last ten years the stock guaranteed by Britain fell fifty per cent., and through that operation the tenants gained the benefit.  The man buying under the 1903 Act, paid into the Sinking Fund, calculated at 2¾ per cent.  The fall in the stock made that Sinking Fund operate at 5 per cent.  Why should we not allow the same thing to occur now?</P>

      <P>Why not do the same with the National Loan?  We got <Col N="2423" /> £10,000,000; let us pay £8,000,000. That is your argument.</P>

      <P>No.  To the extent of the encumbrances which these landlords held upon their lands they have got 20/- in the £, because we have given them paper at face value, and to the extent of the balance we agree to give them 4½ per cent. until redeemed, but these monies which will be paid away on death duties or encumbrances will come on the market.  They will not be lost to the landlord, for he has got his 20/- in the £ for them.  They will come on the market, and financial institutions, fire insurance companies, and others can invest if they consider that better than selling at 84 per cent.  If it is sold we should be entitled with our £67,000 a year to buy it.  That is what I am speaking about.

He is paid in full.  The other man can hold his paper as long as he likes.  If he keeps it long enough he will be redeemed at par.  If he wishes to cash the security he cannot cash it before he loses 16 per cent. on his investment, and he puts it into rubbers or anything else he likes.  I do not see where that man is forced to sell, and I cannot see, as I have said, where there is anything wrong from an ethical point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the first time we have heard a statement such as we have just listened to.  It is based on wrong premises, and it is founded on a system of finance which I hope is not going to operate in this country.  If I have learned one lesson from the British it is that they honour their bond, and in no case has the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the Financial Secretary of the Treasury ever propounded such a suggestion as we have heard.  Now what must be in the mind of the person whose land has been compulsorily taken from him by an Act of Parliament here?  If I were to take by Act of Parliament Deputy Wilson's cattle and say, &ldquo;I will give you stock for it, and you can keep that and draw your 4½ per cent. every year, and if you or any other tenant farmer put it on the market it is at your loss and the State is going to benefit by it,&rdquo; what would Deputy Wilson say?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not put it on the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he would keep it in his pocket.  We are all going to exist on paper.  As far as that is concerned, we issued £10,000,000 worth of National Loan, and we saw when nervous people rushed into the market with a quarter of a million pounds of National Loan what effect it had on the market.  What is the reason of that?  I wonder did Deputy Wilson <Col N="2425" /> ever take into consideration the cause of such an extraordinary fluctuation in the National Loan?  What was it due to?  Nervousness.  A few more speeches such as that made by the Deputy and that nervousness would amount to hysteria.  We have always been told by the nervous gentlemen who control the banks in every country that capital is very shy and that credit is subject to the slightest winds that blow. The statement made by Deputy Wilson is not, in my opinion, a fair statement. He urges that people who were tenant purchasers have the right to get an opportunity to buy stock which is to be depreciated in value.  That is not sale.  They will not sell their cattle for paper, and they are entitled to honour the bonds that have been issued on their behalf.</P>
      <P>The question of sentiment was raised. I would not allow sentiment to come into this at all.  I think I have had as much sentiment in my associations with public life as any other man that was ever in it.  I was one of those who, from my earliest years, built upon sentiment, and who spoke about sentiment to other people, but I never allowed it to interfere with my business. When I was engaged doing public business as a member of the Dublin Corporation, I never allowed one sixpence of the Corporation money to go astray on account of sentiment.  When I made terms with the banks at that time, or when I suggested or negotiated loans, I never allowed sentiment to operate from the fact that we had the money of the Englishman.  The fact that we were at war with him would never prevent me from paying him his due or from giving him his last ounce or his last penny, even though at the time he was sending over people here to slaughter our people.  We kept our word with him, and we paid him, and it is only by that means that we will manage to be in a position to raise the credit and to keep the credit of this country in a stable condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I drew attention a few moments ago to the fact that we had £10,000,000 of a National Loan.  At a time of crisis it reduced in value.  We are now going to put £30,000,000 on the market. When Deputy Wilson speaks of incumbrances <Col N="2426" /> and says that these things are going to go on the market, I say, that in my view, they are the things that are not going to go on the market.  In my view, if anything goes on the market it will be the landlord's portion. Incumbrances are held by charities, mortgagees, banks, and institutions of that kind.  Why should they sell?  In my view, there is no reason in the world why they should sell.  They can have their 4½ per cent. in respect of this bond issue, and if they were have to pay transfer fees, which cost something.</P>
    <P>Landlords may do that because some of them, at any rate, take some interest in their lands.  A great number of them may not have done that in the past, but it will be admitted, I think, that even landlords require some sort of employment, and the drawing of interest at the rate of 4½ per cent. in a case of this sort is not the very best means of employing one's life.  They are not all elderly men, and it is only natural that there should be changes in their investments.  It is their money that is going to come on the market if it is going to be put on the market at all.  I said that this means £30,000,000. If we do not accept this guarantee, it means watering our national resources to the extent of a paper issue of £30,000,000 worth of bonds.  Is that good business?  Has any Deputy here who opposes this measure, consulted any banker, financier, or man in business and asked him: &ldquo;Can we afford another £30,000,000 worth of paper of our own?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputies need only go and examine the bank deposits.  They stand to-day at something like £180,000,000 or £190,000,000 of money.  I should say that about £90,000,000 of that sum is held in easily realisable securities, and the most easily realisable securities are British securities, and for a very good reason: that they have always honoured their bonds.  They have honoured their American commitments, even though people in England criticised them for doing so, but they have done it, and they have kept their credit high by reason of that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2427" /> We have got that £90,000,000 worth of their securities, which, as far as the banks are concerned, could, I suppose, be cashed in forty days on the London money market.  That would not in the slightest degree affect the money market. They could pay out all that is required. But if our banks had to shoulder this £30,000,000 worth of securities, what is going to happen?  The young State is bound to stagger under such a financial burden.  It is too much, and if anyone doubts that I would ask an answer to this question.  Why is it, in the case of the National Loan for £10,000,000, held in many instances by our own people, that the mere sale of a quarter of a million of that stock reduced it by 5 or 6 points on the market, if there is any point in sentiment?  I ask Deputies who talk about sentiment and put it in the balance against this proposal, to consider what position their sentiment would be in when we had taken up such a loan as that without any security from another country, and when we found ourselves unable to take up that amount of paper thrown on the market.  The position would be that other nations looking on would simply laugh at us because we had taken on more than we could bear. &ldquo;The baby State cannot bear it.&rdquo; After, perhaps, twenty or thirty years of experience in Government, the State will be able to bear it when we have men in the country who will have a sense of decency, men with a tradition for stability and good business behind them.  But this burden would be too much to ask the country to bear at this moment, and I say that in a matter of this sort sentiment in this case is false pride.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.  I am dealing with the whole thing now. I am dealing, in the first place, with the fact that even if 70,000 farmers in the country should benefit only to the extent of £5 or £10 a year, that the price is too much in my view for this country to pay if it is to be obtained <Col N="2428" /> at the cost of the credit of the country. Every one of these small farmers, severe though it may be upon them to pay this price, had better realise that their duty as citizens and as business men calls upon them to honour any bond to which their representatives here in this Dáil put their name.  Remember this Parliament went to the country after they had passed the Land Bill and got returned.  Now the British Government, through negotiations, brought up this question of land purchase. I have made it a point not to bring any people into the discussion, because I do not mean to mix up politics in discussions such as this.  It may be that people outside, some of them, will contradict the statement, but there is no doubt whatever that the representatives of what are called Southern Unionists were in close consultation with Mr. Griffith and Mr. Collins during the peace negotiations.  In the beginning, I believe, they were in consultation with Mr. de Valera.  The question of land purchase was the main subject occupying the attention of the Southern Unionists.  There were, of course, representations on other matters. Every one of these items did not come out, but I am perfectly satisfied that when the Treaty discussions were under consideration in 1921 if the question of land purchase for the 70,000 tenants not then bought were to be ventilated as a matter that would be remedied within eighteen months of the acceptance of that Treaty, I say without any hesitation whatsoever that we would have got a great deal more support for the acceptance of the Treaty for that particular reason rather than be damaged by reason of such a bargain as that having been mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Government has undertaken to guarantee these bonds.  Are they not entitled in guaranteeing them to say that any payments that we make should be of the same nature and quality and of the same cost and value as the payments they are going to make?  Would it be an honest transaction for us to say to the British Government: &ldquo;We will take your guarantee but we will pay in whatever currency may be in operation in Ireland <Col N="2429" /> when these bonds become due&rdquo;?  That would not be a business transaction.  I would not take a guarantee from an English House to the effect that they would pay me interest in bonds in their currency if I was under the impression that that currency was likely to be reduced in value.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been fluctuating for some years past in the right direction.  To-day it is one-sixteenth; seven-sixteenth is all that they are on the wrong side at the present moment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that any fluctuation that may take place in this State will not exceed seven-sixteenth in twenty shillings, and if it does, there ought to be no objection to our subscribing to that particular transaction. Why do we subscribe to it?  Simply because we are being given value for value received.  What value are we receiving in this case?  The value we are receiving is the value of being relieved of 30 million pounds of paper being placed upon our banks and upon our financial system.  Thirty million pounds is being kept off our financial market.  Are we prepared to pay for it?  I say it is our duty to pay for it. We could not, unless we were dishonest people, agree to accept a guarantee by the British Government for this sum of money, and not agree to pay to the British Government the value of the guarantee they are giving us.  Now it is said we owe this money to the British Government.  We do not.  We do not owe the £130,000,000 to the British Government in connection with the Land Act of 1903, and we will not owe this thirty millions to the British Government.  We do owe it to the bond holders, and it may be that of that £130,000,000 something like twenty or thirty millions is held by our own citizens and the British Government is simply a clearing house in the transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is twenty-two years since the Land <Col N="2430" /> Act of 1903 was passed.  At that time, although I was very young, I appreciated the gigantic minds behind such a big proposition as that was.  Other Deputies in this Dáil, if they throw their minds back to that period, must agree that they must have been very favourably impressed with the magnitude of the operations under the Act of 1903.  It was a great Act, a wonderful Act, but our own Act of last year was even better, and for a young State to have been able to undertake such a transaction and to perform such a transaction as that was certainly to its credit, and very much to its credit. Thirty or forty years ago, if men were told that they would have their lands bought out to-day and at such a reduction, as compared with the rents they were then paying, they would have said it was impossible.  They would be prepared to pay if they got that offer, and would have said it was a great opportunity, and would not look for any fluctuations in the market price or for any diminution of their annual liability in respect of that if they were able to get it.  That is all we are asking in this Bill, and that is all the British Government are asking from us.  If the British Government did not ask for that guarantee, one would have to examine the offer and to see what ulterior motive there was behind it. If we had not given any guarantee in that commercial transaction, we would have to look for some ulterior motive on the part of the British Government, just as if Deputy Wilson came down to a bank and guaranteed me for a thousand pounds without asking me to show him whether I had a thousand pounds worth of security in my possession to guarantee him, I think we would come to the conclusion that he was a man who was gambling away his money.  In this matter the landlords would not have been agreeable to the purchase price if they did not get this undertaking.  By getting this undertaking they are only placed in the same position as their friends who sold under the 1903 and the 1909 Acts.  Even with this guarantee they are not getting 20/- in the £ on their investments or purchase.</P>

We thought that was a very sensible proposition, and we stand over it.  We recommend it to the Dáil in that spirit, and we believe it is due to these people who in past years could not get the British Government to redeem its promise.

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to add a few words to what the President said in reply to Deputy Wilson.  I do not think that any Deputy here will doubt that the National credit is a most important thing.  If we are to have any developments in this country, various great works of construction must be undertaken by the State from time to time.  Unless the State's credit is good, none of these works can be undertaken on a fair basis.  Moreover, if the State's credit is bad, the credit of individual firms and of individual enterprises in the State will also be bad.  The whole future of the country will be prejudiced by bad national credit.  My submission is that the State cannot maintain its credit and do the sort of dirty trick that some cheap dealer or money-lender would do.  We issued bonds compulsorily. We took property from people compulsorily.  We gave them bonds of the face value of £100&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I question the use of the word &ldquo;compulsorily.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy allow me to proceed?  We took land by Act of the Oireachtas compulsorily from people.  We issued them bonds of a certain face value.  It is our duty as a State to take all reasonable steps, at all times, to see that these bonds are kept as nearly at their face value as possible.  To do anything else, either to take any injurious positive action or to neglect to take any reasonable action that would keep them at par value, would be in the nature of sharp practice&mdash;the sort of thing that no State <Col N="2434" /> can afford to do.  Some shady individual may do that sort of thing in connection with his own business.  The State must try to secure, when it issues bonds at a certain face value, that everything reasonable will be done to keep them at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be very easy for the Government to organise a scare that would run the National Loan down to 30 or 40, and to redeem at that.  But nobody will advocate that that is a thing we ought do.  If the National Loan went down to 50, it would not be the duty of the Government to try to keep it there, and redeem cheaply, but to try to raise it up as near par as possible. It seems to me that Deputy Wilson, in all his remarks, has only the most short-sighted idea of the interests of any class&mdash;the farming class or any other class&mdash;or of the interests of the State as a whole.  He is not looking really beyond his own nose, and if he were allowed he would, so to speak, walk into the ditch.  But the Dáil will not, of course, agree with him.  We are not altering the terms of the bonds, so far as redemption is concerned.  The 1923 Act provides that the bonds shall be redeemed at par.  We are not altering that.  That is a matter that has been settled.  It would not be of advantage to the credit of the State that we should go back on that.  Having had a shake in the National Loan, is it suggested that we should go back on the position which provided that bonds should be redeemed at par, or that we should do nothing that would help to get the bonds in the direction of par? I have no hesitation in saying that if we had not had in mind the possibility of this guarantee, we would not have put forward the terms of the Land Act as we did.  We would not have regarded them as fair or reasonable terms.  I am not really concerned with that now; it is past history.  I am not really concerned, in introducing this Bill, with the question of the landlords at all.  I am thinking really of the State and the State's credit.  There is no doubt at all but the bonds will be put on the market, whether by the landlords or by people who are paid off. All sorts of people will have these <Col N="2435" /> bonds, and they will want cash, and the bonds will go on the market.  If we had not the British guarantee, they would be most likely in the neighbourhood of 80.  They would drag down any other public issues we had.  There is no doubt if the Land Bonds were at 80 the National Loan, although we are paying a high rate of interest, would go down very considerably.  At present it is at 93 or 94.  If we had Land Bonds to-morrow in the market&mdash;even a small quantity of Land Bonds at 80&mdash; there is no doubt that the National Loan would go down four, five, or, perhaps, six or seven points.  When we come to borrow for the Shannon scheme, instead of paying 5¼ per cent. interest, we would have to pay 5¾ per cent. or six per cent. interest.  That would be the inevitable result of not taking the British guarantee in this particular case.  It would mean that the whole development of the country would be prejudiced, and for what?  It seems to me to be for a claim that there is really no reason for.  We are not prejudicing our freedom in any respect, I submit.  The British Government is willing to offer this guarantee for reasons of its own.  We have not had to go and seek it.  Everything that I have been able to find in the documents has been in the nature of a pledge being already in existence by the British Government to do this.  They have offered to do it.  They will, of course, only do it on terms.  We have to enter into certain reasonable counter obligations when they give that guarantee. These are in the Bill.  We have not had to make any secret pledges.  We give nothing away except what is in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson referred to the question of this disclosure and the Treaty.  I think the President has dealt with that already.  There is nothing that I have been able to discover in the documents left after the Treaty in the nature of a definite bargain or agreement with the British Government.  I think there were certainly verbal agreements, and perhaps written agreements, with all sorts of people.  But when the Government heard of an actual written promise by <Col N="2436" /> the British Government to guarantee the issue of Land Bonds, it was long after the date of the Treaty&mdash;perhaps fifteen months.  As the President states, the proposal came from the British Government side and not from our side. Deputy Johnson talked a good deal about people not being willing to accept the same risks as other people to whom the Irish State undertakes obligations. But, as a matter of fact, the cases are different.  We issue our National Loan at a higher rate of interest.  We issue a moderate sum.  We do not hand it out to anybody compulsorily.  People take it because they want to subscribe. There is not going to be the same danger of flooding the market.  There is no risk of our credit being, as it were, waterlogged by the amount of the National Loan.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of currency. Take the case of the National Loan.  It was not stated in the prospectus that it would be repaid in sterling, but there is no doubt that the State must repay it in sterling, and must, if it has a different currency, be willing to pay the interest in sterling.  We borrowed in sterling and it will be necessary for us, morally speaking, to give sterling unless we have currency that is absolutely tied to sterling.  If there was no difference on the exchange you might, for convenience, give in your currency.  But if people objected or if there was any difference, you would be bound to give sterling.  This arrangement will not hinder us, at any time we think fit, having our own currency.  I, for one, hold that when a suitable time has elapsed and when we have stabilised conditions in the country, a national currency must be established.  I think there are sound reasons for that and that it must come, but this will not prejudice us any more than if we borrowed in the American market.  It simply means that we will have to arrange to get sterling to meet certain liabilities, but that has really nothing to do with the question of currency. Practically all Governments have foreign loans, and they pay the sinking fund and interest on these foreign loans in currency other than their own currency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2437" /> I do not think there is really anything in the point raised by Deputy Johnson as to the procedure for deciding if there is default.  If we do not pay our interest on the date due, there will be default undoubtedly.  I do not contemplate that that will arise or that any action will ever have to be taken under the provisions of this Bill to provide for repayment to the British or of any payment by the British.  I think there is not any danger whatever of that, but the fact is that the ordinary investor will not feel that way about it.  The ordinary investor will feel that he has very substantial added security if there is a British guarantee, and he will be willing to pay up for these bonds in a way that he would not if relying on the security of the Free State alone.  The question seems distinctly to be one of getting just now an advantage for this State, of relieving ourselves of a burden that at the present stage would be very heavy indeed, of relieving ourselves of a burden that would handicap the constructive activities of the State in future and place us under disadvantages.  We got that opportunity simply because&mdash;wholly because, I suppose&mdash;the British Government wanted to give help to the landlords. But we would be foolish to refuse advantages, we would be foolish to do damage to the State and to the national credit or impose a strain upon the national credit simply to spite the landlords.  I think there is a good deal of that spirit behind all that Deputy Wilson has said.  That seems to me to be the essence of foolishness.  It was all right to have our fights and wars in the past, but to keep up old feuds against our own interests seems to me to be a very unwise proceeding.</P>

      <P>One cannot but feel that this is evidence of quite genuine, definite renunciation&mdash;a renunciation of all the doctrines that were ever taught pre-Treaty by the occupants of the Ministerial benches.  The case that the Ministers&mdash;and particularly the President&mdash;has made is the case that Mr. John Dillon made and that the members of the Irish Parliamentary Party made against Sinn Féin.  It may be a good one.  But it is the President's <Col N="2438" /> case.  It is a definite renunciation of the doctrine of self-reliance.  Anything that has been argued by the President or the Minister for Finance could equally well be argued by them if the Ministry would go to American financiers or to the American Government and say, &ldquo;Take our bonds.&rdquo;</P>

You can get money cheaper, I have no doubt, and you will continue to get money cheaper, if you give way a little more and a little more, and reunite with the British political system more closely than even is contemplated. The closer you are, the stronger and better will be your business arrangements. Deputy Hewat will subscribe to that.  Now, if you are going to look at it from that point of view, your policy is a policy of reunion and you will get a great deal of support in the country&mdash;more than you would have got three years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the President made any attack upon the Deputy's personal integrity, but he suggested that his doctrine was dishonest.  Now, I want to know what is the position of the landlords and holders of these bonds if Deputy Wilson's <Col N="2439" /> proposal is dishonest?  Under the Act, which the Legislature has passed, a certain promise was made.  A certain bond was undertaken by this State. That was that £100 bond would be issued and that 4½ per cent. per annum would be paid.  That is, that £4 10s. would be paid to the holder of that bond year in and year out, until it was redeemed.  That is the bond that we entered into.  That is the bond which the landlords have been obliged to accept. The compulsion side of it is not essential to this argument at all.  Presumably, in fixing your price, the element of compulsion was taken into account.  This extra guarantee was not taken into account in fixing the price. It was not discussed in the Dáil or Seanad.  It was not part of the arrangement. A £100 bond was to be issued under the promise of the State, carrying 4½ per cent. per annum.  That is the arrangement we entered into. If the holder of that bond desired to sell or dispose of it to somebody else, he would make his own bargain with the purchaser.  There was a possibility of the bond depreciating.  There was a possibility of its appreciating.  It is to be presumed that there is a greater possibility of its appreciating if it has a British Government guarantee.  Who is dishonest?  The landlord is going to be better off by virtue of the British Government guarantee.  The price of this stock in the market as a security is going up because of this guarantee. Who is dishonest?  It is just as dishonest on his part as on the part of the State, if there was no such guarantee. The case is exactly the same.  I cannot understand where the dishonesty comes in; if it comes in at all, it is as dishonest on the side of the landlord as it is on the side of the State.  The landlords sold rentals.  They sold an annual income; they are guaranteed an annual income; they are guaranteed that annual income by the Irish State. I maintain that we are losing our hold upon our own financial position; we are giving away something, by accepting a formal undertaking on this side from the British Government to guarantee those bonds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2440" /> If we do it with this, I cannot conceive of any argument which would resist a claim that we should seek British guarantees for the next issue of National Loan.  It will still be a good business transaction if they are willing to give guarantees.  That would still be a good business transaction.  It could be argued that we should take the fullest possible advantage&mdash;the fullest pecuniary advantage&mdash;out of the association with the British Empire. That is arguable, and a very strong argument it is from the business point of view.  Is that the position that the Minister wants us to accept now?  The President has given a very frank avowal of his position in respect to the present loan, and the value to the State that this acceptance will have on succeeding issues.  Does the President take the view that because we are in association with Great Britain under the Treaty and the Constitution, we should take the fullest possible advantage that that association will give, and bind ourselves closer for the sake of the financial benefit?  Will he follow up that position and advocate it through the country?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am to answer that question, I may as well do so now. I do intend, and I have always intended, to take the fullest possible advantage of any position that we have got by the Treaty, whether it was credit, financial or otherwise.  I do say that this particular transaction is not on a par with the potential case that has been mentioned by Deputy Johnson. This is something that the British Government left undone, and for which they accepted, for a period of years, a certain liability which is undischarged until they have given this particular guarantee.  That is in respect of an order in the community for whom they accepted a certain responsibility. It so happens, as I have already explained, that the discharge of their obligations under that heading suits our convenience now admirably.  But I do not, for a moment, stand for a policy which would involve this State seeking the guarantee of the British Government in connection with any loan for the development of the State.  If the State is unable of itself to finance such <Col N="2441" /> schemes of development as the Parliament of the nation may suggest, I say it is not worthy to be a State.  I would not ask, and I would not propose that any Government should ask, for a British Government guarantee in respect of these loans for development.  This particular transaction, however, is outside, independent of, and quite apart from that altogether.  I am still just as convinced that we should be self-reliant and self-supporting.  A horse may carry a good load, but it cannot carry two loads at the one time without doing itself some damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made it quite clear that this is an engagement the British Government entered into with the landlords.  We cannot interfere.  Let them carry out their obligations.  But the British Government say: &ldquo;We are not prepared to fulfil our obligations to the landlords unless you&mdash;the Free State Government&mdash;do certain things.&rdquo;  Notwithstanding the President's argument, I submit that we are not bound in honour, for security sake, or in any other way, to pass this Bill.  I say, further, that the landlords would be just as secure whether we pass this Bill or not, because the British Government, having entered into their agreement with the landlords, did so, not subject to the Free State passing this Bill, but simply because they had made the promise.  If we do this, we are entering voluntarily into a new obligation with the British Government.  It is an obligation for the benefit of the landlords which was not disclosed to the Dáil or the Seanad when we were discussing the Land Act.</P>

      <P>I am, to a certain extent, an interested party in this question, but I am not speaking from an interested point of view.  I want to suggest to the Dáil the implications of Deputy Johnson's argument.  The British Government created the land question in this country.  The British <Col N="2442" /> Government accepted responsibility for the settlement of that question. Deputy Johnson wishes one of two things: either to release the British Government from the obligation they have undertaken, or else to allow the British Government to carry out the termination of land purchase in this country.  If you follow Deputy Johnson's argument to its logical extremes it means that the British Government, to fulfil its pledges, should not have any negotiations with our Government, but should carry out land purchase itself and have tenants all over the country paying annuities to the British Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>What would we be doing?  We should, presumably, if the British Government had a legal claim which could be enforced in a court of law, be executing it by the forces of the law, otherwise you would have anarchy.  This measure will do two things.  It will, to begin with, render somewhat more stable the security under which Irishmen of a class with whom Deputy Johnson has no sympathy, but still Irishmen, citizens of the State, are being paid and, in the second place, it will strengthen the credit of the State.  I suggest that the Dáil would be ill-advised to listen to Deputy Johnson's argument.  It is not an argument based on reality.  It is not an argument such as Deputy Johnson generally uses.  If that were his normal standard of argument, he should not be here but chasing rainbows in Suffolk Street.  We must look at this thing from a materialistic standpoint because it is a matter of cash and land, hard and real things.  Nobody in Ireland will gain by the rejection of this Motion.  A considerable number of Irishmen will be losers and the State will be a loser.</P>
