      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he can state what proportions of the sum of £5,008,000 received as Property and Income Tax during the current financial year to 21st February is attributable to (a) arrears of tax from previous years; (b) super tax, and (c) mineral rights duty; what proportion of the total figure, £5,008,000, was derived from investments, and other sources of income outside Saorstát Eireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to give accurate figures for a broken period as asked for by the Deputy.  With regard to &ldquo;arrears of income tax from previous years,&rdquo; there is always a certain amount of tax for previous years collectable in any particular financial year.  Some of it, e.g., the second instalment of tax for the preceding year, is legally collectable during the current year.  Furthermore, the normal collection for any particular financial year is always adversely affected by the collection of abnormal arrears during the same year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is considered that the collection of £5,008,000 for the period 1st April, 1924, to 21st February, 1925, was swollen to the extent of about £1,000,000 by the collection of abnormal arrears of income tax.  It is not possible to state how much of the balance has been derived from sources outside the Saorstát.  The amount included in the total for super tax is estimated <Col N="970" /> at £416,000.  The receipts in respect of Mineral Rights duty are trifling and are estimated at £100 for the period.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Estimates for 1924-5 for all the services administered by the Revenue Commissioners (Customs, Excise, Stamps, Death Duties and Income Tax) is £649,890.  There is no separate figure of the cost of administering income tax as distinct from the general costs of the entire Department.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that Mrs. Julia Malone, Castleroe, Maganey, Co. Kildare, was visited by an inspector of his Department on the 2nd February, 1925, who collected medical certificates stating that she was suffering from neuritis and unable to work, and a further certificate was sent to Dr. Morgan, Merrion Square, Dublin, who is acting for the Insurance Commissioners, and whether he will have instructions issued to this woman as to the steps she should take to make her claim for arrears and further benefit to her society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>As promised in the reply to the Deputy's previous question on the 3rd ultimo, further inquiries were made by an inspector of the Insurance Commissioners in this case.  In the course of the inquiries the inspector was handed a number of medical certificates certifying that Mrs. Malone was incapable of work from the 27th May, 1924, to the 31st January, 1925.  These were duly submitted to her approved society with a request that they would take immediate steps to consider the claim and decide whether the member was entitled to benefit in respect of the above period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The society considered the case a suitable one for reference to the District Medical Referee for his opinion on the question of the member's incapacity <Col N="973" /> and his report has been forwarded to them.  It is understood that the committee of management of the society will, at its next meeting, on Monday, the 16th instant, decide definitely whether the member is entitled to the benefit claimed.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the election campaign there was a statement made with regard to a sub-committee set up by my Department.  This has given rise to a certain amount of misunderstanding. The statement was made by Deputy Gorey, and, as the election is now over, I presume he will have no objection to having the statement corrected.  The statement was to the effect that I have set up a Committee to deal with the taxing of motor vehicles, and that, first of all, I had given no representation to the farmers on that Commission; secondly, that the Committee had reported in favour of the petrol tax and that I was going to refuse to entertain the report of the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the first part of the statement, it is untrue to say that I set up this Committee and did not give the farmers representation on it.  That Committee was set up by the Roads Advisory Commission, which was set up over a year ago.  Farmers were given representation on that Committee. Now the Roads Advisory Committee has appointed a sub-committee to inquire into the question of motor taxation generally throughout the Saorstát.  The sub-committee was appointed by the Roads Advisory Committee and I had absolutely nothing to do with that.  Deputy Gorey had an informal conversation with me, and in that conversation we both argued the merits of different kinds of motor taxation, but in that conversation I said nothing to Deputy Gorey to leave him under the impression that I was going to turn down the report of this Advisory Committee.  That Committee <Col N="978" /> has not reported to the General Committee yet.  That is to say, the sub-committee which was appointed by the Roads Advisory Committee to inquire into the subject of motor taxation has not reported to that Committee.  When it does report it will be open to the Committee either to accept its recommendations or to reject them, and, if it accepts the recommendations, it can modify them. If the recommendations of the sub-committee are accepted by the Roads Advisory Committee then they will be submitted to me, and it will be for me, in conjunction with the other Ministers concerned, to accept or reject the proposals, but until the report comes before me formally I have no right to express any view on the matter.  I have an open mind on the subject.  I think it well to make that statement. as the statement made by Deputy Gorey has given rise to considerable difficulty to the Committee concerned.</P>

I thought the personnel of the Committee was settled by the Department of which the Minister is the head.  With regard to the other matter, I think it was on Thursday or Friday last that I asked the Minister if he had received the report from the sub-committee, and he said he had received an interim report.  I asked him was he going to act on it, and he said no, and he talked about putting a tax on the weight of the car.  The conversation was very short.  My memory is very clear about it.  I do not know what is in the Minister's mind, but I am quite clear that I asked him was he going to act on the report, and he said no, and he made a reference to the fact that the proper thing to do was to put it on the car-weight.</P>

    <P>Amendment 93.&mdash;Before Section <Col N="980" /> 63 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) A county or borough council may, with the consent of the Minister, delegate to such person or persons as the Minister shall from time to time appoint for the purpose, all or any part of its powers, duties and functions (including all or any of the powers, duties and functions of a board of health) and such powers, duties and functions shall thereupon be exercised and performed by such person or persons until the holding of the next triennial election of county councillors.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 93.&rdquo;  The object of this amendment is to permit a county council, having been elected, to appoint, if it so desires, commissioners to carry out its duties. At present many local bodies have got into considerable financial difficulties, and a great many likely candidates are rather nervous about accepting responsibility of trying to put these local bodies into proper shape.  Some of them are anxious to have power, if desirable, to get commissioners appointed to do that work.  There were several amendments somewhat similar to this in the Seanad, but I considered that they were objectionable from the point of view that they did not give local representatives or the people an opportunity of deciding whether such commissioners should be appointed.  This amendment gets over that difficulty.  I accepted it, and I ask the House to agree to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the House will not agree to this amendment.  It is, of course, in keeping with the policy that has been enunciated so frequently and that has been practised so often within the last two or three years of eliminating elected local authorities and substituting for them paid commissioners. <Col N="981" /> The object of the amendment is clearly to allow county councils by a majority, shall I say, to conspire with the Minister to destroy local government institutions over the heads of the electors.  Whether it is to eliminate these wholly, or delegate part of their functions to a paid commissioner, or to any person or persons as the Minister shall from time to time appoint for the purpose, that commissioner is not to be responsible to anybody, not even to the Minister.  A county council or borough council, once it has decided under this section to delegate all its powers, duties and functions to a person, asks for no return or no report until the next triennial election.  You are, therefore, invited now to declare that any county or borough council by a majority, with the consent of the Minister, may hand over its duties and functions despite the electors to any person or persons until the next triennial election.  First of all, you go to the electors and invite them to carry out their duties, to appoint a local authority to undertake the duties of that authority, but under this Bill you are telling that local authority that they may deny their responsibilities to the electors, that they may shirk these responsibilities and hand them over to a paid or unpaid commissioner, as the case may be, and he has complete charge without any responsibility to anybody until the next triennial election. This goes a long way, of course, to revolutionising the system of local government and destroying all local responsibility.</P>

    <P>The county council, under this section, may appoint a board of health which, to a great extent, does the work of the county council.  Having done that, it may appoint a commissioner to carry on all the work of the council in respect to other matters outside the board of health, or it may decide to appoint commissioners to look after health and sanitation, and retain its powers over other functions, or it may decide to appoint commissioners to do all these things, notwithstanding the fact that the electors have, within a period of three years beforehand, elected these people to do the very work which these people are transferring <Col N="982" /> to somebody else.  That again is a movement towards limiting and minimising the amount of responsibility which a locally-elected authority should have.  The tendency to elect authorities and then say that they are not worthy of election, not worthy of their functions and responsibilities, is going to bring local government into derision and disrepute.  Under this section the only check is the Minister's wish.</P>
    <P>A bare majority of a council may decide to eliminate itself and, if the Minister is prepared to sanction that elimination, then it shall be eliminated, and the electors have nothing to say. No report on the work of the council is to be made to the electors.  The Commissioner is not responsible to the council and not responsible to the Minister. He is the absolute authority under this proposal.  I can only say, if we are going to treat local government institutions in this way&mdash;first of all to suggest to them that they may eliminate themselves, to suggest to them that a majority of them can come together some day and say, &ldquo;it is going to be to our advantage to hand over this job to so-and-so, and we can persuade the Minister to appoint such-and-such a person to do this work&rdquo;&mdash;we are going to deprive the local governing authorities of their prestige, dignity, and power.  It will simply destroy the prestige that local authorities ought to have, and, I think, move against the system of local responsibility for local affairs.  Again, as I have suggested many times during the discussion on this Bill, the movement is towards centralisation and bureaucracy, but in this particular case, apparently, little thought has been given to the consequences of this amendment, and the effect of it is that you are not merely centralising not merely leaving power to the Minister in this case, as in so many other cases, but you are giving power to appoint commissioners who have not responsibility even to the Minister.  I hope the House will not agree to this amendment.</P>

      <P>In stating that this officer will not be even responsible to the Minister.  Deputy Johnson certainly exaggerated the position.  If the Deputy reads the amendment he will find that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="983" />&ldquo;A county or borough council may, with the consent of the Minister, delegate to such person or persons as the Minister shall from time to time appoint for the purpose.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, if one Commissioner is found unsuitable I can have him removed and can appoint another in his place.  Even at the present time a Commissioner is subject to the sanction of the Minister.  I have authority over him during the whole time that he exercises this particular jurisdiction. There is a considerable demand in the country at the present time amongst a great body of the people for Commissioners. I have no doubt that if I were to introduce a measure practically imposing Commissioners on local authorities it would get a very considerable amount of support in many parts of the country.  It would get such a volume of support as, I believe, would surprise Deputy Johnson.  I am not resorting to such a high-handed measure as that may appear to people with a certain political outlook, who might be called ultra-democratic, and who might regard it as a high-handed attitude.  Certainly, I think it is only fair that where the elected representatives of the people, perhaps after putting this very issue to the people at the elections, decide in the interests of economy and the proper carrying out of their duties, that they should have a manager appointed, either to do all the work of the local authority or perform particular functions of the local authority, they should be permitted to do it.</P>
    <P>At the present time local government is becoming more technical, requires more skill and more efficiency and a greater length of time to be devoted to it.  There are very few people in the country who can afford to devote the time necessary to the proper discharge of the complicated duties of local authorities, particularly of the county borough and county councils.  It is becoming increasingly difficult to get people to carry out these duties.  In a great many cases the tendency is to have these duties delegated to experts who can devote their whole time and their technical <Col N="984" /> skill to them.  Where a demand comes from the elected representatives of the people I cannot see that it is any offence against democracy or any other principle to allow that view to be carried out.  Accordingly, I strongly recommend this amendment to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to disabuse the Minister's mind of the notion that I am opposed to giving a county council power to delegate responsibility to a Commissioner, or a person who may be called a Commissioner. I think it is probably a beneficial development that popularly elected bodies will have to delegate some of their functions to individuals. A very great deal of the responsibility for detailed work ought to be delegated to small numbers.  I think it may have come before the Minister's notice that, so far as the Party I am associated with is concerned, we have advocated the election of popularly elected bodies for local purposes, and the appointment of a small executive, even two or three persons, to do most of the actual executive work and be responsible to the popular elected bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument of the Minister does not affect my contention towards this amendment.  The amendment means that a popularly-elected body at the end of two of its term of three years' service may say: &ldquo;Well, we are not likely to be returned again.  We have mismanaged our business, and we are going to ask the Minister to consent to hand over our duties to a Commissioner whom he will appoint.&rdquo;  They do not go to the electorate or resign their seats.  They are not held really responsible. They simply hand over their responsibility to an outside person.  If they can resign their responsibility in that easy way, then the sense of responsibility is lessened.  The Minister says that these persons will be responsible to the Minister because they would be such as would be from time to time appointed for the purpose.  That certainly will not bear the interpretation he puts on it that because he appoints them from time to time, they must report to him and be responsible to him for the <Col N="985" /> carrying out of the duties that have been delegated to the Council.  That may be the intention.  It may possibly be the practice that will follow, but it is not ensured by this amendment.</P>
    <P>I object to the suggestion that popularly-elected bodies, having faced the electors and asked for certain responsibilities which have been imposed on them, can then be able to shuffle off their responsibilities upon a paid Commissioner who will not have to answer to the electors, who may have to answer to the Minister, but so far as the section goes, that is all he will have to do. I think it is cutting at the principle of local responsibility for local affairs, and I have stood for that right through the discussion on this measure.  I believe this is simply a crowning act of the Seanad to bring the whole system of local government into disrepute.  It would be far better and more honest in its effects if the Minister would say that the whole business of local government will henceforward be managed, under his Department, by a person appointed by him and responsible to him. Do the thing in a bold, clear and open way like that rather than pretend to give local responsibility while depriving the locally-elected bodies of their real authority or, if not depriving them of their real authority, giving them hints and suggestions as to how to get out of their responsibility.  I think the purpose of this amendment is a bad one, and the effect of it is going to help to destroy the system of local government.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister, from day to day, makes much more clear the respect and the faith he has for men and public bodies whom he was responsible, to no small extent, in getting elected himself.  The Minister said if he brought in a Bill to abolish all the local authorities he would get a lot of support for it in the House.  He might get a lot of support for it in the country but I doubt it very much.  But I believe the Minister would then be doing what he honestly believes to be right, that is, to abolish all local authorities and it would be better to have the thing straight and open than to abolish them gradually, as he is trying to do at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister contended that the commissioner appointed would be responsible to him.  Like Deputy Johnson, I cannot see there is anything in this amendment that will give the Minister any authority over the Commissioners to be appointed&mdash;nothing at all so far as I can see.  The sub-section says &ldquo;the remuneration of any person appointed under this section shall be paid as part of the general expenses of the council.&rdquo;  Who is to fix the amount of the remuneration?  Is it the Minister or the council that has got tired of their duties?  Will the Minister have the right to say that the amount of remuneration fixed by the council, if the council has the right to fix the remuneration, is too much or too little? Will he have the right to stipulate what remuneration should be paid and how far will he have the right to interfere with the officers of the council?  For instance, to interfere with the making of roads?  Will this Commissioner have the right, if he is appointed in place of the county board of health, to issue instructions for the reduction of outdoor relief?  I would like the Minister to explain this amendment much more clearly than he has done, and I should be glad if he should tell us as clearly as he can what would be his own powers in regard to these Commissioners. <Col N="987" /> Will he tell us whether the Commissioners, if this amendment is passed, will have the right to do any of the things that I contend it is possible for them to do under the amendment? And will he tell us whether the remuneration paid to them will be fixed by the council that appointed them or by the Minister, and whether the Minister will have the right to say whether the remuneration fixed is too much or too little or is just enough?</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned. I am perfectly satisfied the Minister has power in the matter. I am also perfectly satisfied as to the duties that the Commissioners can carry out, but what I am really concerned to know is whether, if the councils appoint Commissioners to do this work, it is mandatory upon the Minister to order an election when election time comes round, or can he exercise the power he has already under the Bill of keeping a Commissioner in office for two or three years?  Because I can foresee a position such as that.  If a council has carried out some very unpopular things in a certain area, and they know before election that they are not likely to have the members of their Party elected again, they might appoint a Commissioner, thinking that the Minister would keep him in office for two or three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It makes it clear that the kind of Commissioner appointed by this amendment is <Col N="988" /> not the kind of Commissioner appointed under Section 62, and that is what makes me believe that the Commissioner appointed under this proposed section is not responsible to the Minister.  He is a different kind of Commissioner.  He is a Commissioner appointed by the council, the only requisite being that he shall be a person nominated by the Minister.  The proposition that the Minister makes in answer to Deputy Corish is that the Commissioners who are appointed under this new section will not be one of the kind that could be kept in office for a period not exceeding three years. If that is the correct interpretation that would be placed upon this section by the courts, it simply means that the person appointed is not responsible to the Minister.  He is not responsible to the council; he is not responsible to anybody.  His remuneration is to be paid as part of the general expenses of the council.  The council is to appoint him, and is to state what the remuneration will be, and then it has nothing further to say.  He may do what he wishes, the only question being whether the Minister has power to remove him.  I say that whatever may be the intention of this section, the powers that are given under the section are very much greater than the intention the Minister has indicated as being behind the amendment itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I always have power under Section 62 to dissolve a council not performing its duties, and that would be applied equally to the Commissioners to whom they have delegated their powers.  I could abolish the council along with the Commissioner and put in another Commissioner for another three years if I wish to do that. That would be irrespective of this amendment altogether. Under this amendment I can only have a Commissioner appointed until the next triennial election, and I think that safeguards Deputy Corish's point.</P>

      <P>Would that extension allow it?  It is a question whether if this Bill becomes law, say, by the 25th March, the register will be in force by the 1st June.  I think that the suggestion of the Minister for Justice is better for another reason, that it is only two months after the passing of this Bill that the first signs of life and understanding will appear in the public as to what has been done by this Bill.  It will take two months for the people really to wake up.  Then we may have a month's real consideration of the problems that are being effected. I think it is quite desirable that more than two months after the passing of this Act should ensue, because unless the machinery is already well in hands I think it will hardly be thoroughly in tune within that two months, apart from the question that the Minister for Justice has raised.</P>

      <P>I share Deputy Johnson's anxiety that the people should thoroughly understand everything that is in this Bill before they vote.  I am sure that if they do, those candidates that are put up under the aegis of the Government Party will be returned in great numbers.  But the main argument in favour of it is the argument adduced by the Minister for Justice.  If we are limited to two months we will be in a position of having new councils elected perhaps within a couple of weeks of the coming into operation of the new register on the 1st June, and it would be a pity to have the elections on the old register when it would be so near the time when the new one would be available.  Elections held on the new register would much better represent the views of the people.  If we get three months I think we will be able to fix the date of the elections for about the 11th June.  I think that that would be the best date, and that it would be much better from everybody's point of view to have the elections at that time.</P>

      <P>We are overlooking, in speaking of an election in June, the fact that the Seanad, under the Constitution, has ample powers, should they disagree with some of the amendments that they have put up and should there be a deadlock, to postpone this Bill for nine months after it leaves this House.  If you add to that the three months that is now proposed it would amount to a year.  Of course this may be hypothetical, but the possibility is there.  I do not think in a sense that this new amendment is a fair one.  The point I see in it is this: It is not that I object to the elections coming a year hence, but I do make a strong protest against the continuance of the present local bodies.  They have long outlived their mandate from the people, if they ever possessed a mandate, which I deny. They simply represent an antique system in administration and they have no longer the confidence of the people.</P>

      <P>There are very few farmers on those boards.  In any case they are in a minority.  If we give these councils another year of power what answer can we make to the people who protest against high rates and extravagance?  The councils elected in 1920 normally should have gone out two years ago.  Is it proposed that we should double their lives?  There is just the possibility that we may do so, and I submit that we have no right to do it.  I suggest that their authority should cease on 31st March next and that the Minister for Local Government should put a Commissioner in every county to administer its affairs.  I make this appeal in the interest of the ratepayers, I make it in the interests of economical, efficient, clean and decent administration. I ask the House to turn down this proposal and that provision should be made for terminating the lease of life of these local authorities on 31st March.</P>

I suggest that it may mean that he has not power to issue orders regulating the accounts, audits, and annual estimates of boards of health, unless &ldquo;in such manner that units of costs for comparative and control purposes can be established.&rdquo;  It may be his intention to alter the system of accounting.  It may be very desirable that should be done, but I suggest it is not wise to limit the powers, as this amendment implies by inserting it. After all, it is a suggestion that any regulations respecting accounts that may be made by the Minister shall establish that units of cost for comparative and control purposes shall be made. That is a very good suggestion I have no doubt, but it seems to me if we put in this amendment the only kind of regulations he will make will be such as will do this&mdash;at least it limits him to a certain kind of accounting, and I question the wisdom of that in an Act.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 104.&rdquo;  This amendment was agreed to in principle in the Dáil.  It was afterwards proposed in the Seanad.  The object of it is to ensure first of all that on the board of health every electoral area shall be represented, and secondly that after that representation has been secured every party in the county council can also secure representation on the board of health if they have sufficient numbers to constitute a quorum under the rules of proportional representation.  It really combines the two systems of elections, and I think that it meets the difficulty very well of trying to give two systems of representation, that is, representation according to party and representation according to area.  There was a good deal of criticism about boards of health, that they would not be representative, and I think this is an effort, as far as it is humanly possible, to secure that these boards of health will be in every possible way representative.</P>

      <P>I would not like it to go forward that this is accepted as meeting the objections raised from these benches.  I do not think it will ensure that the boards of health will have proper representation of the urban districts and local electoral areas.  All it requires is that one member of the board of health shall be elected from the county council as from each electoral area.  The others may form themselves into groups of various kinds&mdash;that is, groups of people, not local electoral groups or areas. The Minister has begun to speak of persons to be elected at the next county council elections representing his Party.  He now speaks again of parties.  That was not the suggestion <Col N="999" /> with regard to representation at all, but that the representatives of a locality should have some clear kind of supervision over the work of the boards of health in their localities. This does not at all ensure that that supervision shall be given to the local people, and I think it is a bad attempt to meet the objections that have been raised from this side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On this point I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the effect of this section and of Section 89.  There has been, perhaps, an omission in the introduction of this section.  The powers in relation to advertising are confined to health resorts and pleasure resorts.  Now it has been found desirable in other countries that places, believing they have advantages as industrial centres, should have power to advertise those advantages. That power is not given by this Act, and it is obviously an omission that, perhaps, cannot be remedied on this occasion. It is as well, however, to draw attention to it.  We only give powers to local authorities to advertise their amenities as health and pleasure resorts, and not as industrial centres. When the Minister for Industry and Commerce finds himself with power to <Col N="1002" /> sell&mdash;I mean motive power&mdash;some of the centres might desire to advertise the fact that their place is specially fitted for this, that, or the other kind of industrial development.  Under this Bill, however, no power is given to any local authority to do that.</P>
      <P>I draw attention to this merely to illustrate the method you have adopted and are continuing to emphasise in this Bill, a method tending towards the cramping of the initiative of local authorities.  We would have to get a special Act passed to allow a local authority to advertise its centre as an industrial centre.  You have a special Act to allow a local authority to advertise itself as a health resort.  You will have to have a new Act to allow it to advertise itself as a place where certain mineral deposits lie at hand, or where certain industrial facilities may be found.</P>

      <P>When the discussion <Col N="1004" /> was suspended on the last day, a certain number of points had been raised by Deputy Johnson.  He asked how the cost of note-takers for Circuit Courts, as ascertained so far, compared with the cost as estimated when the Courts of Justice Bill was going through the Dáil. We find that the cost is less than the estimate of £6,000 which was given to the Dáil when the Courts of Justice Bill was under consideration.  So far as we have been able to gather from the session of the Circuit Courts that has been completed, the cost will work out about £5,000 per annum, instead of £6,000 as estimated.  It is anticipated that it will be even less when permanent stenographers have been appointed at scales of salary which will cost the Treasury less than if men were appointed from a panel as they are wanted.</P>
      <P>Rules are being prepared by the Department of Justice in regard to the custody of notes and transcript.  No transcript is made unless notice of appeal is lodged.  Then the transcript is made and sent to the Department of Justice, whence it is supplied to the parties as required.  In future, when the rules have been made the stenographer will be given an opportunity of reading his notes after they have been taken, and the notes will then pass into the custody of the Clerk of the Peace.  They will be given to the stenographer again in case a transcript is wanted for the purpose of appeal.  I do not know that there is any other point on which I could touch.</P>

    <P>Taking the items that are set out on the estimates (a) is due really to heavy drafting work.  It was necessary to get assistance for certain drafting work. For instance, a special man had to be brought in to do the draft of the Courts of Justice Bill.  The draughtsman's office was so congested that it was impossible to undertake the work of that heavy Bill.  There was other work also to be done in the nature of drafting.  The charge under (b) arises from the fact that certain people who acted as State Solicitors in a previous year, temporarily in certain counties, were not paid during the past year. There was a solicitor in Clare and a solicitor in County Longford, and it was not found possible to pay them during the past financial year.  A few of the under-sheriffs are in the same category.  One of the under-sheriffs had not completed his bond in time and he could not be paid before his bond was completed.  It was not found possible to pay him during the last financial year.  Assistant under-sheriffs are appointed under the Enforcement of Law (Occasional Powers) Act.  There are six under-sheriffs and none of them was appointed before the 1st of January. They are being paid at the rate of £500 per annum.  Half of their salaries will be recouped by the counties in the coming financial year.  Bailiffs are also appointed under the Enforcement of Law (Occasional Powers) Act.</P>
    <P>There are about 60 of these bailiffs employed at the present time.  The ordinary remuneration is one pound per week.  In certain special cases remuneration in excess of that is paid. Bailiffs, of course, in addition to payment of salary get certain fees.  Part of the cost of the bailiffs will be compensated for by the receipt of a percentage amounting to one shilling in the pound, under Section 14, sub-section (1) of the Act, where the sum leviable is not paid to the under-sheriff within one month after the issue of the decree.</P>
    <P>Fees to counsel, which is the biggest item of all, arises from the fact that there have been heavy arrears of prosecutions which had to be dealt with during the present financial year.  Not only were men who had been in custody for a long time brought to trial but many whom it had been found impossible to apprehend previously were taken into custody and brought to trial, and the expenses of prosecutions at the Central Criminal Court were more costly possibly than down the country.  Counsel of a higher standing had to be employed for the purpose of conducting these prosecutions. This heavy work in the nature of criminal prosecutions is of a temporary character.  I think the arrears have been pretty well wiped out.</P>

      <Col N="1007" /> This additional sum is required because of excess charges in respect of travelling allowances.  In Estimates previous to the financial year 1923-1924 the amount put into the Estimate for travelling expenses was £100.  This was reduced to £50 for the present year in view of the reduction in the number <Col N="1008" /> of Commissioners, which would reduce the travelling expenses.  However, there was great delay in bringing about that reduction, and it did not take place until about July.  That was really the reason why the reduced Estimate of £50 for the present year was found to be insufficient.</P>

    <P>The Contingency Fund was established in 1923-24 by a Grant-in-Aid of £20,000.  These sums are required to bring up the Contingency Fund again to £20,000.  It was placed at the disposal of the Executive Council to defray urgent or unforeseen expenditure which was not covered by ordinary votes, and for which it might be found impracticable for any reason to get the immediate approval of the Dáil.  Other advances have been made from the fund than those which are now being repaid.  We are now only asking the Dáil to vote moneys which will not be repaid from the fund for ordinary Votes.  For instance, the Dáil has already voted a supplementary estimate to provide for the expenses of the Railway Tribunal, but before that Vote was passed the Railway Tribunal was in existence and expenses had been incurred. These were paid out of the Contingency Fund, and when the Supplementary Vote for the Railway Tribunal was passed, that Vote repaid the Contingency Fund.  We are now moving simply for the repayment to the Contingency Fund of sums that will not be paid out of other votes.  A big amount must be remitted for public departments in respect of stamp duties payable on deeds and other documents. That, of course, is a paper transaction. It simply means that the Revenue Commissioners stamp documents without charge when they are presented by a public department, and that the revenue is recouped out of this Vote for the amount lost.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I do not see Deputy Sean Lyons here.  I was going to ask the Minister if he will justify the practice of paying a bounty in respect of the birth of triplets.  Will he say whether it is a legal obligation on the Minister or whether it is a premonition that within a short time, the system that has been talked about, the endowment of motherhood, should be made general or whether it is only intended as a supplement to the Health Insurance Scheme?</P>
      <P>I would like to hear from the Minister some justification for the continuance of this rather unnecessary notification of the fact that in certain cases three children were born at the same time.  Perhaps the Minister has some reason for it, but it were well, I think, that the House should be informed.</P>

    <P>With reference to the first item of <Col N="1010" /> Section 3, I do not know how this practice arose, but I think perhaps the people deserve some form of felicitation or commiseration in the circumstances. There were altogether nine grants; where all three children lived there were six such grants, and then there were three other grants of £2.  I think it is not an excessive sum.</P>

    <P>This increased provision, which the Dáil is now asked to vote, arises solely from the success which has attended the operation of rural industries in the congested districts.  The original estimate included a sum for the purchase of materials.  That has proved inadequate, owing to the greater amount of work being done, the greater amount of goods being sold and more raw materials being required.  The additional sum now asked for will be entirely recoverable&mdash;most of it in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FISHERIES (Mr. F. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is thoroughly explained in the note.  During the year the sale of the goods produced in those classes along the western seaboard improved, and as the sale improved we found that the amount of money available for the purchase of the raw material was insufficient.  We have, therefore, to come and ask for more money. As the Minister for Finance pointed out, that money is mostly recoverable, we purchase the raw material and resell it to the workers at those classes. In that way, the initial money is brought back almost immediately. Then there is a charge for overhead expenses made of, I think, ten per cent. of the profits of the workers.  That brings back a further amount, so as to cover practically the whole expense. Some classes do not pay for themselves. A good many of them are on the border line.  Some make a certain amount of profit, which helps to recoup the loss on the weaker classes.</P>

At this stage I suppose we need not look for any accounts but the Minister seems to make a very encouraging statement with regard to the fact that the classes as a whole have been largely self-supporting.  If that is found beneficial in one district, the possibility of developing it in other parts of the country would come before him for consideration.  One would like to have information as to whether <Col N="1011" /> the scheme has been sufficiently encouraging in the places where it was adopted to convince the Minister that its extension to other districts would be desirable.  I do not know the parts of the country to which he refers, but I know that down in parts of the County Wexford there is room for something of the sort if it could be done.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, during the year we closed up seven or eight classes that were not working satisfactorily and were not worth keeping on.  A great deal depends on whether the girls locally take to the working of those classes.  In some places we found that classes decayed for one reason or another and we had to close them up.  We had not funds to extend and I do not know that there would be local talent in places outside those congested areas that would justify the making of experiments.</P>

      <P>It is only now that the proposals contained in this Bill are <Col N="1012" /> becoming known and that local authorities are wakening up to the attempted limitation of their authority and the imposition of a certain restriction on their functions as buyers, and I suggest that it would be better to adjourn, say for a fortnight, the Report Stage of the Bill, until the local authorities have an opportunity of expressing their views on the matter.  I think it was the President who said that he would be prepared to consider proposals regarding consultation with the local authorities. I would suggest to him, and to the Minister in charge of the Bill, that it would be better to consult with the local authorities before attempting to pass the Bill in its present form than wait until the Bill is passed and then suggest that the local authorities should appoint somebody to assist in the administration of it.  The local authorities are beginning to express their views on the unwisdom of tying them down to purchasing articles set forth in a list compiled by the Minister, these articles to be supplied by certain specified people.  I would suggest that further consideration of the Bill be deferred, to allow the authorities to understand what is proposed and, perhaps, to approach the Ministry with a view to modifying the character of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Johnson on this matter.  When the measure came before the House one would have thought that local authorities would be acquainted with its proposals. It appears, however, that it is only recently that it has come to the knowledge of the local authorities that such a measure is before the House.  I have received a resolution&mdash;I presume other members of the Dáil have received the same resolution&mdash;which indicates a desire on the part of the local authorities to have a conference with the Government.  I presume the President has knowledge of that desire.  It would be much more valuable to carry local sentiment with the Bill than to pass the Bill in opposition to, or without the concurrence of, the local authorities.  When the Bill was before the Dáil on a previous occasion, I think the President indicated that he would deal with some points on Report <Col N="1013" /> Stage.  I cannot imagine that there will be anything lost by giving the time that may be necessary to secure the support of the local authorities for the Bill.</P>
      <P>The President, I think, indicated that he intended setting up an Advisory Board in connection with the working of the Bill.  That would be very desirable and helpful, and I think that the local bodies, if they have anything to say on the subject, should be heard.  I agree that it is rather late for them to wake up to the fact that this Bill is before the House, and that it affects their freedom of action in connection with purchasing.  But we must recognise that this House has not been sufficiently long established to enable the general public to appreciate fully the importance of the work that is carried on here.  I think that this would provide a very valuable lesson in that respect, and would impress on local authorities that they should raise their objection to any legislation here in good time and put their case before the Dáil.  We are not so conversant with the local bodies that we are able to express their views, and I think it would be a distinct advantage if the President would adopt Deputy Johnson's suggestion.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my appeal to that of Deputy Hewat and Deputy Johnson, and to request the President to defer the further consideration of this Bill for some time.  A certain amount of confusion prevailed in the minds of members of local authorities in connection with the measure.  The Council of Municipal Councils has circularised urban councils asking their views on the question and I think it would be desirable if the President would agree to the postponement of this stage of the Bill, pending receipt of the views of the councils in the Saorstát.  It is not an unheard-of thing for the Government to take the views of the people interested in different measures before the House.  The licensed trade and other trades were consulted before their interests were interfered with.  It is not asking too much to request the President to agree to the suggestion made by Deputy Johnson and Deputy Hewat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1014" /> Deputy Hewat has said that it took public bodies a long time to wake up to the fact that their interests were being interfered with.  I might add that the business men were also asleep and failed to see that this measure very seriously interfered with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It was my intention to have accepted an amendment to have an Advisory Board set up to deal with contracts and tenders in connection with this measure.  I would have been prepared to agree to such a body to consist of two members nominated by the General Council of County Councils, two members nominated by the Municipal authorities Association, one member by the Chamber of Commerce and a chairman to be appointed by the Minister.  That would meet the case, I think, in so far as objections have been made by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>The real question at issue here is the principle of the Bill.  If the principle be accepted, the machinery is a matter upon which agreement can be easily reached.  If the case that is put up is that tenders can only be agreeable to local authorities if accepted from persons in their area, then there is no chance of agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unlikely that low prices will be obtained.  It is obvious that the expenses of the local authorities must be greater than if there be bigger competition for bigger contracts.  With a view to introducing an amendment dealing with that, I propose, with the leave of the Dáil, to discharge the order and to take it on Wednesday.  I do not see that any useful purpose can be gained by entering into a conference with local authorities.  Now &ldquo;local authorities&rdquo; means summoning local authorities.  Whom are you going to summon?  We have various institutions in the country which would probably have a right to see that they should be invited&mdash;county councils, borough councils, urban councils, <Col N="1015" /> county homes, mental hospitals, and so on.  By the time each one of these bodies would have met&mdash;and I suppose they would be entitled to meet in order to select some person who would come to the conference&mdash;very much longer time than a fortnight would have elapsed and I do not know that we would arrive at an agreement any more quickly.  There is a strong case being made against this Bill by some local authorities, and by some bodies described as chambers of commerce throughout the country.  The principle of the Bill is the real issue.  Are we agreed that rock-bottom prices must be obtained, and are we agreed that Irish manufactures and Irish industries must be encouraged?  If we are agreed on these things we ought to be able to find a solution.</P>

Of course, as the President says, if the principle of the Bill is not accepted, a conference would not be of very much use.  I did not gather that the principle of the Bill in its entirety was disputed by the local bodies as a whole at all events, and all I was pressing for was that if these important public bodies think they have reason to object to the provisions of the Bill, it would clear the air very much if the President had an interview with them and showed them that the Bill was in their interest.

      <P>I think the President is wrong in suggesting that there is any objection to the purpose of the Bill.  He speaks of the principle of the Bill as being to ensure, as far as possible, that the lowest prices will be fixed for articles, and that these shall be as far as possible articles of home manufacture.  That is accepted by the Dáil, but that is not the principle of the Bill.  The principle of the Bill in pursuance of the objective they have mentioned is to prevent local authorities pursuing that objective by any methods except those set down by the Ministry of Local Government.  That is the principle of the Bill, and that is the principle that I object to in the Bill&mdash;that the Ministry refuses to accept an amendment, for instance, to allow upon the list of contractors any person who is not prepared to contract for the whole country, even though he might be able to supply local authorities in his own area, or even within the province, at lower prices than the central authority.  It is in pursuance of that principle which the President suggests is not the principle of the Bill, that the local authorities are beginning to rouse themselves in opposition to the machinery which the Ministry has set up in this Bill for the purpose of securing the end upon which we are all agreed.  I suggest to the President that in trying to achieve the end upon which we are all agreed, it is quite reasonable that he should take into consideration the interests that are going to be affected by the machinery set up to achieve that purpose.  He has not done that, and he is not willing to wait until they express themselves after they have learned what is being done on their behalf.</P>

      <P>I do not see that there is any case made for postponing the consideration of the Bill to a fortnight hence, because, as I said, I understand there is very considerable difficulty in getting in touch with these bodies.

      <P>I would like to branch on to another subject.  Deputy Good, my colleague, pressed for a schedule in the Bill, and he asked that the Minister give the matter consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I forgot to mention that.  I did not promise to give it favourable consideration, but I gave it favourable consideration.  I am not disposed to agree that it would serve a useful purpose to include a schedule.  I say that for many reasons.  One is that if we put in a schedule we would be committed to it.  Cases might arise in which it would not be advisable to adhere to the schedule.  These would be cases in which other articles not on the list would be needed.  It would be open to any local authority to get a copy of that list.  On the whole we came to the conclusion that fixing up a schedule and not adhering to it would not be desirable and that it would not certainly serve the purpose of the Bill.  It would mean much criticism if articles were purchased that were not in the schedule, and on the other hand, the non-purchase of articles on the schedule for some particular reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the President recognises that there is really a conflict in connection with this Bill which ought to be confined within certain definite limits.  The Bill has two main purposes.  One is the subsidising or fostering of home industry and the other is economy.  Those two purposes do not necessarily run concurrently. <Col N="1018" /> In connection with various matters that will arise as to the materials, it would be very helpful to have a schedule.  Everybody would then know the articles that were going to be of universal application to local authorities.  At this time of the day it would be perfectly useless, even if one desired it, to say that we are out to buy in the cheapest market, irrespective of source of origin.  At the same time, I think that unless there is some limit as regards that, you are possibly going in the direction of ruling out economy in the purchase to the extent of not buying at all in the cheapest market.  Concurrently with the fostering of industry in the country, the question of local industry comes in as compared with non-local industry but at the same time industry within the Free State.  Then again there is the question of the price that should reasonably be paid for a local article in comparison with the standard value if it were not a local article&mdash;in other words, if it was not manufactured in the Free State.  These things ought to be guarded against.  This Bill does not do much in that direction.  There is, therefore, all the more reason why the opinions of the local authorities should be expressed in an intelligent way as to the operation of the Bill and why they should be allowed to put forward any objections which they may have.</P>
      <P>The President has suggested an advisory committee attached to the trade department which would be representative of the local bodies and others.  That seems to get over the difficulty as far as an advisory committee can do so.  But I think the main principles of the Bill should have some reasonable limitations.  The President has emphasised the importance of getting articles at the cheapest rate. That ought to be put into operation in carrying out the principles of the Bill. If you shut out competition from outside, you eliminate all question of the importation of goods that can be made within the Free State.  That is a very far-reaching principle if carried to its extreme length.  It might be that the economic side of the question would be altogether ignored.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The advantage <Col N="1019" /> there is to be derived from having a trade department is that it gets a list of articles likely to be required by local authorities within a given space of time, not necessarily twelve months. For instance, we found we wanted, I think it was 1,000 bedsteads for the Gárda Síochána.  Bedsteads were not manufactured here.  We knew the price usually paid for them.  It is easy to get that information from mental hospitals, ordinary hospitals, county homes, etc., and you can estimate what the actual price is.  Having found that, it is easy to go to some ironworks in the Saorstát and ask if they could manufacture the article at the price.  In that way you can give some employment immediately.  That has actually happened in one case.  I think Deputy Corish will admit it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, without the Bill.  As a matter of fact, it is in order to ensure that such a thing can happen in the future that we are bringing in this Bill.  Cases arise where there are different specifications for the one article, necessitating a large number of tenders with no chance of getting a standard article which would suit everybody, and which it would pay a manufacturer to take up and produce. It would not pay to manufacture a number of articles much the same, but with different specifications.  Having got the information as to what is required within a certain time, it is possible to keep a manufacturer working who might otherwise have to close down.  That was done in the case of one particular manufacturer, the order being placed although the goods were not required for six or nine months. By placing the order at a given moment the factory was enabled to continue.  The Deputy will recognise how useful a contract of that sort is to such a factory, even though no profit is made on the contract.  The very fact of keeping the factory going is in itself an advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We found ourselves up against rings in another country.  One would be perpetually up against these rings if stock were not taken of the needs of the <Col N="1020" /> country and if some estimate were not made as to when the goods would be required so that one is not forced into a market that is protected by a number of rings.  That is a situation which the local authorities could never get out of if they were buying separately. Other people have learned something from the specifications and the articles required by the local authorities.  I recollect when I was a member of the Dublin Corporation, on one occasion the Chief of the Fire Brigade at the time, who was a very capable engineer, made out a specification for a fire engine.  He ordered the engine from an English company.  The following year the London County Council bought twenty-six fire engines of the same sort.  They learned something by the fact that this particular engineer in Dublin, knowing his business and being an excellent man, was able to draw up a specification for an engine which would suit a city like Dublin. They had the advantage of that, and I am certain the price they paid was much cheaper than that paid by the Dublin Corporation.  While local authorities continue to do business in the old way they can never get advantages like that.  They might get them, but it is unlikely.  It is within the competence of a central department to get such advantages and the local authorities benefit by them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing there were an ingenious engineer, say in Kilrush, who desired to purchase for the use of the council a particular engine or machine, he would not be able to do that under this Bill.  He would be bound to buy through the central authority under the specification provided by them.  The example the President has given regarding the fireengine is exactly the analogy that would kill the purposes of this Bill. You are denying engineers of local authorities the opportunity to exercise initiative as the Dublin engineer did. That is one of the objections I have to the attempt to compel local authorities to buy from the central authority, even though the central authority cannot do better than they can do.  It is this killing of the possibilities of local initiative that is going to be the outcome of the <Col N="1021" /> enforcement of the powers taken in this Bill.  It is quite usual, of course, and probably easily understandable for the President to say what he desires to get through this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very effective advocacy, no doubt, and we are all satisfied that what the Minister desires should be attained, but what we dispute is that you are going to get that, and that alone, through the machinery in this Bill.  The machinery is giving you powers far beyond your desires.  If this Bill becomes law in its present form it will give the Minister for Local Government, with the assistance of this Advisory Council, powers to do things very much more drastic than the things which are suggested as his intention. If he were to bring in a Bill embodying his intentions we could, I think, all support it, but he has brought in a Bill embodying very much more than his intentions, and giving the Minister power to do things which, I think, will be found detrimental to the interests of local government authorities, will add to the likelihood of trusts and combines developing in the country, and will help to suppress and frustrate the desires of local businesses to develop by natural means, that is through their local custom growing until they can cover the whole country.  You are simply saying to the large producers to-day: &ldquo;We are taking you as you are, we are going to put you in the favoured list, and we will put you in the position in which the small local manufacturers, merchants, and traders will not be able to compete with you.&rdquo; It may be said that the practice of the Trade Department hitherto has been to spread over the whole country the number of persons on this contractors' list. That has been the practice, I admit, but the powers in this Bill are such as would enable the Minister, whether he had or had not the advice and consent of the Advisory Committee, to confine the contractors' list to one, two or three persons situated in Dublin, Cork or any other part of the country.  My objection is not against the intention and purposes of the Minister but against the powers that are given to the Minister in this Bill to do things which he has not yet done, and probably has <Col N="1022" /> no intention of doing, but which his successor would be able to do by the powers given in the Act.</P>

      <P>I desire to ask the President whether there is any arrangement by which a local contractor or manufacturer could get a contract for any article which is not more than from 10 to 15 per cent. higher than, say, a foreign article.  If an article could be made locally for a public authority, and if a considerable sum of money is spent in wages locally, will this authority to be set up have power to buy a foreign article that may only be, say, 10 per cent. cheaper than the local article?  I have serious reasons for asking the question, and I would be glad if the President could give some assurance that Irish manufactures will get preference, provided the article is not more than 10 to 15 per cent. dearer than the foreign article which may be dumped in here by means of mass production.  Some twelve months ago I read an article in an engineering journal pointing out that a local firm wanted a very big plant and that they found it could be purchased for a sum of money in Switzerland which was £12,000 less than that at which it could be provided locally, but the local authority, which wanted this work carried out, decided, as it was not more than 10 per cent. dearer than the foreign contract, that it was good practice, good work, and a desirable thing to give the contract to a local person. I would ask the President whether there is any provision in this Bill allowing a similar procedure to take place as regards local authorities in Ireland. Later on, if the President desires it, I will state a case for him on this matter which will, I think, be worthy of consideration. I think that no foreign article manufactured by low wages and on mass production should be allowed to deprive local workers of their right to live and right to work in cases where the article made locally is not more than from 10 to 15 per cent. dearer than the foreign article.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;&ldquo;In sub-section (1) to delete paragraph (c), lines&mdash; 20-22.&rdquo;  At present the section would provide that any person conspiring or inciting to levy war against Saorstát Eireann would, if found guilty, suffer the penalty of death.  I submit, that as the clause reads, that would mean that the arrest of one, or two, or more persons attending what might be called a battalion or brigade council meeting of the Irregulars, and discussing amongst themselves the purchase, say, of arms for arming themselves, would mean, according to my reading of the clause, that any of these persons might be sentenced to death.  Many people have been on platforms one way or another during the last six weeks, and it might be argued that many statements made there by persons on the Irregular side were incitements to war against the Saorstát.  As the section stands, such persons would, if found guilty, have to be sentenced to death.  I, therefore, propose the deletion of the clause.  The Minister will, no doubt, consider that persons who conspire or incite to levying war against the State should, if found guilty, receive some kind of <Col N="1025" /> punishment, but I do not think that it should be the punishment of death.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered this amendment very carefully, and I think it can probably be taken with amendment No. 4, which is of much the same complexion. It is a difficult matter to provide by law for an offence in which there can be varying degrees of gravity. The Deputy will appreciate that, and I am not willing to take the line that the offence of conspiring to levy war against the State, or the offence of inciting to war against the State, is not an offence in connection with which the life of the offender might be forfeit.  I admit the justice of the Deputy's point that there can be degrees of gravity, and in that connection I am prepared to make a suggestion.  I think-myself that simply a collection of individuals discussing military organisation, though that organisation would be unauthorised and unlawful in itself, would be scarcely taken by a judge or jury as sufficient evidence, or sufficient indication of intention to levy war against the State.  I think before a conviction could be secured under this particular section there would want to be proof of actual present or imminent intention to levy war against the State, and the incitement would want to be, certainly, much more definite than anything we have been treated to, even from platforms, in the last six weeks. To say that in no circumstances is the offence of conspiring to levy war against the State a proper subject for the capital penalty is to say something to which I could not subscribe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be, in the course of this discussion, a suggestion that to meet that contention of mine, of varying degrees of gravity, there should be, instead of the simple death penalty, provision for death or any lesser penalty. Certainly, so far as we have been able to ascertain, the whole trend of modern legislation is not to provide an alternative penalty to the death penalty, that if a particular offence, taken at its maximum gravity, is an offence for which the life of the individual should properly be forfeit, then, the course invariably taken is to set down the <Col N="1026" /> death penalty for that offence, leaving the prerogative of mercy to come in when the circumstances point to a lesser degree of guilt, or a lesser degree of gravity, which would seem to make the death penalty unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I have a suggestion to make.  I was struck by the Deputy's argument that a simple meeting of men, possibly with war-like documents on the table, might possibly come within the scope of either &ldquo;c&rdquo; or &ldquo;f&rdquo; of the section.  In thinking over that, I was inclined to take the view that there was probably some other section of the Bill under which men so found and so situated could be indicted.  Certainly Section 8 does not cover that matter, and it would, perhaps, be a straining of my new Section 4 to say that it covered it. My intention is to insert, at some later stage of this Bill, a new section prescribing the offence.  It would be something like the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Every person who takes part or assists in the formation, organisation, or maintenance of any association or other body which purports to be a military or police force and is not established and maintained as such by law, and also every person who is a member of any such association or body shall be guilty of a misdemeanour and on conviction thereof shall be liable to a fine not exceeding two hundred pounds or, at the discretion of the court, to penal servitude for any term not exceeding five years, or imprisonment with or without hard labour for any term not exceeding two years, or to both such fine and such penal servitude or imprisonment.</P>
    <P>With that in mind, let us return to this imaginary case of men detected at what may be described as a battalion council meeting of some unlawful military organisation, possibly with documents of a military nature, pointing to the intention&mdash;the probable or possible intention&mdash;at some time to fight somebody. Men so found and so detected would be put forward&mdash;assuming such a section as the one I have read were inserted in the Bill&mdash;under that section, unless the view of the Executive was that there was an actual and imminent intent to levy war on the State, <Col N="1027" /> which would justify indictment under Section 1 &ldquo;c&rdquo; or &ldquo;f.&rdquo;  I would be sorry to strike out of Section 1 &ldquo;c&rdquo; and &ldquo;f,&rdquo; because such striking out would mean that the maximum degree of gravity and the maximum degree of guilt which could possibly be covered by these sub-heads would not then be liable to the death penalty.</P>
    <P>That, in fact, would be taking up the position that the principal, or those who might be principals in the revolt, would not be liable to the penalty held over those who are merely their agents, followers and dupes, and who actively participate in the revolt.  It is desirable to cover the chamber man, the office man, who, from some place of concealment in the capital, perhaps, brings about the situation of revolt, and only in a very minor degree shares the dangers and hardships of the state of affairs which follows.  I would ask the Deputy to agree to the insertion of a section making the forming, organising, maintaining, or promoting, of an unlawful military organisation itself an offence, which leaves you then ample scope to put up to indictment under that section the people who are found in less grave degrees of guilt, and who may personally on his understanding of the section, at any rate, be held to be covered by &ldquo;c&rdquo; and &ldquo;f&rdquo; of Section 1.</P>
    <P>That would leave the Attorney-General, acting for the State, a discretion, and we are entitled to feel that that discretion would be properly exercised, and that only those persons would be indicted under &ldquo;c&rdquo; and &ldquo;f&rdquo; of Section 1 who were, for good and sufficient reasons, believed to be in actual imminent intent of levying war, or gravely inciting to the levying of war. Only such persons would be indicted under the section, which involves the capital penalty, while the lesser degrees would be covered by the section which prescribes unlawful military associations&mdash;military associations not authorised and not established and maintained by law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that that leaves it still with the section making it explicit that a person found guilty of conspiring or inciting to civil war or <Col N="1028" /> to an attempt to overthrow the State, must, by the court, be sentenced to death.  I am not clear that in ordinary times the State here would require the infliction of such a penalty in order to deal with cases of conspiracy or incitement such as these.  I realise that it puts into the hands of the Executive at the time the responsibility for framing a charge under this particular section if it is serious enough, and for framing it under some other section if it is not serious enough.  But it deals with the question of military organisation, and I can fancy, say, a number of people being interrupted at a meeting at which they have documents, saying that a military movement against the State must be developed, say, by the end of this year.  It is a very grave question, in my mind, whether even in cases like that the State, which is not hampered by anything like civil war or anything like any serious disturbance in it, does require, in order to deal with circumstances such as that, to inflict the penalty of death.  It does not give any loophole on the question of incitement, because, I take it, that incitement may be a private or a public matter, but I do not think the alteration which the Minister suggests leaves a loophole on that incitement question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says that he scarcely thinks that the State in ordinary times would exact, or wish to exact, the death penalty for offences such as these.  Of course, the reply to that is, that you do not have offences such as these in ordinary times, and the very fact that you have such offences is rather an argument against the ordinariness of the times, if I may coin a word.  The evidence which would convince a court that the accused person was guilty of conspiring to levy war against the State, or was inciting to the levying of war against the State, would need to be very definite and very serious evidence.  The Deputy says that I met, to some extent, the view of graded degrees of gravity with regard to the actual conspiring to levy war against the State, but scarcely met it with regard to incitement.  The reply to the incitement aspect of the thing is this, that the State would not put in peril of the capital charge anyone except <Col N="1029" /> a man whose incitement was a very grave thing and a very serious thing&mdash;incitement that was highly likely to bring about a state of affairs which the offender desired to bring about, and was highly likely to bring about actual revolt.  How do you meet the lesser degrees of that?  The answer is, by the ordinary common law indictment of sedition.  These sub-heads visualise a state of affairs of imminent revolt in which the outbreak is imminent and seeks to provide legal powers to deal with that, and legal penalties for those who are actively endeavouring to precipitate such a revolt.</P>
      <P>We are laying down in this section drastic penalties, the most drastic penalties known to modern legislation for those who take part in a revolt against the State or those who levy war against the State&mdash;the actual participants. I hold that we should cover in this section, and cover with equal penalties, those who are, in fact, the principals, who are, in fact, the most guilty persons in connection with any such war or any such revolt: the people who plot the whole situation, who conspire to bring about such a situation, who incite to such a situation and who bring others into jeopardy of the capital penalty.  That is, without wishing to go back in any bitter way on the complaint that was thrown at us here and there through the country, that the principals got comparative immunity in the recent revolt, and that the mere agents of such, people acting under orders, or people misled by frenzied rhetoric, were harshly dealt with, or were harshly dealt with certainly in comparison.  I see no way out of the dilemma.  If you strike out these sub-heads from this section then you leave no capital penalty for those who may be the most guilty persons in connection with any war or in connection with any revolt that this country might have to face in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, I know of no modern precedent, at any rate, for prescribing the death penalty with an alternative, the idea being that if the offence can be so grave that the life shall be forfeit to the State, so that then in the event of the gravity being lesser or the degree of guilt being lesser, the Executive&mdash;those <Col N="1030" /> who are politically responsible for the exercise of the prerogative of mercy&mdash; must come in with that prerogative to say, in all the circumstances, that forfeit need not be exacted.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may say that there are cases that seem at present to be covered by this section, so paltry and trivial that it would not be right or proper to put offenders in peril of the capital sentence for them.  I can only meet that by the suggestion that this alternative section should be written into the Bill, which would leave the opening that persons could be indicted simply for taking part in, or assisting in the formation, organisation, or maintenance of any association or other body purporting to be a military or police force and not established and maintained as such by law.  That would meet the Deputy's example of a battalion council conferring and wondering how they were going to get arms in, and so on, and wondering whether a company could not be formed in such and such a place, and so on.  Now even that example which the Deputy quotes would, of course, have to be taken in its setting.  If the times were grave in the country, if revolt seemed imminent, I could imagine that men so found and discovered in such a set of circumstances might well and reasonably be indicted under Section 1.  Equally, in another setting, and with another state of affairs prevailing in the country, it would be certainly extravagant and absurd to put a body of men so found in peril of the capital sentence, and it is for that reason that I would like, in the Bill the section which would leave to the Attorney-General, acting on behalf of the State, the exercise of a wise discretion as to whether, in all the circumstances, the offenders should be put in peril of their lives, or whether they should merely be put in peril of the lesser penalties which this proposed new section embodies.</P>
    <P>Now, incitement in a particular setting again, may be a very, very grave offence, warranting the gravest penalty. Incitement might take the form of posting proclamations all over the dead walls and on every tree in the country calling upon the people to rise <Col N="1031" /> up in revolt, but a lesser degree of incitement, again, can be met, as I say, by an indictment under the common law of sedition, of which I will have occasion to speak later, when I am speaking to the deletion of Section 5 of the Bill as originally drafted.</P>
    <P>I regret that I could not reconcile it with my responsibilities to accept Deputy Mulcahy's amendment, which would have the effect of leaving outside the capital penalty entirely the man who might be the gravest offender in connection with any war or any revolt, and who may well be the head and centre of the whole thing and yet who might not come in under any other sub-heads in jeopardy of his life by an act of participation in such war or revolt.</P>

      <P>I know we are trying to deal with this Bill in a very detached order of time, and I myself, probably, am not able to get entirely away from the present days.  I was influenced in putting down this amendment by the fact that in 1922, when we were actually in a state of civil war, we did not inflict the death penalty even for the offence of levying war without definitely coming to the Dáil and getting a certain resolution passed here that gave us that particular authority. It seems a very far step, then, that in three years we would pass an ordinary measure, with the present days close around, to the effect that persons who conspire and incite to civil war against the State would suffer the penalty of death.  I quite realise the Minister's responsibilities in the matter, and I quite realise that there might be circumstances in which it might be very necessary to have this power.  If the Committee is satisfied to allow me to withdraw these amendments I will be prepared to do so now in the light of what the Minister has said generally on this clause.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to support this amendment and any other amendment of this Bill which will relieve us of some of the shadow that will come upon us if the Bill is passed in its present form or without any modification of its form at the present time. The proposal of the Deputy is to delete two paragraphs of Section 1.  The Minister wants to bring into the condemnation of death any persons who incite any other persons to levy war against Saorstát Eireann, or who incite any persons to take part or be concerned in any attempt to overthrow by force of arms or other violent means the Government of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>That is to say, we have decided that murder, deliberate and calculated murder, is punishable by death, and we are asked to decide that there is no difference between murder out of personal passion, the premeditated and deliberate desire to kill to satisfy one's own selfish or vicious impulses, and an offence of this kind, to incite any person to levy war.  The Minister has told us that there may be within that definition very minor cases of incitement.</P>

      <P>A man may go out at the street corner and say, &ldquo;The State is rotten and it ought to be destroyed. Who will help me to destroy it&rdquo;?  That man is guilty of an offence punishable only by death, and he then has to rely upon the prerogative of mercy.  That is a phrase that presumably means that the Minister for Justice for the time being will have to decide whether such a person ought to suffer death, the judge having had no alternative but to prescribe that this street-corner orator is guilty of that <Col N="1033" /> offence.  The decision as to the continued existence of the offender is to be left in the hands of the Minister for Justice for the time being; it is he who will have to exercise the prerogative of mercy.  I say that we ought not to allow that to be a possibility.  We ought not to put upon the Minister for Justice for the time the responsibility of saying: &ldquo;Patrick Murphy, who incited his fellows to levy war against the State or to take such efforts by force of arms or other violent means to overthrow the Government, should suffer death.&rdquo;  The Minister will be the only person who will have to decide that the sentence should not be carried out.  I say that within these paragraphs which Deputy Mulcahy seeks to delete there are possibilities of injustice, of, shall I say, unconsidered vengeance, being meted out to the offender, and we ought not to agree that any such power shall be placed in the hands of the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>No, I think the Deputy did not hear me.  I say I would not reply to the Deputy at all except that it might have the semblance of discourtesy if I did not.  The fact is that the Deputy has put up nothing substantial calling for any reply, and nothing with which I have not already dealt.  He has, of course, made skilful use of the fact that the degrees of offences will necessarily come within this sub-head and within this section, and that is one of the difficulties of legislation.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that it would be impossible to draft a sub-head that would cover the gravest form of the offence of conspiring to levy war against the State and that would not cover lesser degrees of that same offence, and the Deputy knows as well as I do that it would not be possible to draft a sub-head that would cover the gravest form of <Col N="1034" /> incitement and that would not cover less grave degrees of the same offence.  But with regard to both of these things I have suggested remedies; I have indicated an intention to insert in the Bill a new section that will cover simply the offence of &ldquo;forming, organising, promoting, maintaining or being a member of a military organisation not authorised by law,&rdquo; which will enable the less grave degrees of conspiracy to be met and dealt with, and I have pointed out that the less grave degrees of incitement can be met and are covered by the common law of sedition.  But the Deputy skilfully and successfully used the dilemma which cannot be avoided, that if you cover the gravest degree, if you think the gravest degree of conspiracy to levy war against the State something that warrants the death penalty, how do you get away from the dilemma of the battalion council meeting in the labourer's cottage in what are really almost normal times?  Are you going to put these men in peril of their lives?  Are you going to put what corresponds to the Hyde Park orator in peril of his life for saying that the State is rotten and ought to be destroyed, and who will come and help him to do so?  No.  But equally you do need and should have powers to deal with the gravest degree of these offences, and the only fitting penalty for the gravest degree of these offences is the capital penalty.  The lesser measures can be used against those who commit these offences in lesser degrees of guilt and gravity.  No man will be indicted in such a way as to imperil his life unless those responsible for the safety of the State consider that his life ought to be imperilled.  That is why I am looking for and will seek at a later stage of the Bill to insert an alternative section which will cover the simpler offence of organising and maintaining unlawful military associations within the State, and I do submit that an indictment under such a section will enable you to get out of the dilemma of having to put in peril of their lives people who, under all the circumstances, you do not really consider ought to have their lives imperilled. The lesser degrees of incitement can be <Col N="1035" /> met, if it is necessary to meet them at all, by an ordinary sedition indictment. But I stand for the insertion of these sub-heads because I can visualise, and it is, after all, my duty in drafting such a Bill as this, to visualise a state of circumstances in which these offences ought to be punishable, and punishable by death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to forget that the decision as to whether it will be for the minor or the major offence that the prisoner is to be indicted will rest with the authorities, with the Minister or the Attorney-General, and that that decision will have to be taken in a time, possibly, of excitement, when newspapers and certain sections of the public may be crying out for the lives of such persons. The Minister would be living in a period of excitement and under the influence of that kind of agitation, and there are just as many possibilities of refusing to indict the person who has committed, in the mind of the Minister, a minor offence, for the major offence. A man may either be indicted for the minor offence or the major offence, and the Minister may choose to indict him for the major offence.  Once that is done the death penalty is invoked and the sentence is carried out; calmer views may later prevail, but you cannot call back the death sentence once it has been inflicted.  Of course this argument applies to the punishment set out in the section as a whole, but I want you to think of it in relation to those persons who may be charged with incitement to levy war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are times of agitation, perhaps organisation, or perhaps a desire to stimulate organisation, and some people feel that their lives and their properties may be in danger, and there may be deputations to the Minister, they may inspire newspaper articles, and the Minister is perhaps weaker than the present Minister would be&mdash;more amenable to that kind of influence.  He, or the Attorney-General, might decide that this is a matter of great moment, and that the alleged offender should be indicted for the major offence.  Once that has taken place the penalty is death.  A little later on it may be <Col N="1036" /> found that they had been over-excited and unduly agitated by these deputations and newspaper articles, but the death sentence had been carried out and the harm done.  How many executions within the last 5, 10 or 15 years in this country, or in the history of Europe within the last century, would not have been carried out if people had a little calmness, forethought, and more time to consider.  Political excitement brings feelings to the front which lead to acts that in calmer moments are recognised to be unjust and unreasonably severe.  It is for these reasons I would like to reduce the possibilities of undue vengeance being inflicted upon any persons in the Saorstát for offences such as incitement&mdash; incitement which may cover simple agitational speeches.  After all, police reports are not always reliable, and the spirit of the times is a consideration. We ought not allow ourselves to be brought into that state where we are going to execute, or run the possibility of the death penalty being inflicted, and then regret it three months afterwards. These are some of the reasons why I urge the Dáil to agree with Deputy Mulcahy's amendment.</P>

      <P>As there will probably be a division on this amendment, before taking part in it I want to give my view-point on this question, not necessarily the view-point of the party to which I belong.  I hold that the man who conspires or incites is a more guilty person than the man who &ldquo;encourages,&rdquo;&ldquo;harbours,&rdquo; and &ldquo;comforts.&rdquo;  If this section is going to stand at all, you should retain this power over the man who conspires or incites.  Anyone can visualise a position in which the man who incites is more guilty than the man who actually levies war.  We have had individuals of that class who have been very prominent in recent years.  Such an individual is cute enough to save his skin. Very seldom he came into the firing line, and very seldom he actually took risks.  He helped to incite, but he held a life insurance policy in his pocket, or he took care that he would not expose his hide to danger.  I do not see why individuals of this class should be excluded.  If I vote for the section at <Col N="1037" /> all, I shall also vote for this sub-section.</P>

      <P>Good.  The Deputy goes on to the Attorney-General.  After all, he is only a man, neither a god nor a machine, and is not infallible. Ministers are subject to political excitement and popular pressure, and they are not infallible.  We are living, after all, in that kind of world, subject to human limitations, and I am afraid that the Deputy is not going to get, this side of the grave at any rate, the state of affairs where considerations such as he urges will not apply.  He is not going to find his vacuum.  Yet we all have responsibilities, and yet we are supposed to act up to our responsibilities. I regard as the chief responsibility of the Government for the time being of this or any other country the defence and preservation of the State, and in furtherance of that responsibility to enable us to discharge it adequately and properly we are asking the representatives of the people to prescribe certain penalties for certain offences.  But these powers, if given, might be used rashly, might be used in heat, might be used in a spirit of political vindictiveness; therefore, they should not be given.  The Deputy seems to forget that under this section the accused man must be formally indicted before a jury of his countrymen, and must be found guilty of a grave offence before sentence is passed.  Then, after sentence is passed, people who are politically responsible through the Dáil to the electorate must decide whether or not that forfeit is to be exacted.  You cannot devise perfect legislation&mdash;no <Col N="1038" /> man can contrive it&mdash;which will rule out human considerations and human weaknesses such as the Deputy has touched on.</P>
      <P>You cannot invent a machine which will decide whether or not John so-and-so, found in such and such a state of circumstances, ought or ought not be indicted under Section 1, or under some other section which may be inserted at a later stage.  You will only find a man.  He is a man carefully selected to fulfil certain functions, to perform certain duties; but he will only be a man and, as the Deputy has pointed out, he will be liable to err like any man.  He will be neither a god nor a machine.  Yet I think we must decide here at this stage that, if the State is to survive, certain things must be declared to be offences, and adequate sanctions of law must be prescribed for such offences.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Dáil to agree with me in the view that under those sub-heads you may have a degree of guilt and gravity warranting the death penalty.  I know no way of drafting by which you will avoid bringing in the lesser offences; but I do suggest that the lesser offences can be met by indictment under some other sections of the Bill, or otherwise than under this Bill at all.  Lesser degrees of incitement to war can be met by an indictment for sedition.</P>
      <P>If we talked for weeks, I think we could devise no way of getting away from human frailties, such as Deputy Johnson has touched upon, and no way of ensuring that the factors such as he indicated will not operate.  He says that decisions may be taken in heat to put up men under this section rather than under some other section, and decisions may be taken to put a man in peril of his life for an offence for which his life ought not reasonably to be imperilled. You might apply that generally and say that it is unsafe to have the administration of the country in the hands of a body of men at all, because that body of men is liable to err.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Minister's argument is a travesty of anything I said.  The argument I adduced is quite a simple one.  It applies to the whole section, because it all leads to <Col N="1039" /> the penalty of death for a political offence.  The proposition before us is to limit the number of offences which are liable to lead to this death penalty, and therefore limit the number of occasions where a machine will operate in such a way as that the work accomplished cannot be recalled.  Clearly, my point is that this human instrument which we must work with and which we are perforce bound to work with, is, in times of political excitement, more likely to err and to do the unjust thing than in times of calmness.  But once the thing is done it cannot be recalled. It points to an alteration in the penalty.</P>
      <P>My argument in this matter is really directed against the death penalty and expresses a desire to reduce the number of offences of a political character which will be brought under the death penalty.  The Minister speaks of his regret at the absence of machine-like precision and rigidity.  I do not regret that at all.  I do not want a machine-like system of government or administration, and I do not want to have such an inflamed human instrument as will do things that, in calmer moments, cannot be recalled.</P>

I trust I am not deficient in humanity, but when you deal with such a very serious thing as awarding your vote for the infliction of the death penalty, it is at least essential that an adequate explanation should be offered.  The proposal in the Bill awards the death penalty to every person who commits in Saorstát Eireann any offence such as the following:&mdash;&ldquo;Conspires with any person (other than his or her wife or husband) or incites any person to levy war against Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is a very serious responsibility that lies on every Deputy, but in our duty to our constituents we have got to face this thing.  I propose to vote against Deputy Mulcahy's amendment.  A more or less hypothetical case has been put up that a man would be indicted under this Act and perhaps convicted and executed. I wonder whether a man can be executed who did not really deserve the death penalty.  These sub-sections are really aimed against people, I take it, who, remaining in comparative seclusion, going into the sewers, as it were, nevertheless are actively conspiring with and inciting others to pull down the whole fabric and the whole structure of the State.  I submit this section has a right to remain in the Bill.  I hope I am not deficient, I repeat, in humanity.  I should be sorry to see the ordinary poor wretch who may have taken men at their words indicted under these sections.  I say it is a good thing, speaking relatively, to retain this section.  It is a good thing to retain a maximum penalty, the penalty of death.  The retention of this section will be a very great deterrent to people who may conspire against the State.  It will make them think twice before they embark on such a thing.  Men may likely go forward on offences of that kind when they know that the maximum penalty will be imprisonment or penal servitude. They will think twice over this, and, thinking of this, they will be restrained from conspiring against the State if they realise there is a maximum penalty and that they may be indicted under Section 1.  I say this section should be retained to repress these conspirators who remain in the background but who still are pulling the strings and actively engaged in hostilities against the State.  I repeat that it is necessary to retain this section, and, believing that, I will vote for it.</P>

      <P>Amendment 5.&mdash;To add at the end of sub-section (1), line 34, the words, &ldquo;or such lesser punishment as the judge may direct.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Most of the arguments that were used in connection with the last two amendments were really arguments bearing on this amendment as well.  This amendment puts forward an alternative which the Minister, judging by his remarks, does not regard with favour. Still, his argument against it seemed to be rather an academic argument, and it did not impress me very much.</P>

      <P>Probably.  The Minister seemed to me to say that the whole trend of modern legislation was to fix the maximum penalty as the actual penalty and not allow the possibility of a lesser penalty.  That may be the case.  My legal knowledge is not sufficient to enable me to challenge that statement.  I have no doubt the Minister is quite correct, but I do not think it follows that because that is the trend of modern legislation it is necessarily the right trend.  I rather expected more originality on the part of the Minister than that he should merely follow the trend of legislation.  Probably the real point is whether the choice of a lesser penalty should lie with the court or should lie with the Executive Council.  I am bound to say that the arguments put forward leave me under the impression that the proper place for decision as to whether the maximum penalty or a lesser one should be imposed is in the court where the whole case has been tried and evidence heard.  I do not say that because I think that it is likely that more mercy would be shown by the court than by the Executive Council.  The reverse would probably be the case.  But I think it is probable that besides the actual judicial weighing of evidence in connection with the particular act, whatever it may have been, there would be other matters which would likely be present to the mind of the Executive Council in deciding as to whether they ought or ought not to insist on the extreme penalty.  They would naturally regard the matter in <Col N="1045" /> its wider bearings and would not have regard solely to the actual act of the person convicted and sentenced.</P>
      <P>Further, it seems to me that, to a certain extent, the naming of the extreme penalty as the only penalty makes it less likely that a verdict will be obtained, even though the evidence be very strong in favour of it.  A jury would be influenced by the fact that if they were to bring in a verdict of guilty the man, as a result, would be bound to be sentenced to death.  That is more or less inevitable.  Again, I am not clear from the reading of the Bill as to what exactly would be the consequence if a person were convicted and sentenced to death&mdash;the judge having no choice&mdash;and then the Executive Council were in the position of wishing to remit that sentence for a lesser one, I am not clear whether, under the terms of this Bill, they would be able to substitute another penalty for the death penalty, or whether they must insist on the death penalty.  Perhaps the Minister would explain that.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that even the wording of the section tends to show that the Minister or the draughtsman was disposed, in the first place, to say that the Bill meant that the maximum penalty should be death.  It says in the end of the first section, &ldquo;If such person is found guilty of treason he shall be liable on conviction thereof to suffer death.&rdquo;  Only in the very end does it say the penalty shall be the same as if he had been found guilty of murder. The use of the word &ldquo;liable&rdquo; suggests to the non-legal mind that that is the extreme penalty, but that another penalty might be inflicted if, in the opinion of the judge, the extreme one were not merited.  I think this alternative is sufficiently important for it to be worth serious consideration by the Dáil, and I hope the Minister will give it further consideration, because a great many of us, including myself, voted against the last amendment because we thought it was not the best way of meeting the difficulty, and the Minister himself admitted it was not.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment.  The effect of the amendment would be that in <Col N="1046" /> the case of all the offences which Section I purports to cover, the judge might impose a lesser penalty than that of death.  To place the judge in the position of deciding whether, in a given case, the death sentence should or should not be imposed, is, I think, undesirable.  I could understand opposition to this section coming from those who at all times and in all circumstances oppose capital punishment. That position has not, so far, been taken up by any Deputy.</P>
      <P>Treason, as John O'Leary said, is a grave crime.  If there be any offence for which the State is entitled to take the life of an individual, it is that offence.  If we take the view that the offence of treason is an offence warranting the death penalty and warranting forfeiture of the life of the individual, then I think we should say so in this Bill and say so <i>simpliciter</i>, leaving it not to the judge, who is not responsible to the people, who is not open to representation from the people, to decide whether or not that forfeit should be exacted, but to those who have political responsibility, and who are available to receive and consider any representations that may be made from the general public, to take a decision in the matter.</P>
      <P>The Deputy seemed to question whether, under the section, the death sentence could be commuted to any lesser sentence, whether it was not simply a position that if a particular penalty was imposed, that penalty had to be enforced or no penalty.  That, of course, is not the position.  The death sentence can always be commuted to any lesser penalty&mdash;to penal servitude. It comes down then to the question of who is to consider the mitigating circumstances, who is to consider whether or not the forfeit shall be exacted.  If the Dáil enacts that the offence of treason against the State is an offence for which, in the abstract, the life of the offender should be forfeit to the State, who is to consider whether, in the concrete circumstances, the forfeit should, or should not, be exacted?  Deputy Thrift says it is the judge, that we are to place the judge in the position of having discretion as to whether he shall or shall not pass the death sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> Different judges will, no doubt, have a different outlook on the question of the death penalty, and the life of an accused person may be on the hazard of what judge he happens to be indicted before.  I think it is infinitely preferable, if we consider the offence is one which warrants the imposition of the supreme penalty at all, to set down that penalty <i>simpliciter</i>, leaving those who have the responsibility for the conduct of the State, and for acting on behalf of the people, and who are, as I say, available to receive and consider any representations that may be forthcoming from the general public, to take the last decision; to consider the representations made on behalf of the convicted man and to take the decision.  I do not want to use the word in any narrow sense, but it is, after all, a political decision, and political circumstances will and must come in from the very nature of the offence.  The offence is an attack upon the life of the State, and it is not improper that those who have the responsibility of safeguarding the life of the State should say finally and in the last resort, whether or not the forfeit is required and should be exacted.  The judge is not politically responsible.  You put him in his high office.  He is aloof.  He is independent of the people.  He is not susceptible to any representations, and he is not available to receive any representations from the people.  It is those who act on behalf of the people, who have the responsibility to the people to preserve the State&mdash;which is the people's State &mdash;who should, I submit, decide in the case of this particular offence whether the exacting of the penalty is required.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I do not want to be misunderstood when I say that political considerations will decide whether the penalty is to be exacted. I use the word &ldquo;political&rdquo; in the broadest possible sense of the word.  I mean that in the abstract the Deputy can take it that possibly the most unpleasant duty which a Cabinet can possibly have to perform is the duty of deciding negatively on such a point as this.  It is the Government of the country for the time being, it is the Executive Council of the country for <Col N="1048" /> the time being that is best qualified to know whether or not a situation exists which calls for the exaction of the supreme penalty, or whether or not the situation is such that leniency towards that particular offence would not have grave reactions on the State, and would not gravely prejudice the future safety of the State.  They are preeminently fitted to know all the factors that would have to be considered in a decision such as the decision that would be involved by that section. They are in a better position, I submit, to know them and judge them than the judge himself.</P>
    <P>I would not like to write into this Bill an amendment putting on the judge the duty of deciding whether or not the general position of the State was such as to make the exaction of the supreme penalty a necessity.  I say that in the case of any offence for which you prescribe that penalty, it ought to be prescribed <i>simpliciter</i> and the judge ought not be asked to say whether the degree of the offence was such as to require that penalty or a lesser one.  He is not so asked in the case of murder.  The penalty which the law prescribes for murder is the penalty of death, and the man found guilty of that offence must have the capital sentence passed on him.  It is not always exacted.  There are those on whom the duty lies of considering all the circumstances, and considering whether there are no mitigating facts or circumstances which would justify leniency. I suggest that we should follow the same course here.  I suggest that the life of an accused man ought not to depend upon the accidental circumstances of the particular judge before whom he happens to be indicted and on that judge's outlook upon the capital sentence; and the duty of judging factors which are political factors, and judging a position which is a political position, should not be imposed upon a judicial functionary, but should lie rather with those who have the final political responsibility for the safety and welfare of the State.  That is my objection to the Deputy's amendment, and I think that the Deputy will not find many, if any, precedents in modern legislation for prescribing for the same <Col N="1049" /> offence the death penalty and any lesser penalty which the judge may think fit to impose.</P>

      <P>With most of what the Minister stated I find myself in very close agreement, but I would like to point out that what I was trying to secure in this amendment was, not that the control of the matter from the political point of view should be removed from the Executive Council, because I think they are the only persons who could decide that, but to secure two things: in the first place, that the man's complicity or actual part in anything for which he was tried was sufficiently grave from the criminal point of view that he should deserve the death penalty in the judge's estimation, and, if that had been fulfilled, if the judge thought he was worthy of the death penalty, then the Executive Council should come in with their political considerations and say whether the conditions at the time required the exercise of the penalty or not.  If you like, I was giving the unfortunate man a double chance.  But I did not seek in any way to challenge the fact that it must be the Executive who are to estimate the needs of the country from the political point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects which I ask the Deputy to consider for a moment.  You write a penalty, a sanction into a Bill with regard to a particular offence.  Why? I suggest you do it with a two-fold object.  You do it first in the hope of its proving a deterrent, and secondly&mdash; and only secondly, I submit&mdash;to provide that, in the event of the deterrent effect proving inadequate, justice will be done, that the balance will be redressed. The acts set out here are serious: levying war against the State; conspiring with any person, or inciting any person to levy war against the State.  The State must defend itself, and is entitled to defend itself, and when the duty and the responsibility of that defence and protection is placed on certain people they must be given adequate power.  Take the deterrent aspect of the sanction.  Will it prove adequate?  Is it likely to prove adequate if you write into the Bill death <Col N="1050" /> or any lesser penalty, and if, in fact, the idea grows up that the death penalty is rather <i>in terrorem</i> than likely to be actually imposed, and the feeling prevails that a judge, confronted with the alternatives of passing the death sentence or imposing a lesser sentence, will invariably or almost invariably take the latter course?  I suggest that the effect of the Deputy's amendment will be, in practice, that the death penalty for treason disappears, or, at any rate, that in the public mind, and in the mind of potential treasonable offenders, that belief will grow and harden. That is undesirable&mdash;eminently undesirable.</P>
      <P>Men contemplating assault upon the life of the State ought to do it, at any rate, with the contemplation of the more serious penalty&mdash;the supreme penalty&mdash;in the event of detection and conviction.  I think it would be unwise to remove from their minds or lessen in their minds that contemplation.  It is a reasonable thing, after all, and perhaps more reasonable in a country with a franchise as broad as ours and with special provision for the representation of minority views, to say that the person who attacks the State, who attempts to destroy the State, shall have his life forfeit to the State, and that the final decision upon the exaction or non-exaction of that forfeit will lie with those who have the final responsibility for the defence and protection of the State and not with any irresponsible lawyer&mdash;and I use the word irresponsible entirely in the political sense&mdash;who has no responsibility to the people, no political responsibility.  I stand for the section and against the amendment.  I have endeavoured to put as clearly as I can the reasons for that position, and I ask the Dáil to agree with my view.</P>

      <P>There is another aspect of this question that has not been dealt with: That is the position that you put a judge into.  I may be wrong, but, to my mind, it is a very unenviable position.  The question of the penalty in a murder case or a treason case does not arise until the jury has given a decision.  When the jury has given a decision the amendment seeks to put <Col N="1051" /> the judge in the position, not alone of judging the degree of guilt of the individual, but also of judging the justice of the jury's verdict.  To my mind, that is an impossible position, a position that, properly speaking, no judge should be put in.  I may be taking an exaggerated view, but I think it puts him in a position that no judge would be willing to occupy.  I do not think it is fair to the judge.  It is an impossible position to put a judge in.  I should not like to be put in such a position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of considerations that arise in view of the Minister's statement in regard to this matter.  First, there is the position of the judges as compared with the position of the Executive for the time being as defenders of the health of the State.  The Minister makes a distinction between a judge who is to administer the law in respect to civil crimes, crimes that are not treason, and others, and I gather from the Minister's view that it is right that the judges of the civil courts ought to be entrusted with the authority of the law in respect to that class of crime or offence.  When we come to what may be called political offences against the established Government, then the only function of the Court is to decide whether that person charged is guilty of the offence, but that it is the Executive that shall mete out the sentence.  I think that is practically the position that the Minister stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>May I correct the Deputy.  The Dáil is asked to prescribe a penalty for a particular offence.  The jury will decide the question of guilt and the judge will impose the penalty and will pass the sentence as prescribed by law, and in any particular case the Executive will decide whether or not the circumstances require the exaction of the penalty or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether or not the circumstances, apart from the prisoner's guilt, apart from the offence&mdash; that is to say, whether the circumstances extraneous to the offence are such as would justify the political <Col N="1052" /> authority in over-riding the court's decision. This is not put forward as an exercise of the prerogative of mercy. It is put forward as the function of a political Executive in respect to offences of a political character.  I think that is a rather dangerous doctrine, because the Executive in a State Government, as this State is and will be, is undoubtedly a political body subject to the fluctuations of public opinion.  If the offender is of a kind that can get the support of a large body of public opinion, the influence to be brought to bear on the Executive will be greater, and it will be more likely to succumb to that influence.  If the offender is not of the character, social status or political strength that he can gather to himself a great body of support, then the responsibility of the Executive in the direction of a commutation of the sentence will not be so great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An analogy has been brought forward in respect of the law relating to the punishment for murder.  That is not a true analogy.  In the case of murder the victim has lost his life, and it is clear that the evidence brought forward and leading up to the verdict of guilty is, as to the connection between the prisoner and the death of the victim and the method of bringing about that death, and the motives and so on, whether it was an attack with intent to kill that resulted in death.  But here we have a series of offences which, quite obviously, lead to variations and grades of guilt.  We have not got a concrete case of a dead man who has met his death by violence caused by an individual.  You have a series of offences such as incite to do a certain thing.  That incitement may be of a very direct kind, or of a less direct kind.  It may be very insistent and very powerful, or it may be less insistent and less powerful; but the penalty is to be the same in every case, the only change being that the political authority is going to be empowered, and this is defended by the Minister, to exercise a discretion as to what the extent of the penalty shall be.  So far, in these countries the law does not say that an attempted murder is to be subject to the same penalty as actual murder. <Col N="1053" /> Incitement to commit this offence is to be meted with the same punishment as the commitment of the offence of making war.  The mind of the inciter may be just as antipathetic to the State and he may be just as great an offender as the actual person who commits the offence.  As regards what may be called the end of the incitement, the levying of the war, the guilt of the one may be as great morally as the guilt of the other.  So it is with murder.  An attempt to murder is morally and logically as great an offence as actual murder, but the law in this country has made a distinction in the penalty, and I think the explanation lies in the fact that there is a realisation that once the execution is undertaken the life cannot be brought back and possibilities of error cannot then be avoided. In other countries we have, I think, a legal system which allows, for the offence of murder, a first and a second degree.</P>
    <P>One can see surely that the offence of levying war or an incitement to levy war may be great or small.  There may be degrees, shall I say, of guilt.  Certainly there may be degrees in the effect of the incitement or the conspiracy, and I think it ought not to be left to be a matter for the discretion of the Executive as to how much of the maximum sentence shall be remitted. Another question has arisen as to the unfortunate position of the judge.  Of course, his position is unfortunate in many other cases, but the presumption is that he is detached from the influences which would affect the political Executive of the time.  He is somewhat impersonal, and is not affected by the passions of the moment like the political Executive is likely to be, and justice is more likely to be meted out, and reason and equity are, I suggest, more likely to be taken into consideration by the judge than by the political Executive. The jury has also a difficulty placed before it.  If it knows that the penalty that is to be imposed upon the person for incitement to conspiracy or for incitement to take up arms against the State is death, do you think that the jury is likely to find a verdict in accordance with the evidence?</P>
    <P>I suggest that the chances are that <Col N="1054" /> in very many cases jurors, knowing the penalty is death, will not find a verdict according to the evidence notwithstanding their oaths.  They realise that the amount of the incitement, the quality of that incitement is of that nature that is not deserving in their minds of the death penalty. They will not risk the possibility that the Executive will not commute the sentence, if the proposition of the Minister is that the political authority shall be placed in the same position in respect of political offences of this character as the Minister for Justice has been placed in and as the Home Secretary in England has been placed in regard to appeals for clemency and remission of the death sentence.  In murder cases petitions are sent forward.  The Minister calls for the minutes of evidence and the judge's notes and the judge's report as to how the evidence and the demeanour of the prisoner affected him.  The Minister has to take into account all these factors upon the evidence which appeared in the court although the Minister was not there.  He will have simply to take a printed or written material to come to his judgment.  He will say that it is not the facts of the case that he is dealing with, but with those extraneous matters such as whether the execution of the offender in a particular case is going to have reactions, and if there are risks of reactions which might be harmful or inconvenient then the remission will be made.  It may be that if the pressure is not strong or if the Ministry for the time being is rather fearful and nervous, then it will say, &ldquo;Let the execution take place, we are afraid&rdquo;; and in three months' time, when the country is calmer and the excitement has died down, it will be found that they were afraid of a phantom.  I do not think the political authority for the time being should be required by the passing of this section, without this amendment, to exercise its judgment as to whether an offence is of the kind that warrants a death penalty.  If there are varying circumstances, if there are degrees in guilt and the factors of the situation do not seem, to the court, to warrant the supreme penalty, <Col N="1055" /> then it should be left to the court to decide that the penalty is less extreme than capital punishment.  I want to say that this is not a case where we should rely on what is called the prerogative of mercy being decided by the Executive authority in times of political excitement, in matters of treason or what is designated in this section as being treasonable, and if we are going to leave the decision as to how much less than the death penalty, or what lesser penalty than the death penalty, shall be inflicted, it ought not to be left with the political authority but with the judicial authority which tried the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest the amendment proposed by Deputy Thrift corresponds with the realities that the Minister or whoever occupies that position in future, under the operation of this Bill when it becomes an Act, will find himself compelled to act in agreement with.  By all means, once a person has been found guilty of a particular offence, let there be set opposite that offence a penalty that shall be unvarying.  I ask what would actually happen under the operation of this section.  Under sub-section (1) (a) it would happen that if any particular person was caught in the act of levying war against the State, almost in any circumstances whatever, it would not be possible for the Minister to find himself in the position of varying the death sentence because the conditions would be those of actual warfare.  Warfare would actually be continuing, and the person would have been caught redhanded and would have been convicted. Under paragraph (a) then the consequence is set out, and will almost inevitably follow whatever may happen. But come down to this further subparagraph and to the question of incitement that Deputy Johnson touched upon.  Incitement may occur under conditions of perfect calm without any disturbance in the country.  That incitement may nevertheless be incitement within the terms of the section, and as the section reads and stands there would be no opportunity for any tribunal to vary the death sentence. But in these conditions and circumstances <Col N="1056" /> it is impossible, at least it is highly improbable, that any Minister would allow the death sentence to proceed. He would find himself of necessity compelled by the facts and circumstances to make a variation in the judgment returned under this section. The effect of that argument is that there are found within this section a certain category of offences of unequal severity and unequal value.  Against them we have not got a variation of the penalty, only one rigorous penalty, and consequently as the section stands the judge has no option but to pass a sentence of death.  Consequently those real variations that do exist and will be found in practice to exist will also be found in practice to require and necessitate the interposition of the Executive, an interposition dependent not in the necessity so much of the case but dependent upon the variations that are within the section itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I mean is that incitement is clearly more often likely to occur under conditions of peace than under conditions of war.  Levying war can only exist under a condition of war. The conditions in the two cases are entirely different.  In the case of levying war with disturbed conditions and with a state of warfare continuing, there is no likelihood of the Minister interposing himself with any variation. In the case of incitement under conditions of peace, which may be conditions of absolute peace, the incitement may be an incitement which must, in the inherent nature of the circumstances, fail from the first word.  Yet the penalty must be the same, but the penalty will be one which could not under the circumstances be suffered to continue, and so it appears that there is really substantial variation on the section in regard to the offences set forth.  The only matter is that there is not a corresponding variation, nor a corresponding adaptability of the penalty.  If the section were to be put into two parts, and levying war was one, and the more severe of these penalties was to have attached to that an unvarying penalty of death, so be it.  If, on the other hand, in a second part of the section minor offences were set out with a minor penalty that would be admirable. <Col N="1057" /> But what we have got is the severest penalty for a variation of crime and offences against the State. The meaning of the amendment is that the judge shall determine, and I say that the justification of the amendment will be found in the future, because it will always happen that levying war against the State will not only receive in the courts the full sentence, but that the full sentence will be sought by the Minister, whereas these other minor offences will also receive the full sentence, but not in five per cent. of the cases will the Minister suffer them to be carried out.  That would be the practice in the future, and that practice is what it is being endeavoured to give legal sanction by this amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like to support this amendment, but I am afraid it is quite impracticable to place on the shoulders of a judge the alternative of varying sentences.  As far as I am personally concerned, I am certainly no advocate of capital punishment, but on the other hand, in connection with this Bill it seems to me that there is no alternative.  The introduction of the term &ldquo;murder&rdquo; into the clause seems to me rather to confuse the issue. Murder is a civil crime which is punishable by death, but the analogy with the case of treason is not very apparent to me.  This clause aims at preventing people from taking up arms against the State.  In its operation any person that engages in a conspiracy or actually takes up arms must of necessity recognise that he is taking a step which, if successful, has no penalty attached to it at all.  But the Executive must for its protection place an importance on an action of this kind which justifies the very maximum penalty.  To do otherwise I think would be to minimise <Col N="1058" /> the seriousness of the step that such a person took when he proposed to take up arms and by violence wrest the power of the State from the people as a whole, who in their wisdom elect representatives and, incidentally, elect the Executive Council.</P>
      <P>Cases have been recited showing where very little harm may be done by the machinations of these people, because they do not get far enough.  But surely that is an argument in favour of holding up before them the seriousness of any action they may propose to take in that direction.  Unless the Government and the State take the fullest powers to suppress any action of that kind in the initial or in any stage, I think they would be guilty of neglecting to do what must be done in every State.  Every State, I take it, has a law of this kind, and as far as I can see the minor cases dealt with politically would and must get the serious consideration of the Executive Council before the capital sentence was put into operation. After all, the Executive Council are the people who are open to public criticism in a way that does not apply to any judge or any other body of people, and as far as I can see, the Executive Council are the people who are open to public criticism in a way that does not apply to any judge or any other body of people, and as far as I can see the Executive Council are not likely to exaggerate the importance of a trivial movement.  But they certainly ought to be in a position to take strong action where the necessity arises, and that they should be able to take that action at an early stage is, I think, of obvious importance.</P>

      <P>I want to speak generally against the section.  I think the section is simply an attempt to reenact what is unnecessary, and that we <Col N="1062" /> are not yet in a state of mind when we should be able to consider the whole question of the relations of the citizens to the State in matters of treason with calm minds and without reference to the political trouble of the last year or two.  There is no necessity at the present moment for enacting a Treasonable and Seditious Offences Bill.  Perhaps at later times when we have calmness, and can give due consideration to matters of this kind, we would approach them with some ideas of, shall I say, liberalism without falling back upon old enactments and the spirit of the pre-Victorian age.  In a general way I oppose the section because I oppose the attempt to enact a Bill of this kind at this moment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether an Order in Council dated 4th June, 1877, was issued under the Juries Procedure (Ireland) Act, 1876, fixing the fees to be paid for the preparation of the Jurors Lists at £10 for the first 100 names, and 9d. per name thereafter; whether at that time the names to be returned were mainly limited to occupiers rated at £40, and £10 freeholders; whether the numbers returned on the lists have been enormously increased owing to the insertion thereon of tenant purchasers under the Land Purchase Acts whose valuations are as low as £10 a year; whether the maximum remuneration in the Order was fixed at £125 a year for the Clerk of a Union; whether this limit was enforced when the work was transferred to the Secretaries of County Councils, and if the Executive Council will consider the advisability of issuing a new Order reducing the fees, as the names of the jurors are now shown on the Voters Lists.</P>

      <P>The Orders fixing fees for the preparation of Jurors Lists are dated 26th November, 1919, and 5th November, 1920; the amounts being as stated in the Deputy's question.  The qualification for jurors is statutory, and I have no information as to the increase in the number of jurors by reason of the inclusion of persons of a particular valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> With regard to the limitation of remuneration, I would refer the Deputy to the terms of the Order of 5th November, 1920, which suspended the operation of clause 2 of the Order of 26th November, 1919.  County secretaries are remunerated in accordance with clause 3 of the Order of 26th November, 1919. The question of fees for jurors work has already been considered by the Oireachtas and appears in Section 8 (2) of the Juries (Amendment) Act, 1924.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether an Order was issued dated 20th March, 1919. fixing the fees for the preparation and revision of the Voters Lists in counties at 3d. per name, payable to the county secretary; whether dual fees amounting to 1/6½ per name are now paid in respect of the name of any person appearing on the Voters Lists, who is also shown thereon to be qualified as a Juror; whether as the yearly revision of the Lists now entails considerably less work, the Executive Council will dispense with the services of county secretaries as being redundant, or issue a new Order reducing the fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative, and to the second part in the negative.  The present scales of Registration expenses were framed on 21st February, 1924, and represent a substantial reduction on the former fees. Section 8 (2) of the Juries (Amendment) Act, 1924, enacts that no fees are allowable in respect of duties under the Juries (Ireland) Acts to county secretaries appointed after 15th November, 1921.  The expenses of revision are reduced, but it is not agreed that the services of county secretaries are redundant. In view of section 8 (2), previously quoted, the necessity for any scale dealing with duties under the Juries Acts disappears.</P>
