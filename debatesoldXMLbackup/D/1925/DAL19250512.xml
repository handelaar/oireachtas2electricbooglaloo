      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that certain proposals relating to housing for Civil Servants were submitted to his Department for consideration as far back as July, 1924, by the Civil Service Federation, and whether he will now undertake to have these proposals investigated and cause a reply thereto to be furnished.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has received from Mr. Martin Naughton, Ballycor, Oatfield, Sixmilebridge, Co. Clare, an application for compensation in respect of personal injuries sustained by him at the hands of British <Col N="1268" /> Forces on January 8th, 1921; if that application has been considered, and, if he will give it further consideration if the applicant produces new evidence in its regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The application referred to by the Deputy was investigated by the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee who recommended that no compensation should be paid. As the injuries sustained by the applicant were not serious enough to require medical treatment, I see no reason why the case should be re-opened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS (for Mr. A. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether travellers' samples of dutiable goods, accompanied, will be allowed into the Saorstát under bond as in Australia, and, if so, whether all samples must be returned, or whether duty can be paid on the portion sold in the Saorstát; whether travellers' samples unaccompanied will be allowed in on deposit, or if duty be paid, whether commercial travellers can claim a refund on any samples which are returned to manufacturers outside the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Bona fide samples of dutiable goods accompanied by commercial travellers are admitted into <Col N="1269" /> the Saorstát without payment of duty on conditions prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners to secure the duty involved, the identification of the samples and the re-exportation thereof. These conditions include also provision for deposit of the duty or for the execution of a bond to cover the duty pending the re-exportation of the samples.  All such samples must be returned and failure to observe this condition may involve the withdrawal of the concession.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have extended the above facilities on similar conditions to unaccompanied samples of clothing and apparel, etc.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the Lisdoonvarna and Rooska Spa Wells Trust has been assessed for income tax under No. 3 of Schedule A of the Income Tax <Col N="1270" /> Act, 1918, in respect of the years 1920/21 and 1922/23 on the basis of the profits of the preceding year, and, if he is aware that the Wells Trust has sustained heavy working losses in the years in question; further, whether, having regard to the fact that the deficit on four years still remains at £1,940, the Revenue Commissioners will enforce payment of the assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">

      <P>Under Rule 3 of Schedule A, No. 111 (Income Tax Act, 1918) salt springs, &amp;c., are assessable to income tax on the basis of the profits of the year preceding the year of assessment. The liability of the Lisdoonvarna and Rooska Spa Wells has been computed on that basis, and there is no power to waive the collection of the tax charged.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether in the case of boots and shoes imported into the Saorstát after the appointed day and not up to order and therefore not accepted and returned, the importer is entitled to a refund of the duty paid on such goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision in law for the refund of duty paid on boots and shoes which have been duly cleared through the Customs on payment of duty, and subsequently sent out of the country.  Payment of duty on imported boots and shoes can be deferred or avoided by importers depositing the goods in a warehouse approved by the Revenue Commissioners.  In such case duty is payable when the goods are taken from the warehouse for home use, but if the goods are exported from the warehouse no duty falls to be paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The claim to unemployment benefit made by Thomas Quealy, of Cronegort, Doolin, Ennistymon, Co. Clare, on the 25th of November, 1924, was disallowed on the statutory grounds that the applicant was not unemployed and was not unable to obtain suitable employment.  He exercised his right of appeal, and the case ultimately went to the umpire, whose decision was that the claim must be disallowed on the grounds stated.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say in what special connection the section of the Act applies to that man?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The claimant in this case is the holder of a substantial farm of land, and that circumstance of itself shows <i>prima facie</i> that the man was not unable to obtain suitable employment. In this case there was every consideration given to it.  The case was examined in the first instance by the <Col N="1272" /> insurance officials, and afterwards by the umpire, who decided that the claim had properly been disallowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In a case where a claim has been disallowed and where payment has not been made, will the Minister say what is the position under the Act regarding a refund of the money to the contributors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Unemployment Insurance Fund, of course, holds on to the money if any contributions have been paid.  The fund is swollen by contributions from people, and these contributions are not payable simply on the basis that a claimant has previously paid contributions.  Contributions are only payable when contributions have been paid, and when, amongst other things, suitable employment is not possible.</P>

      <Col N="1278" /> I regret to say the Minister for Education is unwell, and it is not proposed to take his Estimates.  I presume I am meeting with the approval of the Dáil in taking the legislative programme, as I have outlined it, to-day, and the Estimates that appeared on the Order Paper last week, to-morrow.  The first is the Courts of Justice, next the Ministry of External Affairs (the League of Nations Vote), and the others on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>I move that the Dáil sit later than 8.30, and that the motion for the adjournment be taken not later than 10.30.  We may not sit very late, but we want to get through as much of the legislative programme on the Paper as possible.</P>

While I do not want to raise any objection, I am quite certain some Deputies, who did not want to interest themselves in the Education Estimates, and who are, therefore, not here to-day, when it was expected they would come on, but are interested in the legislative items, and would be here if they had known these were coming on, will have a grievance.</P>

    <P>(1)  For the purpose of advising and assisting the Minister in the performance of his duties under this Act there shall be established an advisory <Col N="1284" /> committee (in this section referred to as the committee) which shall be styled the Local Supplies Advisory Committee and shall consist of five persons to be appointed by the Minister from time to time as occasion requires, of whom&mdash;</P>

    <P>(3)  The several members of the committee shall, unless they previously die or resign, respectively retain their membership for such period from their appointment as the Minister shall prescribe, but shall be eligible for reappointment.</P>
    <P>(4)  Three members of the committee shall be a quorum, and the members of the committee shall at every meeting elect from amongst their number the chairman for that meeting, and such chairman shall have a second or casting vote.</P>

      <P>This amendment is almost the same as that introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary when this Bill was last before the House.  I think it meets the criticisms which were raised against nominations being made by bodies which might not be regarded as statutory.  The principle which was in mind in connection with the previous amendment will, of course, be observed, that is to say, that the General Council of County Councils will be requested by the Minister while it is in session, to nominate two persons to act on the committee.  In the same way the Municipal Authorities Association will also be requested to nominate two persons, and the same course will be adopted as regards the fifth member as was contained in the previous amendment.</P>
      <P>I do not think any complaint can now be made regarding the infirmity which existed in the previous amendment. While this amendment affects the same purpose it is not open to any such objections as were raised on the previous occasion, so that I think it might be accepted.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw the President's attention to the fact that the effect of the amended form will be that the consultation with the different bodies mentioned by the President is optional under this proposal.  It says the Minister &ldquo;may.&rdquo;  Would there be any objection to substituting &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for that word?  Sometimes a government and ministers change, but the Act remains.  If the word were &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; it would ensure that the intention now expressed by the President would be carried out by his successors.  I would suggest that that particular point might be considered <Col N="1286" /> by the President.  I would also ask him to bear in mind that this clause has been introduced to meet almost unanimous opposition on the part of local authorities to this proposal.  I am quite sure the President has received from a large number of local bodies, as many of the Deputies have, resolutions objecting to this particular proposal. It was, I think, his intention to have an Advisory Committee on which these different bodies would have to some extent representation, and, therefore, an opportunity of putting their views before the Minister.  I would suggest that in order to make the proposal more acceptable, although I doubt that it would alter the views of many of the local authorities regarding this Bill, or weaken their opposition to it, the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be substituted for &ldquo;may.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out that that substitution will not really effect Deputy Good's purpose. The amended form will read: &ldquo;The Minister shall before appointing a member consult with any association of commerce.&rdquo;  That certainly would not meet Deputy Good's claim that it should be discussed with the particular association he has in mind.  If you say the Minister shall consult with any association of commerce, then you may find the association in Galway or Tralee, or some other place, and entirely leave out Dublin.  That would not effect Deputy Good's purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy consider the other side of the question? As it stands, the proposal put forward by the President is not in the form that I would put it forward in, but we cannot always get the views we favour adopted.  The alteration I suggested means that the Minister should consult with some association.  Under the proposal as it is before us it is not necessary, in making these appointments, that he should consult any association. The President has been good enough to give an undertaking that before such appointments are made he will take such and such steps to communicate <Col N="1287" /> with these different bodies, but, as I say, he could make the proposal probably more acceptable to the opponents of the Bill if the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; were substituted for the word &ldquo;may.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">

      <P>I have no objection to the suggested amendment, but I am of Deputy Johnson's opinion that it does not make it cast-iron.  It will, however, mean that the Minister has got to consult with some people.  If he did not, I do not know that he would be doing anything more than breaking the law.  With the permission of the Dáil, I am prepared to accept that amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <P>Amendment, as amended, put and declared carried.</P>
      <P>Question proposed:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill, as further amended, be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment inserted probably goes a little towards meeting some of the criticism levied against the Bill.  It does not, however, go very far and there is no assurance that the committee is going to have authority that would remove difficulties created by the Bill itself.  It is not necessary, perhaps it is not wise, to go over the whole question of the methods that the Bill provides for meeting the difficulties announced by the Minister on the First and Second Readings.  I want to repeat that I have no objection &mdash;quite the contrary&mdash;to the principle of combined purchasing of standardized articles for local authorities.  But I object to the proposal to set up a body&mdash;a Department of the Ministry&mdash; even though it has an advisory committee of this kind, which will draw up a schedule of articles, and a schedule of contractors who will be bound to supply to any local authority in any part of the country the articles on this schedule at a price named, and makes it penal almost, certainly throws a responsibility for proving innocence <Col N="1288" /> upon the local authority, if it attempts by any means to go outside the schedule, even though the purchase price is lower, the quality better, or the service given more satisfactory than could be got from the scheduled firms.</P>
      <P>The effect of the Bill will be to encourage combinations of firms, to encourage trusts and rings, and to deprive the local authorities of any power of getting outside the rings or breaking them.  We can foresee the possibility, not at all unlikely, that as regards certain articles two or three firms are capable of supplying the whole demands of local authorities; that these firms will arrange amongst themselves what price shall be charged and that, having been put upon the list of contractors, the opportunities for any smaller and struggling local firms to supply similar articles, possibly more satisfactorily, but only capable of reaching a small area, will be nil.  I want to stress the provisions of the Bill, and my objection to them, which say that any firm on the contractor's list is bound to supply the article in question to any local authority in any part of the country at the price named in the schedule. You are making a flat rate for the whole country; you are deciding that no local authority will have an advantage over any other local authority in respect to the price they may pay, even though the local conditions would allow the local authority to purchase much more advantageously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be said that the auditor, who has certain powers in this matter, would not object to a local authority purchasing at a lower price; but it may be that the question affecting the local authority's decision would not be price but quality and convenience of delivery, certainty of delivery, regularity of delivery, and a better chance of checking. The auditor will come twelve months after the event, and it will be necessary for the local authority to prove to him that there was greater convenience, greater regularity of delivery, greater certainty of delivery, and better quality from the local supplier than from the scheduled supplier.  It may be impossible for the auditor to form any judgment on the facts.  His judgment will be based upon his opinion and prejudices. <Col N="1289" /> In such a case the onus of proving to the auditor that the local authority was not criminally minded is thrown upon the local authority.  I say that that is the wrong way to approach the matter.  It is treating the local authorities with discourtesy, to say the very least.  It is proclaiming beforehand by legislation that you do not trust the local authorities, and assuming that if they do not purchase within the scheduled limits, then they have had ulterior and selfish motives without regard to the public interest.</P>
    <P>We attempted to insert a provision in the Bill which would allow scheduled firms to be scheduled in respect of definite areas, so that a firm which was not in a position to supply the whole country at a given price would be able to quote for a particular class of article delivered at a station, say, within fifty miles, or within the province, or two counties.  At any rate, such a firm would be able to take into account the cost of delivery.  Under the Bill, as proposed, you are asking the contracting firms, who will be scheduled, to fix a rate in making quotations which will enable them to deliver in any part of the country.  They will be asked to calculate upon where the biggest demand will come from&mdash;is it likely to come from the west, or the south, or the north-west&mdash;and if the biggest demand is likely to come from distant places, then prices will be adjusted accordingly. In practice I think this is going to be most difficult.</P>
    <P>Then again a difficulty was pointed out by Deputy Good and myself and others which would arise in respect of the contracts that were entered into between the start of the contracting period and the end of that period.  For instance, if a contractor's price was twenty shillings for a certain article delivered in any part of the country, if Cork, Waterford and Wexford bought articles at that price, but Limerick did not want such articles until three months afterwards, the price would have become known to the purchasers and traders or manufacturers in Limerick.  Those contractors would then be able to under-cut the price in the schedule and somebody will have a grievance.  Would it then be said that <Col N="1290" /> the local authority was justified or was not justified in going outside the contractor's list?  According to the argument of the President in support of the Bill, I would gather that the auditor would be expected to surcharge the local authority for something&mdash;what it would be I do not know&mdash;but the responsibility would be placed upon the local authority for having bought outside the contractor's list, even though they bought cheaper and though the price at which they bought only became possible by virtue of the fact that other townships, boroughs or county councils had bought at an earlier date from the contractors at a higher price.  I think that the scheme of the Bill is not going to work satisfactorily.  The whole method is faulty, and I think the Bill ought not to pass in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Johnson that a local authority should be permitted to buy in its own area if the article that is to be bought is as cheap as the price in the schedule.  Although this system has not had the force of law it has been in operation for the past three years.  I submit that it has created a great deal of inconvenience for local authorities.  I would like to point out to the President that, in my opinion, seeing that the Bill is going to become law, and that there is no use in trying to stop it, it would be desirable if a representative of the Trading Department were sent to the various areas periodically. The price list that was sent out is not sufficiently descriptive, and very often local authorities have been led astray by it.  For instance, long-handled shovels were mentioned in the price list.  I know a local authority that ordered these long-handled shovels and found they were entirely different to what was described in the list.  The result was that shovels had to be purchased locally and the other ones sent back to the Trading Department.  Such incidents will occur unless the price list or the catalogue is more descriptive.  A representative of the Trading Department should be sent periodically to visit local authorities and find out exactly what they require.</P>

      <P>If any Deputy <Col N="1291" /> ought to speak against this Bill it should not be the last Deputy.  If goods can be bought better and cheaper locally, does the Deputy mean the 47 road vans made in Wexford would be purchased elsewhere?</P>

      <P>Should the clay pipes made in Wexford have been bought elsewhere?  The Deputy knows whether Wexford has benefited more than any other county in Ireland in this respect, and the Deputy, at any rate, should be the very last to make a case against this measure.  I am not committed to this measure, and I do not mind whether it passes or not.  It does not concern me.  I am concerned with doing something for the industry of the country where it can be done. I hold something has been done, and in Wexford more than anywhere else.  If the Deputy has anything to say against that, now is his opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say I was against the principle of the Bill.  Anyone would think from the President's remarks that I said so.  I said nothing of the kind.  So far as the bedsteads are concerned, they are of Irish manufacture. I wish the Trading Department would give more attention to <Col N="1292" /> Irish manufacture and not be bringing all the stuff they are bringing from the other side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department cannot do everything, and evidently it is not going to get much assistance, as every contract must be given to a local contractor.  Has not a man in Monaghan as good a right to get a contract as a man in Wexford?  Is the Deputy's contention to hold good if there is an opportunity of starting an industry or doing business in a particular place? Is the whole business of the country to be done in Wexford?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Following out the Deputy's suggestion to the logical conclusion, it simply means that where the Trade Department is unable to start an industry in Wexford, every local authority should be allowed to buy from a local contractor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is. Nothing is to the point except one thing: where a local industry is going to be started, make everybody buy there; if the local authority is to give a contract, let the local contractor get it.  The Deputy is speaking about one county, and there is a particular body in that county that will not buy Wexford-made goods, simply because the local contractor does not sell them. The Deputy knows quite well what this Department has done for Drinagh cement.</P>

      <NameTxt>THE PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  If the Deputy wants good results from contractors, at any rate the Deputy should <Col N="1293" /> see that the debts are paid.  I got some information while Deputy Corish and Deputy Johnson were speaking and I find the great &ldquo;punch&rdquo; against this Bill comes from places where things like this have happened:&mdash;Tea&mdash;The local contractor has no specification and the price paid is 2/4 per lb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that Irish manufacture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The price on the list is 1/11.  Rice&mdash;23/4 per cwt.  No specification locally; according to the price list 20/3.  Corn flour&mdash;60/- cwt., and 28/- on the list.  Strawberry jam&mdash; 24/- per doz.; 21/- on the list, and so on.  To go to another part of the country, over 100 miles away, I find that most of the goods purchased by a local authority, which objects to this central purchasing scheme, are not of Irish manufacture and are much dearer than the prices in the Trade Department's list.  Tobacco, not manufactured in this country, 9/3 per lb.  In the list the price for tobacco manufactured in the country is 9/- per lb.  Snuff, not manufactured in the country, 10/3 per lb., as against 9/- in the list.  Even goods that are not manufactured here are dearer on that list than on the Trade Department list.  This Department was set up at a time when the finances of the country and the finances of the local authorities required the most careful attention.  If the Department does not serve any useful purpose, then the sooner it is scrapped the better.  It did serve a useful purpose during the time when the local finances were in a serious condition.  It got very considerable support from local authorities anxious to see low rates and to get good value.  It has succeeded in doing something for Irish manufacture.  That is the only case that is made for the Bill. If it is a bad case, or one that does not appeal to the Dáil, the sooner the Bill is dropped the better.  We hold it is a good case, but we do not hold with the publication of the prices of this Trade Department, thus giving an opportunity afterwards to the local authority, when these prices are known, to buy at the same price.  We do not stand for that.  We will stand for fair <Col N="1294" /> competition at the same time but not for competition at two different times when one party can examine the list and see the prices of the central authority. We are not standing for that, and we are not going to have it.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister make the point that that is possible under the Bill?  The Bill proposes to legalise, or make permanent, the system at present in operation, and to enlarge and make more rigid the obligation upon the local authority to purchase from the central authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>If the local authority asks for tenders at the time that the Trade Department asks for them, and the local authority can show lower prices, then the local authority ought to be the Trade Department, and the sooner it is the better for the country. Only in cases where tenders are asked for at the same time, and the local authority can show the same prices, or lower prices, than the Trade Department, will these tenders be accepted? That is a fair case.</P>

      <P>I only wanted to make a suggestion.  We recognise that this Bill is in process of becoming law.  We want, if possible, to make it a workable measure.  There are many good points in the Bill.  I am prepared to make that admission to the President.  But take the case of a local printer who is a ratepayer and who is prepared to do work for the local authority at a lesser figure than the work can be done by the central authority, plus carriage.  Is it wise to force the local authority, in that case, to purchase at a higher price from the central department than the price at which the purchase can be made locally?  The local person has a claim on the local authority, being a ratepayer. <Col N="1295" /> This is one of the points in the Bill that is causing an amount of irritation. If the suggestion I made at an earlier stage of the Bill were adopted, it would avoid that irritation.  I advised the President to get over that difficulty by attaching a schedule to the Bill.  He did not do that.  I think that is at the root of the objection to this Bill.  If the President could see his way to make some statement that would ease that particular difficulty, I think he would have gone a good way to remove the principal objection to the Bill.</P>

      <P>I understood the President, in reply to Deputy Johnson, to indicate that in the case of a local contractor, whether engaged in printing or otherwise, if he can supply the local authority with the required article at the same price as the central authority, then the auditor will not have power of surcharge over the local authority if they give the contract to the man who is employing a number of local men in industry.  That stands to reason.  Deputy Good referred to the printing industry.  If you had a printing works employing twenty or thirty men, who pay rates to the local authority, the local authority should be perfectly entitled to place the order with that firm, if it is able to do the work at the same price as the central authority. I understand that that is the position, and that in such cases the auditor will not have the right of surcharge.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy O'Connell, I move this amendment. The obvious intention is to <Col N="1298" /> abolish plural voting and proxy voting. The argument has been used that only persons interested in fisheries should have the right to elect conservators, and, no doubt, a good case can be made for that view.  In this case, the intention is to abolish the rights under the section of a person who has no interest in fisheries, except the most casual interest. He comes to Ireland once a year and he may go to one river on one occasion and may go to another river on another occasion.  The amendment also seeks to abolish the provisions which allow the collection by the fishery owner of all the votes of the licensees, which he can cast as he wishes.  I ask Deputies to bear in mind that the scale of votes contained in the Bill was provided for in 1848.  We all realise that the world has moved on regarding public authorities, and the method of electing public authorities, since that time, particularly in respect of matters such as plural voting and proxy voting.  I hope we are not going to perpetuate the system of voting for a public authority which was established in 1848, in this Bill of 1925.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Johnson states, there are two points in this amendment, one objecting to plural voting and the other to proxy voting. The strange thing about it is that the amendment would probably hit the person whom Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Johnson would like to protect. The effect of merely giving one vote to any person holding a licence would almost certainly give preference to the anglers on the board of conservators. A draught net which employs four men would be entitled to two votes where the salmon rod will only be entitled to one vote.  One can conceive a position where, if the voting was the same for the rod and net, a big number of people could be got to take out salmon licences and swamp the board to the exclusion of the drift net workers.  That is as far as plural votes are concerned, and I am strongly opposed to changing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not so much against the abolition of the proxy vote.  In the past there has been a great deal of what you might call shady work or dishonesty in regard to proxy voting.  The licences <Col N="1299" /> have been entirely collected by persons interested and have been used to get in certain persons on the board who will do certain things and are pledged almost to do so beforehand.  This Bill, in its provision for short term licences, does not entitle a person who comes in and takes a fourteen days' licence for a pound to vote on that.  That will abolish the visitors' proxy at last.  The procedure, as a rule, for the exercising by draft-net and drift-net men of their votes at elections for boards of conservators is that one man is selected by the men.  He collects the licences, comes along to wherever the voting is, and casts those votes for the person they want on the board of conservators. There is usually only one polling place in each electoral division.  Every owner of a draft-net or a drift-net licence could not afford to come to the polling.  It would be a certain amount of hardship on him.  In that respect the proxy vote is desirable, but, as I said, I am not keen on it myself.  I see it is open to abuse.  If the amendment is pressed strongly I will come in as far as abolishing the proxy vote is concerned, but I do not feel justified in differentiating between the number of votes allowed to the net and the rod.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit there is some point in the Minister's argument regarding the number of votes.  The vote is given to one person, being the person whose name is on the licence, though, as a matter of fact, the licence is held by two or a half dozen men in combination.  If in practice it becomes essential that a licence should be held by one person, and he carries a number of votes, I agree there is a point against the amendment I have moved. I agree, too, with the Minister that the objection to proxy voting is more important. I ask him if he will promise to consider the form which the amendment should take to abolish proxy voting. If he does that I am inclined to withdraw the amendment with a view to altering it in such a way as merely to abolish the proxy vote.</P>

      <P>On Section 10, I just want to raise a question.  I notice that the only disqualification is against elected members.  It is that any elected member of the Board who absents himself from the meetings shall be disqualified. I would like to know whether there is any justification in making that disqualification only apply to elected members.  One would imagine it was at least as important that if a disqualification should apply anywhere it should apply to the <i>ex-officio</i> members who did not attend.  Otherwise it may be thought that the <i>ex-officio</i> members were only going to attend when some matter concerned them.  It is no proof that they have a real interest in fisheries, but only in fisheries as it affects their own particular property. I ask the Minister if he can justify the insertion of the word &ldquo;elected.&rdquo;  That is the second word in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point in that.  I think if you put in the phrase &ldquo;any member&rdquo; it would be more desirable to abolish entirely the question of the <i>ex-officio</i> members than that they should be disqualified for nonattendance. The difficulty is to disqualify a man who has at the same time that right at law.</P>

      <P>The Deputy speaks <Col N="1301" /> of the law, but this will be the law when it becomes an Act of Parliament. We are engaged in making the law.  I want to make the law such that the person who, because of his alleged interest in fisheries through ownership, is entitled to membership of the board of conservators, if he proves by his inaction that he has no interest in the fishery over a period of six months, is as much entitled to be disqualified as a person who has been elected and fails to fulfil his duties.  If it is thought that only rights are to be considered and not duties, then Deputy Gorey may be justified in his contention.  I have always learned and tried to remember that rights involve duties and that if duties were not fulfilled then rights were forfeited.</P>

If they are not doing the duty for which they were sent there specifically by that body, they should be removed and somebody put in who will do the work. The ex-officio members can be said to represent themselves, or, at least, their own interests, and if they do not attend, it is their own look out.</P>

    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1302" /> SECTION 12.</P>
    <P>(1)  The Fisheries (Ireland) Acts, 1842 to 1909, shall be construed and have effect as if in the Schedule to the Fisheries (Ireland) Act, 1848, there had been inserted the several duties mentioned in the First Schedule to this Act in lieu of the several duties mentioned at numbers 1, 3, 4, 5 and 14 in the said Schedule to the said Fisheries (Ireland) Act, 1848, and notwithstanding anything contained in the Fisheries (Ireland) Acts, 1842 to 1909, no board of conservators shall have authority to diminish or reduce any of the said duties so mentioned in the said First Schedule to this Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  If any board of conservators shall so determine and resolve a licence for angling with a single salmon rod in their district during the limited period of fourteen days from the date of the licence may be issued and shall be obtainable on or after the 1st day of January next after such determination and resolution on payment of the licence duty of one pound.</P>
    <P>(3)  The licence duty for long lines for eels, trout, or sea trout shall be two pounds in every district in lieu of such duties for such lines as are now in force, and no board of conservators shall have authority to diminish or reduce the said licence duty of two pounds.</P>
    <P>(4)  The proviso to section 30 of the Fisheries (Ireland) Act, 1848, is hereby repealed, and in lieu thereof it is hereby enacted that no person who shall have taken out a licence for a rod for a calendar year in any district shall be entitled to angle with a rod for salmon in any other district unless and until he shall have taken out a licence for a rod in such other district, and paid the licence duty specified in that behalf in the First Schedule to this Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies I should like to call the attention of the Dáil to the effect of the amendment.  When I first examined it, I was very pleased with it, and I thought it was in agreement with an amendment of mine to the schedule. In practice, as I read it, this amendment will mean that any person resident in the district can fish for salmon without a licence at all.  That is a rather revolutionary proposition.  If it does not mean that, if it means that persons resident in the district will pay £1 on the licence, then, on the whole, although I dislike legislation by reference, I think my amendment is better than Deputy Hogan's, because it says exactly what the licence is to be.  If there is a loophole of doubt, as to whether people, even if they live in the district, have to take out a licence for salmon, then I urge the rejection of the amendment.  Some people seem to imagine that salmon come into the river as the result of chance or by the act of God.  As a matter of fact, if you dissolve every board of conservators, and cease all precautions for the preservation of fish, there would not be a salmon left in the country inside ten years.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gorey thinks that the time will be much shorter.  I always try to avoid overstating my case, as Deputies know. There would not be a salmon coming into Irish rivers that would not be killed on the spawning-beds if these efforts at preservation cease.  You must have funds if the fish are to be preserved, and a very important contribution comes from these sources.  Though I agree to the principle of Deputy Hogan's speech, I am not quite sure that I could agree to the wording in <Col N="1304" /> the amendment.  I do not think I could agree to it without opening dangerous loopholes.</P>

      <P>I am equally opposed to Deputy Hogan's amendment and to Deputy Cooper's amendment to the schedule.  I am taking it that Deputy Hogan's amendment means what he said himself.  It did not occur to me that it would possibly mean the abolition of the licence.  The whole object of the Bill is to get more finances to enable boards of conservators to attend to the rivers properly, to protect the spawning beds and the stock.  An important portion of the revenue comes from licences and the amount of revenue they get from the visiting anglers is at least so far highly negligible.  If this amendment were passed it would deprive the boards of an important part of their revenue. Further, I am entirely opposed to the idea of differentiating between tourists and the local anglers.  They are all anglers; we must remember that. Tourists do not come in with drift or snatch-nets, or anything like that.  It would be a very bad principle to say to the world: &ldquo;We are going to bleed our visitors and make a distinction as between those who come here to visit the country for angling purposes and the local anglers.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wolfe spoke a great deal in <Col N="1305" /> connection with this point on the Second Reading, and asked had we done anything to get in touch with the Tourist Development Associations in order to try to bring people here for angling purposes.  I am sure I will have the Deputy's support in opposing this amendment.  If the Tourist Development Associations, and other people are taking these steps&mdash;and I think it is desirable that people ought to come to this country for angling&mdash;I think that the Dáil should not set a lead by discouraging these people.  Certainly this amendment would have that effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with what the Minister has said just now. I think it would be very unwise to differentiate against tourists in a way that would make them think that they would be bled.  I think we are agreed that a certain amount of money must be got to carry out the work of preserving and developing our fisheries efficiently.  Whatever amount may be fixed it should be such as will enable the work to be done efficiently, and I think the amount should be the same for those who are on a visit to the country and for those who are here.  I think it would be unwise to make any distinction. Moreover, I am sure that the Minister is quite correct in what he said, that if the tourists see that there is a differentiation in any way that will make them think they are going to be bled, they will say to themselves: &ldquo;We are not going over there to be bled like that.  Let them keep their fishing to themselves.&rdquo;  That will be the idea in their minds, but it should not be the idea in our minds or in the Minister's mind.  If the hotel people waken up to their responsibilities, which is the important matter, as regards enticing people to come to the country, then I am quite sure that the results will be good.  We hope at least that the people who come here will not come merely for the purpose of economising.  We trust they will come to enjoy themselves and to spend their money.  I am sure none of them will be against paying a sufficient sum if they get good value for their money, and all that, I suggest will be to the advantage of the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's plausible argument has, I am afraid, led Deputy Wolfe astray.  This amendment does not propose to discriminate against the foreign tourists or against any other tourist.  I have re-read Deputy Hogan's amendment, and I am satisfied that it would apply equally to the Dublin man who goes to fish in Tirconaill or Kerry, to the Tirconaill man who goes to fish in Kerry, and to the Kerry man who goes to fish in Tirconaill. The principle on which the amendment is based is, that the man who lives in the locality is paying rates there.  He is spending his money there by giving employment and in other ways, and, therefore, the proposition is that he should pay a lower rate than the casual visitor who comes to fish in the district for a fortnight or three weeks.  The only people he is of benefit to are the hotel people.  I think there is a good deal more to be said for the amendment than has been said either by the Minister or by Deputy Wolfe. I think the acceptance of this amendment would help towards the preservation of salmon, because it would give the local people a greater interest in the salmon fisheries.  In that connection I do not propose to use now all the arguments which I intend to put forward in support of my own amendment dealing with salmon fishing, but I would urge the Minister to give this matter his earnest consideration.</P>

In the section as it stands, there is a discrimination made as between the man who lives in the district and is of use to it, and the <Col N="1307" /> man who merely comes there for a fortnight or three weeks to make use of the district for his own pleasure and profit.  There is surely no similarity between these two men.  The one lives in the district and is of use to it, while the other merely comes there for a fortnight or three weeks to make use of the district for his own pleasure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The case, I think, has to be emphasised that there is a large number of men who are interested in fishing as a matter of regular sport and who come a distance to utilise local opportunities.  The Minister has made the case that you must not discriminate between the person who comes from a distance and the person who lives in the locality.  I wonder will that be possible of application generally?  Are you likely to be able to ensure that your visitor is going to have all the facilities, in respect to everything, that the resident has a right to?  This brings me to a question on which I would like to have the views of the Minister and of Deputies generally. It has arisen on two or three occasions, but we have not yet had much discussion or enlightenment on it.  The question is whether, in considering this Bill, as well as the whole question of fisheries as a natural resource from the point of view of food provision, or as an industry, or whatever you like to call it, you are thinking of the preservation of the fisheries mainly as a bait to attract the tourist?  I think that is important, because it touches the difference of interest between the owner of a fishery up the river and the fisherman working for a living and catching fish down the river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather from what the Minister has said that his main thought in this Bill is to make the fisheries of the country more attractive to the tourist from a distance, whether within the country or outside it, and that he is thinking of the fisheries rather in the light of making them attractive as a holiday pleasure than as an industry for the production of food.  I think it is important that we should bear that in mind.  There is that contradiction that occasionally <Col N="1308" /> arises, and whether we are considering the industrial side of this, the sporting side of it, or the tourist development side of it, we ought to understand where we are.  It may be possible to harmonise the two interests, and I suppose the Minister's case will be that he is endeavouring to harmonise the two interests.  But in such a case, if you are harmonising the two interests, then that is an added argument in favour of this differentiation: that you are going to assist the person who is living by the fishing and that you are going to maintain him on the lower scale, and still allow the tourist to come forward and get some advantage out of the sport by paying an extra fee for the licence.</P>
    <P>If the main purpose is the encouragement of the tourist who will come fishing, then I suppose we might say that you had better reduce his fee and give him a preference.  I do not think the interests of the local men who are always on the spot and who, as Deputy Cooper pointed out, should be encouraged to take an interest in the preservation of the fisheries, ought to be treated in the same light as those of fishermen who come to a district for sport.  I think a good deal would be said, and it will be said before the Bill passes through, in favour of widening the range and the area of interested persons, so that as many people as possible will be interested in the preservation of the fisheries and will be very severe upon people who kill fish during the spawning season.  This amendment of Deputy Hogan's is in that direction. It rather tends towards widening the range of persons interested in the preservation of the fisheries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson has lately developed the habit of interpreting what I think, but he usually succeeds in misinterpreting it.  He said my main thought in the Bill was for the tourist.  I said, just before I sat down, that the main purpose of the Bill was to provide sufficient funds for the preservation of the river stock.  That is my main thought, but, at the same time, I am not going to cast aside as of no advantage the possibilities of attracting <Col N="1309" /> tourists to the country for angling.  I think that that, as such, is, or at least could be made, as much a part of the industry as any other end of the inland fisheries.  Indirectly it could be made, I suggest, a great source of revenue to the country.  I am not at all convinced by the arguments put up against this.  The local persons who take out salmon rod licences are usually as well able to pay as much as the visitors. They are sportsmen.  When you come to consider that these licence duties were fixed as far back as 1848, and that the maximum fee for a salmon rod licence was then fixed at £1, surely it cannot be thought that a licence fee of £2 is exorbitant even for local people in the year 1925.  I do not think there is anything in the argument put up by Deputy Cooper.  It does not matter whether the tourist comes from across Channel or whether he goes down from Dublin.  We should be just as anxious to encourage the Dublin angler to go to Connemara as we are to encourage the cross-Channel tourist, and I think you would be doing an unfriendly act to the hotel keepers and car owners in Connemara if you were to discourage the Dublin angler from going down there.  The whole object of the section is to provide a greater sum of money for the preservation of the fisheries.  If we are deprived of the increased licence duties from the local anglers, then you practically make the section valueless as far as the angler is concerned.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy O'Connell, I beg to move amendment 5: In sub-section (3) line 38 to delete the word &ldquo;eels.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the position is that the Fishery Boards show very little interest in the preservation of eel fishing and eel fishing is done generally by poor men and is not very profitable.  To put a licence duty of £2 upon these men is asking them to pay in effect for the preservation of the salmon fishing. It is asking them to pay something out of their poverty for the preservation of the sport of the richer classes interested in angling.  That is the whole case as I understand it.  The number <Col N="1310" /> of people affected and the class of people affected are generally the poorer elements of the population, and they think any funds they provide are certainly not going to be used for the preservation of the eel fishing and therefore, they should not be asked to provide funds for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, the only thing that matters in the sub-section is eels, and the intention is not to get funds but to prevent this particular type of eel fishing altogether.  Legislation on that matter is long overdue because immature eels are largely killed by long lines.  Eel weirs only kill mature eels.  It is not the intention of the section at all to provide money for fish preservation.  The intention might be better made known.  I am going to accept the next amendment because it is of no consequence to trout and sea trout.  Eels are the only things that matter in this section.</P>

      <P>I will explain it briefly.  The wording of the Bill might legalise the practice of fishing for trout and sea trout with long lines.  At present that practice is illegal.  You may have a line set for eels but it is not the intention.  Eel lines are set in deep water.  However, if the particular wording of the section stood as introduced it might legalise the setting of long lines in shallow water for trout and do an enormous amount of destruction amongst trout.  I am very glad the Minister has seen his way to accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That notwithstanding anything contained in section 21 of the Fisheries (Ireland) Act, 1850, and if a board of conservators of any electoral district shall so determine and resolve, no person, who does not reside or possess real property within such district, and who has not taken out a licence for a single salmon rod in such district for the calendar year then current, shall be entitled in any such year to fish with a single rod for trout within such district unless, and until, he shall have taken out a licence for a single rod in such district, and paid the licence duty of 10s. in respect thereof; and all the provisions of section 17 of the Fisheries (Ireland) Act, 1869, shall apply to such licence, and to all persons who by this section are prohibited from fishing for trout without having obtained such licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This raises a very contentious topic, and here we come to a question that was discussed partly on Second Reading, mainly the desirability of levying some duty for fishing for trout.  I am afraid I am coming into collision with one of the Minister's fixed principles, because as he told us on Second Reading that while he himself was in favour of a small duty and some charge upon the trout fishery, he was met with such an outcry from the board of conservators and the angling associations, and so on, that he withdrew it.  I attempt to meet that outcry, and so the amendment proposes to impose a licence duty only on a visitor who does not reside in the conservatory district in which he proposes to fish.  There we come again to the discussion of the principle adumbrated in Deputy Hogan's amendment. I think there is something to be said on this matter.  There was one person upon whom it would bear hardly, and that is the person who resided on the border of two fishery districts.  He is just inside the border of one, and if he wanted to go five miles to fish on the other side he would have to pay this duty.  I am not at all tied to the sum.  I am prepared to reduce it to 5s. or to 2s. 6d., and I think it is a very good thing to give the trout <Col N="1312" /> fishermen some interest in the preservation of the fish.  Some anglers come from England or other parts of the country, some come from the North to two or three lakes in the West during the May fly-fishing season.  They live there for a fortnight or three weeks. Some contribute to the preservation of the fish, some do nothing.  They lodge with farmers, and even the owners of these farmhouses in which they live do not contribute to the fund of the association. I think there is equity in the matter of asking people who come over and devote their whole time to sport for some contribution.  I do not think it is unreasonable that they should contribute to the preservation of the fish.</P>
    <P>As regards the argument about putting a tax upon persons coming from a distance, if a man can afford to take a rail journey costing £3 or £4, and if he can afford to pay for food and lodgings for three weeks, will the question of 2s. 6d. or 5s. or 10s. be of such great importance to him?  I do not think so. I believe this would be an effective means of collecting funds for the preservation of fish where voluntary means have failed, and, therefore, I move the amendment.</P>

      <P>I press the Minister to consider this amendment of Deputy Cooper.  Deputy Cooper said that the Minister for Fisheries was thinking of some such licence duty, and that he had been met by such opposition that he had to drop the proposal.  I have a document on behalf of those who spent years on the river Suir in my constituency. It is signed, and is representative not only of sportsmen, but of farmers, merchants and Government officials, and they asked to have this half-crown put on trout fishermen. They state that if this is done you will turn all those who indulge in this form of sport into conservators, and that they will help in preserving the rivers. They state that the Suir, with its tributaries, is one of the best rivers for visitors in England, Ireland, or Scotland, and that a large number of people come to Clonmel for trout fishing, and stay in the hotels and various places along the banks of the river.  It is also stated that there is scarcely any protection, <Col N="1313" /> although the Civic Guards are doing their best.  They want this money to be used for the purposes of preserving the rivers, and they state that if that is not done the poachers will practically clear the free waters of trout during the year.  They press this proposal very strongly, and hope that the Minister will consider it.  I am in favour of Deputy Cooper's amendment, but I suppose I can hardly vote for it.</P>

I think that everybody who goes in for sport should be prepared to pay a small amount for his enjoyment.  I would be in favour of a small level tax all round, and I do not think that anybody who indulges in fishing would object.  I would be glad if the Minister would favourably consider this amendment. He, of course, has more information on this subject than we have, but, so far as I can see from my experience, I do not think that there would be any great objection to the imposition of a small tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of this matter which, I think, has been lost sight of.  Visiting fishermen do not fish for trout.  Our local fishermen, especially youngsters, in the months of April and May, when fishing, are not killing trout but are killing salmon-fry wholesale.  Nobody on the river has authority to tell them to stop.  If you speak to them they will tell you that they have as much right to be there as <Col N="1314" /> you have.  Anybody who knows the rivers and who knows what April and May fishing means, knows that thousands of pounds worth of fish have been destroyed by young boys, and perhaps by old ones too, through the indiscriminate use of rod and line in these particular months, as well as certain flies to which the fish rise.  I think that there ought to be an all round licence. I would almost go so far as to say that fishing on certain stretches of river, especially dead water near rapids, ought to be forbidden.  I admit that on certain stretches of rivers you cannot keep the fish off the flies.  The destruction done in shoal waters at certain stages of a current is enormous.  Major Cooper and other fishermen know, I think, what I am talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy D'Alton was not quite in line with Deputy Cooper. He, with Deputy Gorey and Deputy Wolfe, advocated an all round licence. That question was before the Advisory Committee and&mdash;Deputy Gorey knows, as far as I remember, the arguments put up there&mdash;the unanimous decision of the Committee was against such licences. The great argument against it was that it would deprive youngsters of their sport.  In the Firearms Bill today, an amendment was put in at Deputy Gorey's request reducing the age of the possessor of a licence from 18 to 15 years, because unless a person gets trained with a gun at the age of 15 he will not turn out a great cracksman. The same thing applies to the young angler.  A boy fishing with a trout rod to-day becomes a salmon fisherman tomorrow. The Committee, after considering the pros and cons of the case, decided that a licence for trout fishing was not advisable, and I accept that decision.  The differentiation between visitors and local people is, I think, bad.  The same arguments prevail in regard to amendment 4, concerning visiting anglers.  So far as getting money for the preservation of rivers, such as the Suir, is concerned, the Bill provides for increased finance for boards of conservators, and it will be their duty to provide protection for the fisheries of which Deputy D'Alton has <Col N="1315" /> spoken, as well as for other fisheries in their district.  The Bill gives my Department more power of supervision than we have at present, and it will enable us to see that these boards look after all the fisheries in their district and, if they do not, the Bill gives us power to scrap them.</P>

      <P>I had hoped the Minister would have given me some undertaking to reconsider this matter before the Report Stage, in view of the fact that every voice raised in the Dáil has been raised in favour of the principle of a small licence duty for trout fishing.  I am not tied to the exact figure, or tied to the principle of taxing an outsider or a local man, but I am tied to the principle of a small licence duty for the preservation of trout.  The Minister will not meet me on that.  He quotes the Advisory Committee.  I have great respect for that Committee. One member of it has spoken in partial support of my amendment, and another member has his name attached to the amendment.  Then we are told the Advisory Committee is unanimous.  I do not recognise the right of the Advisory Committee to override the Dáil.  They are a body for whom I have great respect, and the Minister has constituted it fairly, but I cannot accept what the Minister says, that the amendment could not be accepted because the Advisory Committee are not in favour of it.</P>

What I am concerned with is the destruction of fry, and not even an attempt has been made to deal with that evil.  I do not know how it is going to be done.  No matter what grant the Minister makes to the board of conservators I have no faith that they will be able to carry out the law. I believe that a board of conservators with two or three bailiffs on the stretch of a river and its tributaries in the district cannot do it.</P>

We should endeavour to prevent this reckless and wholesale destruction of fish in season and out of season, which is due largely, as Deputy Gorey said, to youngsters.  I think you would have some check on them if you had a small licence.  I do not care how minute you make the licence.  If you catch a youngster or an older person offending you can refuse them a licence next year, and that will be a kind of penalty.</P>

The people in the area around about have been accustomed to fish freely in that lake for hundreds of years.  How are you going to collect licences for trout rods on a lake like that?  If you impose a licence on everyone who fishes there you would want a large staff of bailiffs, and the people will resent it, as they have enjoyed the freedom to fish in that lake so long.  Deputy Gorey has pointed out that those who fish for trout afterwards do harm in regard to salmon.  That does not apply to Lough Mask, where there are no salmon and, <Col N="1317" /> therefore, the arguments in favour of the amendment do not apply to Lough Mask.  If the amendment were accepted, and no exception made as regards places like Lough Mask, harm would be done.</P>

    <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 12, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 13.</P>
    <P>(1)  Every board of conservators is hereby empowered on or before the 31st day of December in every fishery year to which this section applies to strike a rate on all fisheries within their district rated for the relief of the poor or which but for the exemption conferred by this section would be so rated of such amount per cent. as with the estimated amount of their other income will be sufficient to meet the estimated amount of their expenditure for that fishery year.</P>
    <P>(2)  Every rate struck by a board of conservators under this section shall be subject to confirmation by the Minister who may confirm the same either without modification or with such modification (whether by way of increase or reduction) as he shall think proper.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every rate struck by a board of conservators under this section and confirmed (with or without modification) by the Minister shall <Col N="1319" /> be duly levied, collected, and recovered by the board in the manner and with the powers provided by the Fisheries (Ireland) Acts, 1842 to 1909, in respect of rates leviable under those Acts.</P>
    <P>(4)  If a board of conservators shall fail to strike on or before the 31st day of December in any fishery year to which this section applies a rate for that fishery year the Minister may, if he thinks fit so to do, on or before the 28th day of February in that fishery year strike a rate for the district of such board of conservators for such fishery year and in such case the rate so struck by the Minister shall be levied, collected, and recovered by such board of conservators in like manner in all respects as if such rate had been struck by the board and confirmed by the Minister under this section.</P>
    <P>(5)  Every rate made under this section and every rate struck by the Minister under this section shall be paid by the several persons rated for the same in two moieties on the 1st day of April and the 1st day of September in the fishery year for which the rate is struck, and shall be so paid over and above all or any licence duties paid by such persons under the Fisheries (Ireland) Acts, 1842 to 1909, or this Act for that or any other fishery year.</P>
    <P>(6)  Every person who is liable to be rated under the Fisheries (Ireland) Acts, 1842 to 1909 as amended by this Act in respect of a fishery shall be exempt from liability for any rate leviable by the council of any county, county borough, or urban district, or the commissioners of any town, in respect of that fishery for the local financial year commencing on the first day of April next after the commencement of this Part of this Act or for any of the nine next succeeding local financial years, and no such council or commissioners shall levy or collect any rate in respect of any such fishery for any of the said local financial years.</P>
    <P>(7)  If the Minister for Local Government and Public Health shall certify that by reason of the exemption <Col N="1320" /> conferred by this section from liability for rates in respect of fisheries, the amount of the rate which but for this sub-section would require to be made and levied upon and in any area for the service of a local financial year ending within ten years after the 1st day of April next following the commencement of this Part of this Act by the council of a county, county borough, or urban district, or the commissioners of a town has been increased by an amount greater than one penny in the pound, the Minister for Fisheries shall out of moneys to be from time to time provided by the Oireachtas pay to such council or commissioners before the end of such local financial year an amount equal to the sum which would be produced by a rate upon and in such area equivalent to the amount in the pound by which such increase exceeds one penny in the pound.</P>
    <P>(8)  The several provisions in relation to rating contained in the Fisheries (Ireland) Acts, 1842 to 1909, so far as the same are inconsistent with the provisions of this section shall not have effect during any fishery year to which this section applies, but save to that extent the said provisions shall apply to the rates leviable under this section in like manner as they apply to the rates heretofore leviable under the said Acts.</P>

Several sections in the Bill give very effective Departmental control over the actions of the boards and effective supervision by the central Department over their expenditure.  As far as I can see, the amendment is unnecessary. The rate that the boards strike is subject to supervision by the Minister for the time being.  He may add to that rate or lower it, if he thinks fit.  He satisfies himself as to the amount necessary for the protection of the fisheries in the district.  If they refuse to strike a rate, he has power to strike one, but in either modifying or striking a rate he must advert to the possibilities of raising revenue.  From the general tenour of the Bill and the amount of control given to the central department, I think the amendment is unnecessary.</P>

      <P>As I construe the amendment, I think it differs from the information that the Minister has given.  Deputy Hogan wishes that the rates applied to the preservation of inland waters shall be applied to all fisheries, not to special fisheries.  The section already provides that, but if my reading is correct it is only a matter <Col N="1322" /> of wording, and I see no reason why the Minister should not add the words &ldquo;for the proper preservation of all the fisheries within their district.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not think it is sufficient to say that because the Minister retains power over the boards we may be quite sure that trout fishing, for instance, is going to be preserved.  The Minister who may be in charge of the Department might have views in regard to salmon fisheries which coincide with the views, say, of the owners of salmon fisheries, and as he has no law to be guided by, he can exercise his discretion. The object of the amendment, which is most desirable in view of all that has been said about the various kinds of fisheries, is to ensure that the boards will realise that it is their duty to look after all fisheries&mdash;not merely salmon fisheries.  Unless there is something in the original Act imposing on the boards a definite duty in respect to other fisheries, there is nothing as far as I can find in the Bill to define their duties in respect to other fisheries. Most of the references are to salmon fisheries.  One can imagine that some boards at any rate will think only of salmon fisheries.  It is undoubtedly a complaint made in many parts of the country against the boards that in the past they have only thought of anglers and salmon fisheries.  As far as I can gather, the criticism made is that they have failed to consider trout, or the claims of fishermen on other parts of the river, and thought only of anglers for salmon.  The object of the amendment, however faulty it may be in effectiveness, is to impose an obligation on the boards when spending money that they shall spend it for the preservation of all the fisheries and not confine it to salmon fisheries.  If the Minister can assure the Dáil that the obligation in the establishment of the boards is to conserve all the fisheries, I admit there is not very much point in the amendment, but, failing that, I think there is very definite need to define their obligation so that that obligation should be in respect to all fisheries as well as salmon fisheries.</P>

      <P>The unfortunate position <Col N="1323" /> with regard to this amendment is that occasion was not taken on Deputy Cooper's amendment to vote for it.  Had that been done, and if those interested in every class of fishing had to pay some small sum into a common fund, the position would be that every fishery could rightly and justly claim protection.</P>

      <P>Partly.  He did not go as far as I wished.  Here you have a fund subscribed by the owners of salmon and eel fisheries.  Those interested in salmon will bear a much larger valuation, as there is no such thing as a valuation on trout fishing. All the money goes into a common fund, and those interested expect that it will be spent for their benefit. Trout have always been neglected, and no protection has been given them.  On the flats in our rivers and streams netting goes on night after night.  Three and four visits are paid weekly to the flats of the rivers&mdash;that is, where the water is about three feet in depth&mdash; and nets used.  I have seen people passing my place at least four times weekly going to a stretch on the King's river. In future I hope some attention will be paid to such places by the authorities. If there was a common fund into which those interested would pay in proportion to their interests in fishing, I think it would be much more satisfactory. Here you have people who subscribe money, and on the other hand people who subscribe nothing demanding equal protection.  That is a position that is not met.  In future I hope the Minister will insist on every class of fishing getting the same protection. The trout fisheries of this country are more important than the salmon fisheries.  The salmon is generally for export, while the trout are for home consumption.  We have very little trout, because they are not protected. Even in Dublin it is quite common to see heaps of little trout on the marble slabs in the fish shops.  It would take a dozen of these fish to weigh a pound. That is the result of netting, the rivers being cleared up and the small trout <Col N="1324" /> killed right through the season.  That is a shame, but in all our towns these little trout are sold for a few pence, and the authorities allow them to be offered for sale.</P>

      <P>I do not think that this amendment makes the matter any more specific.  For Deputy Johnson's information, I may say that the law is specific.  There is no alteration by this Bill in the existing duties that are imposed on boards of conservators.  It is their duty to protect not only salmon, but trout and eel and other fish.  It is the duty of the Department to see that the expenditure of the Board of Conservators is devoted to the conserving of fisheries in general. It does not matter really what the views of a particular Minister for the time being may be&mdash;whether they are more inclined towards the salmon owners or towards trout preservation&mdash; the duty remains on the Department to preserve all fish.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;To delete sub-sections (6), (7) and (8) of section 13.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The section as at present drafted takes away a certain amount of revenue from the local authorities.  In view of the fact that strong representations have been made by the local ratepayers and by the Minister for Local Government to have the rates reduced, I think it is an injudicious thing for the Minister to have this section included in the Bill.  If the local authorities lose this revenue, which in some cases would, I expect, amount to over one penny in the pound, or from £1,500 to £2,000, this would mean an added burden to the ratepayers.  I think it is the national Government that ought to provide the money for the development of fisheries.  I formally move this amendment.</P>

If there is any great rateable value put on the fisheries in the Slaney, I am rather surprised.  The amount, <Col N="1325" /> as I say, is small, but it is an amount that would be of great benefit to the local boards of conservators, though it would be of very little use to the county rates.  I have not the figures, but I think the Minister can give them. I am sorry I have not the figures, but if the Minister has them I am sure it would relieve Deputy Corish's mind considerably to hear them.</P>

It is rather that they should pay a fishery rate and a local rate as well.  I am perfectly satisfied that the fisheries could not stand it.  As I said, it is anticipated that the rates under this provision <Col N="1326" /> will be at least as high as the local rates, and it would be well to state that those persons who own private fisheries are not exempt from the rates on their other property.

The Minister for Local Government, in the course of conversations, agreed that for a period of ten years the rate on local valued fisheries should be diverted towards fishery preservation instead of going into the hands of the local authority. It is not a case of striking a fishery rate for one year and relieving them of local rates for ten years.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 11, which is down in my name and the name of Deputy Myles:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (3) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any licence to take or kill fish held by any person who shall have been convicted of an offence under this section shall be forfeited, and no other licence to take or kill fish by any means whatever shall be issued to such person during the calendar year in which such conviction shall have been made.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not an amendment to which I attach any great importance.  It imposes an additional penalty on a person who is found guilty of selling salmon without a licence.  In addition to the penalty already prescribed in the section, his licence shall be forfeited as regards the taking or killing of fish.  It would seem to me desirable that, in addition to the licence to sell, the licence to catch fish should be forfeited in such a case.  It is possible that a man who has forfeited his licence to sell might say: &ldquo;I caught these for myself&rdquo; when, as a matter of fact, he had the intention of selling them.  The amendment is open to the objection, which probably Deputy Johnson will make, that it prescribes two penalties for the one offence.  Against that, I would point out that it is desirable to close every loophole for the sale of poached fish.  If there was nobody to sell the fish there would be no poaching. The amount of poaching done by a man who wants to get a salmon to eat is infinitesimal.  It is desirable, I <Col N="1328" /> think, to make these penalties as severe as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this amendment. The Deputy himself has stated my principal objection: that it is imposing two penalties for the same offence.  Furthermore, there is really no precedent in our Fishery Acts for such a penalty.  I admit that there is a loophole, but I do not think that this would be the proper way to stop it.  We must only hope, by more supervision, to get after these offenders, rather than deal with them in this way.  There are many worse offences for which there is no such penalty.</P>

      <P>The decision has been arrived at that no licence is required by men fishing for brown trout.  There is a large number of men earning their livelihood by fishing for brown trout.

We come to a matter, not of sport but of trade and of livelihood, when we deal with the question of the agent of lawful fishermen selling fish lawfully or marketing fish caught under the law.  Any objection to that proposition seems to me to be hitting directly at the livelihood of a large number of men.  I am working in this case on material prepared by Deputy O'Connell.  I am not aware of the local circumstances, but I gather that the position is somewhat like this: there is a considerable number of men who fish and capture brown trout.  They sell those trout for a livelihood and they arrange with one of their number to do the selling on their behalf.  Under this section it appears that that fisherman would be liable to a penalty. Therefore, those fishermen who hitherto appointed one of their number to act as their selling agent will each have to go and do his own selling.  To say the least of it, that is most uneconomic and will materially affect the livelihood of a considerable number of men.</P>

      <P>I want to call the Minister's attention to the danger that I think exists under this section.  I refer to sub-section 3, which states that the section shall not apply to a licensed fisherman selling fish of his own capture. I take it that it is a fisherman who has a licence to fish with the rod, not a licensed dealer.  The profits of poaching are such that it would be well worth while for a poacher to take out a licence, or even half a dozen, in different districts, and place his fish on the market and state they are the result of hauls through the rod.  It would be difficult to prove that the fish were not his own capture.  Throughout history it has been hard to prove that fish are your own capture.  Many people go out fishing and come home with tales of capture that, to say the least of it, are <Col N="1331" /> not strictly veracious.  They cannot be proved.  I am afraid that difficulty would arise here.  I ask the Minister, before the Committee Stage, to see if he could not impose some penalty.  At present no penalty is imposed on a licensed fisherman who sells fish, not of his own capture, except a fine.  He does not forfeit his licence.  I know that is a danger.  In one or two districts in Tirconaill it is looked upon as a considerable danger, and it is the one weak spot I really see in the Bill, in spite of my numerous amendments.  It is the one loophole through which the poacher can get rid of poached fish.  I hope the Minister will see if he can strengthen this without depriving a fisherman of the right which I think he enjoys.</P>

      <P>On the second reading stage I called attention to the insertion of the words &ldquo;and every member of a board of conservators.&rdquo; That is in respect of the powers given to policemen, guards, officers and servants of the boards.  As the Bill stands, all the powers of search, confiscation and the like are given to officers of the board, to guards, and also to every member of the board of conservators.  I think the Minister admitted that there was a doubt as to the wisdom of that and so I have put down the amendment.  I think it will be seen that to endow such members with power to follow fish to any part of the country, to open up cases and generally to interfere is likely to lead to trouble both for the members and the public. I think we should not give them that power or impose an obligation which implies that power.</P>

    <P>Before sub-section 6 to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All monies realised by the sale of any fish sold under the provisions of this section shall be paid to the clerk of the board of conservators of the electoral district within which such fish were detained, and shall be applied by him in such manner as the District Justice for the district in which such fish were detained shall direct, and such District Justice may, if he thinks fit, direct that all, or any part of such monies shall be paid to such board of conservators, and such board shall be entitled to apply all, or any part of, the said monies when paid to them towards the payment of any expenses incurred by them in respect of such detention or sale.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amendments 14, 15 and 18 all deal with the same issue, and I will take all three now.  They seek to make it possible for a peace commissioner to authorise the sale of fish that is being seized. Under the Bill as it stands, at present the only thing a peace commissioner can do is to authorise the destruction of the fish seized.  These amendments authorise him to sell it, because the case may well arise that fish will be seized in a district where it is known that the District Court will not be held for a week or possibly 10 days.  The fish will not keep fresh for that length of time, and as a result the peace commissioner would have to have them destroyed.  That, of course, would be a waste of good food.</P>
    <P>It has another advantage, namely, the selling provides for redress in the case where a mistake has been made. In the event of the fish having been seized, and afterwards it being found that they were properly caught and were the property of the person holding them, the District Justice could make an order that the proceeds be paid over to such a person.  I do not press this strongly, but the Minister should take it into consideration himself. Compulsory destruction of good food is not a desirable thing.  It demoralises people to see pounds and pounds of salmon burned and otherwise <Col N="1337" /> destroyed.  It does not create the proper state of mind with regard to fish as a national asset.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I also urge this on the Minister.  This provision to destroy fish is a farce.  We always knew that in fact the fish would never be destroyed if they were sound fish.  I can inform the Minister that fish caught in nets were given as presents.  Talking of destroying here is only a sham.  It is a shame to destroy fish.  They should be taken charge of and sent to the best market.  It is a crime to destroy good fish.  Once they are out of the river and dead, the best use should be made of them, and they should be sent to the best market.  Fish is not a thing that can be kept for days.  The provision here is only so much waste of language, and should not be in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not accept this amendment.  I agree with any proposal which would suggest that the fish, if it is good, should be disposed of to some public institution freely, rather than destroyed, or even distributed, as Deputy Gorey said it is in fact distributed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to ask who is to get it.  I agree that it is unwise and wrong to destroy fish which is good food, but I think that the difference between that and making the sale of fish a source of revenue to the board is putting too great a temptation in the hands of the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The peace commissioner has a certain authority in this matter.  The peace commissioner has to decide certain things, and may decide these things on a report made to him by the person who has taken the fish into custody, and the responsibility for doing that unfairly is nil.  Any board which desires to increase its finance might well adopt this plan of increasing its revenue&mdash;capturing fish, taking it, running no risk in taking it, selling it, and so making a good thing out of it. I think the proposal is a bad one, and <Col N="1338" /> would introduce into this class of legislation a principle that would lead us far astray.  It is asking an authority to seize fish for the purpose of supplementing and increasing its monetary reserves.  I hope the Minister will not accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to press the point that Deputy Cooper brought forward. I think it is most important. I would not agree that fish seized in this way should be distributed.  I maintain that it should be sold because the dealers' register would be able to show where that fish had come from.  If it is distributed, in the case of fish that is procured by night-fishing and by other illegal methods, people will be able to say that this was fish that had been seized.  In ordinary circumstances that would be destroyed, but now it is suggested that it should not be destroyed, but ought to be given to some institution.  I certainly agree that it should not be destroyed, but it should be sold.  It would then appear on the dealers' register.  That is the most important point, as otherwise people who evade the law, who fish at night, and who are liable for prosecution, would simply state that they had sent the fish to certain institutions, whereas they had been paid for it, perhaps.  I press that point on the Minister, that the fish, instead of being destroyed, should be sold, and it would then appear on the dealers' register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Dáil that not one penny of the money derived from the sale of the fish would go to the board of conservators except by direction of the District Justice.  The District Justice is not connected with the board of conservators and he would not be likely to grant a penny of money more to the board than he considered they were entitled to.  If it would meet Deputy Johnson's objection I would be quite prepared, if the Minister would accept the principle of sale, to have a provision inserted directing that any money derived from the sale should go to the Ministry of Fisheries as an Appropriation in Aid.  I am quite prepared to agree to that.  The principle I want to establish is that there should not be an <Col N="1339" /> unnecessary destruction of fish, and if you accept the principle of sale you must accept some tribunal for deciding how the money is to be disposed of. Deputy Johnson, I am sure, would object very keenly if I suggested to leave the money to the board of conservators. I tried to suggest the best arrangement possible and the amendment I put forward is, I think, the most reasonable way of dealing with the matter.</P>

      <P>I am rather inclined to favour the principle of this amendment as I said, and I am still rather inclined to favour it from certain aspects, but I think there will be considerable difficulty about providing for this sale of the fish.  For instance, fish caught in the close season, or for some other reason, may be considered unsaleable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I direct the Minister's attention to the suggestion made by Deputy Cooper that the proceeds of the sale might go to the Ministry and not to a particular board of conservators?  In that case my objection would be largely removed.  What I feel about it is that under these very extensive powers you would be giving an invitation to the board to add to their resources by interfering unnecessarily <Col N="1340" /> with captures because they are more or less indemnified against any responsibility unless the injured party can show malice.  Where the board is not obtaining any direct advantage from the sale that temptation will not arise and consequently my chief objection will not hold.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (4), page 11, line 37, after the words &ldquo;by such person&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or observed by such Peace Commissioner or by any person whom he may request to assist him for the purpose.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it is not right to leave the peace commissioner any option to accepting the word of the officer, whoever he may be, in respect of the peculiarities or marks or distinctive qualities of the fish.  If he knows anything about fish himself, or can find somebody who knows something about it, then he shall have the right to satisfy himself without relying solely on the word of the prosecutor.  I think the principle is easily understood, and should be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has not read the section correctly.  I consider the amendment unnecessary.  The position is, that the peace commissioner is to describe the fish, and he may put in whatever, in his discretion, he thinks right.  There is nothing to prevent him from consulting anyone he thinks fit. The point is, that if he omits any descriptive particular which the person who presents the fish to him considers essential, the latter is entitled to ask that that should be put in.  That is the whole point in the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>As I read the sub-section it rather suggests that the peace commissioner is to have his opinion formed for him by the person who is describing the fish.  Sub-section 4 reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Peace Commissioner to whom <Col N="1341" /> any fish is produced in pursuance of this section shall, if he is of opinion that the fish ought in the circumstances to be destroyed, give to the person producing the fish a certificate in writing describing the fish, and any marks, peculiarities or other particulars thereof pointed out to him by such person, and authorising such person to destroy the fish, which certificate shall be conclusive evidence in every court of all such matters or facts as aforesaid stated therein.</P>
    <P>The peace commissioner is to be satisfied before he will give the certificate. The suggestion in the sub-section is, that the person who is going to give evidence of the necessity that this fish should be described is the prosecutor&mdash; the officer of the board.  I want to suggest in the amendment that the peace commissioner shall be entitled to call in other expert evidence as to whether such fish ought to be destroyed or not.  On re-reading the sub-section I think I can see the Minister's view more clearly, and that I am wrong.  I, therefore, ask for leave to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">

      <P>Before the section is put, there is what appears to me to be a great omission: the question of the inspection and examination of fish poached in the close season.  We know that extensive poaching of fish goes on in the close season.  The fish may be in the houses of people in the country, and may be salted in barrels.  That is a common practice in some parts of the country.  The fish may have been speared in the rivers during the night, and of course would not have passed through the hands of licensed dealers at all.  I do not think that this matter is covered by <i>(b)</i> of section 1, nor do I think it is covered by this section at all.  During the close season, fish taken in such circumstances may be kept for <Col N="1342" /> consumption in farmers' houses as well as in other houses, and there ought to be, I think, a provision to make a search and an inspection.  As far as I know, there is no provision to do that at the present time, and some such provision ought to be introduced.  Everyone knows that the greatest crimes are committed during the close season. There ought to be provision whereby power will be given to search and enter houses where there are reasonable grounds for believing that fish is being kept on the premises for one reason or another.  There may be fresh fish in some of these houses, and in others it may have been put into pickle.  I do not know whether there are any Deputies who are aware of the fact that such a practice is carried on.</P>

      <P>I want the Minister to take precautions against this evil and to have a specific sub-section to deal with it, because I say it is the greatest evil of the lot.  The absence of such a sub-section would be a great blemish on the Bill, the object of which is to preserve fish.  It is at this particular season of the year that a great amount of fish is destroyed because people destroy the spawning beds.  The Bill in different sections deals with the preservation of fish in the open season.  I want specific powers given to the officer of the Board and the Gárda Síochána, or other officers, to go in, at any time, into the house of anybody who is believed to have fish that was caught in the close season.</P>

      <P>I support what Deputy Gorey has said.  I am greatly surprised if there is not law already for dealing with that class of poaching.  In Lough Mask the most serious kind of poaching is done in the close season in the three winter months.  They do what Deputy Gorey has described.  They get the fish in large quantities and salt them in barrels.  That is a very serious injury to the fishing in the Lough.  I would be greatly surprised if the law is not there already prohibiting a crime like that, and that it is only weakness of the bailiffs that prevents the law from being carried out.</P>

      <P>I am aware that what Deputy Gorey has said applies to other parts of the country.  Fish are netted in the close season and are pickled in that season and are kept in the farmers' houses.  Would there not be a possibility of the Minister being able to ascertain what powers are at his disposal to trace out fish netted in the close season and pickled by parties and retained in their houses for sale or distribution among their friends?  They certainly should be prosecuted.</P>

      <P>Sometimes the fish is taken, as Deputy D'Alton has said, by net and taken perhaps by fishermen and kept in their houses or sold to farmers. In addition, the farmers go out at night with torches and spear salmon in the spawning beds.  Salmon are also taken with nets, and I have seen them sold, but they are speared in the upper regions of the river, which is not possible in the lower regions, where nets are used.  In the upper reaches they come along with torches and the fish are speared and killed wholesale, and by destroying the spawn thousands and millions of fish are lost.  Not alone do fishermen do this and sell the salmon, but farmers do it also.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 27.</P>
      <P>(1)  On and after the commencement of this Part of this Act the several powers of making bye-laws, definitions, rules, regulations, and orders conferred on or exercisable by the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland by virtue of the Fisheries (Ireland) Acts, 1842 to 1909, shall be transferred to, vested in, and exercisable by the Minister and shall cease to be exercisable by the Department aforesaid, and any appeal from the making of any such bye-laws, definitions, rules, regulations, or orders to the Lord Lieutenant in council shall likewise cease to exist.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every bye-law, definition, rule, regulation, and order made by the Minister under this section shall, come into operation on the day specified in that behalf therein, and if no such day is specified shall come into operation on the 28th day after the day on which the same is made.</P>
      <P>(3)  Every bye-law, definition, rule, regulation, and order made by the Minister under this section shall, as soon as may be after the same is made, be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in one or more newspapers circulating in the district affected thereby, and a copy of every such bye-law, definition, rule, regulation, and order shall within one month after the same comes into operation be deposited with the Clerk of the Peace for every county which or any part of which is affected thereby, and with the District Court Clerk of every Court District which or any part of which is affected thereby, and in every station of the Gárda Síochána within the area affected thereby.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 2, after the words &ldquo;this section shall&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;subject to the appeal hereinafter mentioned.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>With the leave of the Dáil I shall also move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (3) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any person who may consider himself aggrieved by the making of or by the refusal of the Minister to make any such bye-law, definition, rule, regulation, or order, may within fourteen days from the date of the publication thereof in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> or, in the case of a refusal to make same from the date of such refusal, appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal against such making or refusal as the case may be, and the Rules of Court applicable to appeals from the High Court of Justice to the Supreme Court in civil cases (save as to the time limited for such appeals) shall, so far as is practicable apply to any appeal under this sub-section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention of these amendments is to give a right of appeal from the refusal of the Minister to make a bye-law. Under the old law there was such appeal.  It was possible for anybody aggrieved by the action of the Vice-President of the Department, who then occupied the post now held by the Minister for Fisheries, to appeal to the Lord Lieutenant in Council. Since the Treaty that appeal has lapsed, and no appeal has been substituted. So far as I can discover, the mind of those interested in fisheries, and particularly the mind of conservators, would be that so long as the present Minister is Minister for Fisheries that right of appeal will probably never be exercised.  Great confidence is felt in the Minister's fairness and in the fairness with which his Department is conducting fisheries.  He may not, however, be Minister for ever, and, therefore, it is desirable to make some provision by which any person aggrieved by a new bye-law, or by the failure to make a bye-law when a strong case is made, would be in a position <Col N="1346" /> to appeal.  I had some doubt as to the necessary tribunal to which to appeal.  I thought of an appeal to the Minister's advisory committee, but that is not a statutory body and it is necessary that the tribunal should be a body recognised by statute.  I therefore decided to put in the Supreme Court of Appeal.  They will decide the matter not as a question of law but on its merits, and the fact that one must appeal to the Supreme Court is in itself, I think, a safeguard against frivolous appeals.  I presume one would not go to the Supreme Court without engaging eminent counsel and paying heavy costs.  I do not attach enormous importance to the tribunal to which the appeal is to be carried, but I think, on general principles, it is desirable that the Minister should not have the last word.  There should be a possibility of appealing to a permanent, impartial, non-political body over the head of the Minister for the time being.  This is not an assertion of a new right, but a reassertion of an old right, and as such I commend it to the Minister and the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the principle of these amendments, but between this and the Report Stage I will want to consult with the Minister for Justice to know whether the Supreme Court would be available for such purpose. There is a point in it, however, which I do not think I could accept.  I believe it would be unreasonable to provide, for instance, for an appeal against refusal to make bye-laws, as in that case the <i>status quo</i> would not be disturbed, and nobody could say that he is aggrieved, or at least more aggrieved than he had been for years past.  I agree, however, where we make a bye law a person may be said to have a grievance, and I feel it is essential that there should be a right of appeal.  I shall consult the Minister for Justice and bring in something to meet the Deputy from that point of view.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Every offence under any section <Col N="1348" /> of the Fisheries Act, 1924, or of this Act may be prosecuted by or at the suit of the Minister or of any board of conservators as prosecutor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I move to delete sub-section (1).  It seems to me to unduly limit the existing law.  The law at present is that any person may prosecute in a fishery case.  It seems to me that if sub-section (1) becomes law only the Minister or the board of conservators may prosecute.  I may be wrong, and I hope I am wrong, but if I am not it seems to me that this is legislation in the wrong direction. What we have been trying to do all through this Bill is to create public opinion against poaching, to make the people feel that poaching is as much a crime as burglary, and that it is the duty of the ordinary citizen to stop poaching, whether he is a member of the board of conservators or anybody else.  If you limit the right of prosecution to the Minister or the board of conservators, you tend rather to enfeeble that civic conscience we are trying to create.  In times past prosecutions had been taken frequently by one individual, who had not the <i>locus standi</i> of the board of conservators or the Minister.  I think it might be found desirable to do something of the same kind in future, so that a water bailiff might bring a prosecution, or even a private individual.  I suggest that there is no great advantage in this sub-section, and that there is a danger of its limiting the power of prosecution unduly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the Deputy's amendment.  The Westmeath Fishery Preservation Society during the season offered a reward of £5 to any person who would bring a prosecution against a poacher of fish.  The result of making this offer was that it practically prevented poaching during the past season.  They have increased that reward, and if under this section no person outside the authorities will be able to prosecute, it would encourage poaching rather than otherwise.  I ask the Minister, if possible, to provide that persons who voluntarily give evidence will be in a position to earn that reward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, the sub-section does not do that at all. This sub-section is necessary because of the provisions of Section 9 of the Criminal Justice (Administration) Act, 1924, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  All criminal charges prosecuted upon indictment in any court shall be prosecuted at the suit of the Attorney-General of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>(2)  Save where a criminal prosecution in a court of summary jurisdiction is prosecuted by a Minister, Department of State, or persons (official or unofficial) authorised in that behalf, by the law, for the time being in force, all prosecutions in any court of summary jurisdiction shall be prosecuted at the suit of the Attorney-General of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>The statute which conferred the right does not apply either to this Bill or to the Fishery Act of 1924, and in consequence of that section this sub-section is necessary.  If it is desired to widen the power given in order to enable officers of the boards of conservators or any other aggrieved persons to prosecute it will have to be done by adding to the sub-section.  I would be prepared to consider something like this:&mdash;&ldquo;Prosecuted by or at the suit of the Minister or of any board of conservators or any officer thereof, or any aggrieved person as prosecutor.&rdquo;  I think that is the point in the amendment and that is how it will have to be achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should be out of order if I asked the Minister whether he had taken the Attorney-General's opinion on the legal point, but I can assure him that I am supported by counsel's opinion that the effect of this sub-section would be to repeal the right given by 5 and 6 Victoria, cap. 106&mdash;that, I take it, is the Act of 1840 or 1841&mdash;that that would repeal the right that any person might prosecute.  That right exists under this early Act and counsel's opinion, as far as the Association of Conservators has been able to consult it, holds that that would be the effect of the sub-section. <Col N="1350" /> If the Minister prefers me to put it by way of addition I will try to do so before the Report Stage, but the formula he suggests, &ldquo;any aggrieved person,&rdquo; would not be acceptable, unless it is recognised that the public generally may be aggrieved by poaching&mdash;that poaching is an offence against the interests of the public as a whole, and that a person who wishes to stop poaching, even though his own particular interest is not affected, has a right to bring a prosecution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In No. 1, before (b) to insert the words: &ldquo;Single salmon rod for one calendar year where the applicant is registered as a Dáil elector in a constituency within the district for which the licence is issued, £1 0s. 0d.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here again we raise the contentious matter raised in a slightly different form by Deputy P. Hogan, this afternoon; the question whether we shall give the local man the right to fish for salmon at a cheaper rate than those who come into the district from a distance, whether it be from across Channel or from other parts of the Saorstát. I put down this amendment partly at the instance of the Association of Conservators of Fisheries and partly because I was asked to do so by the Anglers' Association, and I gather that the principle also has the support of Labour Deputies.  That is a volume of opinion that ought to carry some weight.  It comprises practically every interest engaged in rod fishing.  But I put it down mainly because of the request of the Anglers' Association. This association to which I refer contains seventy members.  Most of them are clerks, men engaged in shops, and people of that kind&mdash;people to whom £2 is of very considerable value, but they are keen fishermen.  In the past I think some of them probably fished illegally, but they want to fish legally, and the owners of fisheries in the Sligo <Col N="1352" /> district have feen facilitating them in this way, because I and other owners have given them one or two days a week, or whatever we could, free fishing for salmon.  But it very often happens that this day in the week does not bring the man, say, who gets two days in the year&mdash;one of these days may be in May, and the other in September&mdash; under the fortnightly licence provision. That man, therefore, out of his comparatively limited means, has to pay £2 licence fee.</P>
    <P>I humbly suggest to the Minister that if this increased duty is enforced on a man of that type the result will be, not that he will pay £2 duty, but that he will pay no duty at all, and fish illegally. That is what we have been trying to prevent.  The fishery owners who have given facilities to this association have given them because they felt it was far better to give these men an interest in the preservation of fish, having them fishing legally, making them feel that their right to a share in the sport was recognised, than to have them saying: &ldquo;We can do nothing else but be poachers.&rdquo;  That is a case that requires to be met.</P>
    <P>The Minister has tried very hard I know to create an atmosphere favourable to the preservation of fish and the encouragement of fishing as a sport. You do not want to alienate the man who cannot afford to pay £2 for a salmon licence&mdash;to make him feel that this sport is kept for people who come over to this country and spend large sums of money on their railway fares, hotel bills, and so on, and that the ordinary man who, as the Minister for Defence said so eloquently, takes out his rod and goes out after his day's work, is not wanted.  I am sorry the Minister for Defence is not here.  The Whips are off, and I am sure he would vote with me.  I am supporting the principle he propounded with his usual eloquence.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to realise that in this matter there is a great concurrence of opinion.  Conservators, anglers' associations, and everybody concerned with fisheries, want to see this differentiation made.  The only argument against it is that of the Minister and Deputy Wolfe that we do not want <Col N="1353" /> to discourage people from coming to fish.  Whatever force there was in that argument for trout, the man who comes to fish for salmon, takes a salmon fishery, or stops in a hotel where he gets what is called free salmon fishing, and where the bill is, perhaps, 20 per cent. higher in consequence, can afford to pay £2.  The man who goes out of his own district and who fishes regularly, can afford to pay £2.  I appeal to the Minister to deal with the case of the man who gets two or three days in the season near his own home, days scattered and so far apart that he can get no use out of the provision of the fortnightly licence and who will be debarred from a sport which he enjoys and which he can help others to enjoy if only given an interest in it.  I sincerely make that appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies I would like if he could give us some evidence to justify the scale of licence duties, say, in respect to salmon, in paragraph 1 (a).  What number of licences have been issued in the past; what is the total amount of revenue from the different licence duties in the past; and what is expected in the future?  Perhaps the Minister also would give us some information, if it is available, as to the number, quantity and value&mdash;perhaps value alone&mdash;of salmon caught on lines and salmon exported?  I do not know if that is possible, but certainly one has a right to look for information of that kind when dealing with the schedule of licences proposed to be imposed.  I think more particularly we should have some information as to the number of licences issued in the past, the revenue derived from them, and what revenue is expected in the future.  I do not feel justified strictly in voting one way or the other in a matter of this kind, but I will support the amendment now on the general grounds stated in the earlier motion. I would be much more satisfied if I had some figures or information as to the possible effects of either the amendment or the proposal in the Bill upon the income of the conservators. As a matter of fact, I would like to <Col N="1354" /> come to the conclusion that it would be better to cancel all licence duties while registering fishermen.  Perhaps the Minister will give us some information about the financial side of this schedule.</P>

      <P>Yes, but we are satisfied that they will.  I can also give certain figures as to the increased value of salmon, a matter that Deputy Hogan has on various occasions disputed. I have figures from 1881 to 1891, and for every year down to last year.  The price remained fairly constant from 1870, and except for a few pence per pound there was very little change in the London market.  The price ranged from 1s. 4d. to 1s. 6d. or 1s. 7d. per lb. until 1916, when it jumped to 2s.  In 1917 it went to 2s. 5d., and in 1918 to 3s.  It fell to 2s. 8d. when prices were controlled. When the control was removed in 1920 the price jumped immediately to 3s. 5d.  It has decreased since 1920 to 2s. 7d.  I think that was the price last year.</P>

      <P>Yes, in the English markets.  That means that roughly the price since the licence duties were first imposed has doubled.  In itself, I think that is a justification for increasing the licence duty on nets.  If in 1880, 1s. 3d. per lb. was paid for salmon in the English market, where <Col N="1355" /> 2s. 7d. is now paid, it is a reasonable thing to expect for the sake of the preservation of salmon that you could increase the licence duty.</P>

Even though I admit what Deputy Cooper said, that these persons might not object to pay something more than the local people, I think it looks bad, and is wrong that we should differentiate in that way at a time when hotel-keepers, the railways and other services are advertising to the world that they are cutting rates in order to induce people to come to the country.

      <P>The Minister has not thought out the cases of those small men at all.  The weakness of my amendment is in the words &ldquo;registered as a Dáil elector.&rdquo;  The ordinary term &ldquo;resident&rdquo; is hard to define. There is no legal definition of &ldquo;resident,&rdquo; as far as I know.  It might be held that a man who comes over to this country and takes up his residence here for a couple of months is &ldquo;resident.&rdquo;  There is, of course, the disadvantage that my friends on the right and their constituents might be confined to fishing in College Green at the reduced rate, or voters in the National University might be confined to fishing in Earlsfort Terrace.  That is the only &ldquo;fishery district&rdquo; they would be entitled to fish in at the £1 rate.  But that is fantastic.</P>

Increased licence duties had to be fixed in order to put the fisheries into a better condition than they are in at present.  Everybody concerned had his licence duty increased so as to make the common fund greater and make more secure the fishery preservation. Making one rate for a &ldquo;resident&rdquo; and another for a &ldquo;nonresident&rdquo; of any county is no use. What does the Deputy mean by &ldquo;resident&rdquo;?

    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Mr. ALTON Mr. ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 24 (a) &ldquo;First schedule; in No. 1 (b) to delete the figures 10s. and substitute 5s.&rdquo; My proposition in this amendment is that the endorsement duty for a single salmon rod be 5s. and not 10s., as in the schedule.  My grounds for that suggestion are, first of all, the disproportion that exists between the licence fee and the endorsement fee, considering the number of fishery districts <Col N="1359" /> there are in the Saorstát, and, secondly, that the 10s. endorsement duty would bear very heavily on a not inconsiderable number of occasional fishermen&mdash;men who have few opportunities of fishing and who, when they get a chance of fishing, may not always get it in the same district.  They may, perhaps, go to one place on a holiday on one occasion and to another place on another occasion and get, perhaps, a week's fishing in the whole year.  In the course of that week they may visit, perhaps, four fishery districts, and a 10s. endorsement fee will be regarded by such men as a hardship. They are a class of men that fish merely for sport.  A number of them, with whom I have spoken, are more enthusiastic than successful. They do not catch many salmon.  Some consideration should, I think, be given to their peculiar circumstances.  Many of them live far from any salmon-fishing district.  I urge the Minister to do something for that class of sportsman. If he cannot see his way to agree to a five shilling endorsement fee, perhaps he would give the conservators power to issue a one-day fishing licence for salmon.  I hope he will consider my suggestion favourably.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment by Deputy Alton for different reasons from those he has given. The great purpose of the Minister is to preserve the inland fisheries, and to raise a revenue sufficient for that purpose. It seems to me that all the prices fixed in the schedule are too high.  As in the case of any other commercial undertaking, if you lower the prices you will get a larger return.  For occasional fishing, such as has been described by Deputy Alton, a ten-shilling fee is undoubtedly too high.  It is easy to imagine a professor from one of the Universities, not particularly a fisherman, going down to a country district where there is very little recreation. To kill a portion of the day, and to take in some of the scenery, he goes out fishing salmon.  If he were fishing salmon for a week he would not do the slightest injury to the fish.  In a case like that, it would not be fair to impose a ten-shilling tax.  I think it <Col N="1360" /> would bring in more money to the conservators if the tax were fixed at five shillings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>The main objection to this amendment is that it seeks to differentiate in favour of a very small proportion of the anglers.  Most of those visiting anglers, who are able to afford a day here and a day there, can well afford to pay the difference between five shillings and ten shillings. This endorsement fee of ten shillings was fixed because the practice had crept in of visiting anglers from across-channel going to fish in Galway or in Kerry or in Donegal, after they had taken out their licence in Dublin.  That licence entitled them to fish in the other areas and they contributed nothing to the preservation of the fisheries in the districts in which they actually fished.  The provision was also necessary because certain persons, owing to spite against the board of conservators in their own district, would not take out licences there, but would take out licences in another district, and then fish in their own district. This matter has been very carefully considered, and I cannot see any way of meeting Deputy Alton.  I think a ten shilling fee is quite reasonable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To delete No. 4, page 14, and <Col N="1361" /> substitute the following: &lsquo;Drift nets of any length, £2.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Deputies will remember that on the Second Reading of this Bill the argument against this extra tax was put forward by me and several other Deputies.  The fishermen whom this will affect are men, part of whose income depends on the salmon fishing. In several districts which I know personally it will drive them out of the salmon fishery trade altogether.  The position is that the present licence for nets is £3.  Roughly, according to this schedule, the licence will be doubled. I am not certain that the Government or the Minister has power to impose a tax on those men.  The fishing on which this tax is imposed is done on the high seas and is open to all the world.  If the fishermen here were stopped under this Bill from fishing for salmon it would not prevent others from England, Scotland, Belgium, and France from coming in and taking those fish.  Certainly that would not be in the interests of the State.  The object of this Bill, with which we are all in agreement, is to preserve the inland fisheries and improve the yield from those in the interests of the State.</P>
    <P>We have put on certain checks and controls, such as registration, etc., in order that abuses in the dealing in salmon may be prevented.  On that ground I think it is only fair that those fishermen in whose interests I am speaking should pay what might well be called a registration fee.  I fix that at £2.  Bear in mind that you have no power to impose a tax on those men. They are illegally taxed at present. Proceeding on that assumption, if we object to this clause altogether and say that the tax should be abolished, we would be within our right.  What we do propose is that, in conformity with the object the Minister has in this Bill, we will agree to a licence tax of £2. A flat rate of £2 will cover all nets around the coast of Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is another side of this question which I want the Minister to consider. His Department knows as well as I do that the incomes derived from those few weeks of salmon fishing make a difference between poverty and comparative <Col N="1362" /> comfort in the case of the people living along the north and the west coast.  Bear in mind, too, as was said in the Second Reading, that this is a hazardous occupation.  The men are out on the track of American steamers.  Frequently their nets are destroyed.  They run a great risk when the weather is squally.  A year ago four men lost their lives.  They went out from Kilcashel to raise their nets. Their boat was capsized in a squall, and they were never seen again.  That is a common occurrence.  If these men are made to pay a licence, it must be that they are committing some injury against the salmon.  Fishing five to ten miles from the mouth of the river, they do not interfere with the salmon at all.  It seems a pity that only the supporters of the Minister are present at the moment.  I would like to tell some of the history of salmon fishing around the coast of Ireland.  The Minister might be saying that I am holding up the House for the purpose of a snatch division.  That is not my purpose. I say deliberately it would be a cruel and unjust thing to impose this additional tax on those men in the interests of the fish-owners of the river when you have people all around who could well afford to pay.  Why should not the ratepayer, the huge shopkeeper, the railway people, or the tram people be taxed to provide this revenue which you are demanding from those fishermen? There is no just ground for imposing this tax, and I hope the Minister will take this into consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor TIERNEY Professor TIERNEY">
      <NameTxt>Professor TIERNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support this amendment, and my reason for so doing is that I have been asked to support it by a number of people from the poorest part of my constituency, who make a considerable part of their living out of salmon fishing.  A great number of people on the West coast of Mayo, far away from the mouth of any river, make a fair amount out of it in the summer months.  The season is short, and the work is hard.  At the same time that is the district where there is never work to be got.  Any relief the people can get is of the greatest importance. It seems that this tax on <Col N="1363" /> drift nets will have the effect of making those people who have drawn my attention to the matter, pay £8.  They are usually grouped in four. Four men have 800 yards of net.  A family of four men will have to pay £8 for the fishing they get off the coast of Mayo.  That is the way they put the case to me, and I enquired into it. People resident in the district told me that was so.  If what they say is true they will have a great grievance if the Schedule is passed.  If that is the case it would be better to prohibit that sort of fishing altogether.  You are making it a natural impossibility.  You should not adopt the attitude of making poor people pay a prohibitive rate for what is a very important industry, and one which gives most valuable employment in districts where people have scarcely any other employment to get.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. P. HOGAN (An Clár) Mr. P. HOGAN (An Clár)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (An Clár)</NameTxt>
      <P>I endeavoured to produce here in the earlier portion of the debate, arguments as to why the Minister should not impose this prohibitive rate, and the Minister, on an earlier amendment this evening, came full tilt against my arguments.  No doubt, he is convinced that he demolished them, but he forgets that I have some reserves.  He told us that the value of salmon has practically doubled itself in some years, but he did not tell us what was the cost of nets, or what is the price now.  He did not tell us what was the cost of transport formerly, compared with what is the cost now.  Possibly he would find that these two items of expense more than cancelled the increased price of salmon.  Looking at the figures he gave us, I find that he says there were 254 drift nets.  At £3 each, these would bring an income of something like £750.  £750 represents very little of the general fishery revenue, but it represents the margin between absolute poverty and comparative comfort for some of these people.  It represents practically the difference between life and death for these people, and the position still remains, as I pointed out on Second Reading, that you are giving these people nothing for the increase.  Notwithstanding what the Minister may <Col N="1364" /> think of the seal argument, I have to revert to it again, and to say that you are giving no protection from this pest at all.</P>
      <P>I have a letter here from a fisherman and he says that he saw seventeen salmon strike his net, and he took out one and a half.  That represents a state of affairs that is certainly not conducive to making fishermen hopeful. As Deputy Professor Tierney points out, it is a matter of whether you prohibit these men and make the whole thing illegal, instead of, in this fashion, making it impossible for them to eke out a living.  It is a living for a good many people.  Many people make their entire living on this business. You might as justly endeavour to tax a tradesman's kit of tools as to tax a fisherman's drift net.  It would be just as fair.  The Minister, I think, will have a very big job in trying to justify this increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are wandering away from the point.  Deputy O'Doherty, making a case for this amendment, spoke of the tax being illegal.  If the tax is illegal the Courts are there to question the matter and get it rectified.  It is absurd to talk in that fashion.  At present the licence duty on a net of 1,500 yards is £3.  The Bill proposes that for the first 400 yards there shall be a tax of £4.  Three pounds is the flat rate at present for any length from 130 to 1,500 yards. The Bill proposes that on a net of 400 yards there shall be a tax of £4, and for every 200 yards over the 400, it shall be an extra 5s.  Deputy Professor Tierney has therefore been entirely misinformed.  The tax on a net of 800 yards will be £4 10s. 0d.  The licence duty on nets used in Deputy O'Doherty's constituency, which are mostly nets of 1,500 yards, would therefore be about £5 10s. 0d.  In nearly all districts the length of net which may be used is restricted by by-laws.  In a good many districts drift nets are chiefly used in estuaries.  In Tirconaill they are used mostly in the open stream and that is the reason the by-law permits the use there of a net of 1,500 yards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be interesting to hear what are the restrictions in other areas.  In <Col N="1365" /> Waterford the length of nets allowed is 240 yards, in Lismore 200, Limerick 130, Bangor (Mayo) from 600 to 800, Ballina 800, Sligo 400, Dundalk 500, and in Tirconaill 1,500 as I said.  The catch of salmon for many years past in the Tirconaill drift nets has been about 90 per cent. of the total catch. I will give the figures, taking the last five years.  In 1920 in Tirconaill 410 cwts. were caught; in all other places 66 cwt.  The Tirconaill percentage of the total catch was 86.  In 1921 there were 1,015 cwts. caught in Tirconaill and 86 cwts. in all other places.  The Tirconaill percentage of the total was 92.</P>

      <P>Fish caught by drift net.  In 1922 the Tirconaill catch was 977 cwts.; in all other places the catch was 24 cwt.  The Tirconaill percentage of the total catch was 98.  In 1923 the Tirconaill catch was 1,233 cwts.; in all other places the catch was 146 cwts., so that the Tirconaill percentage was 89.  In 1924 the Tirconaill catch was 2,288 cwts.  In all other places the total catch was 144 cwts., so that the Tirconaill percentage was 94 of the total catch for that year.  In the five years, in Tirconaill there was a total catch of 5,918 cwts. and in all other places a total catch of 459 cwts.  The Tirconaill average of catches in the five years works out at 92 per cent. of the whole.  The Tirconaill fishermen have caught 5,918 cwts. of fish.  Taking a very small price for the last five years, say they sold this fish at 1s. 3d. per lb., the value of the five years' catch would be £41,426 and the amount of licence duty paid by the Tirconaill fishermen in these five years was something less than £1,000.  I, furthermore, have figures showing that as a matter of fact, Tirconaill fishermen have evaded paying their licence duties in recent years.</P>

      <P>In 1917 the number of nets licensed in Tirconaill was 103, and the catch of salmon 1,455 cwts.  In <Col N="1366" /> 1918 there were 125 nets licensed, and a catch of 1,469 cwts.  In 1919 there were 124 nets licensed, and the catch was 1,972 cwts.  We now come to the year 1920, in which 50 nets were licensed, and the catches were 476 cwt. That was a bad year.  It was during the Black-and-Tan campaign.  In the next year, 1921, there were 23 nets licensed, and the catches were 1,100 cwt.  In the year 1922 there were only four nets licensed, and the catches were 1,001 cwts.  In the year 1923 there were 11 nets licensed, and the catches were 1,379 cwt.  In the year 1924 there were 106 nets licensed, and the catches amounted to 2,426 cwt.  It will be noted that there was a great improvement in that year, and as we now look forward to the year 1925 we hope that there will be a still greater increase.  When you take these figures and see what the catches of these drift nets amounted to, it is absurd, as Deputy O'Doherty, I think, stated, to say that one drift net in Tirconaill does no more harm than one salmon rod in the river.</P>

      <P>Take the figures for 1924, which show that the catches by 106 nets amounted to 2,426 cwts.  If you divide that figure by the 106, and ascertain what each net caught, and then argue that one net makes no more impression in the river than one salmon rod, I say, on the face of it, that statement is absurd.  Deputy Hogan has again raised the question of seals. He mentions that one man told him that he saw seventeen salmon coming into a net and that he only took out one and a half salmon.  What did he do to prevent that?  If a farmer sees crows coming along and picking up his seed, what does he do?  He either shoots them or turns them off.  At least he does something to prevent them from picking up the seed.  The fisherman, too, must decide to do something. If he sees that a seal is so bold as to come so near the boat as to take the salmon out of the net, just as the net is about to be hauled in, surely he is not going to write up to the Department <Col N="1367" /> about that.  It is his duty, I should say, to take some action about it himself.  There is no case made for this amendment, and the next amendment stands in the same position.  It is only fair that nets should pay a licence duty corresponding with their catch area.  If a man is allowed to fish a net of 1,500 yards, I think it is just that he should pay more than the man allowed to use a net of, say, 130 yards. In saying that, I am taking full cognisance of the fact that the man who uses the 1,500 yards net uses it in the open sea, while the other man uses his in the estuary.  The drift net men have the first whack at the salmon as they come to the rivers, and the figures there are proof that their catches are very big and that they can very well afford to pay this extra duty.</P>

      <P>The first point I made in favour of this amendment was that this was an illegal tax.  The Minister dismisses that as rubbish, and says why not have recourse to the courts?  Why does the Minister, who should act in a paternal manner towards the fishermen, not put them right if it is an illegal tax?  I say that he cannot justify it.  They are fishing on the high seas, and he has no power to control them.</P>

      <P>I maintain that you have given no reason against that. You read out these blessed statistics, and you made the point that four nets in a certain year caught 1,000 cwt. of fish.  I ask why there were only four nets licensed that year.  The answer, I <Col N="1368" /> say, is because the Minister's Department did not do its duty in collecting the licences.  Every item that the Minister has given against the fishermen is also a charge against his own Department. One would imagine that when the Minister read out the number of nets and the amount of fish taken, that that was the actual quantity of fish taken by the licensed nets.  He read out the number of nets licensed in a particular year.  Surely he does not mean to suggest that four registered nets in that year caught 1,000 cwt. of fish.  It is absurd, I suggest, to give to the House the impression that the persons using these licensed nets were catching so much fish.  I say they were not.  The Minister, at least, has shown hostility to these fishermen.  I ask the House to show that it is hostile to the attitude the Minister has taken up, and to vote in favour of this amendment.</P>

      <P>I feel that the more information we get from the Minister in the way of statistics the more doubt there is raised as to the general scheme of this Bill.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>And that the value of the fish, assuming that 1s. 3d. per lb. was paid for it, was £41,000.  That is round about 2½ per cent.  I think that 2½ per cent. as a licence duty on the value of the fish caught, assuming that the figures given are accurate, is entirely too much.  The Minister has given these figures to show how well off the Tirconaill fishermen are compared with the estuary fishermen in other parts of the country.  The case made by the Minister seems to be based on a certain assumption that I do not think is at all reliable.  That assumption is, that all the salmon that may be in the high seas off the Irish coast are coming home to Irish rivers to spawn <Col N="1369" /> and that consequently, so far as the Minister can do it, there must be some prohibition and some obstacle placed in the way of fishermen catching salmon on the high seas so as to allow the salmon to come into the rivers for the anglers to catch.  I think there is just as much justification for saying that many of the salmon in the Atlantic will move eastward to the Scottish, English or Norwegian rivers as to the Irish rivers and if we interfere with the rights of fishermen to catch salmon on the high seas, we interfere with what everybody has supposed to be an industry that ought to be encouraged.  I agree with Deputy O'Doherty that the idea of making fishermen pay licences to fish on the high seas is rather preposterous. But he might make some kind of case for licensing fishermen with nets if you license fishermen with rods in the rivers or the estuaries of rivers partly, and I think mainly, because you want to have a check upon persons who are fishing.  The Minister has of course argued that the main purpose of the Bill is to provide increased funds for the boards of conservators but I think the real justification for licensing them is to have a register of licence holders.  I do not see how that ought to apply to fishermen fishing for salmon on the high seas any more than that you would ask men fishing for herrings on the high seas to have licences.  But suppose the case is made, then I ask the House whether it is reasonable to suggest in the best case that has been made for the Minister and the worst for the fishermen, that 2½ per cent. of the catch ought to be paid in licence duty.  And now it is a question of increasing that without any suggestion that there is going to be any greater chance of catching fish in the Atlantic from the same number of nets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his general statement the Minister thought that the new scale of duties would bring about the doubling of the revenue.  I suppose that is including the drift nets, and he would assume that instead of £1,000 in the past five years, £2,000 in the next five years would be secured, and £41,000 at 1s. 3d. in the £ is the income for the fishermen, assuming the continuation of the high prices.  But supposing&mdash;and it is quite <Col N="1370" /> reasonable to suppose&mdash;that there is going to be a reduction in the price; then the tax of 2½ per cent. for a licence duty is going to increase, perhaps, to 5 per cent. for licence duty, and perhaps to 7 per cent.  I think Deputy O'Doherty is perfectly sound in his contention that the duty is entirely too high.  I do not know how the figure would apply when we go to the estuaries where there are shorter trains of nets, but very much smaller catches according to the Minister's figure.  We have the figures that he has given us showing that the number of cwts. of salmon caught by all the drift nets owners is very small indeed.  But their tax also is to be doubled.  I think Deputy O'Doherty has made a very sound case, and I hope the Committee will approve of it.  As a matter of fact I hope, at a later stage, to be able to persuade the House as a whole that this licence duty ought to be abolished altogether.  We will refrain, however, from discussing that at the moment, and now I beg to support Deputy O'Doherty's motion for a reduction of this rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephMcGoldr" hpid="Mr. McGOLDRICK Mr. McGOLDRICK">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I was somewhat late for the discussion on this amendment.  I want to put forward another point of view in support of it&mdash;that is the unanimous demand made by the County Council of Tirconaill on this matter.  They at least, are a representative body, and their views are entitled to consideration on so important a matter to the county as this is.  They have not gone so far as Deputy O'Doherty, but they have asked that there should be no change in the licence duty in regard to drift nets from what was embodied in the Fishery Act of 1848.  Now the contention that you can or should charge a licence duty for fishing outside the three-mile limit, may be disputed or it may not, but I think that it will hold its ground; and as regards the damage done within the three-mile limit by those fishermen, I think it is infinitesimal.  Certainly, from the importance of the industry from the national point of view and its importance to the people engaged in the trade in Tirconaill, I think it is a very peculiar thing that the Minister of our own paternal Government here should now suggest that a penalty <Col N="1371" /> should be imposed upon those fishermen. That was not thought of under the Government that prevailed here before.  If the development of this industry is sought to be achieved by this Bill, then a wrong method is being taken to develop it, and, as Deputy Johnson has stated, the two-and-a-half per cent. may become twenty-two-and-a-half per cent., according to the volume of the trade, and that is a very serious impost to put upon those people.</P>
      <P>Now, as a matter of fact, we find Scotch fishing boats coming into our shores for the herring trade and securing catches worth £11,000.  All that they contributed, in fees, in respect of that, was something like £120.  If the position is going to be that as between the foreign fishing boats coming from Scotland and our own people, who depend largely upon this industry, all the preference is to be given to these other people, and our own people are to be penalised in this way, then I say farewell to the prospect of developing the fishing industry in this country as it should be developed.  It is a wrong angle altogether to approach the subject from.  The necessity for more revenue for conservators may be very serious and imperative, but, at the same time, the means of getting that revenue should not be sought from those who have to take all the risk, to face all sorts of weather, every day, in this business, for the purpose of supplementing their incomes from other sources, in order that they may be able to live at home.  Now, if our fishing industries are to be developed, and the people are to be kept at home, I say this House &mdash;a democratic House&mdash;should not, on any account, over-ride the unanimous decision of the representatives of a whole county, and of all the fishermen in that county, by giving a decision here which would not be given by any Government in the times gone by.  I ask the Committee to support this amendment, and give people some hope and chance that they may proceed to develop this industry in the way that will enable them to live at home and support themselves and their families in this country.</P>

      <P>There is no use getting into hysterics in this matter.  If there is a two-and-a-half per cent. licence duty&mdash;two-and-a-half per cent. of the amount of the catch&mdash;we must remember what it is for.  This licence duty is for the preservation of the fish stock. If the fish stock is not preserved, then in the course of a few years these drift-net men will have to go out of business anyhow.  The word &ldquo;penalty&rdquo; does not apply.  It is asking them to contribute to save the fish for themselves for the future.</P>

If Deputy McGoldrick were here earlier in the evening he would have heard Deputy Cooper working himself into a rage because I followed the advice of the Advisory Committee. He talked of the Advisory Committee overruling the Dáil, and now Deputy McGoldrick apparently wants the Tirconaill County Council to overrule the decision of the Dáil.  This matter has been thought out very carefully in my Department, and it was thought over very carefully by the Advisory Committee, and the result of our thoughts and of all that consideration is the provision in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am going to ask the Minister again to deal with the finances of this proposition, and to ask any Deputy in the House interested in industry, apart from sport, to consider it.  It is to increase the tax on the sea salmon-fishing industry from 2½ per cent. of the takings, that is, of the sales, and not of the profits, 2½ per cent. of the turnover, to something indeterminate.  If every farmer, every industrialist, every producer of any other commodity, were asked by the Minister for Finance in his next Budget to pay a tax on his sales of 2½ per cent. without any remission on any other score, there would be a pretty wild outcry.  Then the Minister might be justified in talking about hysterics and rage.  I do not think in all the time that we have been sitting here less hysteria and less rage were shown than now.  This is about the dullest of all the debates we have had, yet the Minister describes it as hysterical and raging.  Seriously, however, it is an important matter if we are to be asked to agree to this increase of 2½ per cent. of the takings on sales to something indeterminate, for what the Minister says is the protection of the industry in the future.  He, however, gives us no evidence in support of his contention that the salmon caught on the high seas were making their way into Irish rivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that herring or mackerel caught twenty, thirty, or forty miles away, as they sometimes are, from the shores are coming close inshore for spawning purposes, but anybody who knows the trade knows that is not the case.  Anything that will justify the contention in this respect is going to justify a licence duty, based on the length of the nets of every fisherman <Col N="1374" /> fishing with herring or mackerel nets or any other nets, in the seas, because it is going to provide revenue for the Department of Fisheries, or one of its subdepartments, for the purpose of preserving and developing the fishing industry. There may be something to be said in some instances for the industry being specifically taxed for its own protection and preservation, but we had better not go too far on that line.  If the farmers are going to be taxed as farmers for the protection of farms, and the merchants in the cities are going to be taxed as merchants for the police forces protecting their particular establishments, and if we carry that principle right through, we will find that we are not a State at all, that we are not a society at all, but simply a conglomeration of separate little interests. I would ask the Minister not to press that proposal too far&mdash;that we must tax an industry for the preservation of that industry.  Here we have two industries in question&mdash;the tourist industry on the one hand and the protection of anglers.  I am not going to say a word against it, though I am not going to raise it to the highest pinnacle as the most desirable thing to which the country should look forward as a national development.  We have the other industry, fishing on the high seas, and fishermen on the high seas are to be taxed at the highest rate for the purpose of preserving the tourist industry.  That is the proposition of the Minister, and I would urge every Deputy to consider seriously the implications of the amendment, or rather the proposal which the amendment tries to avoid, and to support Deputy O'Doherty in refusing to put this additional tax over and above the two-and-a-half per cent.</P>

I want to make the proposition that the preservation of the fisheries, and if you like, more particularly the salmon fisheries, is best done by the Gárda Síochána, and paid for out of the ordinary police funds.  I think it is not desirable that the salmon and trout fishing industry should be dependent to so great an extent as is proposed on licensing fees, and that the cost of police duties ought to be borne out of the general police funds, sometimes local and sometimes national.  It is a general service, a national industry, and it should be considered as a national industry, and not a mere sporting right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The old conception&mdash;the conception of the original Acts, of which this is a mere amendment&mdash;was that salmon fishing was rather a sporting right for the wealthy, and had to be preserved. We are trying to consider this matter, I hope, in the light of an industry.  The Minister stated that the income was about £4,600 per year, and that it is hoped to double that&mdash;to make it, say, £9,000.  The proposal to raise £9,000 by licence duties seems to me as raising very much more irritation and creating more opposition than £9,000 is worth. I agree with those people who have argued that the right way to preserve salmon fishing is to make the penalties against catching salmon during the spawning season very rigorous, very severe, and to encourage as many people as possible to stand by the preservation of salmon, and give them absolute freedom, subject to registration, for fishing outside that spawning season.  I admit that there is something to be said for registration of salmon fishers, say, for rod and line and net, so that you will know who are fishing, and have some means of checking the number, but I do not think it is the <Col N="1377" /> best policy to impose a licence duty of any size except, perhaps, the cost of the licence&mdash;the registration fee.  If you have as many people as possible free to fish without licence, and finance the authority which is policing out of other funds&mdash;national funds or local funds&mdash;you will have much more satisfaction and better salmon and trout fishing.  The amount involved is, perhaps, £9,000, provided the whole scheme of licensing were abolished.  Of course, if this schedule were not accepted then it would require that the Bill itself should be revised.  But I would ask the Dáil, for the sake of the money value, is it really worth charging these fees in the interests of salmon fishing for the purpose of providing funds for the policing of the rivers?  I think that the conservators would be better engaged in the development of fisheries by means of artificial propagation and the like, endeavouring to encourage an interest in preserving the fisheries by other means than through bailiffs.</P>
    <P>I would agree entirely with those who say that the catching of fish, whether by line, rod or net, during the spawning season, should be prevented and punishable.  I am informed by some people who know a good deal about the matter that there is more damage done by ducks eating the spawn than by the fishermen at the mouths of the rivers.  But there certainly could be a great deal more supervision during the spawning season, and very severe punishment for offences during that time.  Then I suggest that the interests of salmon fishing at all other times in the year are going to be better looked after if everybody has freedom to fish and all that is required is to register.  It is with that view that I ask the Dáil not to agree to these licence duties, but rather to throw upon the Minister the responsibility of revising his Bill with a view to preserving fisheries as an industry and thinking of fishermen as well as the angler who is a tourist. If that view were taken&mdash;instead of merely tinkering with the old system based upon the preservation of fishing rights for landowners and their friends &mdash;if the old system were revised, we <Col N="1378" /> would have very much more success in preserving fisheries.</P>

      <P>It seems to me a great deal wiser that the persons benefiting from the salmon and trout fisheries should themselves pay the cost, or at least contribute largely towards the cost of preservation, than that money should be found from a central national fund.  The Gárda Síochána are doing a great deal already towards helping the conservators' bailiffs.  Deputy Johnson's proposition, I am certain, would necessitate adding largely to the existing force.  It would also necessitate special training for certain members of the force who would be on fishery duties.  Anyhow, it has always been the policy to avoid as far as possible having the work of fishery preservation thrown on national funds. The policy has always been rather to have it thrown on the local people as far as possible and on the persons who benefit.  After my experience of the Department, I do not see that any reasons have been advanced to change that policy.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of the Arterial Drainage Bill, 1925.  It is hardly necessary in the present year to spend much time in dwelling on the advisability of having some legal means of dealing with the flooding that periodically occurs in various districts in Ireland.  The physical configuration of the country, with the mountains <Col N="1379" /> practically altogether on the coast, and a pretty level plain in the centre, brings it about that you have, comparatively speaking for the size of the country, long and sluggish rivers.  It is true that the lakes sometimes act as reservoirs, and the bogs as retaining lands that keep back the water more or less like sponges, but, on the whole, the result is that you probably have, in comparison to the size of the country, from the mere course of nature, an abnormal degree of flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present situation is that there are in existence about 190 drainage districts in Ireland as a whole, and most of these&mdash;even out of proportion&mdash;in the Saorstát.  Owing to the many causes and changes of circumstances that have taken place, especially within the last forty or forty-five years, the present legislation that we have is quite unsuited, and quite incapable of dealing with the problem of the creation of new districts.  In the creation of 190 districts something like £3,300,000 was spent altogether, but largely as a result of widespread neglect, in many cases, so far as mere external appearances go, it would seem as if nothing had been spent on many of the existing drainage districts.  As I think I indicated in speaking here on the Estimates, it is not altogether possible that the districts could recede to the position they were in before they were first taken in hand and dealt with, especially where channels have been blasted through rock and matters of that kind, where improvement undoubtedly is permanent.  When you come to less serious matters&mdash;that is, matters more easily and more economically dealt with than the blasting of rock, such as allowing weeds to grow and accumulate, allowing the rivers to silt up and weirs to be built across the rivers, as well as obstructions of all kinds placed through the proper flow of the water&mdash;there has been such wholesale neglect that, as I said, in many cases, the outward appearance of the river valleys is pretty much the same as it was before they were dealt with.  It is natural, therefore, that you should have widespread complaints about flooding.  Inspection has shown <Col N="1380" /> that these complaints are well founded, and that that is due, in many cases, simply to neglect and failure to maintain the rivers in the position they were put into at so much cost.</P>
    <P>Under the old code of 1842, 120 of these districts were made and there are about ten modifying Acts.  That particular code probably never got a fair chance as before it was really fully in operation, or before it could be justified in normal circumstances, the famine years came upon the country. There was then great anxiety to undertake relief works of all kinds and amongst the relief works undertaken were drainage works on a large scale. Possibly they were undertaken without full examination or without due consideration. In any case the proprietors got frightened owing to the amount of money they were charged with, and the Government of the day also got frightened, and there were instances in which schemes were dropped when half finished.  The existing legislation is such that we have no legal power to extend these schemes or to carry them out, no matter how desirable they may be.  I may say that a Royal Commission was good enough to suggest that some people might think that one of the causes of the unpopularity of the Board of Works was the great eagerness with which it plunged into the drainage schemes of those days.  Be that as it may, there is no power to extend, even to the extent we would like, the existing drainage districts except under the Act of 1866.  That is the only code now operative so far as the creation of new drainage districts is concerned.  The distinguishing mark between the code of 1866 and that of 1842 is that most of the responsibility and the initiative was thrown entirely on the proprietors.  The State, represented by the Department of Public Works only came in to a slight extent. The scheme was promoted by the proprietors. They employed the engineer who was to draw up the scheme and who ultimately was to carry it out. The function of the Board of Works was to get an outside engineer who was not one of their own men and who could not have anything more to do with the scheme in question, than to vest it, as <Col N="1381" /> it were.  They had two other functions, to supply the money by way of loan and to make a final award determining how much each little plot was improved or benefited and what portion of the annuity it was responsible for. On the whole, the scheme of 1866 was not a success owing to the inherent weakness in the code itself, owing to the great social and economic changes that took place connected with the holding of land, and also probably to the failure of the proprietors to get really competent engineers to draw up the scheme and see that it was properly carried out.</P>
    <P>Deputies are also aware that both the trustees, under the one Act, and the Drainage Board, under the other Act, were appointed from the proprietors. With the coming of the Land Act of 1881, the proprietors lost the interest or the motive that they had for undertaking drainage schemes.  If the motive did not altogether disappear, it was certainly greatly diminished.  By the Land Acts that came later, substituting the farmer as the owner of the land for the landlord, the motives may have been restored so far as the farmer was concerned, but there were difficulties that interfered with the proper working of the Act.  The Act involved the expenditure of money, the paying back of the interest on the loans, and the paying of the maintenance rate.  As a result of the splitting up of the proprietorship, the rate very often amounted to less than one shilling.  In some cases it only amounted to one penny.  It was practically impossible to collect that rate, and the Drainage Trustees were unable to keep the rivers in proper order.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, there was a certain limited power in the Board of Works to interfere, but only in one way.  They could not compel the trustees of the Drainage Works to do their duty. They had no such power.  All they could do, if a drainage district were neglected&mdash;that is, prior to the Act of 1924&mdash;was to come in and spend the money and charge it to the people whose land was improved.  The difficulty there, again, was that the proprietors were so numerous that there was a difficulty even in collecting the <Col N="1382" /> rent charge to pay back for the restoration of the district works.</P>
    <P>Taken as a whole, the Act of 1866 has not been a success.  So far as the maintenance is concerned, it was brought up to date last year by the Drainage Maintenance Act of 1924. That took advantage of the fact that you have in the County Councils bodies that could collect this drainage rate as they collect the poor rate.  That made it possible to collect the maintenance rates in the future.  Therefore, the difficulty that existed in the past and that has led to the neglect of those rivers, will not be there now.  There is not the same reason to fear that in the future.  On the whole, the efforts to drain different portions of the country in the past very often resulted in a state of chaos.  There was no system. The thing was done haphazard.  There was really no department of the Government responsible for the carrying out of drainage works.  Very often a little district was constituted a drainage district, without any reference to the larger district of which it formed part.  Sometimes benefits were conferred on people outside the district, who had to pay nothing for those benefits.  Sometimes in the same river there were two drainage districts. There was no reason why you should have that.  There was no natural division between the two districts. Sometimes the key position of the district was outside the district itself.  In the same way, in the course of years, mills began to put up weirs and increase the height of weirs.  In some cases the mills have passed into disuse, and the only thing they can produce now is flooding.</P>
    <P>Very often the right they had to erect weirs or raise the height of weirs was very doubtful.  It was oftentimes a case of usurpation.  Now it has the sanction of prescription.  If we were living in ideal conditions, one might argue that after all it is the business of the people living along the riverbanks to combine and to put the river into a proper state of repair.  But we are not living in ideal conditions.  Consequently it has been recognised in all drainage legislation that compulsory powers are necessary.  When a certain <Col N="1383" /> number of persons along a river think it proper to improve their land, compulsion should be put upon others not to hinder them.  As I said, it may seem reasonable enough to argue that it is a matter primarily for the owners of the land, or the people living along the river whose lands are flooded, to combine and do the work themselves. But compulsion is necessary, and for that legislation is necessary, and the State must in reality step in.  The idea in this Bill is to make use again, as in the Maintenance Act of last year, of the co-operation between the county councils, on the one hand, and the Central State Department, on the other hand.  It is recognised that it is not easy in the case of drainage or hydraulic work, to find local engineers capable of undertaking ticklish work of this kind.  The suggestion, therefore, is that the technical skill of the Government engineers&mdash;who, owing to the number of cases of this kind that they have to undertake, have the advantage of both theory and experience &mdash;be put at the service of the drainage district.  The works will be carried out &mdash;if it is decided to carry them out&mdash; by the Central State Department. Then the lighter responsibility for maintaining the works will be put on the local bodies.  Owing to the position they are in, they will be able to collect the annuities necessary to pay back the loan and also to collect the maintenance rates.  It is recognised in this Bill&mdash;and this is a departure from previous drainage legislation&mdash;that the people living along the banks, the owners whose lands are benefited, can hardly be expected to bear the whole cost of putting the river in order. Under the Acts of '42 and '66 the theory at all events was that the proprietors of the benefited lands would bear the whole responsibility.  Considering the prices that have to be paid for labour on the one hand and the prices realised by farm commodities on the other hand, we realise that that is not a practical proposition.  Hence there is provision in the Bill to enable the State to advance, not merely the money to be repaid, but to make a grant&mdash;a free grant&mdash;in other words, to <Col N="1384" /> contribute something to the expenditure which need not be paid back.  The county councils will have the same power.  Whether that power will be exercised by the State or by the county councils is a matter that will have to be considered in each case.</P>
    <P>Seeing that this is merely a question of draining a river or a number of rivers, it may seem that the procedure outlined in this Bill is rather cumbersome and complicated.  I think any complication there is, is, practically speaking, unavoidable.  Occasionally there are letters in the Press suggesting that there is no trouble in dealing with rivers.  I think I saw the statement in a letter about twelve months ago from an engineer, that practically every farmer living on the banks of a river&mdash; even such a troublesome river as the Barrow&mdash;knows precisely what the problem is, knows how to deal with it and that there is, therefore, no necessity for expert engineering.  The problem, unfortunately, is not so simple.  On the contrary, it requires special training. The ordinary civil engineer, without experience in river matters, is not much good for anything like a big drainage scheme until he gets that experience. We have to remember that there are rights of different kinds interfered with &mdash;rights of individuals, land rights, mill rights, water rights, navigation rights, and so on.  There must be some protection for the people who propose to drain a river to secure that they will not be mulcted in heavy damages. There must be some means of determining what compensation should be paid for interference with the rights that I have alluded to.  Thirdly, there is a question which some of the most complicated provisions of the Bill are designed to deal with.  The people whose lands are benefited will have to pay to the estimated amount of the benefit which they derive.  That being so, it is only fair that they should have given to them the choice of initiating a scheme or be asked whether they will go on with the scheme or reject it by a majority.  When I say &ldquo;majority,&rdquo; I do not mean a majority of votes.  It will not be simply a counting of heads. Neither will it be a property franchise qualification.  The voting power of the <Col N="1385" /> parties concerned will be decided not by the amount of land they hold, not by the amount of wealth they have, but by the amount of their land which is estimated to be benefited by this scheme.  It is only just&mdash;it is inevitable, in fact&mdash;that the right should be given to the majority, in that sense, to determine whether they will have the scheme or not, since, as I have pointed out, they will have to pay for the scheme to the extent of the benefit they are expected to get out of it. Consequently, for these three reasons&mdash; the necessity of protection against legal action and heavy damages in respect of the people undertaking this scheme, the necessity for providing proper technical advice and the necessity of getting the consent of the people whom it is intended to benefit&mdash;there is apparent complication in this measure.  Personally, I would be quite glad if anybody could suggest how any of the complicated provisions could be dropped, without damaging the Bill or without unduly diminishing the rights of the individual.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself allows any six or more persons whose lands suffer from flooding to send in a petition to the county council.  The county council will ask the county surveyor to give a general verdict&mdash;but only a general verdict&mdash; on the scheme presented by the petitioners. They will not ask him to draw up a detailed scheme.  Then the county council has the right to drop the matter or send it on to the Commissioners of Public Works.  That is again a right that you cannot very well deprive them of, seeing that they will be responsible for the collection of the rate in respect of the money advanced by way of loan for the carrying out of the works, and also for the maintenance rate afterwards to be paid to the State.  By sending the scheme on to the commissioners the county council undertake the particular duties I have referred to incidentally. The commissioners having examined the scheme, will appoint a qualified engineer, and, if necessary, a qualified land valuer, to examine the scheme.  If it seems that the scheme ought not to be gone on with, the matter ends there.  If the commissioners are of the view that the scheme <Col N="1386" /> is <i>prima facie</i> a good one and should be gone on with, then they get one of their engineers to prepare the scheme in full detail.  That scheme will show not merely the rivers proposed to be dealt with and the works proposed to be executed, but also the different plots of land that are expected to be benefited, and the estimated amount of benefit that is expected to accrue to each plot.  Then there will be an estimate of the cost of the whole scheme. The next important point is, that an opportunity will be given to the people affected to object to this scheme.  They will be asked to vote on whether the scheme is to be gone on with or not. If there is a majority of votes in the sense I have indicated&mdash;a majority, if I may say so, representing the benefited lands&mdash;against the scheme being gone on with, it will drop; it does not matter whether that opposition is well founded or not.  In case half or more than half the people are in favour of it, objections will be heard.  If they are found to be frivolous, they are simply rejected, and the commissioners report on the scheme.  If not, an inquiry will be held, and on receiving the report the commissioners, after considering the objections put forward by the local people, make any recommendations they think fit, in the way of addition to, change in, or omission from the scheme.  The scheme having been approved of by the Minister for Finance, the commissioners will be given power to carry out the scheme as an engineering project.  Section 12 deals with the method of assessing compensation. That is the same as under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act of 1919.  Then you have section 13, dealing with the provision of money for the carrying out of the scheme.  The money is provided in the three ways I have already indicated: the Minister for Finance may make a free grant to the scheme.  The county councils have a similar power.  The balance will be provided, in the first place, by loan, and that will be paid back by means of a charge levied on the improved lands.  The scheme having been carried through, a draft final award, will be prepared.  There, again, you will have indicated the works <Col N="1387" /> carried out, the lands benefited, and the extent to which they are found to have been benefited, the amount to be paid by the scheme as a whole in repaying the loan, and the amount to be paid by each plot.  As there are still likely to be objections&mdash;somebody thinking he is paying more than he ought to pay&mdash;a further inquiry will be held to hear these objections, and then a final award will be made.  The future charge will be based on that.  Section 16 deals with the responsibility of the county council in collecting the annuities that are to pay back the loan, and also in collecting the maintenance rate which is to be levied.  Section 19 confers on the council of the county the power of maintaining in good repair and proper and efficient working order the district in question.</P>
    <P>It is decided that all costs and expenses shall be raised in the way of a drainage rate.  The drainage rate will be collected, levied at the same time, and subject to the same appeal as the poor rate.  That is Section 21.  The other matters deal with the power of the county council to raise money, their power to appoint committees to carry out the purposes of this Act, the Committees of the Commissioners, the public rates they interfere with; the two final clauses are necessary to see that the scheme is not damaged wilfully or through gross carelessness. With reference to the determination of various offences and penalties&mdash;they are maximum penalties&mdash;power is given in Section 28 to make by-laws and incidentally to fix penalties. Generally speaking, that is the principle and the scope of the Bill.</P>

      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary had risen in the Dáil this evening to declare that he had discovered half a million acres of land for the residents of the Saorstát, it would, I presume, cause quite a flutter not only in this House, but throughout the length and breadth of the country.  I think it would be only fairly stating the case to say that if the measure that has been introduced in the Dáil is passed <Col N="1388" /> into law and administered as it can be, and as we hope it will be, it will beyond all doubt, be able to recover for the farmer anything around half a million acres of additional land.  If there is any fault to be found with or any complaint to be made about the Bill, it is that it should be introduced sooner. Those of us who pressed for it, welcome it even now.  We should like to have seen it given precedence over many other Bills, even including the Shannon Scheme.  It is welcome even at the eleventh hour.</P>
      <P>In this country, unfortunately, year after year it seems that our rainfall is increasing and our countryside is being denuded of timber; our rivers constructed under legislation passed in other days, have been, as the Deputy put it, permitted to go back into their former state.  The effect of all this on the health of the country must be very detrimental, indeed, and I fear that if such a condition of things as this were permitted to continue very much longer, life for many of our people and life for our stock would in future years become increasingly difficult.  I think that the problem we debated here a few nights ago with regard to the loss of our stock, might have been considerably lessened if this problem of drainage had been tackled by some other authority in the years gone by, and tackled taking into account the lakes and the rivers.  The drainage of the land is welcome.  It is possible to do very much indeed.  When the Bill is passed the Government will have conferred a benefit on the country that cannot, from my point of view, ever be estimated. The measure in itself, while the Parliamentary Secretary may say it is a little complex, seems to me plain and intelligible.  It is questionable whether it could be more effective if condensed more.  It covers every aspect of the problem that has to be tackled.  There may be certain minor amendments, and there are two or three clauses of the Bill to which I want to draw attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to clause 3, it will be the duty of the county council after a petition is put before them to order their county surveyor to visit the area from which the petition comes to make <Col N="1389" /> an inspection.  I suggest that it is questionable if the conditions in our counties at the present time will permit county surveyors or assistant surveyors to leave the work they are on to make inspections in such areas as will come under review when this Bill becomes an Act.  From the experience I have of my own county which, unfortunately, needs this measure more than any other, I do not think it would be wise that the county surveyor should be expected to leave his work, the state of which at the moment will not permit him to leave it and go on to this work. So many areas will have to be visited that it is questionable whether it would not be wiser to give authority to county councils to employ outsiders altogether or another engineer.  That will be a matter for discussion, I presume, in the Committee Stage.  I notice, in Section 5, that while a petition may come into the county council it may be turned down by them.  I cannot see anywhere in the Bill that there is a right to appeal from the decision of the county council. It is questionable whether or not a county council should have the right to declare that there are no grounds for a petition.  I think there should be given an opportunity to those people for putting forward their point of view elsewhere.</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 16, if I am to understand from it that the Minister for Finance is to declare the number of years over which payment is to be extended, I would like to hear something from the Minister as to what are the number of years over which payment is to be extended.  After all, that must be a serious consideration for the people undertaking to contribute their fair proportion to the lands benefited. Farmers will naturally ask, when an award is being made out, that the period of years should be extended over as far as possible.  Conditions at the moment in agriculture demand that it should be so.  Farmers are reluctant to pay more than they can see their way to pay presently.  That aspect of the problem should be given serious consideration. On that I would like to ask that if, when a draft award is being made out, it would not be advisable that perhaps the annuity on the entire holding <Col N="1390" /> or the valuation on an entire holding should be taken into account when making a draft award?  It may be questionable whether it would be wise or fair, but in many cases the area a small farmer may have subject to floods may be by far the greater proportion of his holding.  The areas are increasing year by year and if a rent or rate were fixed on a man's land at a time when flooding was not so serious a problem as it is now and when the value of his land was higher than it is to-day, the award fixed on that land might hardly be fair.</P>
    <P>It is questionable whether it would be an economic proposition for a farmer like that to undertake to pay a contribution for the drainage of portion of his land, if his rent and the valuation of his holding, on which his rates would be fixed, put his present charges so high that he would not be able to meet all the charges that would be demanded of him.  I think from that point of view the matter should be taken into consideration.  I cannot say exactly what should be done but it is something that should be considered.  There is the question of whether or not you can include the existing drainage area in the new area that is to be created after the passing of this Act.  If that is so&mdash;I take it, it is so from the Bill&mdash; I am inclined to think that it will be necessary in many cases to do the work on the old scheme simultaneously with the work on the new scheme, because in very many cases our rivers, as they are under the old drainage scheme, would not be capable of carrying the larger body of water which they will need to carry when the new areas are opened up.  I do not know how exactly that problem is to be met.</P>
    <P>In Section 27 I think there is something that can be hardly accepted as fair.  I concede all right that where a man has land which will be benefited by drainage after the construction of drainage works, it is right that the man should pay and it is well that he should not do anything so far as he can possibly avoid it, to injure the work that has been done or that is in course of construction.  After all if you undertake to do certain work to create certain <Col N="1391" /> new conditions, I think it is not fair that you should put on certain individuals the responsibility for protecting the works that you have constructed.  I would rather prefer that the obligation should be put upon you to protect the works.  Even if it means additional cost I think it would be the better way and the most effective way for protecting the works you threw up yourself.  If it is necessary that the cost has to be added on to the general charges it will be better than putting the responsibility on the various farmers whose land will be drained.  It would mean to certain small farmers the construction of fences for three or four hundred or perhaps eight hundred yards.  I think that is something that could hardly be accepted as fair.  I think we will have to consider when amending the Bill, putting the responsibility on somebody else rather than the owners of the land. The penalty would make him say &ldquo;I would be safer without a drainage Bill like that.  I never know when I would be liable for a penalty, and if they cannot protect their works themselves, I cannot see how I can protect them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Taking the measure as a whole, I think it is very welcome.  As far as I can see those seeking to amend it have not very much scope for their energies. One thing I would urge is that the Executive Council should give the Minister in charge every opportunity of pushing it through, at least consistent with complying with the Standing Orders, and giving us a little time for the consideration of amendments.  It should be possible that work be done under this Act this season.  It is absolutely essential in many areas that the work should be done under it this season.  If we are to have any work done this season the extent of it will be determined by the length of time it will take us to get the Bill through.  I would, therefore, urge on those in charge that the Minister should be facilitated as far as possible in order to give people down the country who will be benefited by this Bill when it becomes law, the improvements that are so long overdue, and that are so very badly required.</P>

      <P>As regards the Minister's desire to get a Second Reading for his Bill to-night, I do not propose to impede him in that by saying more than a few words.  I have not had an opportunity of reading this Bill with any care, but I followed the Minister's speech in describing the Bill with some care, and I was impressed with the delay that is likely to be occasioned by the methods prescribed in the Bill.  It seems to me that that could only be relieved by Deputy Baxter's suggestion: that it might be possible to get work done during the coming season.  I cannot see the possibility of that if it is necessary to go through all the procedure that the Bill seems to prescribe, and that the Parliamentary Secretary explained.  It occurred to me that there must be a number of schemes in existence in the office of the Board of Works which might get the consent of the county councils and of the Ministry very easily.  That is to say, some of this procedure might be more formal than actually necessary. In such cases, I can imagine work being done this year.  Then I am struck with the provision regarding finance, and I wonder whether it is likely that farmers who are going to be affected are going to vote for a scheme in the way prescribed without knowing what proportion of the cost is going to be provided by the State and what proportion by the county council.  As I understand it, a decision has to be come to in regard to the acceptance of the scheme before it is known what proportion of the cost is going to be defrayed by the State, and what proportion by the county council.  I would imagine that farmers asked to vote on that question are going to be a little chary, and are going to ask themselves, how much they will have to pay, and whether it is worth their while or not to vote for this scheme without knowing whether they will have to pay the whole of it, or as to how much is to be paid by the State and how much by the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is some point in Deputy Baxter's speech regarding the <Col N="1393" /> veto to be exercised by the county council.  There may be districts in a county which are very badly hit, and where the farmers affected will not have very much of a desire to enter into such a proposition.  The county as a whole may have no interest, or at least very little interest, in that particular area, and may be very slow to act with a view to relieving the situation in that district.  I think, as Deputy Baxter says, there ought to be the right of some sort of an appeal in cases of that kind.  Even though the county council as a whole does not desire to pay anything towards the expenses, there should be some method of carrying through the scheme with the assistance of the State grant.  I would like, if it were possible, the Parliamentary Secretary to give us some assurance that even with the procedure set out in the Bill, it may be possible to have some work carried through, or at least some of the schemes passed and work begun this year.  I rather fear, with the procedure so involved, that it is going to take very much longer time than would allow work to be done this season. On the whole, I think that the Bill is going to be of very great value eventually, and I am glad that the Ministry has taken the line that it has taken in regard to this general question of arterial drainage.  I hope that the action that is taken will be followed up at a very early date by very widely-spread action on the part of farmers draining their own land, with perhaps some assistance, where such assistance is necessary, to help them in that good work.</P>

      <P>With Deputy Baxter, I welcome this Bill, and I assure the House it is one of the most urgently-needed that has been introduced for some time.  I trust it will have a very speedy passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am certain that the carrying out of the work described by the Parliamentary Secretary will produce very beneficial results all over the country, and I hope that a start may be made soon in the execution of that work.  The past two or three winters, as Deputies <Col N="1394" /> know, were exceptionally inclement, and an enormous amount of damage was done to land in many parts of the country by heavy floods.  I am aware myself of cases where thousands of acres of land were flooded, the result of which was that the land was rendered absolutely valueless to the occupiers or the owners.  For that reason I hope that this Bill will get a speedy passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas so that the provisions of it may be put into operation at once with a view to alleviating that damage, and I might almost say the destitution caused amongst great numbers of people by the flooding of their lands. This Bill, in my opinion, provides the means of alleviating the distress caused by the floods, and therefore I hope it will soon become law, and be the means of bringing much needed relief to very large numbers of people all over the country.</P>

      <P>There are one or two points to which I would like to refer in the few moments at our disposal&mdash;the points raised by Deputy Baxter and Deputy Johnson on the question of the power of veto given to the county councils.  That is a matter to be considered in the Committee.</P>
      <P>After all they are assuming a rather important responsibility in collecting the drainage rate and the maintenance rate, and we did think they should have the power to reject the scheme or promote it.  That is, however, a matter that we could consider more fully in Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Baxter as regards the county surveyor, I do not think there is anything in the Bill which prevents the county council appointing an assistant for this purpose, especially in a county like that represented by the Deputy&mdash; the County Cavan&mdash;which is practically made for the consideration of hydraulic engineering, and which seems designed for that purpose more than any other county in Ireland.  There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the county council appointing such engineers.  So far as the penalty mentioned is concerned, it is a maximum penalty to start with. So far as the damage is due to carelessness, <Col N="1395" /> that is a matter that will be taken into account by the District Justice who deals with the case.  Such a man is inflicting very serious damage upon his neighbours, and a great deal of the damage that has been caused to rivers up to the present has been caused by cattle trampling down the fences and banks, and in that way causing shoals and various other obstructions in rivers. I think, on the whole, it is desirable that there should be a penalty on a man who will not take proper care.  Remember this is no longer a scheme of the Board of Works; it is the property of the neighbours that is being damaged.  There was a point made by Deputy Johnson, and I think there is a great deal in it.  That is, that the farmer will not vote until he knows definitely what he is voting for and <Col N="1396" /> how much is he to be responsible for in the way of an annuity, that he should have an indication of the estimated cost of the scheme, and also an indication of what the Government propose to contribute, and what the county council propose to give at the beginning. Therefore, he should know, when the matter is put up to him to vote, for the first time, more or less what he is expected to contribute towards the financial cost.  I think that Deputy Johnson's view is quite sound in that respect.</P>
