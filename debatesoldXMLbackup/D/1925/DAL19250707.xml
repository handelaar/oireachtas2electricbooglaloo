      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that allowances given to railway workers who have been dismissed since the railway amalgamation scheme are considered inadequate; that Thomas McGrane, 31 Upper Dominick Street, Dublin, who had forty-three years' service, was dismissed on April 18th, 1925, and was granted 7s. a week during the pleasure of the directors, which has not yet been paid; and whether he will make representations to the company with a view to increases of superannuation in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no control over the payment of superannuation to railway workers, and compensation for those discharged in consequence of amalgamation is fully provided for in the Third Schedule to the Railways Act, 1924.  As I have explained in answer to a number of previous questions, that Schedule does not contemplate my intervention in any questions as to compensation arising under it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that directors who were only twelve months acting as directors have received something like £450 per year? Contrast that with the case of a man who has had forty-three years' service. who was dismissed last April and was granted seven shillings a week, which was to be paid during the pleasure of the directors, but who has not yet been paid any money.  If all the directors were to die, in such event it is quite possible the workers would not receive a penny at all.  Surely the Minister does not consider it fair that such conditions should exist.  Why should the Government allow such great hardship to be inflicted on the workers as is being inflicted under the amalgamation of railways?</P>

      <P>Mr. Moran's son was accidentally killed in Kilkenny Barracks on the 28th June, 1922.  The claim for compensation was duly considered under the provisions of paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Third Schedule to the Army Pensions Act, 1923.  It was ascertained that Mr. Moran had only been partially dependent on his son.  He was, therefore, not entitled to a pension.  The maximum gratuity payable under the Act in any case of partial dependence on a soldier who was killed or died of wounds was, however, awarded to Mr. Moran.  The amount was £100.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether an inquiry on oath was held into a complaint by a patient against Mrs. Loughney, midwife of Killala Dispensary District; whether the evidence of both patient and nurse, and other witnesses, was to the effect that the case, in which a fee of 10/- was voluntarily paid, was a private case, and that fees had been paid voluntarily on two previous occasions, and whether the Minister has decided that the case was a dispensary case; whether he was aware that the patient's husband was not a casual labourer, but in permanent employment, and would have been entitled to £2 maternity benefit if his employer had not neglected to stamp his insurance card; and, further, whether he was aware that this midwife's salary was only £35 a year, and that one of the objections to raising it was the small number of tickets issued, and, whether he was aware that efficient midwifery service in the dispensary district would be impossible if the midwife was not to be allowed to attend cases without receiving either ticket or fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN, replying</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  Inquiries were made in this case as to whether the patient was attended on a ticket for gratuitous Medical Relief, or if she was eligible for such relief.  The Home Assistance Officer stated that the patient was not attended on a ticket but that, being a labourer's wife, she was entitled to gratuitous medical relief. <Col N="2104" /> Furthermore, the Doctor's services were gratuitously rendered, as he stated he would not be entitled to accept a fee.  In these circumstances there was no alternative but to decide that the patient was entitled to relief on ticket.  The fact that the midwife accepted fees for attendance does not exempt her from the provisions of Article 21 (6) of the Dispensary Regulations, which prescribes that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Midwife is prohibited, under penalty of dismissal, from accepting a fee for her services from any patient in the dispensary district who has obtained a medical relief visiting ticket, or who is entitled to medical relief under the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act, 1851.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The fact that midwives fail to insist on receiving tickets for their services has little bearing on the point.  It is always open to the midwife to report to the County Board of Health or Home Assistance Officer that she has attended ticket cases and has failed to obtain tickets from them.  There is no bar on the midwife accepting fees from patients who are not entitled to gratuitous medical relief.</P>
      <P>The question of the salaries of midwives in County Mayo has been brought to the notice of the Board of Health, and a further communication on the subject will shortly be addressed to that body.</P>

Right of appeal from the Department's decision was provided to the Tillage Appeal Tribunal, and the penalty, if any, fixed by the Tribunal was recoverable as a civil debt in the County Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 271 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, every motor-boat carrying more than twelve passengers must be surveyed at least once a year and must obtain from my Department a passenger certificate applicable to the trip or excursion on which the boat is engaged.  Fees for the survey and the expenses of the surveyor must be paid by the owner of the boat.  The scale of charges for motor-boats is at present under consideration with a view to some possible reduction.  But there has been considerable evasion of their duty in the matter on the part of boat-owners, and I will have no alternative to enforcing it strictly in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Boats plying for hire in State harbours <Col N="2107" /> controlled by the Board of Works, such as Howth and Dun Laoghaire, are required, whatever number of passengers they carry, to take out a licence from the Board of Works.  At Howth this licence costs £5 for a motor-boat, but in the case of such a boat holding a passenger certificate from my Department the charge is only 2s. 6d.</P>
    <P>I regard the obtaining by these motor-boats of a passenger certificate as a very necessary protection for the safety of the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the First Reading of a Bill to make provision for the formulating and carrying out of a scheme of arterial drainage of the River Owenmore and its tributaries. Prior to the European War steps were taken by the Congested Districts Board to set up a special drainage district to deal with flooding in connection with the Owenmore and its tributaries. Considerable progress had been made with the preliminaries.  Consents had been received from some 90 per cent. of the proprietors.  A qualified engineer had been sent down as required by the Act of 1863 to hold an inquiry and to hear objections, and he had reported in favour of the scheme.  It is now proposed to deal with this particular local problem.  A higher contribution will be given in this case as the district is a congested district than would be probably given in most similar works.</P>

      <P>I made a fairly full statement on the Second Reading of the Bill, and I presume the Deputy was not here.  The main principle in the Bill is that it affects certain powers which I had under the previous Act, and which I could not exercise for two years.  It allows me to exercise these powers within three months after the passing of this Bill.  That is the principal object of the passing of the Bill, and that is the reason it is so urgent to pass it. The main Act has been in operation for <Col N="2111" /> the last twelve months. but it has had very little results.  There has been very little rebuilding as a result of it. I have taken power under the Bill to enable the Corporation to put a site up for auction if a building owner is not rebuilding or if he has ceased building operations after a certain time.  I would not have power to enforce that provision for two years as the Act stands.  Under this amending Bill I can do it within three months.  That is the main provision of the Bill.</P>

It may not be necessary to exercise this power, but it is necessary to have it.</P>

      <P>I hope an opportunity will be given to the aggrieved party&mdash; that is the party concerned&mdash;so that he will be able to put his case before the Minister and that no arbitrary action will be taken.  I drew attention to this matter before, and probably it was on account of that that this provision was put in.  The case I put up when the original Act was going through was that in many cases where adjoining property falls vacant, merchants and others purchase that property with the object of making extensions in the future.  The time for those extensions, by reason of the falling-off in trade, may not have arrived.  If the Minister were to walk in in such cases and compulsorily take the premises from these people, it would prejudice their trade in the future.  It was to prevent any arbitrary action of that kind that I drew attention to the matter.  Supposing trade is bad, the people concerned will not be disposed to make extensions until there is a probability of trade improving. Still, they would not like to lose the site on which they would make the extension.  That is an aspect of the <Col N="2112" /> question that I would like the Minister to consider, in case he is asked to use the powers to be given under the amending Bill.</P>

    <Title>DAIL IN COMMITTEE. - ELECTRICITY SUPPLY (SPECIAL POWERS) BILL, 1925&mdash;SECOND STAGE.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill. It is a very short measure, and the explanation of it lies on the surface.  It is simply to allow for such mutual assistance to be rendered between electrical undertakings as to enable these undertakings to meet the estimated normal demand until such period as power from the River Shannon be available.  The object of the Bill is to save undertakers the expenditure of a certain amount of money on new plant. which plant would, if erected, be rendered useless four or five years hence. Perhaps I might take one example. The matter arises very acutely here where, if you take the normal growth in the way of demand for electricity in, say, Pembroke, Rathmines and Dublin, it is estimated that while some of the undertakings&mdash;notably the Dublin, United Tramways&mdash;would have a certain surplus of electricity for sale, they would be prevented from selling their supply to the others, or some of the others, who would have to put in additional plant.  That additional plant might, in the city of Dublin alone, involve an expenditure of £40,000 or £50,000.  That expenditure might, in a few years, be found to have been useless. The principle of the measure has <Col N="2113" /> been agreed upon.  I cannot say the same for the details, but the details can afterwards be subjected to amendment on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major MYLES Major MYLES">
      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in my opinion, has not given us enough details. This Bill is evidently intended to give facilities to electricity undertakings to afford mutual assistance in giving a supply of electricity in view of the Shannon scheme.  I presume that all new consumers ought to be connected up, as far as practicable, with the existing distribution in a manner that will afterwards fall into line with the Shannon scheme.  The difficulties ahead in the Shannon scheme will be very much increased if you have a number of new consumers with currents of all sorts and conditions&mdash;direct currents of various voltages, alternating currents of many phases.  The confusion is bad enough at present.  It has caused immense trouble in England, and I think it would be really worse in Ireland.  But there is one point that is more important still.  This Bill will wipe out, at one stroke, the protection afforded the various undertakings by their Provisional Orders and Acts of Parliament. It was on the security afforded by the various Acts of Parliament of the supply undertakings that money, both public and private, was invested in them in the past.  It is quite inequitable that this security should be removed.  The effect could only be to discourage the investment of any capital in any undertaking in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several unauthorised undertakings have been considering the advisability of seeking statutory powers, but I fail to see that that would be of any value to them if the security originally given is removed, as it will be removed, by this Bill.  I would suggest to the Minister one or two points which if dealt with would be very acceptable to the people of this country who have in the past contributed to electrical development.  I would suggest that he include in the Bill a provision to continue to authorised undertakings the security which they enjoy under the existing legislation; that he encourage <Col N="2114" /> the taking of statutory authorisation by undertakings at present working without such authorisation; that he encourage and assist existing undertakings to extend their present distribution, discourage the multiplicity of systems of distribution, and give no facilities to new generating stations to give supplies in areas in which there is a supply already available; that he encourage the inter-connection of existing net-works by stipulating that all supplies given to consumers from stations not already giving a public supply shall be given only through the medium of an undertaking which is already giving a public supply.  Thirty years or more ago, when electricity had begun to come into general use, it was thought advisable to give competitive powers in the same area, in order that the price might thus be kept down.  It was thought that the competition created would reduce the price to the consumer.  That was thirty years ago.  The result, as proved by experience, has been exactly the opposite. It is quite plain that if there are two or more distribution net-works laid down in one area the consumer must eventually pay for the extra net-works. The Minister has ample powers to look after the consumer's interest, as he can fix the maximum price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in some difficulty in replying to Deputy Myles, because I find myself in agreement with what he has stated, except on one or two small points.  He speaks of confusion in England at the moment, with regard to the difference in various matters as between certain electricity undertakings.  He states that the confusion would be still worse in Ireland, or that it is actually worse.  I do not think that it is by any means as bad, or likely to be as bad, even relative to the size of the two countries and the use of electricity in both.  I do think that we are lucky to have a National scheme, like the Shannon scheme, <Col N="2115" /> coming along thus early, so as to prevent whatever elements of confusion there may be increasing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Myles has, in a series of suggestions, really put forward certain principles, with which I felt, as I listened to them, in complete agreement. As far as I know, the Bill runs very much on those lines.  The principle of the Bill is to prevent new plant being installed, and to allow undertakings which have a surplus to deliver to undertakings which require that surplus and can use it.  If there are undertakings which do not require statutory powers, and that set up in the ordinary way, of course they are exempt from control.  But, obviously, if the principle of this be followed to any large extent, if we are even to proceed on the logical lines that the Bill lays down, if any would-be authorised undertaking seeks to come along in an area in which there is at present an authorised undertaking, and where consumers of both would eventually be supplied from the Shannon scheme, it will be our endeavour to prevent useless expenditure of money, and consequently to see that new consumers will be, if at all possible, supplied from the older undertaking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major MYLES Major MYLES">
      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister what is his idea in this scheme dealing with existing undertakings where the voltage of the supply is different from what the Shannon scheme will require?

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>These are matters which will all be subject to adjustment later on, when arrangements in connection with the supply and distribution of the Shannon current are being made.  This Bill has nothing whatever to do with these matters.  It does not seek to interfere with them. This Bill has one simple object, as I have already explained, and there is no intention, and I doubt if there is even power under the Bill, to interfere with any existing undertaking if it can meet the present demand.</P>

      <P>Yes; under this Bill.  This is a Bill the requirements of which, if I had been allowed to do so, I would have provided for in certain amendments to the Shannon Bill.  But I was told they were outside the scope of the Bill.  This Bill is really in answer to a demand made.  The question is more acute here in Dublin, and the urgency was pressed upon us by certain Dublin undertakings.  It is entirely to the benefit of those undertakings. They have all agreed that eventually their consumers can be supplied from the Shannon, and that it is desirable now to prevent the expenditure of money in a useless way.  There is no intention in this Bill of doing any harm to existing undertakings, where these can supply what is required, but the aim is to prevent the needless expenditure of money.  The matters to which the Deputy referred are matters which must be adjusted in the Organisation Bill, or the Second Bill, dealing with the Shannon.  They do not arise on this Bill at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early stages of the part that began in January this year of this <Col N="2117" /> Session, there was an understanding that an opportunity would be provided during the Session for discussing the reports of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The opportunity has not occurred until now.  It was hoped that the comments expected to be made and submitted by the Ministry of Finance would have been made available before the adjournment.  But, by what I may call a misfortune, the Department of Finance have not yet prepared or circulated any comment of that kind.  We have, therefore, to proceed without any knowledge of the views of the Department of Finance upon the Reports of the Committee of Public Accounts. It has been well said in this House that the work of the Committee of Public Accounts does provide a practical object lesson in the working of Parliamentary institutions, and the real check by which a democracy can influence public administration.  I think that any Deputy who has time or opportunity or inclination to read any portion of the evidence contained in the volume which has been circulated will realise that there is a great deal to be said for that view.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is no harm to remind the Dáil of the course of procedure by which the Dáil does maintain some kind of control over public expenditure. We have recently gone through an examination and discussion of the Estimates.  And, in fact, it is only to-day that we passed the Finance Bill.  The Finance Bill is the method whereby the Department of Finance may raise money to be expended in a certain direction, that direction being contained in the Appropriation Act, after discussion of the Estimates.  It remains for some one to be satisfied that the expenditure of the money raised by taxation has been according to law and according to the directions of the Oireachtas.  As expenditure proceeds, accounts are presented and the Comptroller and Auditor-General and his staff make current and final examination and make a report at the end of the examination and audit to the Dáil on the Appropriation Accounts.</P>
    <P>The account for the year 1922-1923 was submitted with the Auditor-General's report in March, 1924.  There <Col N="2118" /> was, as is well known, a delay in the preparation of that report, owing to the circumstances of the time.  The report has received a certain amount of attention.  The Committee of Public Accounts, which inquired into the report of the Auditor-General for the year 1922-3, beginning in April last, met, I think, on about fifty occasions and examined these accounts, particularly the accounts to which attention was directed by the Auditor-General. The important point that I want to make is that it is the privilege and responsibility of that Committee to call before it for examination, and to answer any questions, the Accounting Officers responsible for the expenditure of the money under the different Departments of State.  These particular officers are not merely formally responsible, but, in fact, responsible to the Dáil, acting by the Committee of Public Accounts, for the proper expenditure of the moneys committed to their care.  The report of the Committee of Public Accounts is a report to the Dáil.  It is a practical necessity that the report of the Auditor-General should be examined by a Committee of the Dáil rather than by the Dáil itself. As I say, it is a practical necessity, and one which makes it desirable that that Committee should be representative of the House as a whole.  It has become the practice that the Chairman of that Committee shall be one who is not a supporter of the Government of the day.  I am drawing attention to this, because it provides, I suggest, a real check.  While it may seem to be somewhat belated, the very fact that there is such an examination imposes, throughout the Civil Service, a very salutary check.  Every officer in the Civil Service realises his position.  He has a definite sense of responsibility and he has the knowledge that he may be called to account for any faulty administration.  In that way the Committee's investigations have a valuable disciplinary effect.  That, at least, is the experience, after a good many years, of Great Britain.  I think it is recognised by those who have experience of the Civil Service in this country to be very valuable also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2119" /> The report for the year 1922-3, which we are now dealing with, would seem to have been of a very voluminous kind, and the Committee would seem to have gone into very much detail&mdash; much more than, I think, will be required in future years.  There are several reasons for that.  One reason is that the Committee itself was entirely new to the procedure, and had to learn as it went along, what were its duties and responsibilities.  The second reason was that the whole administration was new to its work and that even some responsible officers had not previous experience of the requirements of the public service and, consequently, did not maintain a proper grip upon the expenditure of public moneys. Then, further, and perhaps more important, as a cause of the prolonged examination, was the fact that the period in question was one of very great trouble in the country.  A great deal of money was expended without a recognition of what the public services demanded.  It will be seen by Deputies that in this volume there is a memorandum on the general financial procedure, and there are appendices, some of which deal with financial procedure and the general work of administration on the financial side.  I think it may be said that that volume would provide a few hours light reading during the holidays for any Deputy interested enough.  I am quite certain that a good deal of trouble next Session would be saved to the Departmental officers and the Ministers if the main lines in respect of procedure and departmental responsibility were understood, as explained by the Departmental officers in the course of the evidence given.</P>
    <P>As I said, the fact that we were all new to the business, led to a good deal of detailed inquiry, which, it is to be hoped, will not be necessary another year.  In the course of the Auditor-General's report and in the course of the evidence contained in this volume, there will be found a great deal of criticism of the administration.  Very much is said which could be used to the detriment of the country, the Government of the country and the <Col N="2120" /> general administration, and I have no doubt it has been so used, and will be used again in many cases, perhaps unfairly, and in other cases quite fairly.</P>
    <P>But I want to point out, to forestall criticism and comment, perhaps, on what I may have to say later, that the very fact that this examination takes place, that it is part of the normal procedure, and that the examination takes place in such a way that it is reported verbatim, is recognition of this, that normally and as a matter of regularity the public service on the financial side is well administered, and is expected to be well administered, and those responsible have faith in that administration being honest and fair.  I think, as I say, I may forestall criticism by saying that if every other body in the country claiming power and responsibility were able to say: &ldquo;We will submit our accounts to the same kind of criticism at the hands of our political opponents and will allow these political opponents to demand the appearance of witnesses and to call for papers,&rdquo; they would then have the right to utter criticism of the work of these departments. That I put forward as a kind of challenge to those who may be said, not unfairly, to be malicious critics, those who merely pick out details of maladministration and set them up as typical.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that these second and third reports&mdash;the first was quite an ordinary one, dealing with a small matter which was disposed of without any difficulty&mdash;contain recommendations.  I do not propose to go through the various items seriatim&mdash;there are Deputies, no doubt, who will desire to call special attention to particular paragraphs&mdash;but there are two or three paragraphs in the second report to which I think it necessary to direct special attention.  In paragraph 7 attention is drawn to the fact that certain moneys which were expended by the State, but which were not moneys voted by the Dáil in the formal way that has been followed since the establishment of a Constitution, must be taken into account, and though they have been expended by Departments of State they have not been examined by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  The accounts of the expenditure <Col N="2121" /> from the Dáil Eireann Loans Funds for the period from January to June, 1922, were presented to the Dáil in, I think, September, 1922, but between that date and the merging of the Dáil funds with the Central Fund there has been no accounting to the Dáil of the expenditure and no examination of that expenditure by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  It is recommended by the Committee that authority should be given to them to examine those funds and accounts, if for no other reason than to establish the principle of continuity.  Then in paragraph 8 reference is directed to the fact that moneys were expended by the Provisional Government from what was known as the Local Taxation Adjustment Fund.  These have not been examined in a formal way by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, because they were not voted moneys, and the Committee desires that authority should be given to have these accounts audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General and presented to the Dáil, and that the usual procedure with regard to voted moneys should be followed.</P>
    <P>I said that there was a certain actual and real responsibility on the part of the accounting officers, and I want to emphasise that by referring to paragraphs 30 and 32 of the second report, from which it will be seen that the Committee recommends that certain expenditure, comparatively small in amount, should be disallowed.  In one case it is a sum of four guineas, being an overpayment to a certain typing staff of the Ministry of Local Government, and in the other case it is an overpayment of the sum of £16 6s. 6d. in respect of a part-time teacher attached to the School of Art.  I do not propose to examine the evidence or the reasons why the Committee recommends that these payments should be disallowed, but if it is the will of the Dáil that the recommendations of the Committee, which coincide with the decision of the Ministry of Finance, should prevail, the effect will be that the officers of the departments concerned will be obliged to pay over these moneys themselves. So that there is in fact a personal financial responsibility for the correct administration <Col N="2122" /> of the funds as well as a moral responsibility.</P>
    <P>I want also to draw attention to paragraph 6 of the report and the appendix to the report referred to in the paragraph.  Certain sums of money were voted and expended under departmental heads, but it appeared from the report of the Auditor-General and the accounts, as presented, that in addition to the sums voted and allocated to the various departments a sum of £212,442 was expended from Dáil Eireann funds for the year ended 31st March, 1923.  Some of this expenditure was not allocated to specific departmental accounts, but it is necessary for the purpose of comparison of one year's account with another that the Dáil should understand that this sum of £212,000 was spent in different departments in addition to the sums voted by the Dáil.  I have said that in his report the Comptroller and Auditor-General drew attention to a good many faults of accounting, a good many items of unauthorised expenditure, and in many cases expenditure which was beyond the authority of the officials, but that in the greater part such expenditure was explainable by the conditions of the time.  That applied more particularly to new departments, and the Committee was prepared to support the view of the Department of Finance that in the great majority of cases the expenditure, though it was irregular, should be finally sanctioned in the faith that such wrongful expenditure could not be repeated. The final report of the Committee makes special reference to the faults in expenditure and accounting in respect of the Army and Army accounts.  The Committee's view was clearly that a great deal of the expenditure in connection with the Army was quite unjustifiable and indefensible in the manner of its spending, but that circumstances of the time may have justified or at least excused the method.</P>
    <P>We reported that the circumstances attending the transformation of the Irish Republican Army into the National Army and the preoccupation of the Provisional Government and the heads of the Army with other more urgent and serious matters arising out <Col N="2123" /> of these divisions of the Army into rival conflicting sections might have prevented attention being given to the necessity for a proper accounting system, and the Committee has, I think, fairly and reasonably, taken all these factors into account, and has overlooked much that might in other circumstances have been very strongly commented upon, and which could not but for those circumstances have been justified in any way.  We came to the conclusion that in place of a proper accounting system and a proper check it had to be left to the honour of the officers concerned in buying and in the distribution of purchases, and it had also to be left to the honour of the traders who were supplying the goods, and we recognised that probably no other course was left open to the authorities responsible.  It is the view of the Committee, however, that faults occurred and that in too many cases the trading public took advantage of the lack of experience of the purchasing officers of the Army and, in too many cases, grossly overcharged. The fact that the purchases were made and delivered, and that prices were fixed, made it necessary in most cases that the accounts should be paid notwithstanding the fact that it was believed that overcharges took place.  If we refer to paragraph 3 of the final report, it will be seen that reference is made to the Comptroller and Auditor-General's report regarding the amount of unvouched expenditure and expenditure only partly vouched amounting to a sum of £128,000, but that sanction had been given by the Ministry of Finance that this sum should be charged to the Appropriation Accounts.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General on this led to a considerable amount of public comment.  The Committee made a close examination of the facts referred to in paragraph 35 of the Comptroller and Auditor-General's report.  We came to the conclusion, however, that with respect to by far the greater portion of this sum&mdash;£100,000 of it&mdash;the references to unvouched expenditure had to deal with the pay of soldiers, and that <Col N="2124" /> the Committee were satisfied that the money was, in fact, expended in the way prescribed, the fault being that no vouching was made and no receipts could be produced.  The circumstances explaining that absence of vouching were examined and the explanation will be found in the evidence.  The Committee, having made a very close inquiry, came to the conclusion that it was justifiable on the part of the Ministry of Finance to sanction this expenditure. I think it is necessary to draw special attention to that because of the comments that were made on this large amount of unvouched expenditure.</P>
    <P>If we refer to paragraph 4 of the final report it will be seen that special attention is drawn to an agreement that was entered upon with respect to the purchase of cattle and sheep for killing in the abbatoirs at the Curragh and in Dublin and that special arrangements were made by the Quartermaster-General to pay a commission of 10/- per head for cattle.  The Committee came to the conclusion that there was lax supervision in the Quartermaster-General's department which allowed an agreement to be made at such a high rate of commission.  While saying that I want to draw attention to the evidence and particularly to the comments made, in respect of this item and to other matters which I shall refer to, by the ex-Chief of Staff who was Quartermaster-General, which all appear in the minutes of evidence.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 45 of the Comptroller and Auditor-General's report goes into some detail in respect of purchases made amounting to a total of £275,000 from a single firm of suppliers to the Army.  The observations of the Comptroller and Auditor-General in respect of this were very closely examined and the Committee's final considered view of the matter was that sufficient care was not exercised by the authorities to ensure either that the goods supplied were required or that the prices charged were reasonable.  I must direct special attention to the fact that during this period the Army was a financial law unto itself.  There was no control by the Finance Ministry.  The Finance Ministry was not set up until April, that is at the beginning of the year in question. <Col N="2125" /> The Army had been running on the old lines and continued to run on the old lines, having had allocated to it a certain sum of money and was spending that sum of money under its own authority and without any outside check.  Even the check that was provided later in the year by the appointment of an Army Accounting Officer was not apparent in the early stages of the National Army's existence. Speaking for myself it appears that the buying power was rather too much for the persons responsible and they did not realise the necessity for putting a check upon their command of material through the possession of money.  It was the view of the Army authorities apparently that they had to prepare for the equipping of an army for any possibilities and from the beginning of the National Army it appears that authority was given to the trading firm in question to supply an almost infinite variety of goods.  It is said on behalf of the Army authorities that no purchases were practically made without prices having been quoted and samples in some cases being shown.  But I am obliged to make the comment that there was a very generous interpretation on the part of the buying authority of their powers and privileges.  The view of the Committee was that in so far as this particular account was concerned that however justifiable or unjustifiable the expenditure may have been, the terms of purchase and the conditions under which contracts, if they were contracts, had been made were such as to leave no option but to allow the expenditure as finally sanctioned by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I think, perhaps, I should draw attention to one or two of the items to which attention was directed to show the justice of the Committee's comments and the reason which animated the Comptroller and Auditor-General when he made his references to the account.  In July, 1922, it will be remembered that the Army had not only just begun its career as a National Army, had taken possession of barracks and was organising itself, but it also entered into a period of strife and civil war.</P>

      <P>I think it was at this time that the headquarters of the Army thought it necessary to set about furnishing quarters, and I think it will be seen, if one turns to page 407 and onwards in this report, that there was not exactly a Spartan view of the position of the officers in the National Army at that time.</P>
      <P>I will not detail the items.  Deputies have the report before them, and the appendix contains the particulars of expenditure on furnishings.  I want to emphasise the fact that in furnishing officers' quarters it was the view of the Committee that necessary expenditure was justifiable and allowable expenditure for ordinary service conditions, but that it was unjustifiable to consider that the elaborate furnishings indicated in these reports were justified in addition to the officer's pay.</P>
      <P>To illustrate the point respecting the large sum of £275,000 expended in the purchase of miscellaneous stores with what we believe to have been a looseness and absence of check, I will just refer to page 290.  It can hardly be sad that any responsible officer of the Army, after a sample was shown, would order 12 tea sets at £7 14s. per set, each set containing only four items, or six tea sets, each set containing three items, at the price of £5 4s. 6d.  My comment in respect to that is that the Army authorities did not order them, but that they were received from the firm in question, signed for, finally approved by the Army authorities, and eventually taken in; but there was no valid check, and consequently very much money was spent out of State funds in this line which ought not to have been spent. The absence of the memoranda which would in the ordinary course, and will no doubt eventually be produced by the Ministry of Finance, commenting upon these reports, makes it somewhat difficult to understand the point of view of the Army and of the Ministry of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to direct special attention to the paragraph 8 in the last two pages, pages 3 and 4, of the Final Report. <Col N="2127" /> I direct special attention to this, because the Ministry of Finance and the Executive Council, as a whole, are even more intimately affected by that item than in respect to other items. Though it is true that the purchase occurred about the same time, the settlement of the account did not take place until very recently, January of this year, and apparently under the direction of the Executive Council.  The paragraph in question refers to the purchase of chemicals and arms.  It appears that even prior to the setting up of the National Army a certain firm in London had been supplying chemicals, chloride of potash, barium nitrate, and D.N.T., and possibly other items also.  From June onwards it appears that orders were given to this firm to supply chemicals in considerable quantities. Records have been submitted showing that up to the end of April, 1923, 32 tons 1 cwt. of chloride of potash, 11 tons 5 cwt. of barium nitrate, and 38 tons 16 cwt. of D.N.T. were delivered in Dublin.  In addition to that, 11 tons 4 cwt. of chloride of potash, 9 tons of barium nitrate, and 5 tons 8 cwt. of D.N.T. were charged to the Army but remained in store in London.</P>
    <P>The important consideration in respect of these chemicals is that the prices were all uniform at 56/- per cwt., or £56 per ton.  Notwithstanding that the deliveries took place over a series of months, there was no change in the price.  The prices were stable, though it is a fact that the market quotations in respect to chloride of potash fell to £28 per ton, or 28/- per cwt.  We have not been able to ascertain the ruling market price of barium nitrate or D.N.T., but it is noticed that the price as invoiced for D.N.T. was at the rate of 2/- per lb. even when a consignment weighing as much as 11 tons was invoiced. Neither the Army authorities nor the Ministry of Finance have been able to give any evidence that any price was arranged or fixed, or that anybody knew what the price ought to be.  No question appears to have been raised when a settlement took place as to whether the price charged was a fair price or a reasonable price.  The <Col N="2128" /> Committee's view is if no price was fixed then attention should have been paid in making the settlement to what was a fair and reasonable price.  No such questions appear to have been asked and a settlement was made without reference to a price.</P>
    <P>Then the same firm was concerned with the sale to the Army of arms.  It appears that 10,000 rifles were the subject of a purchase or of negotiations for a purchase.  Orders were given apparently by the Chief of Staff for these rifles and authority appears to have been given to pay a deposit to a negotiating firm of £2,250.  This £2,250 was paid over by the firm which eventually came under our review, the firm known as Senior Crozier &amp; Co.  It was a firm professing to be engaged in the sale of chemicals; that appears to have been their normal business.  This firm here, of Senior Crozier &amp; Co., was engaged in the sale of arms, and they had negotiations with another firm to whom they paid a sum of £2,250 as a deposit for ten thousand rifles received by that firm for the sole purpose of enabling them literally &ldquo;to secure a definite option on them, (the rifles) from the Disposals Board.&rdquo;  The rifles were never delivered.  The Army was anxious to obtain them, but some reason or other prevented delivery of the rifles.</P>
    <P>The Army being anxious to obtain the rifles and the money having been deposited by the firm who wanted to sell the rifles to the Government, one would have imagined that when the contract for the delivery of the rifles was not fulfilled, any loss that would be occasioned would be borne by the firm which failed to deliver, but it appears in the settlement the Government made that they accepted responsibility for the loss of £2,250, on account of rifles which they were always ready to receive, but which for some reason not disclosed, they were not able to obtain possession of.  An important consideration arises in connection with this, inasmuch as that, in making a settlement, although the Government had legal advice, apparently, and a solicitor attending the settlement in London, no proof was called for that this sum of £2,250 had been, in fact, <Col N="2129" /> paid to anyone.  The receipt was not in possession of the firm who was making the claim.  It was not produced for the evidence of the Government or their solicitor, and apparently only the word of the claimant was called for or relied upon to satisfy the Ministry that this sum of £2,250 had been paid.  But even if it were by any chance regarded as a Government liability to pay this £2,250, one would naturally have expected that they would satisfy themselves by the production of a receipt that such a sum had been paid over.</P>
    <P>Then there is again, with the same firm, the question of the purchase of five Hotchkiss guns.  There is something not understandable in respect to this purchase.  The memory, without records, of the officer primarily responsible was that the price was named at £750, but in the accounts which the Ministry of Finance were ultimately called upon to deal with the guns were charged at £1,000.  It appears clear that £750 was the price paid by the firm in London to the selling firm and the sum of £250 profit, or shall I say addition, surplus, whatever you may call it, was added as gross profit on to the £750 and this sum of £1,000 for the £750 worth of guns was accepted by the Ministry as a liability.  There is a question of 2,500 revolvers in respect to which evidence has not been made available and in respect to those, I do not propose to say anything now. But the facts are clear that the firm with whom the Government was dealing had been entrusted to supply commodities such as chemicals and ammunition, practically without any check upon the price to be charged.  It was found in the course of the inquiry that the Government had questioned the reasonableness of the charges that were being made, or rather shall I say the accounts that were being submitted were not accepted as valid and I think I am right in saying, though I am not quite sure if it appears in the evidence, it was because of the non-delivery of some of the chemicals and some of the ammunition or arms, that legal action was entered upon.  The Ministry for Defence appears to have initiated legal proceedings.  These proceedings were stopped and a settlement appears to <Col N="2130" /> have been arrived at just prior to the entry upon this portion of the Inquiry by the Committee of Public Accounts. While the information made available was not complete, very far from complete, and apparently neither the Minister for Defence nor the Ministry of Finance was in a position to give the whole of the facts, the evidence that was produced before the Committee satisfied us that there was something very unsatisfactory in respect to this whole transaction.</P>
    <P>Perhaps not the least satisfactory fact in the matter was the agreement that was made in respect of the £2,250 in the final settlement.  I have explained that this sum of £2,250 was part payment for 10,000 rifles.  The receipt states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Received the sum of £2,250 ... this amount representing a deposit on the said 10,000 rifles and is received by me for the sole purpose of enabling me to secure a definite option on them from the Disposals Board, and as a result of such deposit I undertake to purchase outright and deliver these 10,000 rifles to a public warehouse to be selected immediately and as soon as the balance of the purchase money, namely, the amounts mentioned in my letter of July 24th, 1922, less the £2,250 above mentioned, have been placed in a bank by you in the form of an irrevocable credit, the terms of which have already been stipulated by me to you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is signed by Horace W. Soley and is dated the 2nd August.  The final settlement entered upon in December, 1924, had, to some extent, to deal with this £2,250.  Apparently, the Ministry was not satisfied that it was a real liability, though they paid it.  They paid it on these terms.  The gentleman who carried on the business of Senior Crozier &amp; Co., and who was the firm, and the gentleman who had to deal with these various transactions was named Francis W. Fitzgerald.  It will be found on page 387 of the Minutes of Evidence that he signed this undertaking, which the Government say they were advised was the utmost that could be secured.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I undertake, in the event of my recovering from H. Soley &amp; Co., the <Col N="2131" /> sum of £2,250, or any sum, to pay to the Minister for Finance of the Irish Free State 50 per cent. of such sum recovered, less the cost of action in recovering from H. Soley &amp; Co., having regard to the fact that they have paid the sum of £2,250 to me, which I have paid to H. Soley &amp; Co. on the contract for the purchase of 10,000 rifles.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Government had no feeling of responsibility, and that when they entered upon legal proceedings they must have been advised that they had a solid ground for their claim.  They entered upon an agreement by which this gentleman, Mr. Fitzgerald, was to be paid, or allowed in the settlement, the sum of £2,250, on the understanding that if he cared to endeavour to recover that sum from H. Soley &amp; Co., then the Government would pay the costs of the legal proceedings leading to that recovery, and would be satisfied with 50 per cent. only of the sum recovered, less the costs of the proceedings&mdash;that is to say, the Government would bear the costs of the legal proceedings and Mr. Fitzgerald would be allowed to retain 50 per cent. of the moneys which the Government had no responsibility for paying, in the first instance.  It is the most extraordinary settlement that I can conceive. I have felt it my duty to direct special attention to the evidence given by officers of the Army and of the Ministry of Finance, and to say that the whole position is most unsatisfactory. It is possible that explanations may be given, explanations that have not been even hinted at, explanations that I know nothing of, but it will be difficult to disabuse the public mind of the thought that the Ministry had been affected by personal considerations when I say that the Mr. Fitzgerald in question is a brother of a Minister of the Executive Council.  I say that with very great regret, but the fact that it is within my knowledge and that, if not disclosed, it would leave us all open to the charge of cloaking knowledge which we had, makes it incumbent on me to state that fact.  I would be the last person to impute responsibility to <Col N="2132" /> one person for the actions of a relative, but I cannot but think that before this settlement took place, there should have been, at least, one resignation from the Executive Council.  The Committee expects that this matter will have to receive further consideration and further inquiry, because of the fact that moneys will appear as having been paid in the succeeding accounts.  But it is not right that matters of this kind should be allowed to run over from one year to another without the facts being brought to the knowledge of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I have stated now all I know of this matter.  I have drawn attention to the evidence and I have met what, I think, may be said to have been the curious absence of criticism in respect of the last report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The watchdogs of public expenditure seem to have been strangely silent since that last report was presented. I certainly feel that the putting off of any discussion in the Dáil of these reports until this date and, then, its taking place only under special pressure from me, is strangely significant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with one point before we go further. I would like to say that no personal considerations were taken into account in the settlement of the particular claim dealt with in the last pages of the third report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We had regard only to the public interest.  I can certainly say that if Mr. Francis Fitzgerald had been somebody whom we had never heard of before, nothing different would have been done.  I regard the whole position in regard to this matter as highly unsatisfactory, for the reason that I believe&mdash;I do not want to put a tooth in it, but I do not want, on the other hand, to be taking up the position of being wise after the event&mdash; that after the Treaty not one of these purchases should have taken place. Arms should not have been got or sought, nor should explosives have been got or sought in this way.  I do not want to seem to be wise after the event in saying that.  Many people were confused after the Treaty, many people took up an equivocal position, and <Col N="2133" /> many people were forced to do things that, I think, they would say now were things that ought not have been done. I say that the position is unsatisfactory in that respect and that it should not have arisen.  After the Treaty was signed, this business was no longer necessary and should have ended.  But there is no use in talking about details in the settlement of a claim which should never have arisen.  When we found ourselves in those circumstances and with these claims, we had only to consider what was the best thing to do, having regard to the public interest.  I could go at much greater length into the matter, but I have said enough, I think, to indicate to members of the Dáil what were the considerations in mind in arriving at that settlement.</P>

      <P>There is one point that, perhaps, Deputy Johnson would make clearer to us.  He leaves me under the impression that he and the Committee were of opinion that in July&mdash;I think he mentioned the year 1922&mdash;the Army authorities had rather tall ideas of the type of furniture they would like to have around them in their quarters.  He pointed to one or two appendices in the report of the Committee of Public Accounts, suggesting to us that, at that time, the quarters of the Adjutant-General and of the Chief of Staff were very sumptuously furnished.  I would like to know if I got a correct impression of what the Deputy said in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only draw my conclusions from the items charged to State funds in respect of the various quarters.  One has no objection, of course, to expenditure&mdash;even lavish expenditure&mdash;at the expense of the persons enjoying the use of the furniture. But this expenditure was out of State funds.  I see, for instance, for the Adjutant-General's quarters the following: Three occasional chairs and one table, £14; blankets, satin quilts, etc., £16; mahogany bureau bookcase, £30; mahogany bedroom suite, £65; one Jacobean sideboard, six oak dining chairs, two carving chairs, one oak dining table, £90; one Axminster carpet, £31 10s.; one Chesterfield and two easy chairs, £39 10s.; one Wilton carpet, <Col N="2134" /> £42 10s.; one plain mauve carpet, £25 10s.; one Axminster carpet, £17 10s.  Then the items for the house of the Chief of Staff at Portobello are set down in the Minutes of Evidence. I do not think it is wise for me to go into details.  For Templemore military barracks there are items which include: Two satin walnut pairs, £25; two ditto, £25; two ditto, £25; two bedroom suites, £50, and so on.  I refer Deputies to the appendix to the Minutes of Evidence for further particulars of these items.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wishes the House to draw the conclusions to which apparently he has come, from an examination of these schedules, I desire to repudiate the suggestion which is made.  I think that persons who wish to charge the Army authorities with sumptuous ideas in the way of furnishing should examine their premises more closely.  They should see the places where those officers do live. To suggest that in 1922 Army officers were thinking of the kind of chairs they sat on, or what kind of price was paid for their carpet, or to suggest that they are thinking of that now, is to suggest something that is not a fact. It would be well to examine even these schedules more closely to see exactly what they do mean.</P>

      <P>I would like the Deputy to understand that I am acting entirely on what is presented in the accounts, and that &ldquo;sumptuous furnishing&rdquo; is simply a matter of comparison. If I used the word &ldquo;sumptuous&rdquo; I had in mind the comparison between what may be said to be expenditure which is reasonably charged to the State, quite apart perhaps from what an individual may think desirable for his own household requirements.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is possible for the Minister to reply to the innumerable small points which crop up in the course of this report.  He has after all, only the information at his disposal which the Accounting Officers had when they came before the Committee. I would like to draw attention to one aspect of the Public Accounts which is referred to by the Committee <Col N="2135" /> in paragraph 11 of their report&mdash;the only paragraph which was not unanimously agreed upon by the Committee. I endeavoured to have it amended but unfortunately without success.  I have no desire to advocate any radical change in the system of public accounts, and I am aware that the Minister is rather impatient of such discussion, as a distinguished Senator, I think, discovered some time ago to his cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that I have no diatriable intention in what I have to say.  This paragraph deals with the problem of the appropriations-in-aid which appear in the Estimates of Public Services as sub-heads in thirty of the Votes, about half the number, and these appropriations-in-aid in the aggregate come to a fairly large sum.  During the year under review they amounted to over £300,000; in the next year they came to over £500,000, and in the present year they are actually in the aggregate about £700,000.  That is to say, there is a turn-over of nearly a million and a half pounds which does not appear on the general balance sheet of the State; £700,000 is collected and £700,000 is expended in excess of the figures which are given in the Budget statement. That is one way of looking at it; the Minister may look at it in another way, and of course there is no attempt at hiding anything, because one has only to read the Estimates to see these various appropriations-in-aid in the Votes. But the practice is growing and has been growing for the past three years, since the establishment of the State. The practice is sanctioned by the Public Accounts Charges Act of 1891.  That Act only sanctioned the practice which had been growing up for some time previously. I happened to look up Hansard in connection with the introduction of that Bill, which was passed without discussion, and I found that the Secretary of the Treasury at the time stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to 1881 the system of dealing with extra receipts was not uniform in the various Departments, and the <Col N="2136" /> Public Accounts Committee had been for some time drawing attention to the fact....</P>
    <P>In 1881 a Treasury minute re appropriations-in-aid was adopted by the Public Accounts Committee.  Since that time a considerable step has been taken in the direction of using these extra receipts and appropriations by way of reduction of the Estimates rather than paying them into the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Act then sanctions this practice of retaining these moneys from the Exchequer by the authority of the Treasury, but in a sub-section of the Act it is stated that this can only be done by the Treasury placing a minute to that effect before Parliament.  The third sub-section of the Act reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Where any fee, penalty, proceeds of sale, or other money of the nature of an extra receipt is, by virtue of this Act or of any other Act (whether passed before or after this Act), or otherwise payable into the Exchequer the Treasury may, by a minute to be laid before Parliament, direct that the whole or any specified part thereof shall be applied as an appropriation-in-aid of money provided by Parliament for the service mentioned in the minute.</P>
    <P>When we consider this Act under which these moneys are withheld from the Exchequer and used to reduce the Estimates we must also take into consideration, as is referred to in paragraph 11 of the report, Article 61 of the Constitution, and in my opinion the practice which has been pursued by the Government is definitely contrary to the spirit of the Constitution.  Article 61 of the Constitution states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>All revenues of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) from whatever source arising, shall, subject to such exceptions as may be provided by law, form one fund, and shall be appropriated for the purposes of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by law.</P>
    <P>I think that it was the intention of those who passed the Constitution that all moneys should be paid into the Central Fund, subject to such exceptions as might be provided by law, and <Col N="2137" /> that meant in the opinion of those who passed the Constitution, subject to any law which was passed subsequently, specifically in order to go outside the original provision of the Constitution. I am sure that when the Adaptation of Enactments Act, which I think was the second Act that was passed by the Oireachtas, was passed Deputies could not have realised the number of Acts which they were adapting to the circumstances of this State, and they had no idea that in passing that Act they were to a certain extent nullifying this Article of the Constitution, because by re-enacting, so to speak, the provisions of the Public Accounts and Charges Act they were to a certain extent nullifying the provisions of Article 61 of the Constitution. Since that time the appropriations-in-aid have actually doubled in value: in the year we are considering they were a little over £300,000; now they are £700,000.  Not only have they increased, but new appropriations-in-aid have been made without any specific legislation, and not only that, but these new appropriations-in-aid have been made without any Treasury minute being placed before the Oireachtas, as is provided by the Public Accounts and Charges Act of 1891.  I do not know what the explanation of this procedure is.  There seems to be a tendency on the part of the Department of Finance to increase this system of appropriations-in-aid, which, in my opinion, is not a good system.  It has grown up largely from a mistake by the British Treasury, and it is not pursued, as far as I can make out, in the public accounts of other countries.  I do not think it is very advisable, and whatever advantages it may have in a large country I do not think the necessity exists in a small country, where the revenue and all the moneys which are paid to the State can easily be brought to the Central Fund in a very short time.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not be aware that these new appropriations-in-aid are being made, but I would refer him to the appropriations of the Department of Agriculture which have been introduced as a result of the new legislation, the Dairy Produce Act, and the various other Acts which impose fees for their <Col N="2138" /> administration.  Quite apart from the constitutional and legal aspect of this question of appropriations in aid I should be very grateful if the Minister would adopt a definite policy as to whether it is to be continued or reduced and ultimately put an end to.  It was stated to the Committee in the course of the evidence that under the British regime extra receipts of less than £1,000 are not allowed as appropriations-in-aid. It was proposed in Ireland to reduce that figure from £1,000 to £200.  The policy is evidently not being pursued at present, because I notice even in this year's estimate there is an appropriation-in-aid of £45 in Vote 35.  The policy is evidently not being carried out if that was the policy. At present, as a result of appropriations-in-aid there is very great confusion in the Estimates and the accounts as they are placed before the Oireachtas.  There are actually over 30 Votes in which appropriations-in-aid appear; that is to say, in which the extra receipts are not paid into the Exchequer.  There are 15 Votes in which extra receipts are not used as appropriations-in-aid, but are paid into the Exchequer.  There are five Votes in which extra receipts are half applied for appropriations-in-aid and half paid into the Exchequer.  There is one Vote where they are used as appropriations-in-aid but are described otherwise. They are not described as appropriations-in-aid in the Estimates.  Deputies must naturally look upon public accounts from a different point of view from the Government.  The Minister for Finance is, I am sure, anxious to save as much money as he can, but Deputies are more anxious to see that the accounts are so simplified that they can be clearly understood by the mass of the people.  They should be unified and simplified in a manner that would in an intelligent democracy enable the people to understand how their money is being collected and spent.  This practice of appropriations-in-aid grew up gradually in other countries, for instance, in Italy, and one of the greatest blessings which Mussolini and his Ministers conferred on the Italian people was to do away with all those appropriations-in-aid. By unifying the <Col N="2139" /> finances of the country, he brought them within a reasonable grasp of the mass of the people, so that they could take an interest in their own finances.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that his Department is hard worked, and that he is not in a position now to indulge in any adventures or new schemes of public accounting, but I suggest if it is his intention to do away with those items and to have a unified system it would be better to do it now in order that in future years we might be able to compare actually the expenditure of the State with former years and it would be much more simple in the end if this change were made as soon as possible. I do not know whether the Minister has made up his mind on this matter.  I hope if he has not that he will be willing to receive memoranda and suggestions from Deputies as to improvements in the public accounts on the lines I suggest.</P>

      <P>The motion proposed by Deputy Johnson asks that the Report of the Committee of Public Accounts in the hands of Deputies for some time should get consideration.  I think Deputy Johnson's persistency and urging to have this matter considered by the Dáil is very commendable because the Committee that sat to consider these accounts were practically, I might say, new brooms for Committee work, and I think it must be recognised that a Committee that sat and considered the accounts or considered any matter of importance&mdash;I suppose if we measure the importance of the work of this Committee by the size of the volume issued we will come to the conclusion that their work must be very important&mdash; would be apt to pall, if I may say so, if it is treated in the way the recommendations and the consideration of the question under review have been treated by this House, when the reports came up.  In no case was any consideration given to those reports.  The final volume has been in the hands of Deputies for some time and we must recognise that the consideration of these accounts would not have been undertaken this session at all but for Deputy Johnson's persistence in having a promise, made some time ago to him, <Col N="2140" /> carried out.  This matter comes on what I might call a tired House.  Personally speaking, I do not feel any particular inclination to go into the whole details of the Committee's Report.  A postponement until we resume after the Recess might have added to the interest of the members in considering the details. However, in this case it comes up practically on the last day of the session.  I only support what I think Deputy Johnson's contention was, that the matter was very belated as far as the Government was concerned and has not got the consideration it deserves.  I will only say the Committee recognise that they were dealing with a period in which very grave difficulties arose. I think the Committee have duly given consideration to that fact and recognised that some of the things that occurred in connection with the accounts were to be explained in that way.  I think the Minister for Finance has recognised, also, that the period dealt with has been an exceptional period and for that reason, perhaps, it is as well that the accounts have come on a tired House without any inclination for analysis of the reports in detail.</P>

One must recognise that Committee work very often is not very congenial, and want of recognition of the work of the Committees of this House will, of necessity, I think, lead to a want of full recognition of the responsibilities by members of the Committees in connection with the work they undertake.  I think it is due to our Chairman to recognise his indefatigable zeal in any matter he undertakes, and more particularly the work of this Committee. As he thought it right and proper that this matter should be raised to-day and not carried over until the House resumes, I, as one member of the Committee, support him.  I spent a considerable amount of time on this Committee, and I support his claim for full consideration of the matters into which he has gone in greater detail.</P>

      <P>I never did expect to go into the question of these Army accounts that have been examined by the Public Accounts Committee. I have not gone very exhaustively into the statements that have been made with regard to them; I do not intend to do so.  There are, however, one or two remarks I would like to make here.  It has been suggested that after the beginning of 1922 the Army accounts began to be carried on, or the handling of the Army moneys began to be carried on, in the old way, and that the old way was a way that led to a very undesirable state of affairs.  In so far as the handling of moneys in the pre-Treaty days went, an examination of the accounts by the Public Accounts Committee showed that the pre-Treaty Army was about the cheapest run Army there ever was. The accounting machinery that was run in connection with that Army was not a very elaborate one, although the present Comptroller and Auditor-General will tell you what he often told us who were responsible for the Army accounts, that the Defence Department accounts in pre-Treaty days were the most satisfactorily rendered accounts he had come to.  As I say, the machinery was not very elaborate.  Personally, I pulled the threads of the accounts together every month.  I remember on one occasion having a kind of toss-up with General Collins as to whether an accounts clerk, who appeared on a very empty horizon, as it was at that time, should go to him or should go to me. Because General Collins had the handling of general finance matters as well I agreed that he should keep him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We began in 1922 with no accounting fabrics of any kind in the Army.  We continued for some months with very little of an accounting fabric except such as grew up of necessity in the Quartermaster-General's Department. If there is anybody responsible&mdash;and there is a person responsible for nothing systematic being done to organise an accounts department since 1922&mdash;that person is myself.  It is very easy to be wise after the event.  A lot of people are very wise after the event and are possibly full of nice theories.  If <Col N="2142" /> their theories were put into operation at the time of the event, perhaps quite a lot of other matters could now be raised.  You must take it that those who were responsible in the beginning of 1922 rose to their responsibilities, whether they were in the accounting, the political or the military branches. They rose to their responsibilities as best they could.  I am not going to suggest that in 1925 there are any matters of accountancy belonging to 1922 that require to be apologised for.  If you are going to examine the 1922 situation and say, &ldquo;You must apologise for that and for that,&rdquo; I hold there is a very big credit side to the account.</P>

      <P>I do not accuse Deputy Johnson of any unfairness in the matter.  I say, however, he is coming to wrong conclusions.  The people who, from the public point of view at any rate, find themselves held up by Deputy Johnson to-day as requiring sumptuous surroundings in their department in 1922, are not going to ask you to examine the credit side of the account.  Speaking for myself, I am very unmoved when the debit side of the account is being examined, and I do think&mdash;Deputy Hewat seems to be of the same opinion&mdash;that even from the point of view of being real critics, critics that will get results in better administration here, the people who set themselves out to teach lessons and give headlines to those around them, could be doing very much better things to-day than inquiring how it came about that potassium chloride was bought in a surreptitious way during 1922, or even in 1923.</P>

As I say, we might be doing much more useful things to-day, if we want to make improvements, than by looking <Col N="2143" /> back to 1922 and seeing why this, that or the other thing was done in a particular way.  I have looked up the index of the report to get at the word &ldquo;grapes,&rdquo; but I cannot find it.  I am told that the Comptroller and Auditor-General found it necessary to inform the Committee that the Army fed on grapes.</P>

      <P>Very likely we will find it indexed next year. As a matter of fact, the Army did not feed on grapes.  I just wanted to say that as regards our accounting system I, personally, was responsible in the beginning of 1922.  The roots of a proper accounting system were not set up in the Army, and I was justified.  It was not because it was necessary to oil any particular kind of machine here by pouring money into it, but because you could not be encumbered by machinery at that particular time.  If I object to the suggestion that Army officers and the Army authorities in July, 1922, wanted to set themselves up sumptuously, I object to it, because a statement like that suggests that if moneys were unaccounted for or unvouched in the earlier portion of that year, they found their way into the pockets of persons who had something to do with the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that Deputy Mulcahy does not take that out of any-think that I, or members of the Committee, have said.  We have gone to some trouble to disavow any such suggestions. We are quite satisfied that so far as personal utilisation of moneys by staff officers, officers of the headquarters staff, is concerned, there is not the slightest reason for believing that any such misuse of moneys was undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will quite understand that I do not for a moment consider that any opinions like that have been entertained by the Committee.  I am speaking of the public effect of statements that would suggest that Army officers <Col N="2144" /> were doing themselves well.  That would be read in conjunction with the fact that there was of necessity, in the earlier part of 1922, money utilised that, when it came to settling up your accounts, could not be accurately vouched for, although it must have been, and naturally was, spent in a proper way.  Actually in the beginning of 1922 a system was put into force by which every soldier had to sign for his money and it broke down.  Many things broke down in June, 1922.  I have to take upon myself considerable responsibility for the fact that there was not a better accounting machine put into force in the Army early in 1922.  I readily take that responsibility. I say that no useful purpose can be served in July, 1925, by sitting down here or anywhere else, to discuss why some other arrangement was not come to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that I agree fully with what Deputy Johnson and Deputy Hewat have said in regard to the importance of the work of the Public Accounts Committee.  I would also say that there has been no lack of consideration of the work of the Public Accounts Committee.  It is obvious that this last month or two, the period since the 1st April, was not the period when either I or the officials in my Department have had the best opportunity of dealing with the first report of the Public Accounts Committee. The Budget has been under consideration, the Estimates have been under consideration, and legislation has proceeded by rapid steps.  We will as soon as possible deal with all the points raised in the Public Accounts Committee's Report and present our minutes to the Public Accounts Committee.  We <Col N="2145" /> will act on the recommendations where they can be acted upon.  If there are any recommendations that we think should be modified or should not be acted upon we will give our views on them to the Public Accounts Committee and enter upon the discussion that is usual with them.  As a matter of fact, it is not essential at all for the proper discharge of the work of the Public Accounts Committee, that their report should be discussed here.</P>
      <P>In Great Britain for a prolonged period while the Public Accounts Committee was doing a most useful work, and while its importance and power was increasing, its reports never came before the House of Commons.  It is only since 1905 that they have been considered, and even since then they have been considered only intermittently&mdash; by no means every year.  Perhaps one year out of every three they have come up for consideration.  The discussion here may serve to underline the remarks of the Public Accounts Committee. It will also call the attention of Deputies to the importance of the Public Accounts Committee.  It will act in the same way on officials in the various departments.  It will impress them with the importance of acting in such a way that no criticism upon them can be passed by the Public Accounts Committee. Once the Public Accounts Committee has issued its report it substantially has done its work.  There is no doubt at all that if we had not the Public Accounts Committee going into the accounts with the patience and in the detail that it has done in its first year here, the financial machinery that we have would lose a great deal of its efficiency.  If we had simply the Comptroller and Auditor-General as an independent officer reporting without the further examination that the Public Accounts Committee gives, and without the support that he gets from the Public Accounts Committee, there is no doubt that the checks which make for proper, honest and efficient administration would not exist in any effective way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know now that any departure from the proper allocation of money, any expenditure that is not in accordance <Col N="2146" /> with the Vote, and expenditure that is in any way improper, any expenditure that is negligent or grossly excessive for its purpose, is going to be brought to the attention of the Dáil and to the attention of the public by the Public Accounts Committee.  An officer working by himself, like the Comptroller and Auditor-General, without the support of the Public Accounts Committee, might do that sort of work in a way, but there is no doubt that he would not have any force behind him. Technically speaking, not only is it not essential that the Public Accounts Committee's report should be discussed in the Dáil, but there is no reason why their recommendations should be adopted.  The facts in England have been such that it is impossible for the Treasury to ignore a recommendation or to refuse to comply with a recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee unless they have some good reason, on considering the matter, which was not present to the Public Accounts Committee.  The Public Accounts Committee has been entirely non-political. It is certainly an institution that, running on non-party lines, doing work which does not get very much publicity, has grown in influence steadily as years went on.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that our Public Accounts Committee here will be recognised&mdash;as I do not think it is recognised at present&mdash;as the most effective guardian the public have for the proper expenditure of money.  It is quite a different thing to have your accounts dealt with as our accounts are dealt with, and have them dealt with as, say, the accounts of a public company are dealt with, where there is a sort of vague report presented by an auditor which may mean anything or nothing. Deputy Johnson indicated its importance when he said that you might compare the arrangement we have with the arrangement that would exist if a shareholder in a company who was opposed to the directors was able to take the report of the auditor of that company, go into it, summon before him the officials of the company, question them, demand that all the papers they have be submitted to him, and then <Col N="2147" /> publish his report.  You will see that the accounts of a great many public companies could not be presented in the form they are now presented if they were to stand that ordeal.  That ordeal that the Public Accounts Committee is able to submit the accounts of the State to, is the greatest possible safeguard for the public.  It is the greatest possible safeguard for the taxpayer and the Exchequer.  It does ensure discipline amongst officials in regard to financial matters and obedience to financial regulations that could not possibly be got in any other way.  There is no doubt that the members of this Committee and particularly the Chairman, deserve recognition for the tremendous work they have done.  The very bulk of the volume of the minutes of evidence shows the time and the care that was spent on investigating the various points that came up for consideration. I would like to say that I appreciate it, and I know this much&mdash; that just as the work of the Comptroller and Auditor-General could not be satisfactorily or efficiently done without the help, the backing and the co-operation of the Public Accounts Committee, neither could the particular sort of work that the Ministry of Finance have to do, be done satisfactorily without the Public Accounts Committee.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible to get compliance but that people are liable to the censure of the Committee of Public Accounts for their negligences and their failures.  If there are any points in this Report that should be dealt with further, they can be dealt with when it is possible for the Department of Finance to submit its minutes on the reports that have already been presented.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Johnson said, the Comptroller and Auditor-General's report was late for various reasons.  Then the report of the Public Accounts Committee was late.  That being their first experience, they were obliged to take a great deal longer period for examination of the accounts and of the Comptroller and Auditor-General's report than would normally be required.  The final report only reached the Department <Col N="2148" /> of Finance and the Dáil about the beginning of April, that is the beginning of the financial year.  That was the very busiest period for the Department of Finance.  We are dealing now, for the first time, with the report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  When we have dealt with two or three reports of the Committee, we will be able to deal more expeditiously with them. This time, we must have the most responsible officials of the Department of Finance directly dealing with the matter. They have not only been concerned with the Budget and with the Estimates, and with matters arising out of the legislation that has been passed, but the new Committee of Public Accounts has been sitting and a certain amount of the time of the officials has been taken up in attending those sittings and preparing matter for the new Committee.  I would put it to Deputy Johnson, therefore, that in the circumstances it cannot be alleged that there has been any undue delay in dealing with these reports on the part of the Department of Finance.  I had hoped that on one or two specific points, minutes would be prepared, even if I could not get minutes covering the whole report, so that it could be satisfactorily dealt with by the Dáil, the two aspects of the case being before it. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to have these points dealt with up to the present.  One of them at least was a matter that could not be dealt with by the Department of Finance alone. It would have required wider consideration, because it had elements in it that were not purely financial elements.</P>
    <P>Certainly before the Dáil reassembles the minutes on the matters dealt with will be available for the Committee of Public Accounts.  They can be considered by that Committee.  Then any matters that may require further discussion or may require decision by the Dáil, can be brought forward.  I want to say in the plainest language that so far as I am concerned I have the highest appreciation of the work of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I have the most lively sense of the importance of its work, and of the importance of the due discharge of its functions.  So far as I am concerned, I will certainly <Col N="2149" /> neither slight it nor hinder it in the due discharge of its duties, nor will I resent full discussion in the Dáil.  I would like to say this: that with a country like this, with a smaller Parliament than they have in Great Britain, it seems to me that we ought to arrange that automatically every year, there would be a day or two for discussion of the reports of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>We are not pressed for time.  For instance, we do not pass Estimates <i>en bloc</i> and use the guillotine as in Great Britain.  There is no reason why we should squeeze out a discussion on the report of the Committee of Public Accounts as they do there.  I am thoroughly in favour of having an opportunity given annually for discussion of the report.</P>
    <P>With reference to the point that was put up by Deputy Esmonde, I am very conscious of the force of the argument that he put forward in favour of reviewing that feature of many Estimates&mdash;&ldquo;Appropriation-in-aid.&rdquo; But in the case of certain Estimates, I think there are reasons why it would be difficult to do it.  For instance, we have, in the case of the Department of Agriculture, brought the whole service on the Vote, and what was formerly the Endowment Fund now comes in as an &ldquo;Appropriation-in-aid.&rdquo;  I do not think we could do anything in that case without further legislation.  Generally speaking, I am of opinion that we ought to simplify our accounts by the abolition of the &ldquo;Appropriation-in-aid.&rdquo; On the other hand, there is the argument put forward by the Committee of Public Accounts in favour of the retention of Appropriation-in-aid, and it is obviously one of the matters that must be further discussed with the Committee of Public Accounts before any definite policy can be decided on.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the position of the Minister for Finance, and on behalf of the Committee, if I may, I thank him for his appreciation of our work.  I would point out, of course, that the Report which called for comment by the Minister for Finance, is last December's report, not the April <Col N="2150" /> one.  I am not finding very much fault with the failure of the Ministry of Finance to make these comments up to this date, I know that they will come, and I know that they will be very valuable when they do come.  But I wanted to draw attention to the fact that, if we were to discuss the reports, we were doing so without the assistance which these comments would have given. Yet, I felt that, adjourning as we are for four months, in justice to the whole service and to the Committee of Public Accounts, the reports should be brought to the attention of the Dáil in a formal manner, as has been done this afternoon.</P>
      <P>On the point that Deputy Esmonde raised, I would say that I do not think that the Committee of Public Accounts &mdash;even last year's Committee&mdash;was very positive in its view of the question of Appropriations-in-Aid and how they should be dealt with.  They certainly were not convinced that a decisive case had been made for any change. Being novices, we are naturally conservative, and being conservative we thought it well not to advise or recommend any change until more experience had been gained and until better foundation for a proper judgment had been secured.  I still think that that should weigh with us and that we should not make the drastic change that Deputy Esmonde advocates, until we have had more experience of the value, or otherwise, of the device of &ldquo;Appropriations-in-Aid.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There are two questions on the adjournment: one is a question raised by Deputy Johnson with regard to the constitutional relationship between the Executive Council and the Governor-General, and the other is a question regarding the roads, on which the Minister for Local Government and Public Health wishes to make a statement.  We will take Deputy Johnson's question first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to raise a big constitutional debate, but I think it is necessary to make some reference to the statement which appears in this morning's papers as having been made by the Governor-General in London, inasmuch as it sets forth a certain constitutional doctrine.  As constitutional doctrine, constitutional law, if I may use the term, grows by virtue of such statements, it is necessary that a counter-statement should be made, or, at any rate, that some protest or demurrer should be made.  The statement appears in inverted commas as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is the modern jargon to say that the King must be advised by his Ministers.  But I have had the audacity to tell my Ministers that they had better take the advice of an old man.  This idea that the Sovereign has not the power of initiative, the power of remonstrance, or of insistence on reconsideration is, in my opinion, as great an error as the notion that mere feudal tyranny can be tolerated any longer.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may seem presumptuous for me to put my view against that of so distinguished an official as the Governor-General, but I think it is a very great pity that he should have allowed himself to use such a term in respect to the <Col N="2152" /> constitutional practice which we have adopted, the constitutional phraseology which we have adopted both in our form of Constitution and in much of our legislation and our resolutions, and that he should describe it as &ldquo;jargon.&rdquo; I referred to two or three dictionaries and I found that there is general unanimity that jargon is (1) &ldquo;confused, unintelligible talk, gabble and gibberish; (2) rude and harsh language; unintelligible talk; a mixture of two or three or more languages; (3) peculiar phraseology of a party, sect, etc., gibberish, lingo, cant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, when we have set forth in our Constitution that the Governor-General acts on the advice of the Executive Council and that he must be advised by his Ministers&mdash;as the King must be advised by his Ministers, as the Governor-General states&mdash;following the law and practice and constitutional usage operating in the Dominion of Canada, and when the phraseology of our own legislation and our own Constitution is described by the Governor-General as &ldquo;jargon,&rdquo; I think it is time to draw attention to the fact that we, at least, do not recognise it as &ldquo;unintelligible talk, gabble or gibberish&rdquo;; that we actually mean that the Governor-General acts in all his official actions on the advice of the Executive Council. I think that it is quite reasonable, often very desirable, that the Council which is the king to us&mdash;the Executive Council, representing the people&mdash;should be willing to accept the advice of an old man, if that old man has experience and wisdom.  It is very desirable as a practice that the Executive Council should always listen to that advice.  But when that is followed up by pointing to the power of initiative and the power of remonstrance, and the insistence on the reconsideration&mdash;while it may be formally and legally a correct statement of the position of the representatives of the Crown&mdash;if we do not take note of it and point out that it is merely the formal legal position, and not the true constitutional position, created by usage or practice, we may find ourselves faced with this statement of the constitutional position in a few years' time, and find it an obstacle to <Col N="2153" /> our constitutional development.  I am prepared to risk the charge of presumptuousness by putting my view forward, that the advice even of a young man who may succeed an old man, should be received and given heed to by the Executive Council, but that we should not assume the right of the Governor-General to use his power of initiative and remonstrance and insistence on reconsideration of the Acts of the Executive Council.  While I say that there may be a formal legal right to do these things we must make the constitutional practice such that he does not do these things.</P>

      <P>If we had any desire to be flippant with the Deputy, it would be open to us to say that the Executive Council did not advise his Excellency the Governor-General to make that particular speech, or any speech, last evening, and that consequently it is at least questionable whether we should be called upon to answer for it or to comment on it here.  The further point arises as to the accuracy of the Press reports of the Governor-General's speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be accurate; we do not know, and the Deputy will perhaps agree that a summarised and condensed report of a speech very often does either more or less than justice to the speaker and is liable to misconstruction. The official actions of the Governor-General of the Irish Free State are, of course, as the Deputy has pointed out, governed by Article 51 of the Constitution.  The Executive acts performed by him are done on the advice of the Executive Council, and not otherwise.  There has been no departure from the spirit or the letter of that Article of the Constitution, and I can safely guarantee on behalf of the Executive Council that there will be no such departure.  It seemed to me that something turns on the use of the word &ldquo;advice,&rdquo; and that the word in this connection has been used loosely.  The President and the Executive Council receive advice from many people, some of <Col N="2154" /> it good advice and some of it not quite so good.  Deputy Johnson has been good enough to advise us frequently; occasionally with benefit to ourselves and to the public we have acted on that advice, and frequently we have not so acted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Advice in that connection is merely an expression of opinion tendered by somebody with an interest, presumably, in the general welfare of the community, and tendered out of good will and perhaps out of special knowledge.  The Governor-General or any other citizen may tender advice of that nature to Ministers or to people who are not Ministers, and it is simply open to them to accept or reject that advice.  But the word &ldquo;advice&rdquo; used in Article 51 of the Constitution has a different meaning when it is used in the sense of the Executive Council advising his Excellency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that case the word &ldquo;advice&rdquo; is a signification of the decision of the Council in matters of policy, and when and if that advice is not acted upon I quite agree with the Deputy that a constitutional crisis of the first magnitude arises.  We have had no such crisis, and I feel that I can assure the Deputy that there is no probability of any such crisis arising.  If at any time a crisis of that nature should develop it could be dealt with, but I suggest that the Deputy is attaching unwarranted importance to a humorous remark attributed to his Excellency which was never intended to bear the interpretation that the Governor-General had at any time acted, or would at any time in the future act, otherwise than in accordance with Article 51 of the Constitution. We do not need to raise any thorny discussion about the divine right of kings; we can possibly agree that it has been settled before our time, and settled to the general benefit of the community.  It is not a matter that we have had any occasion to give grave consideration to, and it scarcely arises.  Article 51 of the Constitution defines the question so far as we are concerned.  The Governor-General, in <Col N="2155" /> official executive acts, acts on the advice of the Executive Council and not otherwise.  If from time to time the Executive Council receives advice from the Governor-General, using the word &ldquo;advice&rdquo; in an entirely different context, it is open to the Executive Council in its wisdom, or unwisdom, to accept or reject that advice.  The Constitution does not enter into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate on the Estimates of my Department, and on several occasions subsequently, questions were put to me as to what is the policy of my Department with regard to the roads.  For one reason or another it has been very difficult to formulate any definite policy.  One reason that makes it rather difficult is that another Minister, the Minister for Finance, is very largely involved in this matter, and it is not until we have had an opportunity of consulting with him on this very important matter, involving questions of revenue and finance generally, which will take us a long time to consider, that we can hammer out a definite policy.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is also to some extent involved.  Up to the present, therefore, I have not been able to come before the Dáil with a clear-cut definite policy, but as I gave an undertaking that I would make a statement before the end of the session I will do my best to carry it out and will deal generally with the question of roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is frequently stated that the transport problem is due to the growth of mechanical road traffic.  This is but part of the truth, for at no time in the history of the country can it be said that there was a liberal expenditure on road maintenance.  Even as late as the year 1914 the average cost of maintenance to the ratepayers was less than £15 per mile, while in 1924, although wages had risen in the meantime about 150 per cent., the expenditure on road maintenance averaged in local rates less than £30 per mile&mdash;a rise of about 100 per cent. on the 1914 figure.  In <Col N="2156" /> fourteen out of the twenty-seven administrative counties the percentage increase over the 1914 figures was even less (Counties of Carlow, Donegal, Kerry, Kilkenny, Leitrim, Leix, Longford, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary N.R., and Westmeath).  To tar a road to-day costs about £120 per mile for a width of twelve feet.  That will give an idea as to the increase in the cost of road maintenance as compared with the proportionate increase in rates.</P>
    <P>The roads were not in a condition to withstand the heavy mechanical traffic or even the lighter motor car&mdash;the latter injures the crust while the former injures both crust and foundation. Some years ago a scheme of motor transport for agricultural districts was projected, but the proposal fell through because the roads selected were found unsuitable.  No such consideration in recent years has retarded the development of road transport, although, in fact, most of the roads are quite unsuitable for heavy mechanical traffic. The revenue derived from the taxation of motor vehicles represents about one-third of the sum expended from rates on the upkeep of the roads, but the damage which they inflict upon the roads must be far in excess of this proportion. There are two courses open, namely, either to place a high tax on the vehicle doing most damage and to expend it on road improvement and maintenance, or to restrict the weight and speed.  The existing taxation upon the private car scarcely requires increasing from the point of view of damage, nor is it necessary to put a further general restriction on its speed. There is a large body of opinion in favour of allowing a speed in excess of twenty miles an hour.  The taxation of the heavy commercial vehicle is admittedly inadequate for the damage done. There is no doubt that a greater tax must be placed on the heavy vehicle, but such a tax must not be so great as to drive the lorry off the road altogether.  Another remedy must also be applied, and that is by way of reduction in the laden weight.  At present the maximum laden weight of a heavy motor car is twelve tons.  The Roads Advisory Committee recommend <Col N="2157" /> that for vehicles not yet used on the roads of the State the maximum laden weight of the vehicle should be fixed at nine tons, and that vehicles already in use in excess of this weight might be allowed to use the roads under a licence at special charges.  I think that there is a large body of opinion which would be disposed to reduce the maximum weight still lower than nine tons.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to apply this policy in regard to heavy motor cars; the fixing of the maximum laden weight at 9 tons can be done immediately by regulation. The other part of the recommendation requires legislation and will be dealt with in the next Finance Bill. Many of these vehicles are already licensed for the present motor tax year which ends on the 31st December.</P>
    <P>On the question of restricting speed nothing can be done usefully by regulation or fresh legislation.  If the existing regulations were enforced they are ample to meet all requirements, and the matter has been specially brought before the Minister for Justice.  The legal maximum speeds of a heavy lorry vary from five miles to twelve miles per hour, according to weight and nature of tyre. We all recognise in a great many cases the limit is exceeded by heavy lorries. The existing regulations regarding widths of tyres of heavy motor cars apply only to tyres other than those made of a soft or elastic material.  In no case can the width of an iron tyre be less than five inches, and if the regulations are complied with it may be as much as 14½ inches in certain cases.</P>
    <P>It was not considered necessary to make regulations regarding widths of rubber tyres, as it was felt that the matter could safely be left in the hands of the manufacturers.  This reason still holds for the pneumatic tyre, but a practice has grown up of fitting narrow solid rubber tyres to broad rims. Although the Committee do not recommend any alteration in the existing regulations regarding tyres of motor vehicles it is felt that a regulation with respect to the widths of rubber tyres may be necessary, and the matter is at present being examined.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the question of the width of tyres, the position of the horse-drawn <Col N="2158" /> vehicle fitted with iron tyres cannot be overlooked.  Many such vehicles carry heavy loads, especially timber, and it will be necessary to lay down a minimum width in these cases.  Even a concrete road cannot stand up to narrow iron tyres bearing heavy loads. Legislation will, however, be required, and a period of at least two or three years allowed to enable the necessary alterations to be made.</P>
    <P>A copy of the Roads Advisory Committee's report on motor taxation is being circulated, but until the recommendations have been fully considered by the Minister for Finance no announcement thereon can be made.  It is obvious that if a tax on motor spirit were substituted for the present system it would have to be higher than is generally believed unless the Road Fund is to suffer loss.  In order to get the same revenue that we have from the present tax it would be necessary to allow for a 30 per cent. loss for non-compliance. That is the usual estimate with regard to motor taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, it would mean about 8d. a gallon on petrol.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>It would probably mean a great deal more.  It would mean that to bring the receipts up to the present figure, assuming you would have general compliance with the law, you would have to allow 30 per cent. more for non-compliance.  Seeing that an increase and not a dimunition is required in the Fund, if it is to meet to any considerable extent the cost of providing roads for modern traffic, any scheme which would involve loss cannot be considered.</P>
      <P>I may say that, personally, I think a motor spirit tax has very many advantages over the present system.  It is one, however, that requires further consideration.  As I say, I am not in a position to pronounce definitely in favour of one tax or another at present. It will ultimately be a matter more for the Ministry of Finance than for the Ministry of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question of carrying out a comprehensive road scheme, I have, with the assistance of the Roads Advisory Committee and Chief Roads <Col N="2159" /> Engineer, settled on a scheme for the improvement of what may be regarded as the national highways of the State. This scheme has been placed before the Department of Finance, and I am at present awaiting a decision in the matter. The scheme contemplates the improvement of approximately 1,500 miles out of the 4,000 miles of trunk roads and would extend probably over a period of three years.  The object in view is to bring this 1,500 miles to a standard which would give a road life of eight to ten years, and while a provisional estimate of the cost has been made at £3,820,000, a close survey of the roads will be necessary before it is possible to reach a strictly accurate estimate of the amount required.  If sufficient funds were available roads might be laid in asphalt or concrete, but except in very rare cases, we cannot hope to lay down anything more enduring than tar-bitumen macadam. In the extremely heavy traffic areas a superior form of construction will be adopted.  Besides surface improvement the scheme embraces the strengthening of foundations, where necessary, the removal of dangerous corners, the cutting of hedges and trees, the widening, kerbing and drainage of roads, easing of gradients, improvement of culverts, and provision of warning and direction posts.  The scheme would be carried out by the local authorities, and when the specification and estimate have been approved for each road or section of road the local authority would be required to invite tenders for the work: they <Col N="2160" /> would also be permitted to submit proposals to have the work carried out by direct labour.</P>
    <P>In considering the details of the scheme, special care will be taken to meet the requirements of each area.  For instance, in the case of roads near cities and large towns where traffic is particularly heavy an effort will be made to provide a greater width of carriageway than in the open country.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent, if at all, this scheme can be financed by a special grant from the Central Fund, and I have suggested to the Department of Finance that the revenues of the Road Fund might be anticipated and provision made accordingly, as in the case of last year, by a Road Fund Advances Act.</P>
    <P>I hope to be able to put this scheme into operation, but apart from the question of finance, one of the greatest difficulties which Local Authorities will encounter is the provision of road plant of an adequate nature.  This difficulty, may, however, be got over by the scheme being largely carried out by contractors already in possession of plant or who may find it in their interest to acquire a large amount of plant.</P>
    <P>As soon as I am informed whether the scheme can be financed the matter will be forthwith initiated with the Local Authorities.  That is as far as I am in a position to deal with the question of road policy at present.</P>
