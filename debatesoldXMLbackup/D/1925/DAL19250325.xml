      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that an award of £102,500 was confirmed by the German Government on the 15th September, 1924, to the Limerick Steam Ship Company, Ltd., Limerick, and that no payment has been received so far by the Company; whether he is aware that in similar circumstances British claimants are being paid on the basis of fifteen shillings in the pound within six weeks of the award, and, further, whether he has any information to give regarding the position of Saorstát claimants against the German Government.</P>

The Clearing Office at London is the only channel available under the Treaty of Versailles for the settlement of claims of Nationals of Saorstát Eireann against Germany as provided by the Treaty.  The extent to which, if at all, the Government of Saorstát Eireann should assume any responsibility in this matter has been the subject of protracted correspondence with the British Government, and as all material points appear now to have been fully explored, it is hoped that a settlement of the matters at issue may be reached immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, with reference to compensation for post-truce losses, he will state the total amount of claims officially lodged in 1922/3, 1923/4, 1924/5; the total amount awarded in respect of such claims in 1922/3, 1923/4, 1924/5; the total amount actually paid to claimants in 1923/4 in respect of awards made in 1922/3, and, separately, in respect of awards made in 1923/4; also, the total amount actually paid to claimants in 1924/5 in respect of awards made in 1922/3, and, separately, in respect of awards made in the years 1923/4 and 1924/5; whether similar information as to claims, awards, and payments, in respect of compensation for pre-truce losses will be given, and, further, if he will state the total amount received, up to date, by the Saorstát Government from the British Government on this latter account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to post-truce damage to property, I regret that I am unable to give this information in the form in which the Deputy desires it, as it would entail an individual search of many thousands of files.</P>
      <P>The aggregate amount of claims lodged under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923, in respect of post-truce injuries to property is approximately, £14,380,000.  The amount of decrees and reports lodged with my Department is approximately £2,150,000, of which £720,000 is subject to a reinstatement condition, and can be paid only as the work of rebuilding proceeds.  Of the remaining £1,430,000, there has been paid, £1,409,445 in cash and securities as follows:&mdash;1922/3, £7,718 (cash); 1923/4, £50,574 (cash), and £47,750 securities: (to date), £858,953 cash, and £444,450 securities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures are exclusive of payments <Col N="1348" /> for damage to the property of railway companies, the amounts of which are as follows:&mdash;1922/23, £30,058; 1923/24, £285,655; 1924/25, £90,894 (to date).</P>
    <P>Claims for compensation in respect of pre-truce property losses are not lodged with my Department in the first instance, but with the Compensation (Ireland) Commission.  It is not possible, therefore, to furnish with regard to the lodgment, etc., of these claims the particulars which the Deputy has asked for.  The total of the awards received by my Department from the month of June, 1922, when the Commission started operations, up to the present, is approximately six and a half million pounds.  All of this has been paid with the following exceptions: (1) Conditional awards, totalling approximately £700,000, the owners of which have not yet completed the reinstatement of their premises, and which have consequently not yet matured for payment, and (2) unconditional awards, totalling approximately £200,000, which have only very recently been issued by the Commission, and which are being discharged as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>The total amount received up to the present from the British Government in respect of pre-truce damage to property is, roughly, two and a half million pounds, but I may point out that the adjustment is not yet by any means completed, and that further substantial sums are still outstanding which it is expected will come to credit at an early date.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he can state what steps are being taken to clear the bed of the River Maigue to enable vessels to navigate the river as far as Adare, and if he is aware that at the present time vessels are unable to proceed to Adare owing to the channel being silted up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE (replying)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Maigue navigation from Adare to the River Shannon is in the charge of the Commissioners of Public Works. No representations have been made to <Col N="1349" /> those Commissioners recently as to the need for dredging; and no dredging has in fact ever been carried out by them in the river (which is tidal), except at Ferry Bridge, about 3½ miles from Adare.</P>
      <P>I understand that there has been practically no traffic on this navigation for many years past.</P>

      <P>A surveyor was despatched to Cobh immediately information as to this casualty was received. He spent the day of the 28th ultimo on board making the fullest inspection possible of the damage.  The vessel was making no water, and the surveyor's examination, together with the report of the diver who went down to examine the hull, showed that she was in a seaworthy condition to proceed, without passengers, to Liverpool.  She was conveyed by a tug from Cobh and reached Liverpool on the 29th ultimo.</P>

      <P>I have no information as to the present position of the machinery in these mines, which, I am aware, have been closed for a considerable time.  Some twelve months ago, however, the owning company informed my Department that the plant and machinery were being kept in good order, and I have no reason to suppose that the company has ceased to carry on this maintenance work.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state what are his intentions with regard to unemployment insurance, in view of the approaching expiry of the Fourth Benefit Year under the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1924, and whether he intends to introduce a further Unemployment Insurance Bill.</P>

      <P>No decision has yet been taken to provide for any special extension of unemployment benefit on the termination of the Fourth Benefit Year.  It will be necessary to ascertain the number of persons then unemployed as compared with the number who will still be entitled to benefit.</P>
      <P>In the present state of the Unemployment Fund, which is in debt to an amount considerably over £1,000,000, any extension of benefit beyond the provision that will be available under existing Acts on the termination of the Fourth Benefit Year requires most serious consideration.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether the application <Col N="1352" /> for unemployment benefit of the employees of the Galway Woollen Mills, at present working part time, has been refused, and, if so, whether he will state the reason why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to qualify for the receipt of unemployment insurance benefit it is necessary for a claimant to prove that he is continuously unemployed.  Continuous unemployment for the purposes of the Unemployment Insurance Acts is defined in Section 7 (2) (B) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, as amended by Section 3 (3) of the (No. 2) Act, 1921.</P>
      <P>From inquiries which I have made I have ascertained that in January last the Galway Woollen Mills put their workpeople on a system of short-time by which a number of their employees were engaged three days and unemployed for the remaining three days in each week.  This system, which lasted only about two weeks, did not permit the workers to satisfy the condition of continuous unemployment, and consequently unemployment benefit would not have been payable to them in such circumstances.  Subsequent to the termination of this system of three days &ldquo;on&rdquo; and three days &ldquo;off&rdquo; which, as I have stated, lasted only two weeks, the workers were put off and re-employed by the firm according to the fluctuations of the work, and since then forty claims have been lodged by the workers.  In no case has benefit been refused, and in only one case is there at present any doubt as to whether benefit will be paid.  The doubt in this case arises from the fact that the applicant concerned is a married woman and her claim has been referred to the local Court of Referees to advise whether, in their opinion, and having regard to all the circumstances of her case, she is available for employment, as required by Section 11 (4) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920.</P>

      <P>The Minister can answer this question if he will.  He said that Canada had intimated to the League of Nations its non-acceptance of the Protocol.

Has that had the attention of the Ministry here?</P>

      <P>The Minister said he was not quite sure that he understood the previous question of mine.  May I put it this way:&mdash;The Protocol has been injuriously affected by the decision taken by Great Britain in the substitution of an alternative to it.  Will this House, when it comes to consider the matter, have both alternatives before it, and be in the position to advance and support either of them independently at the Assembly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the question is even less understandable than it was before.  The Deputy refers to the Protocol and to the counter-proposition made by Great Britain.  If we propose accepting either the Protocol or the counter-proposition by Great Britain&mdash;possibly the case might arise of the necessity for deciding for or against the proposition or some formal proposition that the Deputy refers to as being made by Great Britain&mdash;that <Col N="1356" /> would be referred here before we could be committed to it.</P>

We intended to adjourn on Friday, the 3rd April, until Tuesday, the 21st, or possibly Wednesday, the 22nd April.  That would give more than a fortnight, and I think it would meet the Deputy's point.  In regard to the business here to-day, we intend to take item No. 1 first, and then item No. 2.  If I had any sort of understanding that item No. 12 was not regarded as contentious, that is the Military Service Pensions Bill.  I would ask it to be taken next, but if it were regarded as contentious.  I would give way to item No. 3 on the agenda, which could be taken now and disposed of.

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>If the question had been raised by any other Deputy I would be disposed to give favourable consideration to it, but the remarkable lucidity with which Deputy Figgis criticises any financial proposals, leads me to believe that he is scarcely earnest in the objection he has raised, more especially in view of the fact that I have undertaken that the major business of the Dáil&mdash;if it could be possible to use a larger term I would use it&mdash; after the Easter Recess will be financial business.

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of not giving Estimates to us in time.  But on the question of the business before us, the Financial Resolutions may well take us the next two days; there are other Bills before the House, and we had an announcement from the Minister for Justice some weeks ago regarding the programme of business. As the Minister has said the intention, as announced, was to devote the greater portion of the time succeeding Easter to financial business, but there are a number of Bills that were promised&mdash;if that is the right word to use; threatened, as some people might say&mdash; which I cannot see passing unless we are to rush them at the end of the period.  There are other matters which have not been dealt with, obviously matters that are likely to come forward.  For instance, we have had circulated the report regarding the Shannon scheme, and I take it that that will require some discussion.  No allowance has been made in the programme for that.  There possibly may be a report in respect of the Boundary; no allowance has been made for that. There is the inevitability, as I suggest, notwithstanding the Minister's reply to-day, that an Unemployment Insurance Bill will have to be discussed at a very early date; no allowance has been made for that.  We would have expected a month or two ago that some measures relating to Dublin city and county local government would be brought to us.  No allowance has been made in the programme for that subject to be discussed.  I desire to ask <Col N="1365" /> whether there has been any revision of the legislative programme since the announcement on the 13th February.</P>

      <P>In regard to the point that I raised, I am delighted to see that the President has so far recruited his health as to recover his wonted cheerfulness, but still it does not meet my point.  It is usually the case that, roughly, one-third of the period, four months on account of twelve, is dealt with, but in some cases it is more than three, and in some cases it is less in this paper that has been distributed to us, and the reason for these variations no one can discover until he has had an opportunity of analysing these Estimates.

But we should not forestall the detailed discussion on the Estimates on the Vote on Account.  The point that Deputy Johnson raises is a general point, and if I might make a suggestion, the best procedure would be to discuss one, or if necessary more than one, general question of policy on the Vote on Account, rather than to discuss things that will more properly arise when we are discussing the Estimates separately and in detail.</P>

      <P>I am in entire agreement with you, sir, on the matter.  It would be just the same if I were not, because they should have your approval, and it is perfectly right that they should.  Nevertheless it does occur that there are variations as to the proportions of the Vote on Account, and questions with regard to the why and wherefore of these variations would be very pertinent.  But they might prove very unnecessary if we had an opportunity of examining the Estimates beforehand.  In any case it is surely a sound principle that people who are asked to consider a Vote on Account should have an opportunity of considering the bulk items contained in that Vote.</P>

      <P>There is one question in connection with which, after a hurried glance over the Estimates, it appears to me to be improper to ask people to make a Vote on Account, and that is the Army Estimates.  I think the presentation of the Estimates for the Army in their present form does not justify us in agreeing to a Vote on Account unless we are furnished with the various figures as to how the accounts are made up.  We were promised these at this time last year, and now we have the accounts before us again in the same form as last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Deputy is mistaken in that.  I think it was not before the House at all last year.  I promised that last year's Estimates would contain full particulars, and they did when they were available. I had hoped that we would have had the Estimates in the complete and final form before the House at least a week ago, but it was found impossible owing to the changes that had to be made in the transfers to get them out.  We give them to-day, not quite in complete form, because in the case of the Army Estimate, Part 3 of the Estimate is missing; there is only Part 1 and Part 2.  There is not the complete detail that there will be when we publish the volume in the course of a week or so. The only thing I have to say is that if we have not yet succeeded in getting out the Estimates in the time we would like, we have each year made some <Col N="1367" /> improvement.  I think the first year there were no Estimates until about the 19th April.  The Vote on Account had been passed before the 31st March. But last year we had them rather earlier.  This year for the first time we have been able at least to hand Deputies almost the complete Estimates before we came for the Vote on Account.  I believe that we have got over most of the difficulties that had in previous years delayed the Estimates, and that this is the last time that Deputies will be asked to make Votes on Account without having had fairly reasonable time to look over the detailed Estimates.  But at any rate now, for the first time, in asking for this Vote on Account, we have given Deputies the Estimates.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson raised two matters in reference to my Department.  One was the question of an Unemployment Insurance Bill.  On the day on which the Minister for Justice made his statement with regard to future legislation.  I think he said that any Bill not presented for First Reading before the 31st March, or the date of the Recess, would not be considered as urgent, and would not be put into effect before the autumn.  On that very day Deputy Johnson raised the question of unemployment insurance, and the general effect of my reply was that if an Unemployment Insurance Bill was to be introduced before the Recess, it would, nevertheless, rank as an urgent measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, the Minister gave an answer to-day which, I am sure, will raise a great deal of consternation in the country.  If it reads as I understood it orally, it would appear that the Minister is very doubtful whether he is going to extend unemployment insurance beyond the limit which would depend on the amount of credits in the insured person's account.  That will mean that in two or three weeks of the new year people will be going out of benefit, and already there are people very doubtful as to whether they would have any benefits at all.  I would like, if it were possible, for the Minister to give us some indication before we proceed from this subject, that he is contemplating a renewal of the scheme that has been in operation, at least as good a scheme as that, so far as unemployed persons are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think my answer to-day was fairly definite on that point, that there was one bar which prevented me from bringing in any legislation at the moment, that is to say, the lack of material on which to form a judgment.  It is necessary to ascertain the number of people unemployed at the end of the fourth benefit year, that is to-day.  If I were to go on the figures I have before me, the figures being merely an estimate, there is not any grave reason for an extension of the present unemployment benefits.  I would have to wait for the complete figures on which to base a judgment, and it is possible that we will not have these figures before we adjourn.  Consequently, it would be the end of April or the beginning of May before this matter can be brought forward in legislation.  The way that that difficulty can be met in the meantime is that there are certain works falling due, and I can hasten them and endeavour to speed up anything that is under contemplation in that way to enable those to get work who will fail to get special benefit under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter that the Deputy raised was with regard to the Shannon, and I think that the President, in dealing with the Committee on Procedure, stated that there was certain Shannon legislation which it would not be possible <Col N="1369" /> to introduce before the Recess, and which it would be necessary, if approved by the Dáil, to get through the Dáil before we adjourn for the summer. In order to give a chance of discussing it at the earliest date, I intend to bring before the Executive Council to morrow the terms of a resolution which, if they approve of it, will on their behalf be moved here on Wednesday or Thursday of next week.  It will be a general resolution of such a type that discussion can take place on it corresponding to what would take place on the Second Reading of a Bill dealing with the Shannon as a particular scheme.  I want to give that opportunity, because the legislation that we have in mind with regard to the Shannon scheme is of a very general nature and it is quite possible that there would not be an opportunity for that discussion on the scheme which it is necessary to give. Consequently, if the Executive Council approve of the resolution regarding the Shannon project, it would be discussed in this House on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday of next week.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister indicate in connection with this resolution which he proposes to bring forward for next week if he would look for a decision from the Dáil that would influence the question?  I raise the question simply because very little time or opportunity is being given to absorb the contents of the books that have been issued, either by the public or by the members of the Dáil.  If the matter came up for discussion on a resolution next week, I do not think the members of the Dáil would have the power to speak with any authority on the question.</P>

The reason is that the Army (Temporary Provisions) Acts expire on the 31st March, and it is necessary, if we are not to allow the Army to become a rabble and have no authority over it, that we should have this Bill passed before the 31st March.  That is the reason, and the only reason, why this resolution is brought forward.

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second <Col N="1375" /> Reading of this Bill.  This Bill is to give the Executive Council power to revoke pensions that may be granted, and to revoke them for causes stated. It is felt that in the case of people getting pensions from the State the Executive Council should have some control over these pensions, and that they should be in the position to revoke the pension if the pensioner commits acts against the constitutional law of the country.  The Bill, as it stands, will not affect any acts that have been committed up to the present. It is not retrospective in any way.  It is based on Section 15 of the Army Act, which deals with the manner in which officers may be discharged from the Army.  Full notice in writing must be given to the person whose pension it is proposed to revoke, so as to give him an opportunity of stating his side of the case, and it must be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> in the ordinary way so that the Dáil and the public will know what is taking place, and if anybody has any grievance whatever against the action taken by the Executive Council he can always have this House to fall back upon to have the grievance remedied.  I ask the Dáil to give this Bill a Second Reading.  Its passing will facilitate the granting of some pensions that at the present moment are held up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to oppose the Second Reading, but I want to express my doubt as to the wisdom of this kind of measure.  We have voted pensions to ex-soldiers under certain circumstances.  The only reason for the revocation of these pensions is some act which would make the recipient amenable to the courts and that he would be convicted of some offence. The proposition now is that the pension may be revoked at the discretion of the Executive Council, subject, I acknowledge, to certain possible checks arising from the publication of the fact that such a revocation has been proposed. I feel it is a very doubtful procedure to leave the revocation of pensions in the hands of a political executive. The general procedure has been to consider Civil Service pensions, for instance, as deferred pay and revokable <Col N="1376" /> possibly under the law by Ministerial action.  But I think that is probably unheard of except there has been an indictable offence, or, at least, an offence proved in the courts.  In the case of military service pensions, I think it is invariably the case that the pension shall be made irrevocable except in the case of an offence proved before a court.  The principle we are now asked to adopt here is to make the pension revocable at the discretion of the Executive Council for the time being, subject only to the kind of supervision which is very thin and doubtful and which would require a definite motion in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I think that case has not been made, and it should be made before we are asked to pass this measure.  I believe the reasons which may be in the mind of the Executive Council are not sufficiently strong.  I think that any justification for revocation of pensions granted in the way we have legislated for in the Military Service Pensions Act would be possible after conviction, and if there is no conviction then the amount of damage the State might suffer would be very small.  It would be better to lose that than to introduce this kind of principle, which leaves in the hands of a possibly unscrupulous Executive Council in the future the wielding of a power of this kind for patronage purposes, or, shall I say, that certain things may happen.  It is a discretion which it is hardly desirable to give to any Executive.  Once a pension is granted, unless there is a specific and proved offence I think it should be maintained.  I will not oppose the Second Reading in view of the assurances that pensions of this kind are being held up because of the absence of such a Bill, but I think it is a bad principle and very doubtful wisdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>With much of what Deputy Johnson has said I am in agreement.  I do not think that it is good administration to leave too much power of this kind in the hands of an Executive Council, but we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that commissions in the Army are controlled in no better and in no worse manner at present <Col N="1377" /> than we propose to control pensions under this particular Act.  In considering the question of commissioned officers in the Army it will, I think, be conceded that they ought not to be in any worse position than a person who gets a pension under the Military Service Pensions Act.  They are the servants of the State at the present moment.  Those who will get pensions under the Military Pensions Act are no longer servants of the State.</P>
      <P>I admit at once, if the State needed the services of those who will be in receipt of those pensions, that possibly more than 90 per cent. of them would respond to the call, but the fact is that as the Military Service Pensions Act stands it is open to any agitator or conspirator to enlist the services of those in receipt of those pensions, and their possession of a right to a pension would not be affected by that.  That is not advisable, nor is it desirable.  I think the time when an executive council would unjustly, or for any political reason, revoke a pension granted under the Military Service Pension Act will not come.  I think it is inconceivable that you would have a Dáil so subservient to an executive council that such action as that would be taken.  It would have been much better, and I would have preferred it, that those pensions&mdash;which as I stated at the time of the introduction of the Act were rather compensation for the disturbance and interruption of the lives of the individuals&mdash;should have been accepted in the same good faith in which they had been given.  Circumstances arose which satisfy the executive council that such a community of feeling or thought on this subject did not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances, reviewing the position as regards commissioned officers in the Army, and the position in which a person entitled to a pension under this Military Service Act was placed, I see no case for drawing a distinction in favour of a person who will have an advantage under the Military Service Pensions Act.  In consequence, I support this Bill, agree with the principle, and regret that it should be necessary to introduce it in view of the statement we have heard that the people are now no longer taking any part in public <Col N="1378" /> affairs.  Satisfied as far as I can see or judge that the people of this country would not tolerate an executive council which would seek to utilise for their own ends the provisions of this Bill to the detriment of people entitled to pensions, and satisfied that some such corrective as this will put a stop to any conspiracies entered into by young persons who can easily be led astray by persons who introduce personal elements into what they have no right to meddle with, I support the motion.  The State will be all the surer by reason of this Bill, and the persons getting the pensions will be in a safer position by the passing of this Bill.</P>

      <P>The President suggested that this Bill would be non-contentious. In the opinion of all the members of my party present in this House it is not only contentious but contemptible.  A few days ago while we were discussing some supplementary estimates I drew attention to the fact that military pensions were not being paid, because of political reasons, to certain persons who should receive them.  This was denied by the President and the Minister for Finance. When I left the Dáil the matter was further pressed by Deputy Johnson, and the Minister for Finance admitted that though those certificates had been granted by the Commission he himself was deliberately holding up certain of those pensions.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is mis-quoting what I said on that occasion. I dealt with what I believe to have been a charge made against the Secretary to the Board of Assessors.  I concerned myself only in refuting that charge, and I think I established to the Deputy's satisfaction that the Secretary to the Board of Assessors was not prejudiced against those persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the President is right in that instance.  I was mistaken in thinking that the Secretary was in any way responsible.  The Minister for Finance admitted he was responsible for holding up those pensions and he was acting quite illegally in doing so.  There is nothing in the Military Service Pensions Act which <Col N="1379" /> will entitle the Minister for Finance to refuse to grant a pension passed by the Commission.  There is nothing whatever in the Act which gives him that permission.  I thought first that perhaps this Bill was a clumsy attempt to rectify the illegality in which the Minister for Finance was indulging, but of course it does not affect his action, as it only refers to pensions already granted.  It does not give him any power to withhold the granting of those pensions from the beginning. The reasons he gave at that time for holding up those pensions was that there were certain persons about whose present behaviour the Executive Council were not satisfied.  This is a new principle in law, that the Executive Council if it is not satisfied with the behaviour of certain persons is entitled to over-rule the law and to withhold monies which are due to those persons. The Minister for Finance here to-day stated that the only reason why pensions could be withdrawn under this Act would be unconstitutional acts on the part of the persons concerned. There is nothing in the Act, as it stands, which mentions the fact, or which states for what reason the Executive Council would be entitled to revoke those pensions.  While we were discussing the Treason Bill an amendment was put down by Deputy Davin dealing with secret societies in the Civil Service. The Minister for Justice expressed his willingness to have the matter considered on a general motion, in order that those who had most information on the subject should make a case for it, but he stated he would not accept this prohibition before a case was made and before proof was brought as to the necessity for such a measure. No proof was brought or no case whatever has been made either by the President or by the Minister for Defence as to the necessity for this.  Apparently the necessity for proof and producing evidence only applies to the Labour Party.  It does not apply to the Executive. The object of the Bill, as far as I can see, is to revoke pensions for political opinions, as distinct from offences. I think that will be admitted by the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>If it is not, then the other offences are guarded against in Section 6 of the principal Act, where anyone convicted in open trial of an offence or misdemeanour <i>ipso facto</i> loses his pension.  That does not satisfy the Executive Council.  They intend to conduct a secret trial behind closed doors, a kind of star chamber, on the result of those investigations. As a result they are to prohibit or to allow the continuance of those pensions. If those persons have committed any crimes it is the duty of the Executive Council and the Minister for Justice to have them arrested, tried and convicted.  It would be interesting to see what reasons would be given in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> for each separate revocation of a pension.  Will the Executive Council dare to put in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> a statement that such and such a person has had his pension revoked for committing an offence or crime, and yet that that person will not be prosecuted, imprisoned or brought to trial? Is that the intention of the Executive Council?  It would be interesting if that is the case.  That, apparently, is the reason for the Bill.  To the average person the provisions of the Act are adequate.  Once the Minister for Justice has passed his Treason Bill the offences suggested in the speeches we have had to-day will be amply covered by that measure.  Once that Bill has been passed any man committing an offence will be tried.  <i>Ipso facto</i> under Section 6 of the original Pensions Act he loses his pension, but the Executive Council wish to go further and stop the pension for political opinions. They wish to force the recantation of the political opinions of those persons who resigned a year ago because of a disagreement with the Executive Council. I think that is mean and petty persecution. It is prolonging this petty faction fight between members of the Executive Council and their former comrades, and I think it is dishonouring not only to the Executive Council but to the Dáil and the State.  I oppose this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the necessity for the speedy passage of <Col N="1381" /> this measure was due to the fact that certain pensions, passed by the Army Pension Board and stated to be held up by the Executive Council, would be paid when the Bill becomes an Act.  On the Supplementary Estimate which was considered last week, I asked a question of the Minister for Finance as to whether the pensions granted by the Army Pensions Board, which he stated were held up by the Executive Council for the reasons mentioned by Deputy Esmonde, were pensions due to Army officers who had resigned or who were dismissed.  I do not think it is right that it should go out from this House that pensions will be paid, if this Bill goes through, to people who had been dismissed from the National Army. The Minister stated he was not able to say what the actual state of affairs was when I asked him that question.  Perhaps he will make it clear now, so that members of the House will know what is likely to be the effect of the speedy passage of this measure.  Pensions under this Bill can be revoked for what the President referred to as unconstitutional acts.  I think every member of the House will agree that when the Treason Bill becomes an Act it will be possible for the Executive Council at any time to bring to the bar of justice any man and have him tried without taking the trouble of publishing his name in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> or adopting any other method mentioned in this Bill.  I would like to hear from the Minister for Finance now the effect of this Bill on the type of case he mentioned last week and which he was not able to explain at that time.</P>

      <P>Like so many other Deputies that have spoken, I, while not going to vote against this Bill, cannot vote in favour of it, in view of the provisions of the Constitution. I admit that the times are extraordinary, that the circumstances are unique, and that there is, perhaps, need for something in the nature of this Bill.  But if any pension is to be cut off, I hope that it will only be for something in the nature of an offence tending to the subversion of the Constitution, of which offence there is not <Col N="1382" /> sufficient evidence to secure a conviction, but of which there is, nevertheless, a fair amount of certainly.  I certainly do not think that the Executive Council, or any succeeding Executive Council, will attempt to abuse the extraordinary power we are now asked to give them.  It is extraordinary power. There must be a complete separation between judicial and executive functions, but, in this case, we are making the Executive Council judge and jury&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before you can employ the Treason Bill, you must obtain a conviction.  This Bill is only intended to deal with a case where there is a fair amount of evidence, but still not sufficient to obtain a conviction. I would not have it go out that this is a mere matter of disagreement in the invidious sense in which Deputy Esmonde made reference to what took place between the Executive Council and certain mutinous officers last year. I wonder what kind of dispute was that.  Was it a mere disagreement of opinion or was it a disagreement which bordered on physical force?  As far as those officers of last year are concerned, I should regret very much to see them benefiting by the Military Service Pensions Act.  Because it hits those people who went out in mutiny against this State, and who went as far as possible to subvert its Constitution. I favour this Bill.  But I certainly hold that mere disagreement of opinion, or anything on which we can all agree to differ, that comes within the Constitution, should not come within the <Col N="1383" /> scope of this measure or be dealt with by either the present or any succeeding Executive Council.</P>

      <P>I have not considered any further the question raised by Deputy Davin, but this Bill does not affect the matter in any way.  I was not quite sure as to what Deputy Davin was referring. I did not know whether he was asking if persons concerned with the mutiny of last March were finally dismissed or allowed to resign. At the moment, I do not remember what happened.  But this Bill has nothing to do with qualification for the pension.  That is decided by previous Acts, which I have not at hand at the moment, and have not looked up since the Deputy spoke.  All this Bill does is to provide a means of revoking pensions in the event of action being taken against the State by some of those officers who are or will be in receipt of pensions if the offence be such as could not be proven in court.  It goes no further than that.  The need for some action in connection with these pensions became clear last December, when undoubtedly there was an attempt to create further trouble, and when the Executive Council felt itself obliged to dismiss summarily certain civil servants, a couple of army officers and some 20 or 30 non-commissioned officers and privates.</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied that the principle embodied in this Bill is a good one or a desirable one or one that the Dáil should give its approval to.  I take it that in the Pension Act there is provision whereby if a man is convicted of an offence his pension is revoked.  The Minister, in this Bill, seeks further power.  As I understand it, he seeks power to revoke pensions at the discretion of the Executive Council.  No matter how wisely that discretion may be exercised, it will always be open to grave objection &mdash;the objection that action will be motived by political reasons.  It is undesirable that that should be so.  I understood the Minister for Finance to say that no action would be taken until the fullest opportunity had been given to the Dáil to see what was being done and to hear the reasons.

      <P>The point I was going to make has been made by Deputy Johnson&mdash;that the Dáil would <Col N="1385" /> not be in a position to say whether or not justice had been done, unless it had an opportunity of perusing all the evidence.  The Minister for Finance has stated that the Executive found it necessary to dismiss certain officers from the Army and even from the Civil Service.  I can quite see that a position might arise in which the Government would be satisfied that it was not desirable to retain certain individuals in their service.  I understand that they are always free to do that.  But the revocation of a pension is a different proposition altogether, and that should not be done except in accordance with provisions definitely set out in an Act of Parliament.  It ought not to be in the discretion of the Executive Council to revoke a pension once it has been granted.  That introduces a bad principle, and whether or not the discretion is wisely exercised, it will always be urged that it is not wisely exercised.  I think that nothing short of an offence which would bring a conviction in court, under any one of the numerous Acts which are in force, should be used to deprive a person of his pension, once that pension is granted.</P>

One could name a great many bad principles.  I wonder does the Deputy consider it a good principle that pensions should be capable of being used as a kind of war-chest for conspiracy against the State, and that persons drawing money from taxation, drawing money out of the people's pockets, should be free simply to pool that money as a war-chest against the people, and be in a position to defy the Dáil and the Government and everybody else, short of such evidence being adduced against them as would ensure six months' imprisonment and upwards?</P>

      <P>I am not talking to the Deputy.  I am talking to the Ceann Comhairle with reference to Deputy O'Connell's remarks.  That, as I say, is a principle I would very much like to have the Deputy's opinion upon. Pensions are <i>ex gratia</i> in the gift.  The Act that was passed here does not simply impose an obligation to confer pensions on all who are eligible.  They are <i>ex gratia</i> in the gift.  The position was that, once they were given under this Act, they were revocable only on sentence of so many months' imprisonment. The present proposal is to make them revocable for cause stated by the Executive Council, with the condition of gazetting, to ensure full publicity. It is quite easy, and no doubt pleasant, for Deputy Esmonde and Deputy O'Connell to enlarge on the advisability and necessity of proving things in open court.  &ldquo;Bring up your evidence; table your evidence!&rdquo;  Both of these Deputies know as well as I do &mdash;more particularly Deputy Esmonde&mdash; that the class of offence which is endeavoured to be met and endeavoured to be guarded against by this Bill frequently does not admit of the production of the evidence.  There are frequently very many and very serious reasons against such production.  Last December 24 N.C.O.'s were dismissed from the Army.  They were rightly dismissed.  They were not dismissed on suspicion; they were dismissed with the full knowledge of every member of the Executive Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>None whatever. They were landed out.  They were rightly landed out.  As I say, the action was not taken on suspicion, any more than the other dismissals which took place at that time.  It would be impossible, it would certainly be highly undesirable to adduce evidence on which that action was taken.  It would also be highly dangerous for individuals. The principle of enabling the Executive Council, a body with the confidence of the Dáil <i>prima facie</i>, a body responsible to the Dáil, subject to criticism by the Dáil, to take particular action when they consider the <Col N="1387" /> circumstances warrant it, is open to criticism, and has been criticised by Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Esmonde.  You have got to consider the alternative.  The alternative is that pensions may be pooled and simply used as a kind of conspiratorial war-chest against the State, and the conspirators can, short of this Bill, simply defy the people and their representatives and their Government, and say: &ldquo;Prove your case; get me six months' imprisonment or upwards, but, in the meantime, I draw my pension, I pool it with my fellow-conspirators, and we stand together, a menace and a challenge to the State, and we will continue our activities, suborning your Army, undermining your civil service, and plotting generally against the welfare of the people; we will continue to square up to the State in an attitude of insolent challenge while we pocket the people's money, and when the people can prove an offence against us that will get us six months' imprisonment or upwards, then we will stop pocketing their money.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The only criticism that has not been answered is that of Deputy Esmonde.  As far as that goes, I can only say that he is backing the wrong horse when he states that this Bill is going to be used for political purposes. Any man or any body of men that like to join any constitutional political society, or take any constitutional action, are at liberty to do so.  This Bill is only aimed at people who want to take unconstitutional action, and to try to suborn the servants of the State. As far as pensions are concerned, as the Minister for Justice has said, they are <i>ex gratia</i> in the gift.  They are given with the consent of the Minister for Finance, and recommended by the Minister for Defence.  If this Bill is not passed, my opinion is that the people, who would in the ordinary way get pensions under it, will be subject <Col N="1388" /> to a certain amount of delay, which perhaps would cause more annoyance. If any man wants to get his pension, all he has to do is to conform to the Constitution as laid down.</P>

The pension is <i>ex gratia.</i>  The board that gives the certificates have not the last word.  They give the certificate of service.  The pension is given by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  Pensions have been held up for some little time where certificates have been given.  They have been held for the purpose of making inquiries.  When inquiries were made, the Minister was not satisfied that the pensions should issue, and, consequently, they were held up.  If power of revocation is given, as I said, the pensions will be paid immediately.</P>

    <P>A question has been raised as to the amount of this Vote on Account.  The proportion of the total Estimate asked for in this Vote on Account is the same proportion as has been asked for in previous years, roughly, the amount that would enable the services to be carried on for four months.  Our Standing Orders contemplate that the financial business of the year shall be concluded before August 1st.  This Vote on Account will enable the services to be carried on to that date.  I myself think that the amount is not an unreasonable one, that it would be undesirable to give a Vote on Account for less, with the consequent necessity, in the middle of the period during which the financial business will be under consideration, to come to the Dáil and ask for another Vote on Account and for another Central Fund Bill, thereby taking up part of the time which should be devoted to the consideration of the Estimates and other financial business.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember, from previous years, that, even apart from business of a non-financial character, there is a great deal to be done from the middle of April until the Summer Recess. The Budget will be introduced some time towards the end of April, with the Finance Bill following.  That will require a great deal of discussion. The Estimates themselves will take up a very considerable amount of time, and there will always be other legislation of a character that will be necessary. The result of deciding to give a Vote on Account for less than the amount that is likely to be required would simply be that the time taken up in dealing with this Vote on Account, and the legislation arising out of it, will be repeated some time, say, in June, and time will simply be wasted. Time that could be given to the discussion of the detailed Estimates will be taken up in doing again what might well be done now.</P>

      <P>When I say one-third is taken, we take the amount of one-third on the assumption that expenditure will be fairly even through the course of the year, but certain offices will have expenditure falling largely at some particular period and not evenly through the year.  There are some items where more than one-third is asked for.  There are some in which a great deal less than one-third is asked for.  In the case of the relief grants the reason is apparent.  A good deal of the money is voted simply for the purpose of completing work already in hands.  When the money for relief was voted last year the intention was that it should be used on schemes that would be completed before March 31st. It was found necessary, however, to embark on certain schemes which could not be completed by that time.  It would be undesirable to leave them unfinished, and it is found necessary to provide money for completing them. The work is already in hands, and will go right ahead.</P>

      <P>I beg to move that the sum of £9,157,834 be deleted, and that there be substituted therefor the sum of £6,157,834.  The course of this discussion is following almost exactly that which took place this time last year.  The Minister's case is almost exactly the same.  On the 27th March, 1924, the Minister came to the Dáil and in the same way desired a Vote on Account for four months' supply. Urgency was claimed, and explanations were given.  There were complaints made from these Benches and other Benches regarding the absence of information, the absence of Estimates. The Minister then said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>I would like to say to the Dáil that I regret that these Estimates have not been produced earlier.  If I were to have any responsibility again I certainly would make every possible effort to have the detailed Estimates out in good time before a Vote of Account was asked for.  I certainly did what I could to expedite them this year.  They probably would have been out in a reasonable time if it had not been for some matters, such as the Army reorganisation... I admit quite frankly that Members of the Dáil have a right to be aggrieved at not having the detailed Estimates in their hands some weeks before they are asked for the Vote on Account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year.  The year before that was not in quite the same language as this year's.  The White Paper was circulated yesterday morning giving the total Estimates for the year, and to-day at three o'clock we have had the preliminary provisional details of most of the Estimates, all subject to certain revision.  It is quite impossible for us to consider these Estimates, so that we may take them as not having been circulated.  The proposition is that we should vote four months' supply, being about one-third of a total of 26¼ millions.  I do not want at this stage to deal with any of the details, but I want to draw attention to the fact that this 26 millions added, say, to three millions from <Col N="1396" /> the Central Fund Services, brings us nearly to thirty millions, and that the Tax Revenue and the Post Office Revenue together for this year to date is twenty-four millions.  That in itself raises a question as to whether we ought to vote this sum in this manner without much more consideration than is possible in the time now available before the end of the financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Dáil to recollect almost the chief function of Parliament is to keep a tight hold on expenditure and finance.  What is proposed now is that, having had no opportunity to discuss or even to examine the proposals as to how the money is going to be expended during the next four months, we are asked to vote four months' supply&mdash; April, May, June and July.  We are promised that the Dáil will be in Session in April, May and June, but by the fourth month&mdash;July&mdash;we are promised that the Dáil will have been dispersed. We are asked to vote four months' supply without having any knowledge, without at least having any opportunity of examining the purposes of this supply.  The Minister will tell us that we will have plenty of opportunities between now and the adjournment to discuss the Estimates in detail. Undoubtedly, if everything goes smoothly, that will be the case; but if the Dáil is going to carry out its functions conscientiously, it will not allow four months' supply to be voted without having had an opportunity to discuss the Estimates.  It is conceivable, and not a very great improbability&mdash;I do not think it is likely&mdash;that something will happen to prevent our discussing the Estimates in detail at all. Still the Executive would have had four months' money to spend.  My proposal is that we should limit the amount by one-third, and by that means oblige the Executive to come forward again for another Vote on Account, or, if it is possible to vote the whole of the Estimates, well, that could be done.  I believe the Dáil ought to express, by passing some motion such as I have moved, its determination to have definite control over finance and over expenditure, and let the Minister realise that it takes seriously the promise <Col N="1397" /> that the Estimates would be in the hands of Deputies for some reasonable time before a Vote on Account of this magnitude is called for.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that it is going to be waste of time to have two Central Fund Bills, and possibly two discussions&mdash;one duplicating the other&mdash;that the Minister put forward, is not of very much account.  If we are so careless of our responsibilties regarding finances as to allow arguments of that kind to weigh with us, then we are not worthy of being here.  My only object in moving this amendment&mdash;and I do it quite seriously just as I did it last year&mdash;is to ensure that the Ministry will realise that the Dáil intends to keep definite control over finances and is not prepared to vote away four months' supply without having had an opportunity of looking at the proposals of the Ministry as to how that supply is to be expended.  The Minister may argue quite logically that we have no right to vote any of it, on that same premise, and I think I could not answer him if he said, &ldquo;Do not vote any of it until you have had an opportunity of seeing the Estimates.&rdquo;  I realise that the Government of the country has to be carried on, and I would be prepared to trust the Ministry to expend two months or more of this money, but I am not prepared to hand over the last month's supply during which the Dáil may not be sitting.  I would earnestly ask the Ministry to accept the motion to reduce this amount.  They will then realise the importance of letting Deputies have the Estimates in hands some time before the Vote on Account is asked for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that to trust the Executive Council with four months' supply is rather too much to ask from the Dáil at this time.  The four months' supply asked for amounts almost to one-half of the taxable capacity of this country.  Nine millions out of a possible taxable capacity of twenty-one or twenty-two millions is too much to ask.  Last year it was stated the Labour Government in England <Col N="1398" /> was able to obtain something like £120,000,000 on account.  A point that was neglected to be made was that a vote of 120 millions there was one-sixth of the income of that State, while our vote is half of our taxable capacity. On that ground I think this is asking too much.  Everybody is aware that most of those engaged in the industry with which I am concerned are after passing through a very severe time. We are oppressed at present by local taxation, and the Minister has never given any indication that he will do for us what has been done for those in the northern area and those in Scotland and England in connection with the agricultural grant.  I do not want to confine myself to the points that Deputy Johnson has been making, but to say that those engaged in the farming industry are not being properly dealt with.  For that reason we want to keep a hold on the money, so that it will be applied as we think it should be applied in future.  The question of an agricultural grant for the relief of rates is one that has not received the consideration it deserves from the Executive Council.  Last year the inequalities that exist were pointed out, and while in England farmers are paying one-fourth of the rates, in this country they are paying four-fifths of the rates.  No attempt has been made by the Ministry to relieve farmers so as to enable them to meet the competition that their industry is subject to in the open market.</P>
      <P>I am also seriously concerned with the question of income tax.  Before the war the incidence of income tax was, apart from farmers, based on a man's income.  At present the basis of a man's income tax is his income, but farmers to-day are paying on three times the assessment to which they were subject before the war.  Considering the position that farmers are in, they are not able to pay their way at the moment.  The Minister for Agriculture admitted that farmers are producing on an uneconomic basis, yet at the same time they are asked to pay income tax on a basis that supposes their income to be three times greater than it was in 1914.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will always have this chance, that if he does not like the Executive Council that is in, he can put it out and put another one in.  That is the real remedy he has.  I do not want to prevent him discussing something that he wants to discuss very badly, but the whole question of taxation arises properly on the Budget, and there will be seven different and distinct opportunities of discussing it.  There are seven different stages of discussion on the same thing, so that the Deputy will not lack opportunities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in agreement with the policy of giving such a large amount out of next year's income, an amount which will be spent before we have an opportunity <Col N="1400" /> of supervising that expenditure. For that reason I will support Deputy Johnson's proposal to reduce the Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that one of the most important functions of the Dáil is to keep a tight hold on expenditure. I do not see that you are keeping that tight hold on expenditure by reducing the Vote on Account in such a way that it is most likely a second Vote on Account will be required. The really tight hold on expenditure is the tight hold that will be indicated by a most careful consideration of the detailed estimates.  Even although we now get a Vote on Account for, say, £1,600,000 for property losses compensation, if that particular Vote comes before the Dáil on the 1st May, or during the last week in April, and the amount is reduced, the power of the Executive to spend is reduced in the same way as if the Vote on Account were now reduced.  The Dáil votes nothing away, because any estimate that a Deputy desires to have given priority to from the point of view of discussion will be given that priority. If any Deputy wishes to deal with the expenditure that would be incurred by any service shown on this paper, as soon as the estimates come on he can ask to have that particular estimate discussed. It can be dealt with then in whatever manner the Dáil may decide.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain what the position would be suppose it were decided that £15,000, or any other sum, was not to be voted for the office of the Minister for External affairs, for instance?  What would happen after April 1st if we voted this sum on account?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The expenditure would take place until the time when the Dáil would discuss the estimate; but the expenditure will only be made on types of service that are already in existence.  No new activity will be undertaken and paid for out of the Vote on Account.  For instance, if in the Army there was no artillery, money would not be expended on artillery. In the same way, no new embassy would be opened, and no new office abroad would be opened, by the Department <Col N="1401" /> of External Affairs until their estimate has come before the Dáil. The Vote on Account merely means that services already in existence will be carried on until the detailed Vote may be considered.  It therefore means&mdash; and I meet Deputy Johnson on this point&mdash;that expenditure which the Dáil may possibly disapprove of, instead of ending on the 31st March, as it would if no Vote on Account were passed, would continue until the time the Dáil would deal with the estimate.  The order in which estimates will be dealt with is a matter for Deputies who are interested.  I do not think it can be alleged that the Dáil is doing its duty as the guardian of the State's finances, if it gives a three months' supply, and that it is not doing its duty if it gives a four months' supply.  The difference that lies between a three months' and a four months' supply is that we may have to experience the inconvenience of a second Vote on Account.  We may have that inconvenience if the money is given for that shorter period.</P>
      <P>I had hoped that the Dáil would not be meeting next July.  If it is not meeting then it means that all the Estimates will have been considered before that period.  One does not like to take too optimistic a view in regard to the adjournment of the Dáil.  There has been no year yet in which we were able to adjourn on the day appointed for the adjournment.  Last year the Estimates were not finally dealt with before the 25th July.  If there were only a three months' Vote on Account decided upon, some days would have to be lost in the middle of that period in taking a new Vote on Account, and the Dáil would be meeting on and beyond the 25th July in order to deal with the Estimates. Even if the Dáil were only to run to the 6th or 7th of July, and the Vote on Account was cut short, it might be necessary to introduce a number of Estimates for a new Vote on Account to deal with the period of seven, ten or fourteen days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not dealt very fairly and definitely with <Col N="1402" /> the proposition, which divides itself into two parts.  First, it is desirable that the Dáil should make clear to the Ministry that it is not satisfied to vote for four months' supply on one day's notice without having had an opportunity of looking at the Estimates.  The very fact that the Dáil is not satisfied to do so would be evident if it accepted this amendment.  It would indicate to the Ministry that it takes this matter seriously, and it would also be a very good lesson for future years.  The second and very practical result that the passing of this amendment would bring about, is that it would ensure that Estimates would be always taken early.  It would ensure that they would be taken steadily and consecutively without being sandwiched in between legislative measures, and it would be indicating that the Dáil would be anxious not to treat Estimates as something that might be taken quite casually and carelessly.</P>
      <P>If my amendment were carried we would be practically forced to take Estimates as the main item from the first week or so after the Budget statement. It would mean, at least, that we would take financial business, between the Finance Bill, the Budget resolutions and the Estimates, almost day by day until they would be concluded. That would be quite a desirable course, with such exceptions as urgent legislation might make necessary.  I think the practical result of the passing of my amendment would be the bringing on of Estimates at an early stage, and it would ensure their pretty full consideration. I believe it would be very well worth while for the Dáil to pass the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the point made by Deputy Johnson.  I would ask the Minister, if he does not accept the amendment now proposed, to agree to a course that has been suggested several times.  That is, that we will have from now onwards, now that the Estimates are in our hands, a certain number of hours on certain days definitely set aside for the consideration of Estimates. We could have them under consideration two or three days a week. <Col N="1403" /> No matter what other business the House is engaged on, when it reaches a certain time it should automatically go into Committee on Finance to consider the Estimates.  That was proposed last year, and it was then said that the matter would be considered with a view to its adoption the following year; that is to say, this year.</P>
      <P>The only real reason that I see why Deputy Johnson's amendment should be accepted by the House is that it will ensure that careful consideration of Estimates that in past years we have not had.  If the Minister would give an assurance that from now henceforward the better part of the summer months will be devoted to financial business, and that on three days a week for so many hours a day that business will be under consideration, it will be a step in the right direction.  The House will then feel a greater assurance in accepting the Vote on Account concerning a sum larger than nine millions, amounting to one-third of the amount required entirely for the Government of the Saorstát for the next twelve months.  I suggest that the Minister should give some such assurance to the Dáil before this Vote, if it is pressed, is actually put to a vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the Dáil who were here at the end of the Summer Session last year cannot forget the hasty manner in which legislation and measures which were regarded as urgent were brought in at the closing stages of that Session.  If we are going to have a repetition of that method of legislation in the corresponding period of the coming Session, we will be placed in the same difficulty of being called upon to give preference to urgent measures rather than to the really important question of discussing in detail matters of administration arising under the Estimates.  Now we cannot say exactly whether we are going in that direction or what position we will be faced with in the coming year, unless we have from the President or some member of the Executive Council, before the House adjourns for the Easter Recess, the legislative programme which they intend to carry through after the Easter adjournment <Col N="1404" /> or a definite promise from the Minister for Finance, as requested by Deputy Figgis, that so many hours of the day and so many days of the week will be given for the discussion in detail of these Estimates.  The Minister for Justice, acting for the President some time ago, indicated a number of measures that were likely to be introduced before the Easter Recess.  We will be faced on Friday week with an adjournment from 3rd April to the 21st, and we have not yet seen in print some of the measures which he indicated would be dealt with before the adjournment.  He referred to an Army Pensions Amendment Bill and legislation that was necessary in order to take on the drainage of certain rivers which he mentioned.  We have not got these Bills yet, and one must only conclude that they will be dealt with in the Summer Session, and perhaps a number of other Bills that we do not know of now may also be brought forward as urgent, and we may be told that they require the Governor-General's sanction before the Summer Recess. Until we have got a definite detailed statement of the required legislative measures that are to be introduced we are up against the same stone wall that we were faced with last year.  I think, therefore, the assurance which Deputy Figgis and Deputy Johnson have asked for should be given to the House&mdash;that the discussion on the Estimates will be regarded as more important than any particular measures that we do not now know of, but that may be introduced later on, unless the House, by agreement, decides on a particular date to pass on to a certain stage of a certain measure which is more urgent.  Unless we get that assurance we will be prevented from carrying out our functions as members of the Dáil and criticising, as far as we want to, the administration of the various Departments of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hesitation in stating that in so far as I am concerned I am anxious some arrangement should be made, such as is suggested by Deputy Figgis.  There is always the difficulty, however, that a Minister like the Minister for Industry and Commerce with the Shannon scheme, may <Col N="1405" /> say that he should not be prevented from bringing the Shannon scheme before the Dáil on a particular date.  I could not at the moment promise that a particular number of hours per day, or a particular number of days, would be given for the discussion of Estimates. I would try to have an arrangement made that some special amount of time would be given for the Estimates.  If agreement could be got for that both from Ministers and the Dáil, it should not be difficult to carry such an arrangement into effect.  There has been one decision come to by the Executive Council with regard to legislation for the coming year, and that is, that for the future they will not pursue the practice of trying to complete all Bills that are on the stocks before the summer adjournment.  In the future, unless a Bill is exceptionally urgent, if it is not completed when we reach, say, the beginning of July, it will be, like the Local Government Bill of last year, carried over until autumn.  Even although a number of Bills which are important Bills may be introduced after Easter, it does not follow that they will be pressed forward, and that the Dáil will be asked to sit late or to give up the discussion of the Estimates in order to enable these Bills to pass through all their stages before the adjournment. If the Bill is of such a character that it can be held over&mdash;and most Bills are of such a character&mdash;the intention of the Executive Council is that the Dáil should finish the first or second reading and carry over the Committee Stage until autumn.  If the Dáil has the Committee Stage finished, or partly finished, the Bill could be taken up again when the Dáil resumes in October.  I think Deputies need not fear that there will be the same amount of legislation pushing in on the time of the Dáil and crushing out the consideration of the Estimates as there was last year.  I do not think that the passing of this amendment would lead to a more regular discussion of the Estimates week-by-week. What it would lead to, as I have already stated, would be another Vote on Account when the time came that it was necessary.  The money would be urgently required to carry on some particular service that could not be allowed <Col N="1406" /> to lapse, and there would be the same type of moral coercion on the Dáil at that stage as at any other particular time.  I do not think it is a device which necessarily ensures any more immediate or regular discussion of Estimates than will be secured by pressure of the Dáil and the sense of responsibility of Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has found a new phrase for it.  He called it moral coercion.  Some of us, if he had not sprung in with that particular phrase, might have called it immoral coercion.  But the whole point we are dealing with, and I take it to be the real substance affecting all that has been said, is to try and get an adequate discussion of the Estimates when the time comes for them to be considered.  They are now in our hands, and there is no reason why we should not, immediately after the Easter Recess, enter upon them and continue at them for a certain number of hours each day and for a certain number of days each week until they have been completed.  The Minister knows very well&mdash;there is no necessity for me to remind him; probably he feels it far more acutely than any other Deputy in the Dáil could feel it&mdash;that anticipations and half promises as to the amount of time that is going to be given during certain months to the consideration of the Estimates is one thing but their realisation is quite another.  I do not want to refer to what happened in various Committees of this House, because I do not know how far one may refer to these matters, but I want now to ask the Minister if it has been considered by the Executive Council that the Leader of this House, the President, should make a pledge to this House guaranteeing a certain number of hours each day and a certain number of days each week from after the Easter Recess until the time of the Summer Recess for the consideration of Estimates, no matter what legislation may be required during these months; that these months should be considered primarily as a matter concerned with the financial business of the Dáil, and more particularly with regard to the consideration of Estimates.  It is the only opportunity, as the Minister knows, that the Dáil has of considering and going into <Col N="1407" /> the question of administration.  It only arises once a year.  I do urge that.  I am not altogether in favour of this amendment.  I think the amendment has served its purpose in raising an important question, that in previous years we have not had paid the attention to the Estimates that they deserve and that the Dáil ought to give.  If the Minister for Finance will forgive me for saying so, I think we have not been treated sufficiently seriously with regard to the Estimates.  Last year the President agreed, whenever the matter was raised, that the Estimates ought to be the primary consideration of the Dáil, and ought to be considered very seriously.  But when one tried to pin him down to a definite time as to when these Estimates should be considered he appeared as elusive as he generally manages to prove whenever any definite statement or pledge is sought from him. I suggest, then, that the matter should be met by an absolute pledge by which the Dáil would tie its hands in advance, and have a certain number of hours in the week between the Easter Recess and the Summer Recess and say we shall continue Estimates until they are completed, and until they are completed we shall not allow any other business to trespass on these days and hours.</P>

      <P>May I ask if the Minister for Finance would answer the question I put to him?  We had a certain list of Bills read out as being likely to be introduced before the 31st March.  I have a list here now of eleven Bills which were supposed to be introduced before the 31st March, and none of which is as yet introduced. Are these to be carried over the summer adjournment?  How many are to be dropped?  Or, on the other hand, will the Minister, before the adjournment for the Easter Recess, probably on Thursday or Friday of next week, make an announcement with regard to the legislative programme for the Summer Session, and whether the eleven Bills will be dropped altogether, so that we can make up our minds from a statement of that kind whether we will be able to do the things we require to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Executive Council <Col N="1408" /> have given consideration to the question of giving more time to the Estimates, and certainly there was agreement that more time should be given.  The President was authorised on behalf of the Executive Council to arrange a programme to give further time.  I do not know at present what arrangement he may have made with any representatives in the Dáil.  As to what Deputy Davin has said, the decision that was come to in regard to Bills was that Bills should be introduced when they were ready.  It has always been the case, heretofore, that there was great difficulty when resuming after an adjournment because there was no business, and what happened was that when the Dáil met after the adjournment there was only work for one or two days in the week because of insufficient business and for the reason that the business was not ready.  Gradually the business would accumulate, with the result that at the end of that session a great number of Bills would have to be rushed through. What we decided for the future was that Bills should be introduced when ready, but unless there was some peculiar character of urgency about them no attempt should be made to get them passed through all their stages before any particular adjournment.  It was held that it would be desirable that no objection should be made to Bills getting their First and Second Readings before the adjournment, and when the Dáil resumed in the autumn there would be sufficient business from these Bills to occupy it.  This would work out so that when the Dáil resumed in the autumn, instead of meeting one day in the week and then adjourning, we would have Bills that had already passed the First and Second stages taken up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know at the moment what the eleven Bills are.  The Deputy may take it that there will not be any attempt to push them through.  The attempt to push Bills through will be confined to Bills that are contingent upon a particular date like the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill to-day.  In that way we can give time for the Estimates.  These Bills will be ready and in print, and will occupy the <Col N="1409" /> Dáil when it resumes after the Summer Recess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the Bills to which I have referred is the Barrow Drainage Bill.  It should be quite obvious to the Government that no work in connection with that scheme can be done this year unless the Bill is passed within a certain time.  Members of the Government Party in the recent bye-elections stated quite definitely from public platforms that it was proposed to carry out that work this year.  I want to know how they can do so unless the Bill is introduced and passed very quickly.  They surely cannot start to drain the Barrow in October or November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will have to put up a very big contribution for the Barrow.  There is no doubt that the Barrow is not one of these drainage schemes on which the whole or nearly the whole of the cost can be charged on the occupiers or owners of the benefited land.  As the Government will have to put up a big proportion of the money, the question is being considered as to whether there is not some portion of the work which might, with the assent of the Dáil by the voting of the necessary money, be entered upon before the necessary legislation is passed.  There is work of a type that, if the owners of the adjacent lands agree and if money is provided by the Dáil, could be done.  The Bill would be like that referred to by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in connection with the Shannon scheme.  We feel that it must be a Bill giving general powers&mdash;and it is drafted along these lines&mdash;to enter upon land to carry out works, and set up tribunals to assess the damages and benefits, and it will not be the type of Bill that would take up as much time as if it contained very detailed provisions.  There has been great delay in getting that measure ready, because we found that a detailed plan did not exist.  A very eminent engineer has been engaged on the plans, has visited the scene, and has been trying to produce out of the mass of documents which we have a plan on which the work could be carried out.  But that has been delayed. <Col N="1410" /> As a matter of fact, if we delayed in introducing legislation until there was a detailed plan on which work could be started, there could be no work this year.  I do not anticipate that work done on the Barrow this summer will be done under legislation.  Any work that may be possible this summer would be of a preliminary character, work that could be done by consent, if money is voted for it.</P>

That will be one type.  The Government will not intervene in these cases at all except by way of holding inquiries by their inspectors when the county councils move.  The owners of the benefited lands will pay, and the county councils will collect the rates that will be necessary for maintenance. The Government may intervene by a loan of money, but it will not intervene directly.  In the case of the Barrow, the Government will have to intervene in the actual doing of the work.</P>

      <P>Before proceeding with the motion, I want to understand where we shall be in regard to the question raised by it.  There is a long list of Estimates amounting to £9,000,000.  There are certain questions raised.  One question has been raised, more or less, by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to-day&mdash; the question of the provision for unemployment insurance, and, generally, the question of the programme of his Department regarding unemployment and unemployment schemes.  It has not been possible in the two or three hours that we have had those Estimates before us, to relate them to last year's Estimates or to understand exactly what is being proposed.  We find that the total estimate against the Department of Industry and Commerce for this year is £366,484, while the total estimate for 1924-25 was £505,031. There are several items which may explain the reduction in the total, but it has not been possible to make any proper examination of the papers that have been laid before us.  I have been able to find, by a close search through this bundle of fly-sheets, a sheet headed &ldquo;Department of Industry and Commerce,&rdquo; but there is practically nothing in it, except part of sub-head 2 (Administration). It gives us no detail as to the way this £366,484 is made up.  I want an opportunity to raise this question <Col N="1413" /> of the Department's policy and also in respect to unemployment and unemployment insurance.  I think it is not possible to do it with sufficient care on this very short notice, and I would like to have an assurance, before passing this Vote, that on the later motions, the Report of the Resolution to the Dáil or on the Vote-on-Account Motion &mdash;that is the supply motion&mdash;which may be taken to-morrow, we shall have an opportunity to discuss the policy of the Department of Industry and Commerce relating to unemployment and unemployment insurance.  If that is acceptable, I have nothing more to say on this particular motion.</P>

    <P>The Industrial and Provident Societies Acts would not include some societies of a similar character, which may have amongst their objects the provision of houses, and the object of the amendment is to make it possible for societies which have similar functions, amongst other functions, as those referred to in this definition section, such as friendly societies or trade unions, to avail of the facilities.  My object is to include amongst public utility societies, friendly societies and trade unions which may have amongst their objects the provision of houses for their members.  The matter was raised by me on Second Reading, and I think it should commend itself to the Dáil and the Ministry.</P>

      <P>I would be prepared to accept the amendment if it read like this:&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is slightly more restrictive than Deputy Johnson's amendment, but it brings out the point that the bodies which we would include amongst those to whom grants would be made available would have housing as one of their objects or as one of the provisions of the articles of association or rules.  Only to that extent does it differ from the amendment of Deputy Johnson.  Personally, I should say <Col N="1420" /> that the Government would be more than pleased to see such bodies taking up this matter.  I do not know whether it would be possible for bodies which have not yet got such a provision in the rules to have them altered so as to include such matters.  If they were in a position to do that, then the amendment I suggest would be almost the same as Deputy Johnson's, except that housing would be specially mentioned in the rules.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot speak offhand, but I think the effect of the President's suggested amendment would be to restrict unduly the advantages that this would give to trade unions.  I am doubtful whether friendly societies, and I am more doubtful whether trade unions, are likely to have specified amongst their objects the provision of houses.  But the fact remains that they do at present, within their powers, advance money to members for the building of houses.  As it is a comparatively recent development for some unions, and as their rules were drawn up in some cases many years ago, and are probably of a wide character rather than specific, if you put in the amendment as read out by the President, then it will require that they should have specific sanction to build houses or to engage in the provision of houses for members.  I suggest to the President that if trade unions or friendly societies are at present empowered within their rules, irrespective of any specific authorisation, that the object he seeks is already attained. Some of the older and larger unions have made it a practice to advance money to their members for the purpose of house-building.  I am doubtful whether they have specific authorisation under the rules, but I want to secure that a trade union or friendly society which is prepared to advance money to its members might do so as a public utility society within the meaning of the Bill, and that the members who constitute the society are thereby benefited to the extent that the Bill provides for.  I am inclined to think that the phraseology of the President's draft means limiting the trade unions unless they proceed to revise the rules, and that takes quite a considerable <Col N="1421" /> time sometimes.  As a matter of fact, if the unions are, within their powers, able to provide money for housing, then the object that the President seeks is already attained within the present rules, and, if they are registered either under the Friendly Societies Acts or the Trade Union Acts, that should suffice, I think.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson is introducing a rather dangerous principle in this amendment.  We know that trade unions in their operation have a compulsory levy for certain purposes. If the unions are given power to levy members for the provision of houses it would seem to be very far-reaching.  It is one that could, I imagine, be greatly abused.  It seems to me that it would be quite possible and desirable for trade unions to have housing schemes apart from ordinary trade union funds.  In that case the levy would not be compulsory on a member.  I think Deputy Johnson's proposals would really be compulsory on a man who might not want to participate in a housing scheme at all.  It would be a serious thing to compel members to subscribe towards an object to which they did not desire to contribute.  It would be desirable to have a contribution towards the provision of houses, but to make it compulsory would, I think, be objectionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would not be wise to allow the Dáil to be misled by Deputy Hewat's statement.  I think he must have been sadly disappointed at the intervention of the Prime Minister of Great Britain in a recent debate, and that he has got the compulsory levy on the brain.  There is no suggestion here to levy for the building of houses. Friendly societies or trade unions&mdash;too few of them&mdash;have friendly benefits. They have accumulated funds which are the property of the members and which the members will look some day to get benefit from, if the need arises.  It has been the practice of some of the unions to utilise some of these funds for the provision of houses for members.  The object of this amendment is to make it possible for any union which does that to take advantage of this Bill in the same way as a public utility society registered under the Industrial and <Col N="1422" /> Provident Societies Acts.  That is the whole purport of the amendment.  It does not introduce any compulsion or make any change whatever in the relationship of the union and its members or of a friendly society and its members. It simply seeks to make it possible for a union which desires, and which is in a position to advance money for the building of houses, to take advantage of this Bill in the same way as a public utility society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts. Under these Acts, for instance, a cooperative society would be in a position to take advantage of the subsidy.  Some of these other working-class organisations, similar in character, and largely similar in purpose, which chose to register under one series of Acts rather than under the other series, would be debarred under the definition as set out in the Bill.  The object of my amendment is to bring the other societies&mdash; friendly societies and trades unions&mdash; which, I say, are of the same character as some of the societies registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, into the category of the Bill.  I do not want to be too definite, but I think the President's suggested draft means limiting the number of friendly societies, and possibly will make impossible the utilisation of this machinery for the building of houses out of the funds of the societies, unless they have very definite and special sanction within their rules.  I do not understand the object of the limitation, and I think it would simply destroy the effect of my amendment.  In view of this fact I would ask the President to accept the amendment, and then to look up the matter, as well as the effect of his proposed amendment, between now and the Report Stage.  If he were to do that, I think he would find that the effect of his proposed amendment would be simply to nullify the effect of my proposition.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the views expressed by Deputy Johnson.  Societies which facilitate their members in the matter of building houses do so, I think, from a special fund provided in these particular societies. If the President's amendment were insisted on, it would, as Deputy <Col N="1423" /> Johnson has pointed out, nullify the administration of these funds to the members.  There have been several cases in which grants have been given to members from amalgamated societies. I think if the amendment could be altered to read: &ldquo;the provision of a housing scheme for its members&rdquo; it might meet the point or meet the objection that has been raised.</P>

      <P>Of course, but if a number of people come together to put up houses, whether they are in a trades union or not, they are, I would say, entitled to whatever help you can give them under this Bill, which, I admit, is a very good effort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not lose sight of the issue in this matter.  An ordinary individual will get £75, and a public utility society £100.  There you have a difference of £25.  What is the reason of the difference?  I should say that the reason for the difference is, that we contemplate a public utility society undertaking to erect more houses, a great many more houses, than individual members of a society would, of themselves, build.  In other words, one of these organisations entering into the spirit of this measure, puts up 20 houses and is given in that case a sum of £2,000.  If twenty individual members come to us to put up their own houses, we only give them £75 each.  What is the reason for that? It is a simple one, and it is this: That there are a certain number of organisations of persons who have in their rules the provision of houses, not specially for the individual members of their societies at all, but as a general contribution towards the public good.  We <Col N="1424" /> have such organisations.  It is well known that we have one of the finest, if not the finest in the world, in the Artizans' Dwellings Company here in Dublin.  They have ceased operations for a number of years, but during their time they did remarkably well.  I referred to it here twelve months ago when I was speaking of people who came in to contribute to the relief of the housing problem.  At that time, I neglected to mention the name of one noble family that made a real contribution here in Dublin to the solution of the housing question, and that is the family of the Earl of Meath.  They did the work themselves, and not as a public utility society.  A public utility society undertaking to put up houses will do the work, to a large extent, out of their own funds, and will let the houses to certain individuals, members, perhaps, of their organisation in the case of a trade union, and to others in the case of the various companies or societies that I have mentioned, and in that way they will bring into play, in connection with the construction of houses, their capital, energy and industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My objection to the acceptance of Deputy Johnson's amendment is not that I object to a trade union or a friendly society registered under the Friendly Societies' Act of 1898, but that the individualist theory might be persisted in there; in other words, that ten members of an organisation might say: &ldquo;Put up ten houses for us, and by reason of this amendment we will get £100 each.  Lend us so much money, and we will pay the interest.&rdquo; I want more than that.  I want to have organisations building not only this year or next year, but continuously, and I want them to bring into play something that would not be put into operation if it were not for the exceptional advantages which are to be derived under this Bill.  An organisation might be started with five persons, and it might build five houses for its five members.  They are of no use to the State because they stop there.  An organisation of ten persons building twenty houses for people other than the ten members who compose it, who do the same thing next year, and let <Col N="1425" /> these houses to people who cannot afford to put down the cash themselves, is the sort of an organisation that we are interested in at the moment.  We want to bring into play in this question the speculative builder, and those societies and trade unions which will make it a condition not to stop building this year, but will go on putting up houses for a number of years, because we realise it is time that some real effort should be made towards solving the housing problem.  If Deputy Johnson will agree to leave over his amendment until the Report Stage I will put down my amendment for the Report Stage. In the meantime perhaps he would have an opportunity of looking into the matter.</P>

      <P>I do not want to mislead anyone in this matter.  I do not know of any suggestion that trade unions or friendly societies are thinking of entering into the business of building houses in the way that the President has indicated, and in the way that public utility societies will, as he hopes, do under this Bill.  The definition speaks of the society whose object includes the erection and reconstruction of houses.  Now, there are many societies registered under the I. and P.S. Acts whose main business is not the building or reconstruction of houses, but by whom that work is incidentally and occasionally undertaken. Some of the industrial and cooperative societies registered under these Acts do that, but it is not their main business.  They may do it occasionally for their members, but under this definition, by the fact that their objects do include the erection and reconstruction of houses they would get the advantage even though it was not their main purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>My proposition is that if it is possible for any other <Col N="1426" /> society whose objects may include the erection and reconstruction of houses for the working classes, then some definition should be allowed to cover other organisations which may be capable, within their rules, of providing houses, but who do not at all set out to make it their main purpose.  So far as putting them on even terms, my purpose would be served if the Minister would add my amendment after the words &ldquo;Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1913.&rdquo;  That would mean that either friendly society or trade union, before it could come into this definition, would require that its objects include the erection and reconstruction of houses. That would be one way of meeting the President if he is very strong on the point that the object should be specifically stated.  But I think that for the purpose of erecting houses you must have facilities given that may very well mean the erection of quite a number of houses if friendly societies, as well as trade unions, can all be brought into it.  Let me illustrate a point that has just occurred to me.  The National Health Insurance Commission specifies certain trust funds to which funds of societies may be applied, or invested. I do not know whether under those Health Insurance Acts the health insurance societies may not be capable of spending a considerable share of their moneys in erecting houses if they were allowed under the definition.  Instead of investing in railways, they might be allowed to invest in houses, and that might mean a considerable amount of money available for that purpose.  Some of those societies are registered as part of the national health insurance scheme, but they are societies registered under the Trade Union Acts, and in these cases it might be well to leave them as free as possible.  I think you would have a considerable amount of money available if the societies would be willing to invest it for that purpose.</P>

      <P>My few remarks will be directed towards the explanation of the President as to why he is cutting down the grant from £100 to £75 to private speculators and people who desire to build their own houses. The President said that a person who built his own house is not of very much <Col N="1427" /> advantage to the State.  It was only six months ago that the President stated the direct opposite when he said that a person who built his house was doing good patriotic work, and, as a result of that statement, made some months ago, a number of people set about looking for sites for their own houses.  Some of them got sites, but they failed to get people to join in to start a public utility society.  They had their plans prepared.  I have a case here where people agreed to build houses with the assistance of last year's grant, and where they expected to get £100 apiece.  They got their plans prepared, but they are not yet approved by the Commissioners.  Having got the land as well as their plans prepared under the Act, they immediately found that they were to get a sum reduced by £50 between the two.  They could not get five people to agree.  They were to get £100 apiece, now the sum of £25 apiece comes off them, not being a utility society.  I think the President would be wise&mdash;he has been very gracious upon housing and he has made great efforts to get houses built&mdash;to withdraw this little limitation so that private people will be able to build here and there where they can secure a piece of ground.  I have a letter in my hand dealing with this matter.  It is:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir,&mdash;I have to thank you very sincerely for your efforts to get the maximum grant of £100 for those about to build under the 1925 Act.  In my own case it will show you how hard it is to have the grant cut down from £100 under last year's Act to £75 in the new Act.  In the middle of last February I had plans, builder, etc., all ready, just going forward to the Borough Commissioners, when the crux arose out of the grant.  This has now been got over.  I and another are prepared to build a house each, but the loss of £50 is more than we can afford as it means the borrowing of more money, and we have reached the high-water mark of borrowing, so you see it hits us very hard.  We are both working people, and the five-roomed houses we were to build were on the Government's approved plan.  I am asking if you will continue your efforts in favour <Col N="1428" /> of obtaining the £100.&rdquo;  And then the letter goes on to mention a few popular Deputies that the writer hopes I would try to see and get them to do the same.</P>

      <P>This Bill was introduced a fortnight ago, but the mere introduction of a Bill does not repeal an Act of Parliament.  The complaint of the Deputy is that we have repealed the Act.  We have not yet repealed the Act.  As I explained the other day, there is £10,000 which is still earmarked under last year's Act.  Deputy Byrne's friends concerned themselves writing letters and expressing hopes, instead of going to the fountain-head, namely, the Minister who is the person to apply to.  I told the Deputy, a fortnight ago, and again to-day, that there is still £10,000 available awaiting the industry and energy of his friends when they are ready to start business.</P>

I was discussing public utility societies and their contribution to the housing problem. Everybody knows that private individuals of themselves will not solve the housing problem.  In last year's Act we endeavoured to get more than private individuals, but not to neglect private individuals.  Precisely the same thing is happening with regard to this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to rise merely to put Deputy Byrne's point in order.  As I gather, the President's objection to Deputy Johnson's amendment is that under its operations members of trade union societies might join together to utilise their trade union as a public utility society &mdash;ten people, I think, he took as an illustration, would combine to obtain houses.  Each of the ten who promoted the building would occupy his own house.  In that way they would have gained twenty-five pounds as members of a public utility society, which, as individual builders of their own house, they could not have obtained.  I wonder am I correct in that summary of the President's argument? In other words, the President's objection to Deputy Johnson's amendment is a difficulty created by the President himself in the present Bill, because it is to my mind, with all respect, an arbitrary proceeding to limit the private builders' subsidy to £75, whereas in the Housing Facilities Act and in the Housing Facilities (Amendment) Act the figures for a three, four and five-roomed house were, respectively, £60, £80 and £100.  A differentiation of £75 and £100 is introduced for the first time in the present proposal. How can that be a fatal objection to Deputy Johnson's amendment?  I heartily concur with Deputy Wilson in the point that as we are all concerned in getting as many houses built as possible&mdash;no doubt, as the President interjected, &ldquo;Cheaply, efficiently and rapidly&rdquo;&mdash;every agency that could be <Col N="1430" /> employed for the purpose should be joined in the work.  I think we could understand the position better if the section of the Act quoted could be read to us, for what its specific enactment is I do not think the House is fully acquainted with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may say so, Deputy Johnson's amendment amounts to this&mdash;namely, he wants to make the building of houses a trustee investment; in other words, to utilise the funds that in an ordinary way would be subject to certain limitations as to investment, and to make them available for building houses.  That is a rather far-reaching proposition.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has taken my reference to health insurance funds in a way which I did not intend. I only brought that forward to illustrate a possible source of house-building money, but those funds are only allowed to be used for a special purpose <Col N="1431" /> by permission of the Health Insurance Commissioners.  I do not know if the Commissioners could, within their present powers, or would in any case, allow funds of a health insurance society to be invested in the building of houses.  I threw that out as a possibility. In any case, the funds of trade unions or friendly societies are, within their present rules, in many cases used for the building of houses for members.  All I am asking is that any society of that kind which has powers to build houses for its members may be able under this section to take advantage of the subsidy in the same way as a public utility society will be able to do.  That is the whole object of my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Professor Magennis does not appear to appreciate the distinction drawn between the £75 grant this year and the £100 grant last year, or between the £75 grant this year to individuals and the £100 grant to public utility societies.  I thought I explained that a public utility society, such as we contemplate operating under this section, will construct houses and will let them at rents to people.  There is a remarkable difference between that sort of activity in connection with housing and an individual who has a couple of hundred pounds, and who is able to have a house built for himself.  In one case a number of persons coming together provide houses that will be let at a rent, and in the other case an individual having money is in a position to get a house built.  The people who can afford to pay rents must get a little more assistance from the State.  People who can afford to put up three or four hundred pounds for the construction of a house are not so greatly in need. That is the distinction between the two. It was discovered last year that local authorities could operate this Bill.  I thought first that it would be possible to interest companies and societies so that local authorities would be relieved of that duty.  They asked it to be extended and we have extended it. They occupy much the same position as public utility societies.  £150 &mdash;supposing a local authority gave £75 <Col N="1432" /> and the Government gave £75&mdash;is a much larger contribution than is paid in any of the countries near us.</P>

      <P>I do not understand the hesitancy of the President in accepting Deputy Johnson's amendment. I think the members of trade unions are the people the President should like to see taking an interest in the building of houses.  We have heard complaints here from time to time that the people engaged in the building trade do not seem to be concerned at all with the people who will have to inhabit the houses; that is to say, that they are drawing too much wages and have no regard for the interests of the people who will have to occupy the houses. To my mind, if the President permits trade unions taking advantage of the Bill, and if he accepts the amendment, then they will be brought into direct touch with the question of building, and they will be called upon to take an interest in the question of providing houses, especially for the working classes, all over the country.  It has been alleged that there is overcharging in connection with the building of houses.  If the allegation that the wages are too high in the building industries is true, and if the working classes find in practice what the difficulties are, there will be an easing of the position.  I think the President ought to accept Deputy Johnson's amendment, because really the best <Col N="1433" /> thing to do is to get the people concerned, the workers, to build for themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The President does not quite appreciate the difficulty of a trade union or a friendly society with regard to extending its rules.  There is a great deal of formula to be gone through, and it takes months and sometimes years to have rules altered. Societies are very loath to get rules changed; in fact, some societies quite deliberately make a provision within their rules that there shall be no change in their rules within two years because of the expense involved in getting the rules changed, notices of all kinds having to be made, and a great deal of formula to be gone through.  I think that applies to friendly societies to a greater degree even than to trade unions, and the cost of two or three houses would probably be eaten up in getting the necessary changes made. They simply would not go to that trouble and expense, and if you make that a condition it will prevent trade union activity in that direction.</P>

      <P>Before you go to the next amendment, would you permit me, sir, to ask a question as regards a definition that intervenes?  The words &ldquo;self-contained flat&rdquo; mean any part of a building suitable for separate occupation as a dwellinghouse.  Who is to determine the question of suitability? In Section 4 of the present Bill provision is made for an official, who is to be known as an appointed officer, who is to inspect the erection and decide whether or not it has been completed in a proper and workmanlike manner, but I cannot find either in this Bill or the original Act a reference to an officer whose duty it will be to declare that the place is suitable for use as a dwellinghouse.  Now, it occurs to me that if the suitability is dealt with only at the stage at which the question as to allowing the grant or subsidy becomes actual, that is rather late, and consequently is unfair to whoever undertook the enterprise.  There should, I suggest, be some provision made for permitting those who undertake the alteration of an existing building for reconstructing it into flats to know what would be deemed suitable and what would not.  There are in the First Schedule a number of provisions in regard to area, but the thing was even more detailed in the new Housing Order, 1925, but still we are not told that the mere provision of minimum space constitutes suitability.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 31 to delete the words &ldquo;a building suitable for occupation as.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It appears to me that any old stable or building of any sort could be converted into a dwelling-house, and the person who reconstructed it would be qualified for the grant.  I may be wrong in that, and I would like to hear the Minister's views on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that a stable might be reconstructed, but it is not possible that an insanitary stable, or a stable in a congested area, would be passed by persons authorised by the Minister to inspect.  The Inspector has rules and regulations concerning these matters, and it is most unlikely that any building unsuitable for reconstruction by reason of being insanitary, or for some other cause, would be passed by the Minister or his official in this connection. The same thing applies to Deputy Professor Magennis's statement about self-contained flats.  There have been cases in which the Minister has accepted certificates from qualified persons not in his service, but only in respect of new buildings, and not in respect of reconstructed houses, and the inspection, and the regulations, rules, and competency of the persons appointed to make these inspections, render it impossible, or as nearly impossible as is conceivable, that an unsuitable house could be passed for reconstruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is in duty bound to tell us whether in the Bill there is any restriction on the class of house which may be reconstructed. He assures us, of course, that the Minister's officer would only allow a house to come under a subsidy if he were satisfied that it was a satisfactory one.  We may have complete faith in the judgment of that officer and the Minister, but there is nothing in the Bill, so far as I can see, which would ensure that the direction given to the officer would be such as to limit the kind of house which he would allow to be reconstructed.  In the original Act last year the definition of a house was a dwelling-house. <Col N="1436" /> In this definition of a house it is put down as a building suitable for occupation as a dwelling-house.  That obviously leaves a discretion to the officer as to what is suitable, and there is nothing else in the Bill to ensure that any conditions as to suitability shall be applied. The Minister will prescribe rules, and if last year's Act is taken as a guide, those rules may be quite satisfactory; but this Bill does not contain any clause requiring that houses should be of a certain kind or quality. I think this Bill, as it stands, may allow grants to be paid for the reconstruction of premises which are quite unsuitable for being turned into houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is really intended that the word &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; there should mean &ldquo;suitable in the opinion of the Minister.&rdquo;  Would it not be advisable to insert those words, and that possibly would satisfy both the objections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, in addition to that, there should be some officer by whom the suitability should be examined and reported upon.  There is no provision made to prevent someone from altering the existing building, say a stable, or some derelict building. A man may then, having spent his money in reconstructing, apply for his grant, and his application would be turned down.  Of course that is wildly improbable, I dare say, in the mind of the Local Government official; but still things that are wildly improbable in the imagination of an official can happen, and have happened.  Besides, we are now making legislation, and the thing ought to be made as watertight as it can be made.  Here, again, I raise the point of a definition clause which includes an undefined term that might be dealt with under regulations. I have looked into the Bill and the original Act, and I do not find in the present Bill provision made for laying down regulations to that effect.  It would be obviously the duty of some inspector to report upon the proposal to reconstruct a building so as to make it suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, it ought to be the duty of some official to say that the proposal to construct a house is a proposal to construct <Col N="1437" /> one that is suitable.  There are obviously regulations as to the site and the aspect.  Even such things as facing the sun and getting the greatest measure of sunshine upon the greatest number of rooms are provided for in the regulations under the 1924 Act. Such things as minimum floor space, the character of the ventilation, and other items like that, that have an important effect conditioning the hygienic value of the house, have not been exhausted in this Bill, while they were provided for in the last Act.  It seems to me that the definition clause could be improved upon.  Where a vague phrase like &ldquo;suitable for a dwelling-house&rdquo; occurs, it might be made more definite and more determinate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to follow that up by pointing out that there is a complete absence in the Bill of any reference to conditions such as surroundings, convenience, aspect, or position in regard to other houses, and so on.  The definition says that the word house means a building suitable for occupation as a dwelling-house. &ldquo;This Act shall apply to every house which complies with the rules set out in the First Schedule to this Act, and with any other rules or regulations prescribed for that purpose.&rdquo;  We are, therefore, bound to rely entirely on any other rules or regulations prescribed. In the absence of any such rules or regulations, the position is that the word &ldquo;house&rdquo; means &ldquo;every building suitable for occupation as a dwelling-house, and includes a self-contained flat.&rdquo;  That complies with the First Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in the First Schedule dealing with the quality of the house.  You are therefore left entirely dependent on rules which the Minister may make.  There is no hint in the Bill of a direction to the Minister as to the kind of rules he will make. That is the defect.  Deputy Nagle's amendment does not go very far in the way of definition; but it indicates that a house shall be a dwelling-house, not a building suitable for occupation as a dwelling-house.  One does know something of what is meant by a dwelling-house. If you say that a broken stable <Col N="1438" />&mdash;now that a man has a motor car, and does not want a stable&mdash;is suitable for John Smith as a dwelling-house, under the Bill there may be a subsidy given for the reconstruction of that, and I think that is not desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11 makes provision for such regulations as may be required for carrying this Bill into effect.  It is open to the Minister to make regulations dealing with such matters in the same way as he made them last year.</P>

      <P>So far as a comparison can be made with the Act of last year, I think that the present Bill is better than last year's Act.  In last year's Act it is stated &ldquo;the word `house' means a dwellinghouse.&rdquo;  In this Bill it is stated: &ldquo;The word `house' means a building suitable for occupation as a dwellinghouse and includes a self-contained flat.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The great advantage of the term &ldquo;dwellinghouse&rdquo; is that there are innumerable legal decisions.  When it is stated that &ldquo;house&rdquo; means a dwellinghouse, one can go immediately to the decisions of the law courts and have light in the matter, whereas, qualifying the word dwellinghouse with a limiting condition &ldquo;suitable for occupation,&rdquo; immediately requires that someone should determine whether or not it is suitable.  Who is that person?  I presume it is the Minister. But how and by what procedure? Are those who have in prospect the reconstruction of a new building, not to know from the beginning what is likely to pass as suitable for reconstruction?</P>

      <P>The Bill, in many respects, is weak, but we are not dealing with the Bill; we are dealing with the amendment to the provision which states that &ldquo;the word `house' means a building suitable for occupation as a dwellinghouse.&rdquo;  If you accept the amendment the definition will read: &ldquo;The word `house' means a dwelling-house and includes a self-contained flat.&rdquo;  Surely that is a more workmanlike phraseology and definition than to enlarge this word &ldquo;house&rdquo; so as to mean a stable suitable for occupation as a dwellinghouse, or any building, including a stable, which the officer may think is suitable for occupation as a dwellinghouse and includes a self-contained flat.  Surely, if it were satisfactory in the last Bill with regard to the definition, there is no objection to re-enacting it, unless some case can be made for the alteration.  So far as I can understand it, the alteration is going to enable the poorer class of building, the building which hitherto has been thought to be unfit for habitation, to be reconstructed and turned into a dwellinghouse.  I am afraid that is going to be the consequence of this definition.</P>

      <P>Before Section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) The Small Dwellings Acquisition (Ireland) Acts, 1899 and 1919, shall apply to the acquisition of a house to be erected under this Act as they apply to the acquisition of an existing house, subject to such necessary adaptations as may be made by regulations prescribed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>(2)  The regulations to be made by the Minister under this section may include adaptations of Section 4 of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposition in the amendment is to apply the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts with the necessary adaptations. There are certain provisions in the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts which would make it impossible, I think, for any local authority to use these Acts under the present Bill. While I am not suggesting that local authorities in any general way are at present likely to be in a position to take advantage or to give the advantages to citizens of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, I think it is well that there should be an opportunity, if any local authority were in that position, to provide such advantages as these Acts give with all the necessary adaptations. These Acts enable local authorities to lend moneys for the purpose of buying houses subject to a limit of £800; 90 per cent. of the value of the house is the maximum advance and fifty years is the maximum period for repayment, but the advance can be only made for the <Col N="1443" /> advantage of persons resident in the house.  The proposition is that it should be possible for the Minister to adapt that by rule and to make it apply to a person who intended to reside in the house.  The Northern Government passed a Bill of that kind and adapted these Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, in this way, by a regular series of sections. In putting down this amendment, I have tried to avoid that long series of amendments which had some back reference clauses, and I leave it to the Minister to make certain adaptations. I do not know whether any objection can be raised to this proposition, and I would like to hear the views of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The objection to it is that it is unnecessary.  The Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts really apply to these houses.  If there was any limitation it was in respect of the sum. I think that in England they sanctioned something like £1,200 under these Acts, whereas the amount here is £800.  The whole trouble about the matter of utilising the Small Dwellings Acts is that the Local Loans Fund is no longer available.  Even if it were, the interest would be very high at present.  The Government would not be in a position to lend money at a lesser price than that at which they were able to borrow themselves.  Pre-war it was possible for a local authority to get money at 3½ to 3¾ per cent., and they charged about 5/- per cent., which enabled a person to get £300 or £400 at 4 per cent.  That is not possible at present, and until the Local Loans Fund can be put into commission, I do not think, even though these Acts do apply at present and will apply to this Bill, that any useful purpose would be effected by having the advantage of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  I should say that it does not appear to me to be likely that a local authority would lend 90 per cent. of the market value of one of these houses.  I take the market value of the house to be somewhere about £600, of which approximately £150 would be put up by the local authority, or by the Government.  It would not be reasonable to expect a local authority to lend 90 per cent. of the £600.</P>

      <P>The section sets out in paragraph (c) that a local authority may grant, sell or lease any portion of any land in its possession to any person or society, and in the case of a sale or lease the price or rent to be paid by such person may be less than the price of rent&mdash;I think that that &ldquo;of&rdquo; should be &ldquo;or&rdquo;&mdash;which could be obtained for the sale or lease of such land in the open market. That may be&mdash;I think it probably is&mdash;a very desirable provision, to allow a local authority to sell or let its property for this purpose, provided it is quite clearly understood that it is for this purpose.  But there is a danger that I think we should guard against, that a local authority, or more likely, if I may be allowed to say it in the presence of the Minister for Local Government, and also in the presence of Deputy Connor Hogan, the single person who is appointed a commissioner may be induced to part with municipal property at an inordinately low price for a consideration, or perhaps not for a consideration but as a favour, to make himself popular with the person to whom he sells or leases it.  My proposition <Col N="1447" /> is to include the provision, as we desire to amend it, which the Combined Purchasing Bill contains regarding the audit.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (c), line 35, after the word &ldquo;market&rdquo; to add&mdash;&ldquo;but if the auditor is satisfied that the price or rent was fixed at less than that which could have been obtained in the open market for any fraudulent or improper purpose or object or without due regard to their duties by the members of the local authority fixing or authorising the fixing of the same, he shall charge against such members jointly and severally the amount of any loss caused to the local authority thereby.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the provision proposed by the Minister for Local Government in the Combined Purchasing Bill, except that we require the auditor to be satisfied that it was for a fraudulent purpose, and I think that some safeguard of that kind is required for fear that any commissioner may be persuaded or tempted to dispose of municipal property at an entirely too low price or rent.  I therefore move the amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 6, sub-section (1) says:&mdash;&ldquo;A local authority may, with the consent of the Minister, assist the erection of houses to which this Act applies in their functional area in any of the ways following.&rdquo;  In that case the Minister must be satisfied, I should say, that the particular proposition in question is sound, that there is nothing fraudulent about it, that it is for the provision of houses; and granted that the Minister and the local authority are both satisfied that it is a good bargain, I think that the services of the auditor for the purpose of seeing whether or not the price or rent fixed was either fraudulent or improper would scarcely arise.  It is actually <Col N="1448" /> mentioned in the last few lines of paragraph (c): &ldquo;and in the case of a sale or lease the price or rent to be paid by such person or society may be less than the price or rent which could be obtained for the sale or lease of such land in the open market.&rdquo;  That is with a view to helping the distribution of land to intending builders.

      <P>I would like to get some information from the Minister as to this clause and as to how it affects the County Dublin.  As far as I can gather, the effect of this amendment would be that if there was a house built in a rural district close to the borders of the city or of the townships, the Government grant would be given, but there would be no assistance obtainable from the rural district council. It may be that the county council can give facilities, assuming the abolition of the rural district council.  But there is a doubt, I think, as to whether the section would allow the county council to make this grant in lieu of the rural district council.  I think if the county council is not in a position to give the extra facilities then a person within the county who might desire to get the assistance of a local authority would be unfairly discriminated against.

The county council is not, in respect of the County of Dublin, doing the work henceforward of the rural district councils in the same way as in other counties, so that we are in the position, if this amendment is carried, that the local authority in respect of the County of Dublin will not have any power to assist the house builder as it will have in other counties.</P>

But the amendment that Deputy Duggan is moving says that this section shall not apply to the rural district councils in the county of Dublin.

      <P>The point I was trying to explain, and I apparently made it more confused, was&mdash;&ldquo;in this section the expression `functional area means' in respect of the council of any borough, or urban district, or the Commissioners of any town situated therein.&rdquo;  In the case of the County Council of Dublin there will be, for a time, rural district councils, whereas in the case of the other counties, when the Local Government Bill has gone through, there will not be.  Consequently, the functional area of the County of Dublin, as provided here, will mean the area of the county exclusive of every borough, urban district or township situated therein.  This amendment of Deputy Duggan says that <Col N="1451" /> the local authority shall not include the council of a rural district in the County of Dublin.  Therefore the local authority that is referred to in sub-section (3) of this section is declared not to be a local authority for that purpose in the County Dublin.  I think if you add these two together you will find it means that the whole function is to be discharged by the county council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the opposite view.  Assuming that Deputy Duggan's amendment is inserted, sub-section (3) says &ldquo;any local authority except the rural district councils in the County of Dublin may borrow money,&rdquo; and so on.

      <P>In the first place in this Bill, save where the text otherwise requires it, the expression &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; means and includes the council of a county or borough or urban district.

      <P>Deputy Johnson overlooks the significance of sub-section (b) in sub-section (2) of Section 6.  In this section the expression &ldquo;functional area&rdquo; means, in the case of a county council, &ldquo;the area of the county, exclusive of every borough urban district or town situated therein.&rdquo;  Therefore the county council's of Dublin functional area will be the whole area of the county, except the Borough of the City of Dublin and the urban districts.  Consequently the <Col N="1452" /> County Council of Dublin functions over the area that is now describable as the area under a rural district council. There is no failure of power.  There is nothing unprovided for.  Then when any local authority is mentioned, in sub-section (3) the precaution is taken that still surviving rural district councils are not to be deemed local authorities within the meaning of this sub-section.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 11, to delete the words &ldquo;and when required by the Minister shall.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with this amendment it would be well perhaps to take it with its context.  Deputies will notice what the section proposes to do.  It gives power to the local authorities voluntarily to remit the rates on any houses constructed under this Bill, or any houses in respect of which a grant for reconstruction has been made.  That is after the first revaluation.  I am not quarrelling so much with the principle of giving for a reasonable period a remission of rates in respect of new buildings, but when it is made mandatory on the local authorities I submit it is scarcely fair.  It is, to a certain extent, superseding them in their functions and depriving them of a certain amount of money which would accrue. If they are willing to forego rates in respect of those houses it is their responsibility, but I submit, in justice to the ratepayers, that if any county council or local authority opposes the idea of remission of the rate it is scarcely fair for a Minister to come along and exercise the arbitrary powers this section confers on him.  It is scarcely fair to the local authority and is unjust to the ratepayers that the Minister should have power to come along to a council and compel them to remit rates.  It would mean a redistribution of the incidence of local taxation. What I say in connection with this amendment is applicable to the subsequent amendments I have down to the section.  There is an idea abroad which is a reversion to the feudalistic <Col N="1454" /> theory of a single tax, which inferentially means a land tax.</P>
    <P>We propose to forego the rates on houses which have been constructed under the Bill.  In addition, in this section we are taking powers to say that houses reconstructed after being revalued shall likewise benefit and the Minister shall have mandatory powers over local authorities even to forego the rates or that portion of the rates which this schedule sets out.  The revaluation perhaps may not mean an increase beyond ten, twenty or thirty per cent.  I doubt if in any case it would mean fifty per cent.  It is scarcely equitable to the local authority that they should be allowed to forego the rates, because this thing would mean a very serious monetary loss to them and they would be compelled to redistribute the incidence of taxation.  We debated this question the week before last very fully and I may still say with reference to the principle that it is not just that houses, whether reconstructed or erected, should be allowed to forego their responsibility to the extent that this section would require.  The fact is that you would be bringing into the country a certain section of irresponsible voters who will not have regard to extravagance or otherwise in local taxation, and who, because they find their own rates lower&mdash;they will be low for a long period of years under this section&mdash;will permit gross abuses to flourish.  We should take long views on this point.  We should not demoralise the civic spirit, but as far as possible we should develop it.  When we supersede the local authorities, when we divest them of their direct responsibility to the people, we are doing something which we ought not to, and which I submit is detrimental and prejudicial to the best interests of the ratepayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hogan seems to read the clause as if it were:</P>
      <P>Any local authority having power to levy rates shall, as required by the Minister ...</P>
      <P>He has missed the point, I suggest, with all respect to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1455" /> Any local authority having power to levy rates may&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>It is left in their discretion, with this slight limitation on their discretion&mdash;</P>
    <P>and when required by the Minister shall ...</P>
    <P>That is, if and when.  Consequently, the pressure will be put upon the local authority only when a sufficient case has been made to the Minister as against a refusing authority.  Deputy Hogan takes high ground in the matter and makes this a constitutional question. So far as there is a constitutional principle involved in it, I am entirely with him.  It brings us to the question as to how far the central Government&mdash;the National Government&mdash;is to interfere in local government; how far the direct representatives of the people administering local affairs are to be under the absolute direction of the central Department. Deputy Hogan is right in his principle.  I am not quite so sure that he is right in the way that he has applied it, because he will see, on reflection, that this housing question is a matter of great national policy.  It is not something that concerns one district of the nation and not another.  It is a matter that most materially affects the well-being of the nation in the future&mdash;and in the immediate future, too.  It affects it vitally.  If some local authority, through a mistaken conception of its duty to the ratepayers to keep rates low, were to attempt to block this policy, it is necessary that there should be this machinery of appeal, on the part of those aggrieved in that locality, and that they should be able to make their petition to the Minister.  I assume that the Minister would go into the merits of the case and, if he found that there was good cause for coercing the local authority, then he would have the power to do so under sub-section (1) of Section 8.  If the local authority were ordered to do it in all cases, and to an unlimited extent, then Deputy Hogan would have an unanswerable case.  But the limits are laid down as regards remission and the period over which the remission is to be granted is determined.</P>
    <P>Then, again, as I pointed out in the <Col N="1456" /> beginning, the Minister is not invested with absolute authority in the matter. It is only as and when he is appealed to that he exercises this authority, so that I see no trace of bureaucracy in the matter, that we who are so adverse to bureaucracy might be suspicious of. So far as Deputy Hogan speaks in the interests of the ratepayers in a locality and stands for the right of the local authority as the representative trustee of those local interests, we ought to support him.  But when the clash comes, as in his case it has come, between the purely local interests of a smaller rate or a different incidence of taxation and the national policy for the betterment of the whole nation, then, I think, the demand of the nation is paramount.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced by Deputy Magennis's argument.  I think if he had concluded by saying that the Minister shall require of all local authorities, in all cases, to remit those rates, because of the national emergency, he might have come to a logical conclusion.  But when he says that only in such cases as there may be appeals will he intervene, then the case for the national emergency and the national need seems to fall, because the amount of the grant that is to be paid does not vary from town to town.  The case for the section would be stronger, I think, if we knew what is the policy of the Ministry in this matter.  I think we ought to have some information as to the requirements of the Ministry under the last Act.  Under Section 7 of last year's principal Act the Minister had those powers.  £300,000, or thereabouts, has been allocated.  Have the local authorities been required in any case or in all cases to give this remission?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been quite voluntary?  Then we must bear in mind &mdash;we cannot avoid referring to the schedule&mdash;that in last year's Act there were certain limitations of rents and of prices at which these houses could be sold.  There is none now under this Bill, and the prices will rise or fall according <Col N="1457" /> as to whether or not the local authority is making these remissions.  So you are going to place in the hands of the Minister power to add still further to the market value of the house which is built with this subsidy, and which may vary according as to whether the local authority is prepared to grant these remissions or not, or as to whether the Minister, in making the allocation, requires the local authority to make these remissions or not.  One may say that, within this section, the Minister may require a local authority to make remissions in the case of one housing scheme but not in the case of another housing scheme.  That would certainly be an unsatisfactory consequence of this section.  I am inclined, on the face of it, to agree with the amendment of Deputy Hogan, especially in view of the removal of any limitation of the price at which houses may be sold or the rents at which they may be let.  Apparently, it is assumed that the local authorities will, in all cases, make these remissions in future as they have done in the past. In the case of any local authority which refuses, the Minister will require it to do so.  I think that is the conclusion we have to arrive at, that the intention is, in all cases, that the Ministry shall require the local authority to make remissions unless it does so voluntarily. Unless the Minister can bring forward very cogent arguments, I shall vote for the amendment.</P>

      <P>Supposing &ldquo;B.,&rdquo; who has, to take the President's illustration, £200 or £300 of his own, wishes to build a house.  He applies <Col N="1458" /> for and is to have a subsidy.  It is conceivable that the local authority, inflamed with holy zeal for its own rates, might say in a case like that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are not going to put the Act into operation in regard to a man of this type,&rdquo; and he might very well feel aggrieved.  He would then appeal to the Minister.  The Minister would have to consider that case in reference to the whole local conditions.  That, I suggest, is what Deputy Johnson overlooked when he wanted me to draw the logical conclusion.  I refuse to draw the logical conclusion when the conclusion is at variance with the actualities of life, following my favourite formula: that life is larger than logic. Deputy Johnson thinks that because the Minister is invested with power to compel, he must exercise it always. The discretion is given to the local authority in the first instance.  Those who are aggrieved by its exercise appeal to the Minister.  Then the Minister has his discretion in the second instance.  There is no reason to suppose, in the very improbable event of a local authority unfairly refusing, that the Minister would not put on the screw.  To that extent I think Deputy Johnson is right in the prophetic attitude he adopted.  On the other hand, suppose a good case is made in the particular instances why the local authority should not, then presumably the Minister, exercising natural justice, ordinary equity, would not put on the screw.  Consequently, I read the section to be in effect that &ldquo;any local authority having power to levy rates may (that is, in its own discretion) &ldquo;do so-and-so, and when required by the Minister shall.&rdquo;  That &ldquo;when&rdquo; means in the legal phraseology &ldquo;if and when required by the Minister,&rdquo; but that is not an arbitrary power given to the Minister.  It is the case that is usually in contemplation for example in all these Acts where &ldquo;shall with the approval of the Minister for Finance,&rdquo; and so on, occurs.  It always has in view that the case is gone into and considered and the reasons for and against well weighed.</P>

      <P>The President said in answer to a question by Deputy Johnson <Col N="1459" /> that the local authorities have all agreed to this particular section.  I do not think that is a fair answer, because I am of opinion that 80 per cent. of the local authorities have not considered the section at all in its true aspect.  For instance, very few of the local authorities have put up schemes. Deputy Magennis said that the local authorities have a discretion in the matter.  I do not think that is a fair statement either, because it has gone broadcast through the country that local authorities should remit a certain portion of the rates, and it is taken for granted that it is mandatory upon them to do so.  It is all very well to talk about &ldquo;may.&rdquo;  I am inclined to think that it is a &ldquo;vaccination&rdquo; may, because all through the Vaccination Act we have &ldquo;may,&rdquo; and when we come to get an interpretation of that &ldquo;may&rdquo; it means &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  That is what it is in this Bill.  The case that could have been made for such a section as this during the progress of the last Housing Bill through the Dáil has fallen completely to the ground because of the fact mentioned by Deputy Johnson, that restrictions have been removed now The incidence of rating and taxation various very much in different localities.  No matter what the remission of rates may be, all the people should be liable for poor rate in full.  The country is in such a state at present that no person should be relieved of his responsibility owing to the distress prevailing.  There should be no exception so far as the poor rate is concerned.  In Wexford we have a special Act of Parliament which permits of us making the assessment on the landlord for certain rates; the borough rate and water rate.  He, in turn, must recover from the tenant.  We had a case in the courts this week in which we succeeded in getting the rate from the landlord.  Now, the restrictions are removed.  Supposing a house is built for which the economic rent would be 12/- or 13/- per week.  The landlord may charge the tenant 17/- or 18/-.  In particular areas he would be liable for the rate.  He has carried out a certain amount of speculation and he gets off scot free so far as his rates are concerned. <Col N="1460" /> He is making a good thing out of the building of the house after being subsidised by the Government. This whole matter, in view of the restrictions being removed, requires closer examination, and we should not be asked, without further consideration being given to it, to pass this section. The same case cannot be made now as was made during the progress of the last Housing Bill through the Dáil.</P>

      <P>We know what the President will have to say on this amendment.  The Dáil agreed to a somewhat similar principle on a former occasion.

      <P>It is all right to say that the Minister may not use his power and authority, that rather he will use his discretion.  It seems to me that what the Minister will be confronted with under this section will be something like this: We will have down the country people availing of the facilities afforded by the Bill, and building houses.  If the local authority is not satisfied to give the remission in rates these people, if wealthy enough, can come up here and interview the Minister and put their case to him, and the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; compel the local authority to change its mind.  That is the power we are giving the Minister. He &ldquo;shall&rdquo; compel that local authority that is responsible for finding money to carry on the administration of local affairs, to allow one body of citizens residing in a certain area not to bear their burden of local taxation but put it on to others.  I suggest that, in plain terms, that is what it means.  Whether Deputy Magennis thinks that that is a principle that ought to be accepted, particularly in rural districts where the burden of local taxation is too heavy, I do not know.  It is a principle that cannot be accepted in the rural districts. In these districts we believe that everybody ought to bear their fair share of the burden of taxation.  We believe <Col N="1461" /> that, when the State is prepared to make a grant to a man to build a house, that man ought to carry his burden of local taxation.  For the rural population, certainly, the building of a house and the remission in rates will mean a benefit conferred, not on this, but on coming generations.</P>
      <P>Farms do not change hands as often as other businesses.  A remission of rates in accordance with this Bill would mean a benefit not to this generation but to coming generations, when things may be altered.  We believe it is not fair to the ratepayers in rural areas that the Minister should have authority to come along, on certain representations that may be made by a minority, and command the representatives of the people to take the burden of taxation off one section and put it on another that is, perhaps, less able to bear it.</P>

      <P>There is nothing to reply to.  I heard much the same story for the last fortnight or three weeks, and the Dáil turned it down. The case made for this amendment is the poorest case that I suppose I ever listened to.  Does anyone know anything of the housing conditions in the country?  Apparently we have lost sight of them, and do not realise there is a housing problem.  The Government gladly give £75 or £100.  The contribution from the local authority does not mean a loss, as we are increasing the rateable valuation of that local authority and not imposing on that local authority any expenses.  Take the Deputy's constituency.  If we build ten houses in Clare what expense is there on the local authority by that?  Do any more people go to the workhouse or use the roads than before?  Are they providing sewerage or are they providing water?  What are the expenses that the local authority will be groaning under by the addition of ten houses to the valuation list?</P>

      <P>Lunatics may come out of new houses, but I have not seen any of them.  If they do come from new houses, I do not think they <Col N="1462" /> come in any larger numbers by reason of the construction of new houses.  The Deputy says we are going to demoralise the citizenship of people by reason of the remission of rates.  What is the nature of the demoralisation?  The valuation of one of these houses will be about £16, and with a rate of 10/- in the £ the ordinary rates that would be collected, if it were not for this section, would be £8.  We proposed to collect only 5 per cent., or 8/- in the first year. The next year it will be 16/-, and the following year 24/-.  Is it not likely that the owner will take particular pains to know what is the reason for any increase, and that he will watch every expenditure incurred by the local authority, knowing that as time goes on he will have to pay not one-twentieth, two-twentieths, or three-twentieths, but twenty-twentieths of the £16?  In my view, it differs very much, but I suppose I have not the experience of the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Deputy Magennis, in a lyrical passage, said that the interests of the nation are paramount. I can rejoin with every show of truth and ask him when did he become the vocal medium of mob psychology. This idea that the interests of the nation are paramount, I submit, has its genesis in mob consciousness. Although I say that, I am not disputing the fact that the interests of the nation are paramount.  I agree with the principle, but I differ as to its application. We are told that there is a great housing problem.  I agree.  I know also, and I believe the President has an internal consciousness of the need of maintaining public solvency in matters of local administration.  You have two problems before you, the housing problem and the difficulty of maintaining your public services.  Does any Deputy, or does any Minister deny that at the present time the ratepayers throughout the length and breadth of the country, particularly the agricultural <Col N="1463" /> population, are hard pressed to meet the undue proportion of rates they have to pay.  The President stated that there will be only ten houses built in my constituency under this Bill. That is possible, but let me remind him that what we are dealing with is not a Bill for this year.  This is the third proposal to remit rates that has come before the Dáil.  I doubt if it will be the last.  We passed an identical Act a year ago.  In the Seanad an amendment was inserted in the Local Government Bill giving a remission of rates on houses or premises erected from 1920 to 1927 inclusive.  It was the last straw that broke the donkey's back.  Will the President say that this subsidy of £300,000 will be the last to be given by his administration to relieve the housing shortage?  I doubt it.  You have established the precedent of the State coming to the aid of housing, and I submit from the phraseology of this section that when you say nineteen years you contend that the housing shortage will extend for the greater part of nineteen years.</P>

Will a Government which has to depend very much for its majority on the urban areas resist it?  I deny it.  I say that the whole burden of maintaining local services will fall on the land.  It is true that these buildings will bear a growing volume of the burden, but the proposal in the section will mean that for ten years they will escape scot free or only give what is equivalent to a contribution for the maintenance of local services.  I submit that that is scarcely fair.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>There was a Branch Employment Office at Granard up to last September, when the branch manager resigned.  At that time the volume of work was not sufficient to justify special arrangements to provide a successor.  The work of the office was transferred to the parent exchange at Athlone, which henceforth dealt through the post with persons claiming unemployment benefit.  I do not think that the absence of a branch office has caused such inconvenience to unemployed persons in Granard as would have justified the disproportionate expense of opening a new office, but the present distribution of branch offices generally is under review, and I will have the case of Granard carefully considered.</P>
