      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his attention has been drawn to a resolution of the Athlone Urban District Council protesting against the action of his Department in deciding that all printing work in connection with the Local Government Elections was to be carried out in Dublin; whether he is aware that in the past, printing for the Government Departments such as Registers and Census Returns, was in great part done in the country printing offices; also, whether he is aware that the Athlone Printing Works has many times been able to obtain Government contracts by open tender; and whether, in view of these facts, he will urge that a fair proportion of the printing work in connection with the Registers shall be divided amongst printing offices in the country.</P>

      <P>I have seen a copy of the resolution referred to.  No decision of the nature suggested was arrived at.  Arrangements were made merely for the printing in bulk of supplies of forms, some of which were formerly printed in small quantities and at much greater expense.  All the printing required in <Col N="1980" /> connection with the forthcoming elections was not executed in Dublin. Advertisements were published inviting tenders for posters and forms.  It was open to provincial printing firms to tender accordingly, and portion of the printing has been entrusted to them.  The printing of the Registers of Electors is arranged by the Stationery Office, who also invite tenders, of which a proportion is invariably given to provincial firms.</P>

That a sum not exceeding £4,510 be granted to complete the sum necessary <Col N="1984" />to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1926, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Governor-General's Salary and Establishment Act, 1923.</entry>

    <P>There is shown in the Estimate this year a decrease of £1,168.  That saving arises almost entirely under sub-head (a).  The reduction is really accounted for by a reduction in the charge for the Governor-General's Aides-de-Camp.  In 1924-25 and the previous year the amount provided was for the full salaries of two Aides-de-Camp.  On the 22nd May, 1924, this arrangement was altered and payment of an allowance only to two Aides-de-Camp of £350 and £300, respectively, was arranged.  Those allowances are additional to their Army pay, which is borne in the Army Vote. The other items changed are of quite a minor character, and I do not think they require any particular comment. The provision for travelling allowances is less by £50 than last year.  This year's estimate is based on the experience of expenditure last year.  The deduction in respect to telegrams and telephones is also based on last year's experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from the Minister's statement that the item in respect of Aides-de-Camp allowances&mdash;the reduction there&mdash;is merely because the substantive portion of the Vote is transferred to another Vote and that the actual result is the same?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount is really less.  As a matter of fact, the total amount received by the Aides-de-Camp is less than last year.  Only portion of what they get is shown in this Vote, whereas last year the entire amount was shown in the Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The amounts paid last year for three Aides-de-Camp were £1,100, £1,000 and £700.  One of the present Aides-de-Camp is a colonel. I am not sure what the rank of the other is.  A colonel's rate of pay is, roughly, £560, or thereabouts, per annum.  I am afraid I cannot say what the rank of the second Aide-de-Camp is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe he is a commandant.  I had something to do with this last year and I know the particulars. In the case of the colonel who is down for £350, he replaces a major-general. The salary of a major-general is about £800.  The commandant replaces a major-general at a salary of £1,000.  The allowance in this case is £300.  There are 95 commandants in the Army, and the Estimate for them is £37,000, or about £400 a year, or £1 a day roughly.</P>

      <P>£400 plus £350.  The effect of the calculation, as I make it out, in respect of the figures which the President has given, is that the first A.D.C. has £890, that is, £540, plus £350; and the second A.D.C. has £400 plus £300.  That is, £1,690 as against £1,700 last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I was acting as Minister for Finance and as Minister for Defence at this time last year, and the sum shown was not settled until somewhere about the late summer.  It was an estimate at first, and the particular <Col N="1985" /> item had not been gone into. The £1,690 last year, in my view, had not included in it the whole salary. It was not intended that it should.  It was intended that the ordinary military commitments would be borne by the Army Vote, and that the extras would fall on this particular Vote.</P>

      <P>In what respect are the duties of these officers so much more strenuous or disagreeable than the duties of officers of similar rank in the Army as to warrant extra pay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so much for duties as for expenses inseparable from an office of that nature.  The allowance is made under various heads. It was made up having regard to the fact that the income tax people would take serious notice of it.  It had to take into consideration the transport to and from the Viceregal Lodge, the extra expenses incidental to functions that these officers would have to attend, and the ordinary expenses inseparable from an office of the sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move a reduction in this Vote of £3,000.  The general position I wish to take is similar to that taken in previous years. We are bound by law to provide a salary for the Governor-General of £10,000, which is the sum fixed in Australia, where living is dearer, and we are bound by law to provide a suitable establishment.  The question arises: what is a suitable establishment?  I maintain that a suitable establishment can be provided for £3,000 less than this Vote.  The salary of the Comptroller of the Household is £600, inclusive. I take it that his business is, mainly, generally to supervise the work and payment of the housekeeping accounts, and the control of the servants. The control of servants in such a house might be worth £600 to anybody who is able to do it efficiently.  The chaplain <Col N="1986" /> is paid £250, inclusive.  Whether that is a chaplain to the household or to the Governor-General I am not sure. Assuming that it is to the household, there are ten persons on this list. Like Deputy Figgis, I made a lightning calculation, and I find that ten men can be provided with a chaplain in the Army at £6 10s. a group on an average, yet we are asked to pay £250.  The medical attendant gets £100.  Whether that is for the Governor-General alone or for the household, I am not in a position to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>People in such a position might require extra chaplaincy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>They may, and they may require extra medical attendance. One may supplement the other. I do not know which would come first.  Two secretaries and an assistant presumably are required, presuming the Governor-General has any duties of an official nature, but I am inclined to believe that there is no need for A.D.C.'s, in addition to two secretaries and a clerical assistant.  I would like to have some explanation of the duties of A.D.C.'s, especially A.D.C.'s of a military type.  Are we to understand that it is necessary, when the Governor-General travels on official business to England, that he must be accompanied by A.D.C.'s?  £1,700 or £1,800 for this service is extravagant, because it is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to &ldquo;salaries, wages and allowances,&rdquo; there are &ldquo;allowances for expenses&rdquo; and for the &ldquo;maintenance of an official residence and establishment,&rdquo; £3,000.  That is over and above the accommodation for rents and rates, as, I take it, those are not charged against the salary.  Rates are paid out of Vote 17.  Office accommodation is paid out of Vote 11, and fuel and light, printing and stationery are paid out of Vote 22.  I do not think that we should be called upon to provide £3,000 for the maintenance of the establishment of the Governor-General over and above salaries and all office expenses and personal attendance, such as has been detailed in sub-head (1).  I think it can be fairly claimed that an establishment costing this sum of <Col N="1987" /> money is not necessary, and that, therefore, we are not bound by any statute to provide an establishment at this cost.  The nature of the duties are, I have no doubt, onerous, depending entirely on the judgment and discretion of the officer concerned, but it is one of the accidents of circumstances that the Viceregal Lodge is the establishment that has to be provided.  I think the State would be well served by a very much smaller house and, consequently, a very much smaller establishment, very much less expense being involved. We are not, I think, in a position to provide this kind of extravagance, because, as Deputy Cooper has said frequently during the last few weeks, we are bound to look through these Estimates and find out where there is a reasonable opportunity for making a reduction.</P>
    <P>I submit that this is an item that can be quite reasonably reduced without feeling that we are doing a thing meanly, and that we can re-allocate the balance of £4,000 in such a way as the Minister, with the advice of the Comptroller of the Household, might advise. I submit that £4,000 would be ample to provide a suitable establishment according to the Treaty and the Constitution, and I therefore beg to move the reduction of the Vote by £3,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to draw your attention to the fact that the device of sending back for reconsideration applies in regard to Votes in respect to which we are debarred from moving a reduction in the salary of a Minister. In this case it is desired to reduce the sum to be voted by £3,000.  It is not a reduction of any specific salary and, if the motion is carried, it would, of course, automatically mean a reference back for readjustment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I want to call attention to an item to which I drew attention last year, and that is with regard to the amount set down for telegrams and <Col N="1988" /> telephones.  It seems extraordinary that £850 is required for telegrams and telephones in this office, whereas the amount for similar purposes for the Oireachtas is only £425, or just about half the sum required for the Governor-General's establishment.  I think that we should have some explanation of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Deputy Johnson has said about the desirability of changing the class of residence and the great expense of keeping up the present establishment. I do not think it is justified, and I think that even the occupant of the position would not object to being made more comfortable as regards a house.  There are residences, large and palatial, in the neighbourhood of the Governor-General's residence which were formerly occupied by the Chief Secretary and the Under Secretary, and which were considered by the Government as suitable residences for oriental potentates during the Tailteann Games, and surely they ought to be considered fit for the Governor-General. I think there can be some reduction in this expenditure, and that some better public use could be made of the residence.  There are various items in this Vote which require explanation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey referred to this large sum for telephone calls.  I do not know if that refers to the private wire which used to be in operation between this residence and London, or whether that wire has been done away with. If it has not been done away with, it is high time it should be done away with.  It is a waste of money paying for the upkeep of such a wire to London. I do not see the necessity for it.  I wonder which of the officials, whose salaries are set down here, signs the Acts of the Oireachtas when the Governor-General is away.  When the Governor-General is in Rome or Spain or somewhere, who is responsible for affixing his signature to these Acts? Before going away does the Governor-General sign a number of blank papers in preparation for the legislative activities of this Assembly?</P>

      <P>His arguments were rather directed to criticising the Vote on these lines.  The discussion, so far, has gone on very narrow lines as regards the position the Governor-General occupies in the Free State.  If the idea is prevalent that the Governor-Generalship should be abolished altogether, the people who are taking up that attitude are, I think, taking up an attitude of opposition to the Constitution. My own view is that the Governor-General is occupying a very important position, that all these expenses are in connection with a position which we would wish to respect, because it is that of the head of the State, and that the expenses are not out of keeping with the position that the Governor-General should occupy in our midst.  I can speak with an unbiassed mind, because neither under the old regime nor under the new regime have I ever been in the Viceregal Lodge.</P>

      <P>That is a matter for the future.  I would ask the Deputies to take a broad view of this matter. When criticising the provision of two Aides-de-Camp, a clerk and a private secretary and assistant private secretary, Deputies should not regard this institution in the same light as a private house run by a private individual. It is not a private residence.  The occupant of the Viceregal Lodge is fulfilling a function of State which requires very considerable attention to details and a considerable amount of routine work.  While I would like to save money in any direction even to the extent of cutting down the expenses of the Governor-General if they <Col N="1990" /> were too high&mdash;I would deprecate the belittling of the position of the Governor-General by this House, and I would say that you are going to take away your own dignity by lowering the dignity of the Governor-General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about that.  You might easily have a Governor-General who would not invite me.  I want to deal with this question from a broad point of view.  At the present time, our constitutional position is the same as the constitutional position of Canada.  The Governor-General of Canada receives the same salary that our Governor-General receives from the Central Fund.  But I think I am right in saying&mdash;if I am not I hope I will be corrected&mdash;that he does not receive an allowance of £3,000 for the maintenance of his residence and establishment.  I do not think Deputy Hewat could argue that we are lowering our dignity when we say that our Governor-General should be placed in the same position as the Governor-General of a Dominion of 8,000,000 people, having a larger revenue than we have.  I do think some justification is needed for this allowance.  I know it is contemplated in the Constitution, but the Constitution did not contemplate that it should be on a scale of £3,000 a year, or on any fixed scale at all.  We need a little more justification than has been given of this item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also support Deputy Morrissey's point with regard to the cost of telephones.  Telephones at the Viceregal Lodge cost £800, and we find that the Ministry of Local Government and Public Health was able to do with £560 for telephones and telegrams.  The Ministry of Local Government and Public Health has to deal with every part of the country.  It has its inspectors and auditors travelling in every part of the country, and I think it has been very businesslike in this respect. It has cut its figures very low.  I think <Col N="1991" /> the Governor-General should not spend £300 more on telephones and telegrams than the Minister for Local Government.  In that respect the Government and the Governor-General are, I think, the victims of the old system. Under the old regime, there was a private switchboard and various other arrangements in the Viceregal Lodge, which are still being maintained. The necessity for these things has passed.  They were necessary when the Viceroy was the nominee of a political party, going out of office when they went out of office.  He had to keep in touch with the various Government Departments.  Sometimes he had to speak in the House of Lords on matters of Government policy, and sometimes he was a member of the Cabinet.  There was justification then for a private switchboard, as there would be justification at present for a private switchboard in the house of the President.  I would not quarrel with that at all.  But this is a relic of the past and I think, in existing conditions, it might easily be dispensed with.</P>

      <P>In any discussion that takes place on this Vote, under present conditions, there will inevitably be the conflict of two minds&mdash;the mind that welcomes the existence of the Governor-General in the Constitution and the responsibility on the State to pay him, and the mind which holds we could get on very well without him, but that if he is to be there, there ought to be some sense of proportion between what is paid him by way of expenses and what ought to be paid him in a State like this.  When there is a campaign of economy engaged in throughout the country, and a reduction of expenditure advocated, particularly by Deputies on the Independent Benches, in order to facilitate trade, we ought to be fair, and say that the right place to begin is at the top.  I doubt if anybody, even on the Government Benches, will contest the statement that there is room for economy in this Vote.  The salary of the Governor-General and the sums contributed, one way or other, through various Votes, go to show what this institution is costing.  I hold, with Deputy Johnson, that the cost of this establishment ought to be cut down. I believe that it is possible for the Ministry of Finance to see that it is cut down without acting in a way that might seem penurious.  If the Governor-General gets the maintenance of his establishment practically defrayed out of these Votes, it is difficult to see what reason there is for a Vote of £10,000 by way of salary.  If we are to advocate the cutting of salaries, the proper place to begin is at the head.  I do not think it can be argued that the standard of the higher salaries <Col N="1993" /> under the old Imperial regime should continue under present conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we should say that, because the salary of the Lord Lieutenant in the old days was £20,000, we ought to contribute almost £30,000 by way of salary and maintenance of the Governor-General's establishment to-day.  If the State could afford that, and if it was felt that such pomp and splendour at the Viceregal Lodge was necessary and that the people approved it, it would be one thing.  But the mind of the country does not approve, and the conditions in the country do not permit of this splendour.  I do not think the Dáil would be reflecting the mind of the country by voting a sum for the maintenance of this establishment, which is not compatible with the conditions in the country.  You cannot expect to level down or level up things when you have such inequality as is here demonstrated between the amount of money spent on this establishment and the economic conditions in the country which has to bear this expense.  It is the duty of the Executive Council, of the Ministry of Finance, and perhaps of the Governor-General himself to bring this Vote more in accord with the conditions of the country.  If so much is paid him as salary and so much for the maintenance of the establishment he ought to be prepared to contribute a sum as an appropriation-in-aid to this Vote.  I do not see any reason for the Dáil year after year voting over £30,000 for the maintenance of this place if it can be run at £20,000.  The <Col N="1994" /> Dáil ought to consider how it can be reduced.  The responsibility is on the Government to go into the matter and make the sum something like the country can afford to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of the amount necessary here has been under consideration, and also the question of a less expensive house.  The Governor-General himself would be very anxious to live in his own house and go out of the Viceregal Lodge altogether, but we, having considered the matter and looking as well as we could into the future, do not think it is desirable that any such thing should be agreed to. We think there should be an official residence for the Governor-General. Not only are we obliged by the Treaty to provide an establishment for the Governor-General, but we think there are good political reasons for having that establishment.  It might be that the Chief Secretary's Lodge would serve.  It is a very good building.  In any case, we will be up against the question of maintaining the actual structure and building of the Viceregal Lodge until some decision has been come to as to the use of it.  The question of the actual house in which the Governor-General should live is one which is receiving attention.  If the Governor-General were housed in a smaller house, though still sufficiently large, and which could be more economically run, it would probably be possible to effect some reduction in this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But we have got to look at this matter in a very long-sighted way.  I certainly would be very much against doing anything that was at all against the spirit of the Treaty or the Treaty settlement.  I would not pay very much attention to an argument that would simply deal with the strict letter of that settlement.  Other parties to the settlement attach great importance perhaps to things that we attach little importance to, and we attach great importance to things that they do not attach very much importance to.  On the whole, I think it will be found to the benefit of the country, in the case of many matters still outstanding and that require co-operation between the <Col N="1995" /> two peoples, if we have in mind always preserving the spirit of the settlement. Taking it in that way, I think it would be false economy to begin to try to cut down unduly the provision for the establishment of the Governor-General. The Government have distinct views about the office of Governor-General. They are, perhaps, not entirely the views of some Deputies, but they are certainly not views that lead to any attempt to belittle the holder of the office or to demean the office itself.  The Governor-General lives in a very large house, and the expenses of keeping it are very great.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson talked about the question of a chaplain being employed for ten persons.  There are, perhaps, fifty persons actually employed of one sort or another in or about the house. There are all sorts of employees that are not mentioned here.  There is no mention of the people who do the ordinary work of the household.  Those people are employed and paid by the Governor-General, and the £3,000 set down here is the State's contribution towards paying them.  Deputies, when they talk about the £10,000 salary should remember that that salary is subject to income tax and super tax. If anybody makes a calculation and deducts the payment of income tax and super tax they will see that that £10,000 shrinks very considerably indeed. The Governor-General also naturally has to pay out money in a very great number of directions, and it would be entirely impossible to put on him the cost of maintaining this household out of his salary.  It simply could not be done.</P>
    <P>I would just like to say this, and it deals again, perhaps, with the views that the Government have in regard to the office of Governor-General.  It may be said that the person holding the office ought to contribute £8,000 or £10,000 out of his private resources towards keeping up the establishment. I do not know what the arrangements are in Australia, but it may well be that the people there are content to have the office there practically confined to people who can make substantial <Col N="1996" /> contributions out of private means towards the cost of running the establishment. We would not take that view at all.  We have certain views as to the line we ought to take when our Governor-General comes to be appointed, and no person can be appointed Governor-General except in agreement with the Executive Council here.  We do not want to be in a position, for instance, that the person to be appointed must almost necessarily be somebody from outside this country. That is an aspect of the matter which should be borne in mind when we are thinking about what allowance should be given.  I believe, without doing anything contrary to what I have said about policy, that ultimately we will be able to make some reduction in this Vote, but I do not believe that we can make a reduction while the Governor-General is housed in the present building.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson said he did not see any reason for A.D.C.'s.  It should be remembered that these A.D.C.'s, in addition to any other functions they may perform, are necessary for the safety of the Governor-General.  It certainly would not promote the interests of the country if you left it open to persons to feel that they would be in no danger themselves if they attempted to interfere with the Governor-General.  Things have happened which should, I think, convince anybody that it is necessary that the Governor-General should be attended by people of the type of the A.D.C.'s wherever he goes.  You cannot put a private from the Army into the position. You must supply an officer or officers for that particular duty.</P>
    <P>There is a great tendency in the country to talk a lot about this Vote, and it is always hard to distinguish between the mere political attack and the genuine bona fide attempt to get this expenditure down, just as other expenses are got down, in some reasonable way, without any harmful reactions on the country.  I feel that very often, even where people who attack this Vote have not a political motive, they are too much aware of the sort <Col N="1997" /> of political attack that goes on about the matter and allow themselves to be influenced by it.  It is not of any use to talk about the amount of this Vote in connection with the question of salaries generally.  This Vote and office are in a very peculiar position.  We have Treaty requirements and special constitutional requirements, and because it is said that the Governor-General is paid on the Australian or Canadian scale, it does not follow that other salaried servants of the State should be paid on the same scale.  We can make our other salary scales suit the conditions of the country.  I really think that we could not have this establishment carried on if the reduction were to be carried.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understood the particular argument that Deputy Johnson raised, it seems to me that the greater part of the Minister's speech was entirely irrelevant to the case made.  I would like to say for myself&mdash;and I think it is true practically of every Deputy&mdash;that I do heartily accept the Treaty position and do not desire that there should be any change from it, except in the degree of progress from it and through it.  Constitutional requirements are requirements that most of us in this House accepted with our own personal votes, and I for one have no desire to waver in the least degree in that regard.  I do not altogether agree with Deputy Baxter, that there are necessarily two points of view regarding a Vote of this kind.  If we had any other form of Government there would still have to be, or at least there is in practically every other Constitution in the world, a head of the State who is outside the actual political executive.  The head of the State would still have to be maintained at the expense of the State, whether we like to call him a President or Governor-General.  There would still have to be a maintenance of that position, which would be an honourable position.  We have accepted in this State that the head of the State shall be a Governor-General, and that he shall be so styled and have certain responsibilities. Well, I stand by that, and whatever expenses are necessary and <Col N="1998" /> just for the maintenance of that position are expenses to which this House, I take it, is committed.  But Deputy Johnson, if I understand the case he made aright, did address himself particularly to one item in the expenses that is called &ldquo;Allowance to Governor-General for Expenses.&rdquo;  Deputy Cooper, referring to that, said that particular item was enforced upon us by a constitutional requirement.  He is not present, but I think I have quoted him correctly.  The actual words of the Constitution are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;His salary shall be of the like amount as that now payable to the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, and shall be charged on the public funds of the Irish Free State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These are the words that follow and that actually might be held to govern this particular case:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and suitable provision shall be made out of those funds for the maintenance of his official residence and establishment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If I understand those words correctly, and they are pretty obvious as to their meaning, the maintenance of his official residence and establishment are all the other items of this Vote, except item (b), which is a special allowance, and if the Vote were to be reduced by that particular item of £3,000, by which Deputy Johnson desires that this Vote should be reduced, being the particular item giving to the Governor-General a special allowance outside the Constitutional requirements, we would still have kept not only the letter of the Constitution but the spirit of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the manner in which the Minister has dealt with this amendment of mine on this occasion.  In moving the reduction of the Vote, I am not trying to run counter to the requirements of the Constitution.  Occasions will arise, no doubt, when we can deal with that question, but I am not trying on this occasion to raise that Constitutional question.  The Minister himself indicated my reasons for desiring to reduce this Vote.  He said that they were partially political reasons, and that they might possibly have reactions on the general situation and, shall I say, on international relations.  I look ahead in this matter, as I try to do in others, and I realise that there will, as time passes, be changes both in the personnel of the Governor-General and his establishment and of the Ministry, and that influences of various kinds will operate.  Possibly a reaction from the movement of the last few years may attain very great power and influence over the Ministry for the time being.  If we maintain the scale of this establishment at its present level (we are bound to pay a salary of £10,000 per annum, and to provide a suitable establishment), if we consider at this stage that &ldquo;a suitable establishment&rdquo; is one which costs £3,000 a year plus £4,040, that is £7,040, the inducement will be to follow that example and to <Col N="2001" /> maintain a general level of sumptuousness for future holders of this office, and the Court that may by that time have been thought desirable in the interests of &ldquo;the dignity of the head of the State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Figgis that, as a matter of Constitutional convenience, some person in this position, or in some equivalent position, is desirable; that is to say, some person more or less outside the political executive which is removable at the will of a political majority. But I want to think of that head of the State as a useful adjunct to the Constitutional institutions.  I do not think that utility is going to be lessened by some modification in the scale of his establishment, and I want to lay a foundation which will be such as will not tempt the mere extravagant spender of money to accept office more or less as an ornamental post.  People differ from me when I say that the present holder of this office has been wisely advised in that he did not attempt to hold social functions on a lavish scale, and appear in different parts of the country spending money lavishly and showing himself off as head of the State.  I say he has been well advised, and he has been well advised to follow that advice.  I think that the possibilities are that some future Ministry, when agreeing to the appointment of a future Governor-General, will be less likely to hit upon the name of some ornamental head whose chief merit will be that he knows how to entertain lavishly.  I want to reduce that temptation by reducing the scale on which the holder of this office can fulfil his functions as Governor-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that within the Constitutional requirements and within the spirit of the Constitution we could reasonably limit this Vote to £4,000, and that that would be an ample provision for the maintenance of the official residence and establishment of the Governor-General.  I do not want to say to any holder of a Ministerial office or any holder of a State post that, having agreed upon a salary, we are going to direct him how he is to spend that salary.  But I think, on the <Col N="2002" /> other hand, that we are unwisely laying a foundation for future extravagance if we agree to the continuance of this establishment, which costs £7,000 a year.  If we limit the sum it will mean that a less costly establishment will have to be provided, probably not only less costly, but more suitable, and not only more suitable, but more appropriate to the wishes of the holder of the office.</P>
    <P>In every way I think the case is made for a reduction of this Vote.  It is quite apparent, from the Minister's statement, that he is thinking of the necessity for a change, that is to say a change in the building.  I think very good use might be made of the present Viceregal Lodge, or what is known as the Viceregal Lodge, and the cost of its upkeep could be put to a very good public purpose at the present time.  I do not think it is serving that useful purpose, inasmuch as all parties, including the holder of the office himself, appear to think that it is unnecessarily extravagant in every way.  I press the proposal upon the Ministry and ask the Dáil to agree to a reduction of this Vote from £7,040 to £4,040.</P>

      <P>On this Vote, and on the amendment proposed by Deputy Johnson, I think it is better that we should explain our position.  Looking over the Article of the Constitution which governs this appointment, I think it is quite plain&mdash;it must be even to Deputy Figgis&mdash;that it has only one interpretation.  If Deputy Figgis would again read the words of this Article, he will have no doubt that the Government of the day is bound to provide not only the Governor-General's salary, but the allowances under sub-head (b).  I will read the Article, beginning about the middle of it:&mdash;&ldquo;His salary shall be of the like amount as that now payable to the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia and shall be charged on the public funds of the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  I would ask Deputy Figgis to note the second word of that sentence&mdash;&ldquo;salary&rdquo;&mdash;and, further down, the words &ldquo;public funds.&rdquo;  The Article proceeds: &ldquo;And suitable provision shall be made out of <Col N="2003" /> those funds&rdquo;&mdash;not out of the salary&mdash;&ldquo;for the maintenance of his official residence and establishment.&rdquo;  I think that settles that part of it.</P>

      <P>While the present ridiculous residence is maintained, expenses probably of those dimensions are therefore necessary.  The Minister for Finance and the Government would be very wise to scrap this unnecessary and expensive residence and adopt one which would be more suitable to the requirements of this State and its finances.  They have expressed that intention, and I hope that will be carried into effect.  Travelling expenses are set at £350.  I do not know why this arises in this connection. It does not say in the Article of the Constitution that you are to give him travelling expenses.  It says that you must maintain, out of public funds, the expense attached to the maintenance of the official residence and establishment.  There is nothing about travelling expenses.</P>
      <P>Under sub-head (d) the sum of £850 is mentioned for telegrams and telephones. If a comparison is made between this establishment, and Government Department, outside of the Army, you will find the amount compares very badly, from the point of view of expense, with any other Departments. We have Departments in the State employing hundreds of employees; the staffs run into hundreds, and yet their telephone bills at the end of the year reach only half the amount of what it costs this small household. It has been described as a small household, but still £850 is charged for telephones and telegrams.  It would seem as if the whole household must be continuously on the telephone.  I wonder do they go to bed at all?  They must be up both night and day in order to run the figure up to this amount.  I do not know how this amount was incurred. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has not told us what is the actual item in connection with the maintenance of the private wire.</P>

Until somebody tells me, officially and with authority, the particular figure, I refuse to believe or put down any amount.  Nobody on the Government benches has put down any figure in this connection.  It strikes me there is something wrong here and an explanation is needed.  The sooner we get back from what looks an extravagant item the better.  Contrary to my wishes on the matter, I maintain that you are bound with regard to the salary and the allowances for the Governor-General, and the maintenance of his residence and establishment.  The figure looks large.  Probably it looks larger still in the eyes of some of our people. We like very much to sling mud at one another.  A lot of political capital has been made out of the Governor-General's establishment.  We like to be slinging mud at our own people; that is characteristic of this nation.  A lot of cheap mud-slinging has been indulged in.  I am not going to indulge in any mud slinging.</P>

      <P>As regards the travelling expenses, I do not think they refer to the Governor-General's expenses. When he travels on official business he takes an A.D.C. with him, or perhaps two A.D.C.'s.  The travelling expenses have really arisen in this way: the expenses are incurred bringing those A.D.C.'s with him.  I am told that he used to bring two with him, but at present he only brings one.  I admit that the telephone and telegraph item is too high.  The special arrangements which exist there must be altered, and the Lodge must get on with ordinary telephone arrangements, such as any ordinary individual would have.  That will enable that item to be reduced.  I will say a few words in reply to Deputy Johnson.  Lavish entertainments will not be prevented by merely reducing the allowance.  The result of that might be that if you retain the establishment&mdash; and there is a great deal of dignity attaching to the office&mdash;you might have <Col N="2005" /> a greater number of petitions from people with money, who want to entertain lavishly, to get the office.</P>

      <P>Quite.  The point really is with regard to the official residence, and Deputy Johnson, having made the point he did make, will appreciate the reason the Government had for declining to accept the proposition of the Governor-General, that he should live in his own house.  Our idea is that when some place has been fixed on permanently <Col N="2006" /> as the Governor-General's house or residence, whatever Governor-General may be appointed in future will live there, and it will be the official residence.  We cannot, in a day, make changes in regard to where the Governor-General is to be housed.  All that matter will require some time.  I might say that the Viceregal Lodge will not be the permanent residence of Governors-General here; but so long as the Governor-General is housed in the Viceregal Lodge my contention is that the amount voted here could not be reduced by the £3,000 suggested.</P>

      <P>The main discussion yesterday evening centred round the road policy of my Department.  I was glad to see that Deputy Corish took up a fellow-Deputy on a point respecting the cost of maintenance of roads.  I am glad to see that Deputy Corish has begun to realise that local authorities are not in a position to carry out anything like an extravagant policy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken note of the fact that he reproved Deputy Davin for seeming to convey the idea <Col N="2007" /> that local authorities have an unlimited exchequer behind them in financing their various schemes.  There is still a considerable amount of arrears in connection with rates.  In 1922, when the Government came into office, the amount in arrears was over £2,000,000.  At the end of March, 1923, it was £1,740,000.  In March, 1924, it was £1,580,000, and at the end of March this year it was £940,000.  I expect that since then there has been a considerable reduction, but at the same time the position as regards arrears is not such as to justify extravagant or generous expenditure.  Deputy Davin also referred to the fact that it is not proper for the Government to assist road development when they are not doing the same in respect of railways. As Deputy Corish pointed out, it is a false analogy, as railways are privately owned, whereas the roads are for the public, and it is the duty of the State to see that the roads are maintained up to a proper standard.  It is the policy of our Department to do our utmost to see that the roads are brought up to a sufficiently high standard to maintain modern traffic in reason. It is difficult for me at this stage to outline any policy with regard to roads.  Anything I have to say in that respect is limited by the fact that I have a Roads Advisory Committee. That Committee has not yet published a report.  It is considering this whole matter with regard to roads, and I may say that there is agreement between the Committee and myself.  From conversations, I think I can go so far as to say, that we are united in a policy of picking out certain main roads in the country for special development, and it is our policy to get what subsidies we can, either by way of advancement or otherwise, for the development of these roads.  There has been considerable agitation in the Press, by deputation, and otherwise as to what line these roads are to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage I am not in a position to lay down either what the mileage of the roads will be, or what direction they will take.  The object is to develop these roads at a high standard <Col N="2008" /> along the routes most necessary, both from a commercial and a tourist point of view.  There will be a difference of opinion when it comes to a final choice &mdash;first of all, as to what direction the roads will take, and, secondly, as to what type of construction will be adopted.  It is our policy to do the utmost we are financially capable of to develop certain routes to withstand modern traffic.  I believe that ultimately it will mean that we will have to restrict in some way lorries over a certain weight using the roads.  Local authorities have at present considerable powers in that respect.  I believe that they have power to prevent lorries over a certain weight going on any road at all, but, so far, they have not made use of that power.  The question has been raised about the speed of these lorries.  They are not allowed to go at a speed greater than twelve miles an hour, and if they exceed that their drivers are liable to prosecution, just the same as motor drivers driving ordinary touring cars, when they exceed fifteen miles an hour inside, and twenty miles an hour outside, a city.  From an administrative point of view this statute has not so far been enforced as vigorously as it might be, and we have taken the matter up with the Minister for Justice so that he may take steps with the Gárda Síochána authorities to see that the law is carried out in this respect.  That is about all we can do at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gorey has referred to the fact that we seem to be wasting time in experimenting on the kind of construction there should be for roads.  We are in touch with the activities of other countries in this respect.  Our representative attends the International Road Congresses and hears the views of technical representatives from other countries, and we have that information available, but Deputies must realise that road construction is a highly-technical matter, and that it is influenced to a great extent by climatic considerations.  A road which is efficient in one country may not be efficient in another.  I am most desirous to get roads constructed whose maintenance can be guaranteed for a certain <Col N="2009" /> period.  That is the only way we can be sure that we will get value for our money.  It has been suggested that a policy of concrete roads would be best for this country.  I have had experience of these roads in America, and they seem to be a great success, but I have been informed&mdash;I do not know whether there is anything in it&mdash;that the climate of this country, except in special circumstances, is not suitable to concrete roads, that it takes a considerable period to lay down concrete to make sure that the roads will stand. Firms engaged in constructing concrete roads are very slow to give a maintenance guarantee for any length of time. For that reason it is necessary for us to carry out certain experiments ourselves. We have done so on the Naas Road, where we have laid out certain stretches in different materials such as tar, bitumen and tar macadam.  That will give us a practical demonstration of the value of these different systems of road maintenance.  We have, in other parts of the country, carried out experiments in different kinds of road maintenance&mdash;and not merely experiments but useful work.  Deputies cannot be blind to the fact that a considerable improvement has been made in the streets of Dublin, and also in Cork, and throughout the country generally.  In Limerick there has been a large scheme of concrete roads undertaken, and I believe a concrete road is a particularly desirable form of highway in Limerick city because of the bad foundations.  It is necessary to have a good foundation if you are to have a good road surface.  Deputy Gorey has referred to the fact that he has seen barrels of tar lying very close together along the various highways throughout the country, but particularly along the Naas Road.  He said that he afterwards saw those tar barrels taken away, and he assumed from that that the tar was of inferior quality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>What I meant to say was that on the Naas Road I saw the tar spread, but on the road from Naas to Waterford I saw the tar barrels collected and taken in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2010" />
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is likely to be accounted for by the fact that last year was a particularly bad year for doing anything like road work.  Spraying the road with tar is work that can only be done in dry weather.  If you have wet weather and spread the tar on the road, it will not give you a good wearing surface.  Probably when the surveyors saw that there was no likelihood of fine weather, they took up the barrels again and kept them for a later period.</P>
      <P>The whole question of road structure is very technical, and those tar preparations and bitumen preparations have to be very scientifically tested. The firms who are laying down these roads have to employ skilled chemists to test the mixtures of those roads, because if the mixture is not up to a certain specification the road will not stand up to modern traffic.  I cannot outline our policy in any detail, because I have first to get an expression of opinion from the Roads Advisory Committee and come to an agreement with them on the matter.  But it is our policy to develop a system of main roads throughout the country that will be feeders and enable goods to be distributed to and from all the main centres of the country.  There has been criticism, I think, by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, about the roads in Cork.  In that particular place, the work on the roads had not been completed at the time.  The road was to have been treated with bitumen, and he happened to be travelling on it before that operation was carried out. Accordingly, the road was probably not satisfactory from his point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson has recommended the speeding up of our policy with regard to roads, in view of the prevailing unemployment.  In carrying out our road programme last year, that was an object that was present to my mind all the time.  In carrying out our policy, we were anxious, as far as possible, to give relief and oftentimes our road policy was, to a very great extent, determined by the number of unemployed in various sections.  But there is this difficulty about taking that factor into consideration, that the higher the standard of efficiency to which you <Col N="2011" /> bring your roads the less scope there will be for employment from the amount of money expended.  A high-class surface on a road will mean a much higher proportion of money spent on material than is spent on labour, whereas if you go in for an ordinary water-bound, macadam road, a much higher proportion of the money is spent on labour.  That is one of the difficulties that has to be faced.</P>
    <P>I expect, perhaps within the next couple of months, to be able to come before the Dáil and outline a comprehensive road policy.  Reference has been made to the fact that the Roads Advisory Committee has made recommendations with regard to the duties on motor cars.  That report has not yet come officially before me, and, accordingly, I cannot deal with it.  At any rate, it is a matter that will concern the Minister for Finance more intimately, perhaps, than it concerns me.  Any policy that is developed in respect of it will have to be developed in conjunction with the Minister for Finance and, as the Minister said in his Budget speech, it may be the subject of a supplementary Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell us when this £1,000,000 for road work, that we heard so much about, will be made available?  I am sure the Minister will realise that there is a great deal of unemployment at the present time, and the policy pursued by the Department of Local Government, with regard to road work, did certainly give very much needed relief in the country during the past year.  It would be very helpful if the Minister would tell us when his Department hopes to be in a position to make this £1,000,000 available for road work.</P>

When we have formulated our policy and put it before the Minister for Finance, he will be in a position to state when the advance will be available and how much money will be advanced for the purpose.  We have to put our proposals before the Minister for Finance before he can come to a decision on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it was only a statement for a public meeting.  I am disappointed that the Minister told us, in almost so many words, that there is no chance of spending any large amount of money on reconstruction of roads this year.  He hopes within the next month or two that he will be able to put before the Dáil a comprehensive road policy, but he is waiting for the report of the Roads Advisory Committee; when it reaches him he will consider it; he is more or less in agreement with what he believes to be the wishes and desires of the Roads Advisory Committee, but when he has his scheme ready he must place it before the Department of Finance. Following their usual practice&mdash; a necessary practice&mdash;they will inquire into the scheme very closely and consider it in relation to the finances of the country.  By that time the Dáil will be on vacation, and by the time the Dáil resumes we shall be in the winter.  Then we shall be told that the winter is not an appropriate time for big schemes of road construction, so that I deduct from that that it is not expected by the Department, or that it is not intended by the Department, that there shall be any considerable sum of money spent on road reconstruction this year; that we <Col N="2013" /> really must wait until the spring of next year before this £1,000,000 commences to be spent.  I am very sorry to hear that exposition of the Minister's road policy.</P>
      <P>I think all the parties inside and outside the House, and all classes, are agreed upon the necessity for expenditure on reconstructing roads.  The matter has been before the Department of Local Government for two years in a definite form.  The Roads Advisory Committee has been sitting, I think, over twelve months.  Frequently this question has been the subject of discussion in the House.  Frequently we have had intimations of one kind or other from the Minister, and from other Ministers, that there would be large schemes set going and a large amount of money spent.  Now we learn that there has not yet been evolved a definite policy and that there is not likely to be any expenditure outside the ordinary this year.  That statement will be received with very great regret by road-users and by people who might have reasonable ground for hoping that they would be employed on road making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Minister's reference to the disproportion between the amount of labour expended on the higher class of roads, as compared with the amount of labour expended on the old-fashioned methods of road-making, I quite agree that there may be, here and there through the country, people who think that because a certain method of construction employs a greater amount of labour, and in maintenance will continue to employ a still greater amount of labour, therefore, that method should be adopted. There may be a few people, here and there, having that view, but it by no means represents the view of responsible people in any section of the community. For my part&mdash;and I think I can speak on behalf of all my colleagues in this matter&mdash;I would desire to see the best possible roads made, even if they never required in the future another halfpenny to be spent on them.  We would like to see that policy of building the best roads put into effect at the earliest possible time, <Col N="2014" /> and I do not think that the Minister should hesitate about embarking on a high-class road reconstruction scheme, because of the possibility that the maintenance of the road in the future will employ a fewer number of men. That is a preposterous suggestion. The Minister instanced the new concrete road through Limerick city, and reminded me of a story I used to hear about Limerick.  A person returning from America to his ancestral home, seeing the condition of Limerick streets, made a proposal to the Corporation&mdash;this may be apocryphal&mdash; that if they would pay him for fifteen years the amount of money that they had been paying for the upkeep of the roads for the previous fifteen years, he would repave the roads free&mdash;I think it was wood paving at that time.  It is alleged that it was because of certain fears that there would be no need to sweep the streets in future that the offer was refused.  That may be the case in Limerick.  I do not know whether there is anyone here from Limerick city who would dare to contradict it.  But certainly there is nobody in these days with any responsibility who would suggest that you must put down a road in the hope that it will employ a large number of men in the maintenance of it.  I hope the Minister will not allow that thought to influence his road policy.</P>
    <P>I would again press upon the Minister and upon the Minister for Finance, that they should assist each other in speeding up this position so that there may be large schemes put into operation this summer.  It will be a very great disappointment if the operation of the decisions of the Department in regard to road construction has to be postponed until the spring.  There are people who are looking forward to a large number of tourists coming over with their motor cars, and who think that the tourist traffic will make of this country a new heaven.  If there are people, as there seem to be, who imagine that the tourist traffic will make a great nation of this country, I hope they will press upon the Minister the necessity of hurrying on this scheme of road construction.</P>

      <P>I was very pleased to hear the statement of Deputy Johnson that we must have efficient roads at all costs, irrespective of whether that may mean a smaller amount of labour employed in the future or not. It must be apparent to everybody that even if we have to wait a little while for good roads we must prepare a scheme which will give us efficient roads.  Deputy Johnson complained about the Minister's delay in announcing his road policy.  It is a matter of regret to us who take an interest in this matter that a definite and progressive road policy has not been produced before now.  On the other hand, we must realise that necessarily the Minister finds himself in the hands of the Roads Advisory Committee.  Personally I have never quite understood why this committee were taking such a long time to produce their report and to advise the Minister, so that he could produce a road policy.  I understand, however, from various conversations I have had with people who have had to do with this committee that a great many unforeseen difficulties arose, and that the whole subject, from the point of view of a national policy of road making, is infinitely greater than a great many people thought at the time they undertook to sit on that committee.</P>
      <P>The Minister made some references to lorries.  As an owner of lorries I would like to reply to some observations which I heard from some of the Farmers' Party yesterday.  There appears to be an idea in the heads of certain members of that Party that lorries should be very strictly curtailed in the weights of the loads they carry.  I would agree with that up to a certain point, but I think it would be a more progressive policy if roads of sufficient strength were built to support any reasonable commercial traffic which this country may require.  That, surely, is a progressive idea.  It is not progressive that the weights of the lorries should be cut down, and that wretched roads should be supplied instead.</P>

      <P>Another matter which I should like to refer to, as Deputy Gorey has interrupted, is that these heavy lorries are running for the purpose of supplying the farming community with goods.  That is a thing they very often forget.  In my district, which is a very important barley and grain district generally, like part of Deputy Gorey's constituency, I have often been struck by the tremendous amount of time wasted by farmers in the particular way in which they get their barley into the market.  I think if roads were sufficiently strongly constructed, and depots were provided at certain cross-roads from which these heavy motor lorries would deliver the barley into the concerns which use it in large quantities, that very considerable time would be saved, time which the farmers could very profitably spend looking after their crops in this very uncertain climate of ours.</P>
      <P>Some remarks were also made about the excessive speed at which these lorries travel.  As an owner of lorries, I have no hesitation in saying that it would be a very great relief to us if the speed of lorries could be regulated, because it costs us a great deal of money in the upkeep of lorries, especially going over indifferent roads, if the drivers exceed the speed limit.  It does not pay us at all.  It is a thing which we are utterly opposed to, and which I sincerely hope will be checked in the near future.  The Minister made some general reference to the structure of roads.  Candidly, I am rather surprised to hear that his experts have advised him that concrete roads would not be suitable for this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that qualification, because I may say I am in complete disagreement with the suggestion that concrete roads would not suit this country.  I have a certain amount of experience of concrete work myself, and probably the greatest enemies that concrete has are the extremes of heat and cold.  In America <Col N="2017" /> concrete roads have been made a tolerable success, and in that country they have infinitely greater variations of heat and cold&mdash;greater heat and greater cold&mdash;than we have in this country.  I do not pose as an expert, but I am not impressed with the suggestion that concrete roads would not be a success here.  I should like to know what the experiences have been, as far as they are known up to the present, in connection with the asphalt roads and whether they are suitable for country towns.  Everybody who goes through the country must be impressed at the very untidy and unhealthy conditions of our towns, owing to the fact that the roads are made largely of what is very often completely unsuitable limestone, which dissolves into mud within a very few days of its being placed on the roads.  I look forward to the day when we can come to the Government and get grants of money for the purpose of making the roads in our towns of concrete or asphalt, if it were only from the hygienic point of view.  In the summer time this limestone is pulverised into dust, which deposits itself on the meat in the butchers' shops, permeates the whole atmosphere, and must necessarily be very bad for the health of the people.  I should like if the Minister could give us some indication as to the cost of this Trinidad asphalt which is being laid down in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.</P>
      <P>I have a very strong recollection of the city of Limerick as being a very dirty town a number of years ago.  I have not had the pleasure of visiting it since these concrete roads were put down, but I am quite certain that the general appearance of the city must be vastly improved, and that the general health of the public will also improve as a result of the laying down of concrete roads.  I am glad to know that the Minister has a road policy in view, and that we may expect to hear it in the near future, because I am convinced that it will be welcomed very heartily by the whole country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the making and maintenance of roads has up to the present, unfortunately of necessity, been bound up very much with the question of unemployment. The Minister, I think, indicated that a lot of that work was undertaken in connection with providing employment. I do not say that the money was wasted, but I do say that it has rather meant spending a lot of money in an uneconomic way.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of the money spent on the roads, while it certainly has made them passable, has not put them in such a condition that they will retain their surface for any length of time.  The real need at the present time is a reconstruction of roads to enable them to bear modern traffic, as it has developed.  On this question of roadmaking I do not think one can talk in an airy fashion as to any one particular scheme being suitable for the whole country.  As far as I can see, any road policy will have to take into consideration the question of the traffic that the roads concerned will have to bear.  It is perfect nonsense to talk of an expenditure on rural roads on the lines of an asphalt surface or a concrete surface.  There are certain main roads on which the traffic is very heavy, where it would pay to spend a very considerable amount on really substantial reconstruction, and in some cases it would pay to make your surface and your foundation of asphalt or some other durable material.  But the <Col N="2019" /> average country road will not require any such treatment as that.  The main thing in connection with the roads will be the supplying of a foundation capable of maintaining the surface you put on it, and that surface need not be made, even on the main roads in many cases, of the expensive materials that have been talked about here.</P>
      <P>I would like to say that I rather agree with the Minister and disagree with Deputy Egan when he talks about concrete roads as being suitable for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. EGAN Mr. EGAN">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Even for the main roads I do not agree that it is a suitable surface.  I agree that as a foundation it would be satisfactory, but as a surface I do not think that concrete will be either lasting or suitable.  That, of course, is only an expression of opinion.  Deputy Egan may have a better opinion than I have, but, Deputy Egan having expressed his opinion, I take the opportunity of expressing mine.  As I have said, this question of road making is rather mixed up with unemployment.  The Minister to-day is, I take it, considering, in conjunction with other people, the question of a road policy for the future.  Deputy Johnson would rather have the work proceeded with during the summer months.  Against that, the rural need, in connection with employment, is during the summer months.  One would expect that in the summer the farmers would be able to absorb a large number, if not all, of the unemployed that are about the country.  Therefore the need is really not a need that occurs so much during the summer as during the autumn, winter and spring, and I do not think that the Minister ought to be influenced to proceed with a very large scheme of road construction before he has the subject fully considered so that he will not make any mistakes as to the lines on which he is to go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express approval of the view taken by Deputy Egan with regard to concrete roads.  I doubt very much that the Minister was <Col N="2020" /> right in expressing a doubt as to the suitability of concrete for the Irish climate.  Concrete might be a new thing in this country, but it is not a new substance for road making.  It has been tried in America on a very large scale.  There are concrete roads made in America to a length that would cover the entire mileage of the Free State roads, and they have been so successful that engineers in road making would not now recommend any other kind of road.  As we all know, and as Deputy Egan pointed out, there are greater changes in climate in America than we have in Ireland.  The only thing that can be urged about the Irish climate is the difficulty of laying down the road.  It requires a certain amount of dry weather in order to lay down concrete. But dry weather is necessary to lay concrete in connection with any kind of work, and going through the country you see scores of cottages and bridges erected in concrete.  If they can build concrete houses and bridges in this climate surely they can make roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Johnson said about the necessity for laying down good roads.  The roads are in a deplorable condition, though I must say they have been vastly improved in the last two years.  The system of road making, however, has been such that you might say, where they were making a few miles of road, when they were completing the last hundred yards it was necessary to go back to where they started and commence all over again.  Even in the case of steam-rolled roads I have seen that thing occur.  They last only a very short time.  Then the injury to health caused by the dust must be very great.  Dust in the summer time and mud in the winter make some roads intolerable.  In America they have found that not alone is a concrete road the best road but that it is the cheapest road.  I have seen comparative figures for the different materials used in roads, and they show that the concrete road will last for thirty years.  We know that other materials last only four or five years.  For maintaining a concrete road the <Col N="2021" /> average cost per mile is £233.  The cost for other roads is double and treble. So that not only is concrete the best surface and the healthiest surface, but it is the cheapest surface in the long run.  Of course the initial cost is very heavy, and it is the only thing that deters us from urging that our main roads should be made of concrete. Other methods of road making seem to be entirely out of date and a waste of money.  The giving of relief in the way of employment seems to be the only thing that recommends the old system.  Staffs of men have to be always employed on them.  Otherwise you will go from one pot-hole into another on many of the roads at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring a matter before the Minister, and I think now is the time for doing it. The matter I want to call attention to is the cost of legal proceedings against defaulting ratepayers.  I understand that in many cases legal proceedings are being taken in the county courts by Civil Bill, when the rate collectors have the option of taking the cases to summary courts by means of an ordinary summons.  The only effect of the system of bringing defaulters before the county court is that they are involved in extra legal costs.  I would like to know from the Minister if he approves of that policy.  I can furnish him with concrete instances of cases which have been brought before the county court.  Yesterday, in regard to this sub-head, I asked the Minister for an explanation of the increase of £200 in the salary of his secretary.  I want to know if that is the ordinary scale of increase, or if it is a special increase, and if so, why it has been granted.  I want to say one or two things with regard to Deputy Egan's remarks concerning motor lorries and the question of the establishment of main roads in general.  I would like to suggest to the Minister that before he would definitely evolve a policy he should visualise clearly what his intention is in regard to the use of the roads which are to be established. If I understand him correctly, I believe it is intended that the main roads should be used largely for the carrying <Col N="2022" /> of heavy traffic long distances.  If that is to be the policy I would suggest to the Minister that it is only right that those who get the advantages of the road for that purpose should be made to pay.</P>

      <P>These main roads at the present time are being used in competition with the railroads.  We have heavy lorries travelling over roads running side by side with the railroads, when the natural way for that traffic to go is on the railroads.  It means that the owners of these lorries are getting the free use of the highways, and I would like to know is it right or just that that should be continued.  The ratepayers of the country are not really getting the advantage of that motor traffic.  There is no indication that goods are being sold more cheaply because of this facility that has been granted to the owners of these lorries. The indication is that goods are being sold more dearly and that profiteering is taking place.  Doubtless the Minister for Finance will be able to tell us if it is a fact, because the accounts of these traders come before him from time to time in connection with income tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyhow that is the state of affairs, and it is really having a bad effect on the rural roads. One of the difficulties in connection with the rural roads is that practically all the short-haul traffic is going on the public roads and the long-haul traffic is now being diverted to the public roads.  That is not reasonable.  The roads should not be maintained for that purpose, and if they are to be maintained I say that we should insist that the people who gain the advantages should pay for the roads which they are allowed to use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. EGAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that it is not necessary to support that statement by figures.  It is obvious to anybody that a good deal of the long-haul traffic is being carried by lorries.  It is being carried from Dublin to Cork in some cases.  But certainly it is being carried distances of 20, 30 and 40 miles. Apart from that short-haul traffic, there is traffic on, perhaps, ten or fifteen miles of road which competes directly with the traffic on the railroads that run side by side with the ordinary roads.  The question of the restriction of the traffic on the roads must arise and must be considered by the Minister.  If restrictions are not placed on the carrying of heavy loads on the roads, the people who derive advantages thereby ought to be asked to pay for the use they make of those roads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of opinion, as Deputy Hewat knows. Certainly a lorry carrying six tons on Irish roads should be considered as carrying a heavy load.  It is too heavy a load for many of the roads.  I would be inclined to think a four-ton load is excessive.  These lorries run on bye-roads <Col N="2024" /> as well as main roads, and in many cases they are cutting them to pieces.  Deputy Egan says the lorries are being used for the benefit of the farmers and assist in distributing goods to the farmers.  That is not my experience. The lorries are used largely to carry goods from town to town.</P>

      <P>The farmer, perhaps, gets some of the goods, but I have no reason to think that the farmer is getting the goods any cheaper because they are being carried from town to town by motor lorry.  He should get the goods as cheap as if they were carried by the railways.  We have no objection to the encouragement of motor traffic, within reason. We have no objection to the farmers using motor lorries of the lighter type for the purpose of carrying goods to the markets, or for collecting their goods.  We have objections to motor traffic as the principal persons who pay rates for the maintenance of the roads.  We pay towards the maintenance of the roads which are used for the carrying of traders' goods, and we are not getting any benefit in proportion to the payment that we make.</P>

      <P>I would like to deal with one point which has nothing to do with roads.  I do not see any sub-head under which I could bring it.  It is a matter that should certainly come under the purview of the Minister, <Col N="2025" /> as Minister for Public Health.  I refer to the insanitary condition in which many of the school buildings in the country are at the moment.  I would like to know if the inspection of school buildings is part of the duty of a local authority and what steps does the Ministry take to see that a local authority carried out its duty in inspecting these buildings.  I do not wish to dilate very much on this matter. I am sure anybody who knows the country is aware that many of these buildings are in an absolutely scandalous condition.  We have some very fine school buildings in the country; but, as against that, we have some buildings that are absolute death traps for the children who have to spend the greater part of the day in them.  In many cases they are buildings 80 to 100 years old.</P>
      <P>There is nobody specifically charged with seeing them kept in good condition. In some cases they are an actual danger to the health, not only of teachers and pupils, but to the people of the whole district.  I have seen schools where there was overcrowding, broken floors, out-offices built up against the back-wall, rooms badly ventilated and generally unclean.  It has not been, and it is not, the practice of local sanitary officers to visit the schools and report on their condition. We have reports repeatedly from the office of the Department of Education calling attention to the insanitary condition of a school.  If the Minister for Education were here he would be able to inform us about that.  There is no machinery by which the Minister for Education can remedy the state of affairs which his officers call attention to in this regard.  I wish to ask the Minister for Public Health whether, in the interests of public health, any steps are to be taken by his Department to see that whatever authority is responsible for looking after the sanitary condition of schools, will properly do its duty.  I would ask the Minister to see that in future that work is attended to and, if schools are found insanitary and a danger to public health, to see that such steps will be taken, with his authority, as will remedy the existing condition of things.</P>

      <P>Deputy Heffernan asked a question with regard to some prosecutions that have taken place in the country.  I wish to ask another question with regard to another class of prosecution that is about to take place.  That is, the prosecution the Minister is urging public bodies in the country to take against vaccination defaulters. In Wexford there is a large section of the people who have lost all faith in vaccine treatment.  They are not alone in that matter.  We are aware that experts are divided on the subject. It is all very well to leave matters to the expert, but there are times when the plain man has to decide something for himself.  When experts are divided it is time for the plain man to make up his mind as to what attitude he is to adopt.  The question of vaccination and of prosecutions attending it are matters that constitute a legacy left to us very kindly by the old regime.  The English people, progressive in many ways, progressed also in the matter of vaccination.  They held that if a man thought this alleged cure of putting impurities into a child's blood was not a good thing for the child, he should be allowed to neglect vaccination.  Accordingly, a law was introduced in England under which parents could omit vaccination, and as a result the English people, having regard to the welfare of their children, availed of this exemption to a large degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are to-day more children exempted from vaccination in England than there are children in all Ireland. The law of exemption that the English passed for themselves was not extended to Ireland.  They gave us what was bad.  At all events, parents in Ireland to-day are bound by the law to vaccinate their children.  In Wexford, however, two or three out of every four children are not vaccinated.  I am sure it is a great puzzle to the Local Government Department.  I think the law ought to come to the aid of the Minister and not oblige him to prosecute unwilling parents.  The people of Wexford can point to their county as being as healthy as any other county in Ireland. In that county deaths from dirt diseases have fallen remarkably in the last 40 years.  The statistics compiled <Col N="2027" /> apply to deaths from measles, scarlatina, and other dirt diseases, and deaths from these causes have fallen considerably.  Vaccination or other such treatment cannot claim the credit of that decline.  The same causes that have brought about the decline in measles and scarlatina brought about a decline in small-pox.  The doctors gave all that credit to vaccination, but that is not correct.  It is due to improved sanitation and improved housing.  Those things have brought about a better state of health in the country.  Anyone who was in touch with the old fever hospitals can tell you that 40 or 50 years ago the inhabitants of those hospitals numbered 200 to 250.  That number has dropped to 45.  That decline in disease has been brought about by good sanitation and better housing.</P>
    <P>If you believe in vaccination, you ought to vaccinate the people wholesale, and not build any houses or carry out any schemes of drainage at all.  It is not a case of layman versus doctor. The doctors are divided on this point. One of the greatest scientists in Europe for the last 100 years, Alfred Russel Wallace, said the treatment of putting vaccine into a healthy child was a grotesque illusion.  When the Editor of a famous Encyclopaedia came to the letter V he wanted an article written on vaccination, and he selected as the writer an eminent pathologist, Dr. Robert Creighton.  Dr. Creighton went into the history of vaccination, and, after studying it as exhaustively as possible, he went to the Editor and said: &ldquo;This thing is a humbug, and there is no justification for it.&rdquo;  The Editor told him to write about it, and he did so.  I have a copy of the &ldquo;Encyclopaedia Britannica,&rdquo; in which the article appeared.  However, the influences were so great that the article had to be omitted from the following edition of the &ldquo;Encyclopaedia,&rdquo; and it has not appeared there since.  There is another version there now.  I saw the other day where the Danish Government proposes to abandon vaccination altogether.  It is abandoned to a large extent in England.  If vaccination were so effective as is thought in many places, when small-pox visited England, <Col N="2028" /> one would think it would have visited the towns where children were not vaccinated.  The fact of the matter is that it visited all the towns indiscriminately. I would ask the Minister not to force any prosecution on Irish parents. They should be entitled to exemption in this matter.</P>

      <P>It is not my object, in rising, to reply to Deputy Sears.  I see Deputy Sir James Craig taking notes, and I think it is his intention to reply to him.  I want to refer to this Vote, especially that portion of it dealing with the administration of medical matters.  I consider that there are very grave defects, both centrally and locally, in the administration of the Ministry of Local Government and Public Health.  I do not want to attribute these defects to the Minister who has achieved some big things in the way of legislation of a medical character.  In this country we never failed in the way of medical legislation, but we always failed in its administration.  I think I might quote two incidents which came to my notice in recent times, and these, I think, will convince Deputies of the very parlous condition of public health in the Saorstát. Recently I, amongst other medical practitioners, received a circular from one of the largest dry milk factories in the world, urging us to prescribe for children this dry milk, and giving as its reasons for doing so that Dublin, and Irish milk generally, was produced under unsanitary conditions which made it dangerous for children.  Such statements are very serious, but I think there is a substratum of truth in them.  Our milk is produced under appalling conditions.  You have heard of Dublin milk being very bad, but it is only fair to say that it is the cleanest milk produced in Ireland.  There is a reasonable effort made here to milk the cows in a clean way, and to keep them clean, with the result that the milk is in a fairly clean state.  How Dublin milk got the bad reputation it has is due to the fact that milk from the surrounding counties is produced under dirty conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that the Dairy Produce <Col N="2029" /> Act will improve all that, but the administration of that Act does not come under this Ministry, and if it is to be effectively administered it will depend on another Act under the administration of the Ministry&mdash;namely, the Cowsheds and Dairies Act.  That is nominally administered in Ireland, but as for any useful purpose it serves or has served it might not have been passed at all.  When that Act was passed, the British Local Government Board, which was then in charge of public health administration, appointed local inspectors for each union.  It gave a salary of about £25 a year, or a little higher, but if an inspector were to do his work effectively he would spend that amount in one month travelling around the country.  The result is that the work was not done, and we see in every farmyard in Ireland and in the paddocks during the winter months, cows covered with manure.  English people coming over here notice the condition of our cows, and they naturally imagine the conditions under which they receive their butter from Ireland.  The exportation of butter from Ireland to England has greatly decreased.  It is about four millions a year, as compared with New Zealand's ten millions.  Irish butter has lost its popularity, and a good deal of that loss is due to the fact that English people are getting greater knowledge of how it is produced.  Deputy Gorey looks at me, but this does not concern him seriously.  There is no use in being ostrich-like, and putting our heads in the sand, and pretending that things are not as they are.  Unless that Cowsheds and Dairies Act is put into practice things will not improve.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister for Local Government, though it may require special legislation, should avail of the Civic Guard to act as sanitary inspectors or as inspectors under that Act. They are strangers in their districts, and would not owe their appointment to the sanitary authority, and they would, I believe, properly discharge their duties.  It will, of course, be said that the Dairy Produce Act provides for pasteurisation.  That is very good <Col N="2030" /> in its way, and it kills the growth of microbes, but it does not destroy the toxins they produce.  It may be claimed in connection with pasteurisation, as sanitarians do, that sewage, after undergoing a process of purification, could be used as drinking-water. I could never see that it would become an attractive beverage.</P>

      <P>We will have to get a better reputation for our milk, and see that it is cleaner.  The Minister, under the Local Government Act of 1925, has made provision for the appointment of whole-time county medical officers of health.  That is a big step forward, but I would like to know what salary the Minister is going to pay them.  We know that these officers, or, rather, similar officers, were paid such salaries that the money would be spent on travelling expenses if they were to do their work effectively.  Unless the Minister leaves a decent margin for travelling, and a sufficient salary, I do not see how these officers will properly discharge their work.  They will do it, of course, but the effects will be obvious when he does not supply them with the means of doing their duty properly.  The whole administration of health is, I think, neglected, and I do not think that the establishment of our own Government has improved matters.  Under the British system there was a medical commissioner, but his office has been abolished, and no one has been appointed in his place.  He had considerable power.  He was one of three big men. He had power of initiation, and though he was not able to achieve much, he did a good deal of useful work.  I see no provision made in these Estimates for a similar post.  We have medical inspectors, but I do not know what part they take in advising as regards medical administration.  That is so much for the preventative side of medicine. The curative side is just as much neglected.  It is surprising how little we hear from time to time of the work done by dispensary doctors.  I see <Col N="2031" /> here a return for the Free State for 1923, which states that there were attended on ticket 483,270 cases. These were new cases.  We know that people are very loth to bring tickets to doctors, and anyone with experience of a dispensary will find that not one in three patients brings a ticket.  If you multiply the figure I have quoted by three you will get nearer the truth. If they got sufficient tickets they could register one and a-half million a year. Each ticket represents about three visits, and that in all would mean one and a-half million.  They do a lot of work, and yet in all they only get £150,000 per annum, which also covers travelling expenses.  My experience as a dispensary doctor was that if I were paid at the prevailing garage rate for doing poor law work I would get three times my salary.</P>

      <P>This is not the first time Deputy Sears has tried to do a little propaganda work in connection with anti-vaccination.  On a previous occasion he said that the medical profession was a tired profession and needed a little amusement, and that the only way they could get amusement was by going around with their instruments and inserting dirty lymph in the arms of children.  Some other medical Deputies in the Dáil at that time came to me and asked whether I was going to reply to that statement, but I told them that I never waste time in replying to nonsense.  Deputy Sears did not go so far this evening, but he made statements which it should not be necessary for me to repel, but, from the attitude of the Dáil, I take it that members would like me to do so.  If there has been anything proved beyond doubt in medicine, that fact is that vaccination and re-vaccination prevent the spread of small-pox.  It is quite true that in England there have of recent years been epidemics of small-pox, but <Col N="2032" /> Deputy Sears is wrong in his conclusions, because statistics show clearly that small-pox attacked unvaccinated populations and, where it did attack the vaccinated populations, it attacked them in a mild way, and these were cases where re-vaccination had not been done within seven or ten years previously.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sears made a statement which ought to be repelled, namely, that the calf lymph used in vaccination is impure, and he stated quite definitely that that lymph was put into children's arms.  I am rather surprised that I should have to allude to such a statement as that.  The Government have under their control an institution in which the calf lymph is prepared in the most hygienic surroundings and under the supervision of a most experienced bacteriologist, so that a guarantee is given that every particle of this lymph distributed throughout the country for vaccination is absolutely pure.  I go this distance with Deputy Sears, that in the old days when lymph was inoculated from arm to arm there was, as we know&mdash;and I admit it quite readily&mdash;the risk of inoculating syphilis from one arm into another arm and there was a danger of inoculating other blood-poisonous diseases.  That has entirely passed away with the pure calf lymph which is now being used for vaccination.  I admit there are members of the medical profession who do not believe in vaccination.  The medical profession is not free, any more than any other profession, from cranks and from quacks.  We have both plenty of cranks and plenty of quacks in the medical profession, who are always ready, if they think they will make anything out of it, to set themselves against any established theory.  They know that they will have a following of cranks.  If I might venture an opinion, the reason why the people of Wexford have not allowed their children to be vaccinated is because they have been led astray by cranks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not admit for a moment that measles and scarlatina are dirt diseases. If they were dirt diseases, they could have been eliminated altogether. But I do admit, with Deputy Sears, that <Col N="2033" /> progress in hygiene will be attended with a very marked reduction in all these diseases, due to infection.  We have almost entirely eliminated typhus fever, and we have, to a large extent, eliminated typhoid fever, because of the very marked improvement in hygienic conditions.  I should like that Deputy Sears would have the experience&mdash;that is, if he has not been vaccinated&mdash;of going into a ward in which small-pox exists.  I have treated a good deal of small-pox in my time, and I said here on a previous occasion that I would consider myself guilty of an inhuman act if I allowed a nurse to go into, or if I myself went into a small-pox ward and had not previously been re-vaccinated. I lay stress on this fact, because Deputy Sears said nothing about the question of re-vaccination.  I admit that, after seven years or eight years, as the case may be, the immunization that has been given by vaccination disappears, and it is necessary to have re-vaccination carried out, if there is any fear of an epidemic of small-pox.  It is just as necessary, in these circumstances, to have re-vaccination as it was necessary to have vaccination in the first instance.  Deputy Sears' reference to the article in the &ldquo;Encyclopaedia Britannica&rdquo; answers itself.  It was eliminated when people in authority had read it and had seen that it was wrong.  I would like to have said a word or two in connection with some of the matters touched upon by my colleague (Deputy Dr. Hennessy).  On one occasion I made an attempt to describe to the Dáil, and particularly to the Farmer Deputies, what was gained by cleanliness in regard to the production of milk.  I am not going into that now, because Deputy Gorey did not want to know about it.</P>

      <P>At the risk of being described as a &ldquo;crank,&rdquo; I rise to support Deputy Sears in the request that he has made to the Minister to withhold prosecutions against people throughout the country for failing to have their children vaccinated. I admit that it is a very difficult matter for any layman to attempt to discuss, but I do think that there is nothing wrong in suggesting that if, in England, there is facility given to people who have conscientious objections to vaccination to avoid the necessity for it, the same facility should be given to people here.  A fine of a shilling is imposed on anyone refusing to comply with this order in England.  When the medical profession differ on a matter of this kind, it should be open to others to do likewise.  I do not think that is too much to ask, because I have seen the agonies of children as the result of vaccination, and I have seen results from it which I am not now prepared to describe in detail.  I do say that if a man thinks anything about his child and is of opinion that, through vaccination or any other operation of that kind, he is going to subject that child to pain and agony, such as children go through who have been vaccinated, he has a perfect right to make some protest against it.  That is not too much to ask, particularly as this law is put into operation only where it affects the working classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well for Deputy Sir James Craig to get up here and insist that vaccination should be carried out for medical reasons and in the interests of public health.  But if he is justified in making that statement, I suggest that it should be carried out amongst the medical profession themselves. I know of medical officers who do not believe in vaccination, and yet they issue summonses to have the children of the working classes vaccinated. <Col N="2035" /> I do not think it is too much to ask the Minister to withhold these prosecutions and to take some means to give the parents of these children an option in the matter of vaccination.</P>
    <P>On the question of public health, Dr. Hennessy has referred to milk and other items of food.  There is one thing which requires attention and which has a very detrimental effect on one of the common foods&mdash;the manner of retailing and selling bread. Bread, and other articles of food, gather not an inconsiderable amount of dirt by the handling which takes place in the retailing of these articles.  It would be well if we would consider the possibility of adopting the system of retailing bread&mdash;the same thing might apply to other articles of food&mdash; that obtains in other countries.  In America, I understand, the loaf is covered by air-tight paper, so that after leaving the bakery it is not directly handled until it reaches the person who is going to use it.  Here it is passed from hand to hand and from shop to shop, and it is carried through the streets by children.  Undoubtedly, there is danger that the handling it receives may cause the adhesion of germs which may bring about disease.</P>
    <P>On the question of public roads, I wish to support the view put forward that, in the construction of roads, an effort should be made to have them of durable material, irrespective of the cost.  I had opportunities of seeing many demonstrations of road construction, and I do not think yet any definite view has been put forward as to which system is the most suitable to the country.  I think that is a point that will have to be determined before any big effort in the way of expenditure on public roads is decided upon. In England road-making has been taken up since the war on a big scale, and a number of trunk roads in concrete have been constructed.  My attention has been drawn to a cutting in a newspaper, which I will read to the Dáil:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A New Type of Road.&mdash;A new thirty-mile road from London to the Palace Hotel, Southend-on-Sea, was opened in March.  It is 100 feet wide <Col N="2036" /> and it has a 20 ft. centre pathway for pedestrians.  It has cost £33,000 per mile.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A scheme of that kind in this country would, I fear, meet with considerable opposition from those who oppose expenditure on roads and everything else.</P>

      <P>I think the Dáil ought to be quite clear as to what Deputy Sears and Deputy Peadar Doyle are asking the Minister to do.  On the subject of vaccination, I am more or less of an open mind.  I am quite prepared to discuss the merits and demerits of the existing law, if that is in order, but the Deputies I have referred to are asking the Minister not to comply with the law&mdash;to exercise a dispensing power.  At present, the law imposes a certain duty on the Minister &mdash;the duty of prosecuting vaccination defaulters.  Deputy Sears and Deputy Doyle are suggesting that the Minister should disregard the law, should set it aside by administrative action.  I suggest that that is not a sound view.</P>

Deputy Doyle did not give us any evidence that it was not so applied, but, if it is not, I certainly say it should be applied uniformly and indiscriminately to everybody.  It should not be applied to one class in particular. With that point of view I agree, but what the Deputy wants is that the law should not apply in any case.  If the law is wrong&mdash;and it may be wrong &mdash;Deputy Doyle or Deputy Sears can bring in a measure which will assimilate the law to the conditions which obtain at present in England.  That is the right constitutional procedure to adopt.</P>

      <P>I will leave that question, only pointing out that we cannot ask Ministers, and must not ask Ministers, to exercise discrimination where it is a case of enforcing the law. That is a very dangerous thing to do. If Ministers once started that, we might find it impossible to stop them.</P>
      <P>I leave that question and come to the main point I wanted to make.  That is with regard to the health of children. The Minister told us, in his opening statement, that in urban areas in the Saorstát, infantile mortality reaches something over a hundred in every thousand.  In other words, one child out of every ten in urban areas in the Saorstát dies in infancy.  That is not so bad as the fact&mdash;I think it can be described as a fact&mdash;that for every child that dies two children, or possibly three children, grow up lacking strength, defective in some way, possibly crippled, possibly mentally infirm. I do not think we can look on that with satisfaction.  One of the sins of omission with which we here may be charged is that we have not done enough, or thought enough, of the children.  They have no votes.  They are not able to make representations to us in the way that others make representations to us continually and, therefore, we ought to be more careful of their welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has attempted to do it, but I should like to see him make a beginning by having appointed for the city of Dublin a special medical officer of health for children, who would make a special study of the problem of the health of the young.  If it is a success in Dublin, it might probably be extended to one or two other urban areas.  I am not going to put Dublin in the dock.  I think more care has been given in Dublin to this matter and that probably some of the country towns, like Sligo and Limerick, are very possibly as bad and worse than Dublin.  I do say that in all our urban areas more care needs to be given to this question of infantile mortality, infantile health, and the bringing up of the rising generation under proper conditions.  We must begin with Dublin, because any experiment <Col N="2038" /> made here will be made under the eye of the Minister and, to a certain extent, under the eye of the Oireachtas. If we find the measures adopted in Dublin are successful, we might extend them elsewhere.  I do ask the Minister to give thought to this and, if necessary, to bring proposals before the Dáil that will help to meet this terrible mortality and this growing up of the generation that must carry on the work of the State in disease and dirt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrThomasHennessy" hpid="Dr. HENNESSY Dr. HENNESSY">
      <NameTxt>Dr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies I should like to direct his attention to the prevention of disease, especially in children.  Any great achievement to be expected in regard to children will lie within the principles of good housing and proper feeding. That the mortality is so large amongst children and that they grow up defectively is due to the fact that they are badly and improperly fed, and also that their environment as regards hygiene is very bad.  If we want to have a healthy population we will have to direct attention to these defects.  The future of public health in Ireland depends largely on preventive medical treatment.  The medical profession may be suspected of ulterior motives when they advocate preventive medicine, but really in doing that they are taking the bit out of their own mouths.  It should not be necessary to say that, but we are always suspect when we advocate reform.  It is hopeful to see Deputies taking an interest in this matter, especially those who are not members of the medical profession.  I am deeply impressed by what Deputy Cooper has said, and I hope that the Minister and the Dáil will take it to heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some defects in the curative side of the work of the Department of Public Health.  The provision made for treatment, especially of the poor, is certainly defective.  It has been claimed that an advance has been made since the amalgamation of workhouses. I see no evidence of any advance.  We have now one workhouse hospital in counties where we had six before.  It is the same old workhouse hospital, without any proper system of sewerage, or opportunities for treating people in an up-to-date manner.  The <Col N="2039" /> operating theatres are very bad, in fact they are only apologies.  I know that the Minister means well when he says that we are moving forward, but I cannot see any very marked evidence of it.  I have been in many of these hospitals, and they are indistinguishable from the old workhouse hospitals.</P>
    <P>The dispensaries, where the poor people have to come three and four times a week to get medical treatment, are very bad.  They are badly lighted and heated, and the poor people have very frequently to wait for hours in wet clothes.  I do not think that should be.  Loans are not now given out of the Local Loans Fund to local authorities for building such dispensaries.  The local authorities have also ceased to build residences for the dispensary medical officers, with the result that many medical officers have to live outside the district, and that is very undesirable. These are matters which should command immediate attention from the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt also that there is grave discontent amongst medical officers engaged in public health services, both in the central department and locally.  That discontent is, I think, well founded.  I see here that medical inspectors are being paid the same salary that was paid fifty years ago, while the cost of medical education has practically doubled.  A medical inspector, in order to be qualified for his position, in addition to gaining his ordinary diplomas, must have seven or more years' service as a practitioner, and also a diploma in public health.  In fact, it would take about £2,000 to qualify for a medical inspectorship. Yet the salary is the same as it was fifty years ago.  There is not much encouragement for men like that to give of the best that is in them.  The same thing applies to the medical officers throughout the country.  I must, however, pay a tribute to the local authorities.  Any relief these medical officers have got has come from the local authorities.  They have increased the salaries of the medical officers, and although that increase does not represent very much more than the <Col N="2040" /> increase in the cost of living, nevertheless the local authorities who are the representatives of the ratepayers have accorded them very fair treatment. These authorities think that the central authority should revert to the former basis of paying half the salary of the medical officers.  At present they do not pay one-third.  I hope the Minister will give consideration to these matters, because without the service of medical officers he cannot hope to achieve very much.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done a great deal for public health services by way of legislation, but a large amount of work still remains to be done by way of administration, and I hope that the Department of Finance will not prove an obstacle in his way.  Recently there was an inquiry into these medical services and the representative of the Department of Finance was seriously disturbed because the poor law medical officers were some £20 a year better off than they were in 1914, even taking into account the reduced purchasing value of money.  To my mind that is a very poor conception of the importance of a body of public officials like these. As I have pointed out, they give some three and a half million attendances on the poor people at a remuneration which, including travelling expenses, does not work out at more than sixpence per attendance.</P>
    <P>It has been said that Ireland has grown inhospitable to its saints.  It has also become inhospitable to its doctors of all degrees.  I fear, notwithstanding the excellent efforts of Deputy Magennis to bring back the saints through providing saintly entertainment by means of the cinema, that if somebody does not do something for the doctors they also will leave the country.</P>

      <P>I should like to add a word to what Deputy Cooper has said in connection with the necessity for giving more attention to the health of the children.  The Minister has been doing what Deputy Sears and Deputy Doyle asked him to do, to which Deputy Cooper rightly objected. He has failed to carry out the law as it exists at present in one particular direction.  There is on the statute <Col N="2041" /> book for the past three years an Act providing for the medical inspection and treatment of school children.  Each county council is bound by that Act to provide a scheme for the medical inspection of school children.  It is the duty of the Minister to see that the county councils do their duty in this respect, but nothing has been done.  I have raised the matter on several occasions, and on each occasion was told that the Department was waiting until the system of local government was overhauled.  But the law was there all the time.  I hope the Minister will give some definite assurance on this matter, and a statement of his intentions as to when this Act will be put into operation.  I hope the scheme of medical and dental inspection and treatment of school children will be put into operation in every county, and that it will be obligatory on the county councils to institute schemes at the earliest possible date, because it is only by the proper inspection and treatment of children in this way that the improvement in public health, which is desired by every Deputy, will be brought about.  This is the best way, as the medical Deputies will tell us, to have a policy of preventive medicine carried out&mdash;by inspecting children regularly in the schools, and treating them when required.  If infantile diseases are allowed to go untreated and often undiscovered, it will lead to very much greater expense and trouble afterwards.</P>

      <P>It was not my intention originally to speak on this Vote at all, but the subject of vaccination which has been brought forward&mdash;a thing in which I take a good deal of interest, and on which I have a very fixed opinion&mdash;has brought me to my feet. I listened with great interest to the speech of Deputy Sir James Craig, to whom we all listen with great pleasure, because of the knowledge which he undoubtedly has, and because of his wide experience.  In these matters, the matter of vaccination especially, one views the question from one's own experience. I am a firm believer in it, I <Col N="2042" /> may say, to begin with.  I believe in it most thoroughly.  In the year 1878 or 1879, when I was a student in Trinity College, there was an awful outbreak of small-pox in Dublin. I came into intimate contact with people who were down with it.  I was vaccinated, and I think I may say that I owe my immunity from the disease on that occasion to that.  I came into very close contact with it.  It was very bad at the time, and if I remember aright there were certain streets which people were advised not to go down.</P>
      <P>Then afterwards on three occasions &mdash;two in India and another occasion in another country&mdash;I came into the closest contact with people down with that loathsome disease.  One of them, a brother officer of mine, who was not vaccinated, got it in its very worst form, and from being an extremely active man in mind and body, and of splendid appearance, it had the effect of crippling him and breaking him down.  He was never the same man afterwards.  He just barely recovered, by the skin of his teeth, as you might say.  On another occasion, when I was in the north of India, there was a regular epidemic all round.  I was in close contact with it.  There was a very large number carried off with it, and I am thankful to say I escaped. I think I am right in my opinion that I owed my escape to the attention I paid to being vaccinated and to being re-vaccinated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Doyle said that the vaccination laws were worked unfairly as regards rich and poor.  I had a good deal to do with local affairs, and I do not think that is the case.  I think the richer people are as much compelled to carry out the vaccination laws as the poorer.  I know a case in my own neighbourhood of a person of the richer class who declined to have his child vaccinated, and he was compelled to do it by law.  I do not think there is any discrimination, and there should not be.  If it is decided that it is good for the overwhelming majority of the people at large, I do not think that whatever our opinions are against it, we should stand in the way of it.  I hope personally that the Minister will <Col N="2043" /> see that the law is carried out in that respect.  We certainly do not wish to have over here the epidemics that swept over Europe and over England in the Middle Ages.  No doubt a great deal was due to dirt and insanitary conditions, but I am quite sure in my own mind that if vaccination had been there, this illness would not have taken a hold on nations in the way it did.</P>
    <P>Leaving that matter, I want to say that I entirely agree with what Deputies Cooper and O'Connell said in regard to children.  I am with Deputy O'Connell entirely in what he said about stricter inspection of school children, that it should be carried out with the most unflinching strictness, and that every matter connected with them, being a matter of public interest and of importance to the whole nation, should be attended to at once from the teeth&mdash;on which their whole health probably depends &mdash; downwards to other matters.  There is a phase of child illness that I notice very much throughout the country, and that is cases of whole families of imbecile children.  It has always occurred to me that there should be some system of segregating them.  Some of them are hopeless.  I have known a family where all but one could be counted as imbeciles.  Some of them could be taught a certain amount, but others could never be taught.  There should be something done to segregate these children&mdash;they are hopeless cases&mdash; from others that may be partly cured. It is up to us to see that something should be done in this matter.  It is not only terrible for the parents and for the children themselves, but for the people with whom they live in close contact.  They have to mix with them every day.  I hope something will be done in this matter.  It is one of the most pressing matters in regard to child health that I know of.</P>
    <P>Leaving the matter of health, I want to refer to the question we have been discussing at such great length, that is the improvement of the roads. I am in agreement to a certain extent with what Deputy Heffernan has said. I do not believe in the ultimate value of concrete roads.  I had something to <Col N="2044" /> do with certain concrete buildings, and from what I have seen, of some of them at least, I did not get the idea that concrete was secure for all evils in regard to house-planning or in regard to keeping out water, and that kind of thing.  I think before we go to such expense as would be involved in concrete roads we must consider a good many things.  I think also that these very heavy lorries ought to be kept off the roads altogether.  I think that the Minister said something that was in agreement with that.  It is to the interest of the whole country that the railways should be flourishing. They employ an enormous number of men.  I wonder how many they do employ.  Deputy Davin would probably know.  I wonder how many men are employed on the roads, and how they compare in number with those who make their livelihood on the railways.  If the railways become&mdash; shall I say&mdash;insolvent it will be a very serious matter for the country, and if the traffic that should go on the railways is carried by road it seems to me that there will be no other end but that.  The roads were not made for these heavy lorries; they were made for ordinary motor traffic and cars, which is what the ratepayers would consent to pay for.  But, to my mind, heavy traffic ought to be carried on the railways, and by some means or other those who manage the railways will probably find means to reduce the rates, so that it will be possible for people to send these heavy-weights by rail.  A great many people appear to be getting their goods conveyed practically free on the roads when they ought to be using the railways and helping to keep going one of the greatest industries in the country, and one which gives so much employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points that I would like the Minister to deal with.  I want him to give us some information with regard to the system of inspection by his inspectors of county homes and hospitals.  I was very glad to hear Deputy Dr. Hennessy refer to this question of county hospitals.  I agree with him that amalgamation has brought no improvement <Col N="2045" /> as far as the treatment in these places is concerned.  It may have brought about the saving of money, but it is very questionable whether that is good economy or not.  As far as my information goes, particularly with regard to county homes, they are not conducted in a very good way.  In some of them there is great overcrowding and they are badly kept.  The sanitary requirements are not anything like what they should be where such large numbers of people are congregated together, and I think it is absolutely necessary, both in the interests of the inmates and of the ratepayers, that they should be visited fairly frequently by the inspectors of the Department.  I think that these inspections should be made without notice.  My colleague here tells me that they never send notices, but I am inclined to think that the information is carried in some fashion or other.  It is generally known when the inspector is near the place, and then the officials are on their best behaviour: all the white quilts, and so on, that have been in the linen presses for a month or so, are spread on the beds, and everything is in apple-pie order when the inspector arrives, but when he departs they are put back in the presses again.  As Deputy O'Connell says, that is an old trick, but I think it was time it was put an end to.  I am convinced that the inmates have not benefited by amalgamation, because the setting up of county hospitals and the doing away with hospitals in districts has not resulted in any better treatment.  Up-to-date operating theatres have not been set up, and you will not get a first class doctor, a man competent to carry out major operations to go to a county hospital for £500 or £600 a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of the county surgeon.  You will not get men capable of carrying out major operations for that sum, because a man capable of carrying out such operations in the best scientific manner will not go into a county hospital and bury himself, so to speak, for £500 a year. That man is going to go further, if he has the ability, in Dublin, Cork or somewhere else.  There is another <Col N="2046" /> point in that too.  Even if the county council of a particular county is lucky enough to get a capable man for that figure, people will not have the confidence in him, and all the people who can afford to do it, if they can obtain the money, will still try to go to the hospitals in Dublin under a capable and eminent man.  This is a big matter and it should be gone into thoroughly by the Department of Local Government and Public Health, because as far as I can see and learn from people through the country who are interested in this matter there have been no real benefits from this amalgamation.</P>
      <P>We have heard a good deal to-day about the question of vaccination as a preventative of disease.  I think it goes further than the question of vaccination. I think, as Deputy Hennessy said, there is very little use in vaccinating children who are half hungry, and who are reared up, perhaps five to eight of them, cramped in one small room, and eating and sleeping there.  Vaccination is not going to be much good for them and I think the Minister for Local Government should pay a great deal more attention to the proper housing and feeding of the children.  Perhaps if they do properly house them and feed them, then they can insist on having them vaccinated.  As far as I am concerned, I think vaccination is a good thing, but vaccination in itself is not going to keep disease from children who are under-fed, under-clothed and badly housed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister whether his attention has been called to the difficulty of obtaining explosives for quarrying purposes, by local authorities. I am informed that a good deal of this delay is due to the activities of the Gárda Síochána and the military, but the fact is that there is very great difficulty at the present time in obtaining explosives for quarrying purposes. As a result we have a large number of men unemployed who could be employed if the explosives could be obtained. When the Department will make available the money for road reconstruction which we hope they will be soon in a position to do, the county councils will not have the material <Col N="2047" /> ready to go ahead with the work, and if the explosive could be obtained now in the quantities required it would help to relieve unemployment.  The material would be raised now in the fine long days which are suitable for quarrying, and so could be ready when the money was made available.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter regarding milk supply, particularly in our urban areas.  As far as I am aware, samples are not taken by anyone with a view to having them analysed to see if they are correct, and this is a matter which should be seen to immediately.  I think we all realise that it is essential that as far as milk is concerned, above all other things, it should be as pure as possible, having regard to the fact that it is the principal food of children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir JAMES CRAIG Sir JAMES CRAIG">
      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>A statement was made by Deputy Doyle casting a serious reflection on the medical profession, which I think should not go unchallenged. He made a statement to the effect that the medical profession discriminated between the poor and the better-off people, particularly between the children of the poor and of the doctors themselves.  I have no accurate knowledge of what is being done in the matter of vaccination, but I protest against a statement of this sort.  I know of no doctors who do not believe in vaccination and who have not been vaccinated, and I know of no doctors whose families have not been vaccinated. I think it is up to the Minister to refute this statement for the sake of men working under the Department of Local Government.  We have to admit that infant mortality in Ireland has been extremely high.  Even compared with the industrial centres in England, where the death rate would be high, we have a high proportion of infant mortality cases indeed.  The children in the rural area have twice the chance of those in the urban areas.  The figure is 102 for the urban areas and 55 for the rural areas.  This infant mortality will go on so long as the housing conditions of the poor remain as they are, and so long as the mothers understand so little about the feeding of their <Col N="2048" /> children.  These two things have been mentioned over and over again, as lying at the base of infant mortality in this country.  I impress on the Government that it will never have a clean bill of health as regards children until children are better housed and better fed.</P>
      <P>I turn to another point to which I have referred on previous occasions&mdash; namely, to the number of medical inspectors. On each of the two years when we had the estimates before us, I found fault with the actual number of medical inspectors.  I may say I know nothing about the work the general inspectors have to do, but I know something of the work the medical inspectors have to do.  We still have here nine medical inspectors engaged on the work, and I want to ask the Minister whether those nine include two medical inspectors that had been transferred to other duties&mdash; namely, to undertake the work that ought to be done by the elected bodies. Is it the case that two of those nine represent the Dublin Corporation, and two others represent the Cork Corporation? Are those included, or have we still nine actual medical inspectors? With regard to medical inspection, I think the Minister could do a great deal if he directed the attention of medical inspectors, when they were going through the country, to endeavour to induce local bodies or to induce charitable people, even in local areas, to adopt child welfare schemes.  I believe that would do a tremendous amount of good in reducing the infant mortality.  It is extraordinary how ignorant the ordinary mother is about feeding her child, and if those child welfare centres were prevalent throughout the country there is no doubt that the information that could be given by trained nurses employed in the child welfare centres, or even ladies working in the child welfare centres would be very beneficial.  I am sorry to have to intervene in the matter of vaccination, but I think it is necessary to call upon the Minister to refute the statement that there was one law for the poor and another for the rich.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been very considerable discussion of this Vote. Deputy Dr. Hennessy has made two speeches which, while in some respects praising the Department, contained on the whole serious criticisms of its work. He seems to take umbrage at the fact that we have no Ministry of Health, or something in the guise of a Ministry of Health, and that the medical authorities are not more prominent in the Ministry.  Of course, in all medical matters I am advised by my principal medical officer, who, as Deputy Dr. Hennessy knows, was for a long time a dispensary doctor like himself.  He knows the needs and the difficulties under which these doctors carry out their duties throughout the country.  I think we are entitled to some little credit for trying to improve the position of these officers.  In 1904 the average salary of a dispensary doctor was £109.  At present it is £251.  That represents a big advance.  We are trying throughout the country to arrive at a fair scale of remuneration for these officers.  In some particular cases local authorities have refused to accede to our request, and, in the serious economic position of the country, I am slow to resort to the issuing of a sealed order to enforce payment of a higher salary.  Wherever we considered a doctor was not getting proper remuneration we have done everything in our power to force local authorities to improve the position.  It must be remembered that there is a difference in the amount of remuneration that local authorities are in a position to pay medical officers.  The standard of living in various counties is different.  In some counties you have poor and small farmers, and in other counties wealthy farmers.  The standard of life rises and falls in accordance with the position of the predominant element in the county&mdash;generally farmers.  For that reason in some western counties doctors' salaries are not as high as they are in wealthier counties.  That is a condition of affairs that I am not in a position to remedy.  Deputy Morrissey asked me about the inspection of county homes and hospitals.  It is a new role for Deputy Morrissey to take up, to insist on a closer supervision of local authorities by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think some of my arguments must be getting home with Deputy Morrissey.  In a matter of this kind the principal responsibility rests on the local board of health.  It is the duty of the members of the board to see that these institutions are kept up to the proper standard.  It is very difficult at long range to supervise these institutions.  It is quite likely that the leakage to which Deputy Morrissey refers occurs, and that officers of these institutions get wind of the fact that an inspector is going down.  It is very hard for me to prevent abuses of that kind.  The only way that local authorities can see that the officers of these institutions carry out their duties properly is by the members taking an interest in the matter themselves.  Deputy Morrissey does not seem pleased with the establishment of county hospitals. In his constituency there is no county hospital, but the principal reason for that is the agitation of the county council itself.  It had grave objections to carrying out the wishes of the Department, and accordingly we cannot take responsibility for the state of affairs down there.  In some parts of the country where we have county hospitals working, and where we have suitable surgeons appointed, they are carrying on very successfully, and the number of major operations being performed in these institutions is increasing and has been very successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of providing explosives for quarries is one that has been engaging the attention of the Department. We have taken the matter up with the Ministry of Justice.  In each case it is a matter of looking after the public interest.  The Civic Guard authorities are of opinion that it is dangerous to leave large quantities of explosives unguarded for any length of time.  It is very difficult to see how that can be got over.  It is of greater importance to see that the peace of the country is preserved than to see that road work is expedited.  Naturally it is the wish of my Department that every facility should be given for the quarrying of road metal, but if it would prejudice the safety of the State or the peace of the <Col N="2051" /> district the considerations of my Department have to take second place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooper and other Deputies referred to the fact that child welfare is a question that vitally concerns the State, especially to bring down infant mortality and raise the position of children generally.  It will be appreciated that this is a very big question. I am doing everything possible to help in this matter.  As can be seen, the Vote for child welfare schemes has been increased.  It is our object to bring these child welfare schemes into closer contact with the local authorities throughout the country.  By doing that we will be in a better position to see that the object of these schemes is more efficiently carried out. When we get our county medical officers appointed they will be in a position to supervise this work.  That will be a considerable advance.  As Deputies have remarked, it is not merely a question of the child itself.  The condition in which the parents live has a good deal to do with it.  It is a question of housing, a question of clothing, a question of cleanliness, hygiene, and feeding.  It is really a question of raising the whole economic level of the country.  That cannot be done by one Department.  It is a national question. While our economic position is such that our strongest and healthiest are compelled to leave the country to make a living elsewhere&mdash;that has been the position for a long time, and it may be so for some time to come&mdash;it is difficult to see how the condition or the status of the children is to be improved in the near future.</P>
    <P>We are making every effort in that direction.  It is undoubtedly in the interests of the State to do so, as the future of the State is bound up with an improvement in the condition of the children, but it is an ideal to be aimed at rather than something which it is possible to carry out fully at present. Deputy Hennessy has inquired about the salaries of county medical officers. It will, of course, be our interest to see that these officers receive suitable salaries.  They will have important duties, and it will be necessary to give them adequate remuneration.  At present <Col N="2052" /> I am not in a position to state what their salaries will be.  In a great many cases the salaries will depend on the financial capacity of the particular county, but I should say that they would certainly be up to £700 a year, or perhaps more.  Deputy Hennessy also dealt with the question of the supervision of milk.  That is undoubtedly a most important matter.  We all realise that the conditions under which milk is provided are anything but satisfactory, and I think that is true, as Deputy Hennessy has said, in rural and urban areas to an even greater degree than in Dublin.  We were powerless in this matter until we had a county medical officer who could supervise public health work generally.  The public health portion of the Local Government Bill will come into operation probably in October, and provision has been made in regard to this.  We have also made provision for appointing county veterinary surgeons.  There will be at least one county veterinary surgeon to supervise all matters under the Dairies and Cowsheds Orders, and also to carry out the inspection of meat.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell spoke of the insanitary conditions of schools.  That is a matter for the Minister for Education primarily, but the local authorities can interfere if insanitary conditions exist.  There again is a case of having no responsible officer to look after these matters.  When we have the county medical officers all these duties will centre under them, and it will be their function to see that the duties are properly carried out.  There has been a long discussion on vaccination. I am a thorough believer in vaccination.  Far from agreeing with Deputy Sears' point of view, I believe that vaccines of various kinds have thoroughly justified themselves.  In the Great War vaccine treatment was resorted to for eliminating tetanus, and was very successful in doing so, and also in eliminating fevers amongst the troops.  I think Deputy Wolfe's experiences were very pertinent and convincing on this subject.  As regards vaccination for small-pox, it is, of course, ridiculous to expect me to refrain from carrying out the statutory obligation as regards the vaccination <Col N="2053" /> law.  The law puts an obligation first on the local authority, and afterwards on the Minister, and unless the law is amended, I have no option but to see that it is enforced.  Deputy Sears has referred to some alteration in the law in England.  At present there are thousands of children in that country who have not been vaccinated, and the result is that there is a great number of cases of small-pox in England, whereas in Ireland there has been, I think, no case of secondary infection. In a few cases persons living at the ports have been infected by foreigners, but the disease has never spread owing to the measures taken.  Coming back to the roads question, the Roads Advisory Committee meet to-morrow, I believe, and they will go into the question of the standard of road maintenance. I expect within a month we will be able to put forward recommendations, to the Minister for Finance, and, contrary to Deputy Johnson's anticipations, I believe we will be able to start the scheme in about the middle of the summer.</P>

      <P>There is a certain amount of money on hands.  There has been considerable discussion about the different kinds of material used on roads.  I dealt with that to some extent in the beginning.  Deputy Egan insisted that concrete roads are the only kind of roads worth laying down, and Deputy Sears said that concrete roads would last for 30 years.  I have had experience of concrete roads in America, and I know they are very efficient there, but I have my doubts as to their efficiency in Ireland.  Concrete is certainly most suitable for foundations.  If Deputy Sears can bring forward some authoritative engineer who will guarantee a life of 30 years for concrete roads, we will be very willing to give a very attentive ear to his proposals.  Deputy Heffernan has raised some matter dealing <Col N="2055" /> with the prosecution of ratepayers and their being brought before the County Court or the Circuit Court.  I have not any particulars of such cases before me, and before I reply to this query, it would be for the Deputy either to put down a question on the matter or to approach me in my office. Such cases have not come before me up to the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would want to know the circumstances first.  The question of the salary of the secretary was also raised by Deputy Heffernan.  That salary was fixed by the Department of Finance, and it is fixed at a scale which is only commensurate with the very heavy duties that this officer has to carry out.  I think when one realises that the position of that officer is one of the most onerous in the service of the Government, and when it is taken into consideration that he replaces three or four other officers, one of whom had a salary of £1,800 a year, two of whom had salaries of £1,200 a year, and another, who had a salary of £1,100 a year, I do not think it will be considered that the salary of the Secretary is excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Egan, I think, asked for some figures with regard to the cost of laying down roads in the City of Dublin. Finglas Road, Phibsboro' Road and Constitution Hill road were constructed with sheet asphalt, two-inch binder and one-inch surface, at a cost of 12s. 3d. per square yard.  Dame Street and College Green were constructed on a six-inch concrete foundation and two-inch asphalt surface, at a cost of 24s. per square yard.  St. Stephen's Green (East) was constructed on sheet asphalt, two-inch binder, and one-inch surface, at a cost of 15s. 7d. per square yard.  Upper Merrion Street, Merrion Square West, and Lower Merrion Street, were constructed on a reinforced concrete foundation and two-inch asphalt, at a cost of 23s. 6d. per square yard.  Lincoln Place and Merrion Row were <Col N="2056" /> constructed on sheet asphalt, two and three-fourth-inch binder and one-inch surface, at 15s. 6d. per square yard. Nassau Street, Leinster Street and part of Merrion Square, on a concrete foundation, and two-inch asphalt, were constructed at an average cost of 15s. 10½d.  I do not think there is any other question.</P>

It would be a very serious matter indeed if the statement the Deputy made were allowed to go uncontradicted. Without meaning it, perhaps, the Deputy's statement was one of the most harmful that could be made.  It had reference to the manner in which milk in this country is handled in the making of butter.  I do not know what experience the Deputy has in the matter, but his statement would be a most damaging one if it were allowed to go uncontradicted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what experience Deputy Dr. Hennessy has on this matter.  I do not know where he got his information or the experience that he seemed to be speaking from.  I do not know whether he got it from the suppliers of milk to creameries, from the owners of private dairies who do not send milk to creameries <Col N="2059" /> eries or sell milk in their dairies, from amongst the purveyors of milk, or, indeed, what the source was from which he got the information.  I can speak for two classes.  The first is composed of those who send their milk to the creameries, and the second, those who make their own butter and neither send their milk to the creameries nor sell it.  Years ago there might be some truth in what was said with regard to the condition of milk in this country, and the way in which it was handled. To-day there is certainly no truth in the statement the Deputy has made. As regards milk sent to creameries, the statement bears no resemblance to the actual facts.</P>
      <P>Every morning at the creameries, the milk supplies which come in are subjected to close inspection.  Not only is the milk inspected, but there is also a close examination as to the condition of the churns.  If there is foreign matter in the milk when it arrives at the creameries, it will be found at the bottom of the churn when the milk is emptied out.  Almost every morning the creamery managers examine the churns, and it would be impossible for foreign matter to be in the milk without their knowledge.  I have no knowledge myself as to how things are done in Denmark, but I have experience of dairies in England, and I can say from my own personal knowledge that the milk supplies to our Irish creameries are as carefully examined as they are in any other country.  In making that statement, I know that it has behind it the support of every creamery manager in the Saorstát.  I agree, of course, that every precaution should be taken to ensure that milk supplies should be delivered under the best conditions possible, and I am quite prepared to accept any regulations calculated to bring about the highest standard we can reach in that respect.  I desire to emphasise again that the statement Deputy Dr. Hennessy made is absolutely contrary to the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know anything as regards the condition of the dairies about Dublin. It may be, perhaps, that the fodder and the bedding may not be attended <Col N="2060" /> to as they should be, but what I am concerned with now at the moment, is the condition in which cows are kept in the dairy districts of this country.  Where creameries are not in existence, and where proper inspection is not carried out, the conditions to which the Deputy referred, may exist. I know that years ago, before the butter industry became centred in the creameries, the conditions that prevailed were not anything like what they should be, but since then the conditions have improved enormously, and the statement of the Deputy, to my own knowledge, is not true.  That is all I want to say at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrThomasHennessy" hpid="Dr. HENNESSY Dr. HENNESSY">
      <NameTxt>Dr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gorey relies on the fact that the milk is inspected at the creameries every morning. I would like to point out to him that that is only a naked-eye inspection. I agree that the country owes a great deal to the creamery managers, who have done their best to neutralise the effects of the dirty milk supplied to them by some people, but I would point out to the Deputy that microscopic examinations are not made at the creameries.  Very often the crude examination of taking a sample of milk, of putting it in a test tube and allowing it to rest for a period, is not carried out.  If Deputy Gorey would go to the trouble of visiting a number of dairies in any county in Ireland and of taking a sample of milk in a 10-inch test tube, and if he were to look at it an hour afterwards, I should be very much surprised if he did not get in it a half inch of sediment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I was anxious to do was to bring to the notice of the House, and to that section of the community which Deputy Gorey represents, the fact that the Glaxo Trade Milk Company circularised the trade here, pointing out the bad analysis which Irish milk made, and the danger of prescribing it for children.  I say that is a very appalling statement.  If the Irish farmers do not take measures to see that the milk supplied is cleaner, then the position will be very serious.  I am not in a position to contradict the statement of the Glaxo people.  In fact all the information at my disposal would go to confirm the circular issued by <Col N="2061" /> the Glaxo people.  The fact that Deputy Gorey must bear in mind is, that in external appearances, and in the actual milking, the cows in this country should present as good a picture of cleanliness as the Danish cows.  Otherwise, Irish butter will not be a very popular article of food in England. I know myself what the views of the <Col N="2062" /> Ministry of Health in England are as regards the manufacture of Irish butter. It is quite true, of course, that several people engaged in the manufacture of butter in this country do it very well, but then there is too big a percentage of other people who neutralise their commendable efforts.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for POSTS and TELEGRAPHS (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In presenting the Post Office estimates from year to year it is customary to begin with a financial review, and at this stage, it is necessary to explain that it is difficult, indeed impossible, to give anything like an accurate estimate of the working of these services at the presentation of the Estimates.  It is only through the medium of a special report, issued twelve months, or a longer period after these Estimates have been discussed, that it is possible to arrive at anything approaching accuracy in the financial working of the Department for the previous year.</P>
      <P>When the service was taken over in 1922 we endeavoured to ascertain its financial working.  At the time, of course&mdash;I mean prior to the Treaty&mdash; the service was treated as a whole, not the Twenty-Six Counties as now, and though the figures were not vouched for as being entirely accurate, because of the cross currents of accounts between Dublin and London, it is estimated that the loss for the year 1921-22 worked out at £1,400,000.  In the year 1922-23 this sum receded to £1,132,000; in 1923-24 it dropped to £705,000.  As regards 1924-25 it is thought that the deficit will be somewhere in the region of £696,000, and for the coming year we anticipate, without taking into consideration any improvement in the economic conditions of the country, that the debit balance will work out something like £630,000.</P>
      <P>This result is not quite as rosy as we thought at one time it might be. When I spoke here two years ago I expressed the opinion that we should, within the next two years, come beneath the half-a-million mark.  At the time the cost of living showed a dropping figure; in the interval it has gone the other way, and every ten points of variation means a variation of £70,000 roughly, in the financial outlook of this service.  Now the cost of living has gone up ten points in the last twelve months, and, consequently, our financial position is that much down.</P>
      <P>In addition to this burden of £70,000, which we had hoped to avoid, I thought it well to recommend to the Minister for Finance a substantial reduction in telephone charges.  I will deal with telephones very fully later on, but I thought it necessary, because of the need for industrial stimulation, to give relief in telephones, and the Minister for Finance, in his Budget statement, has unfolded these reliefs. I shall briefly re-state them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of private telephones, up <Col N="2063" /> to the present time the charge was £7 10s. 0d. for the call fee; henceforth the charge will be £5.  In the same case the local-call fee was three-half-pence; henceforth, this will be a penny-farthing. It is thought that in the case of the private user, who formerly met a bill of ten guineas, henceforth he should be able to cover this account for something under £8, perhaps £7 10s. 0d.</P>
    <P>Business lines which were formerly £7 10s. 0d. are now reduced to £6 10s. 0d.; they also participate in the call reduction.  Likewise reductions have been made for auxiliary lines and duplicate business lines.  These reductions amount, in the case of telephones, to something like £34,000 or £35,000. We have also made reductions in the case of postcards.  Pressure was brought to bear upon us from the business community to facilitate their business by this reduction and we accepted the proposal.  Formerly the charge was three-halfpence&mdash;an awkward figure for means of communication; it is now one penny.  The two reductions, those for telephone and postcards, amount to £50,000.  This £50,000 has also to be taken into consideration in showing our deficit for the coming year.  I have already pointed out the position has been worsened by the increase of £70,000 due to the rise in the cost of living. Adding the figure of £50,000 to that we get £120,000.</P>
    <P>Ordinarily, had we not to meet these two items the deficit would be somewhere in the region of half a million. In addition to these two figures we have, unfortunately to take with us from year to year a very heavy superannuation figure of £120,000, or slightly more, due to the retirements under Article Ten of the Treaty.  In that way we have to account for practically a quarter of a million of money which could not well have been accurately foreseen when estimating in advance towards the clearance of Post Office working.  Were it not for these facts, our deficit would be well under half a million by now.  During the past year our postal revenue dropped £89,000 under <Col N="2064" /> Estimate.  Our telegraph revenue dropped £10,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and our telephones showed an unexpected profit, or an advance on the Estimate of £17,000. Telephones, for the first time in their history in this country, have become a paying proposition.  They made a small profit last year, and, notwithstanding the substantial concession of £34,000 or £35,000 which we made through the recent Budget, we anticipate a profit also for the coming year. Now, this is a hopeful development.  It means that you can have cheaper telephones and paying telephones.  It proves one thing in regard to this side of commercial enterprise.  It proves that profit moves hand in hand with cheapness.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested from time to time that we ought to follow the footsteps of England in a letter rate reduction. A reduction to 1½d. would mean a sacrifice of a quarter of a million of money.  I am not satisfied that the nation would get value for that reduction. I think we must try to proceed on economic lines.  If you take this quarter of a million off the postal revenue, you must find it somewhere else.  We do not anticipate an increase of any considerable amount through a reduction.  In England it was found that the reduction resulted only in an increase of four per cent. through the change from 2d. to 1½d., and we have no reason to believe that the outlook would differ very materially here.  We are not satisfied, either, that a reduction to 1½d. will stimulate trade very materially or very substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken the trouble, during the year, to determine, as far as possible, the origin and nature of postal correspondence. While I cannot hold definitely by the conclusions that we have come to, it can be fairly safely stated that 50 per cent. of the postal matter dealt with by my Department has its origin in correspondence of a private character, and about 25 per cent. may be ascribed to what we should term handling business; the balance would be what is generally <Col N="2065" /> termed productive work.  We must consider, when deciding to sacrifice the sum of a quarter of a million, how we are likely to help the nation, and to what degree.  In this case, I hold you can only consider that 25 per cent., and to sacrifice a quarter of a million for such a small margin would not, in my estimation, be justified.  I do think that the nation's money could be better spent in other directions, and I am not prepared now, nor, should I be in this position in 12 months' time, would I then be prepared, to make any proposal to the Minister for Finance for a reduction of the postal rate below its present level.  I want to make that very clear, in order to get done with any possible agitation during the coming 12 months.</P>
    <P>I may also say that, with the exception of three or four countries, our postal rates are not high.  In the case of South Africa and England they certainly have lower rates.  A great many Continental countries have a rate similar to ours; but a great many of them also have rates of a higher kind, and some have charges very much above the Saorstát charges.  I do not, at the present time, see any great prospect of the Post Office paying its way. Under certain favourable conditions that possibly may be brought about.  If the cost of living falls, for instance, our deficit will decrease.  If trade revives, it will also decrease, and very appreciably, for the reason that we must necessarily maintain&mdash;as we are maintaining&mdash;a staff in advance of our requirements.  I think I could safely say that we are in a position to deal with something like from 10 to 15 per cent. more traffic with our existing staff than we are now called upon to deal with.  It will be understood by the House that in a Department like this you cannot cut the staff from day to day.  You must move cautiously in a matter of that kind.  That is a means by which this deficit could largely disappear.</P>
    <P>There is still another means.  It was referred to here, I think, on the 1923-24 Estimates.  Our loss is incurred mainly in rural districts.  We set about reducing that loss some two years ago. I cannot say it was very popular with <Col N="2066" /> the country.  At first the country thought it could face reductions of the kind, but most people like to see reductions when they are applied to others; they do not wish to see them as applied to themselves.  When the reductions were made we were faced with an outcry and they have been discontinued. Were this country strong economically, and in a position to give general employment to its manhood, it would not be out of the question to introduce a very radical change in the distribution of rural correspondence, by the introduction, for instance, of the motor cycle method.  One motor cycle would take the place of half a dozen men.  A change of that kind would, at the present time, result in wholesale dismissals and additions to the ranks of the unemployed. Nobody in the House desires that the unemployment situation should be accentuated at present. I want to make it clear, when this loss in the Post Office is pointed to, that at any time that the House desires, the Post Office is in a position, without very serious hardship to the country, to balance the Post Office accounts and to cause this heavy deficit practically, if not entirely, to disappear.</P>
    <P>Prior to the Treaty, all mails leaving this country found their outward and inward channel through London.  The mails were sent to a clearing office in London, sorted there, and dispatched to their respective destinations in different countries.  That applied both to parcels and letters.  It naturally resulted in delay, more or less.  We have departed from that.  We have developed a system of direct intercourse between the Saorstát and foreign countries, and at the present time we are making up mails direct&mdash; I am speaking of letter mails&mdash;for France, Germany, the States, Canada, Newfoundland, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, India, the Straits Settlements and the Federated Malay States. We are negotiating direct exchanges with Holland, Belgium, Spain, Switzerland, China, the Argentine, and Mexico.</P>
    <P>In the case of parcels, we are now dispatching our entire American output through Cobh.  We have in this way been able to give small assistance to the various steamship companies that call <Col N="2067" /> at that port.  Whilst the major portion of the inward parcel mails also comes through Cobh, it must be understood that we do not control the homeward route; we control only the outward route.  We are at present negotiating a direct exchange of parcels with certain other foreign countries, such as Canada and Germany.  In the case of foreign money orders, up to six or eight months ago all money orders going from, or coming to, this country passed through a clearing house in London. The charge made on these at the time was 4d.  The commission on foreign postal orders was 4d.  The total commission had to be paid to the British Government for their part in the foreign money order business.  Latterly, or during the last twelve months, we have opened direct money order business with a great number of foreign countries, and in every case this has meant a saving of 2d. per money order. It resulted in a big saving in the instance of the United States, from which we received last year, through the money order channels, a sum of £989,000.</P>
    <P>It resulted in a saving to us of something in the neighbourhood of £6,000.  The effect of the introduction of the direct method of exchange has resulted in that saving in the Saorstát Post Office in money orders alone.  This policy is being developed.  It will be observed that the Post Office has gone in for motor transport very generally. Formerly the mails were practically entirely handled by private contractors. We have found from experience that we can save money by handling them ourselves in certain areas, notably Dublin. In addition to this development of the mail carrying business in the bigger centres, it has been found very useful to introduce light motor vans in country districts.  This introduction has expedited the transport of correspondence, and in addition, it is a pretty substantial saving, as will be observed from the accounts.  This policy is being pursued.  It will also be noticed that our mails are being collected by light vehicles.  It is unfortunate that this country does not manufacture these light vehicles, or similar vehicles, <Col N="2068" /> because they take the place of labour. It would not matter very much if labour were otherwise employed, but nevertheless, we have to move with the times, and we find that the introduction of light vehicles has resulted in considerable saving, as well as the speeding up of our business.  It will also be seen that we use motor-cycles for the delivery of telegrams in the bigger centres.  This, too, is a paying development, and a very advisable one from the point of view of expedition. In connection with this motor vehicle side of our department, we have found it necessary to set up a separate section for fuelling and repairs.  This section is attached to John's Road, and may in time be useful for other departments. On the 1st September last our inland parcel rates were reduced by an all-round fee of threepence.  This reduction has proved to be a rather substantial drain on revenue.  I should say here that even at the old figures the parcels rates were too low.  You cannot by any stretch of imagination conceive how a parcel can be taken from one end of the country to the other with all its different transactions, counterhandling, stamping, packing, transit, delivery, and so forth, all for sixpence.  We were losing heavily prior to this reduction, and we are losing still more heavily now.  This was one of the main reasons in connection with the surplus of incoming parcels why we found it necessary to impose a delivery fee.</P>
    <P>That delivery fee resulted in an income for the past year of something like £50,000.  A good deal of agitation has gone on for its removal in the interval, but we feel that we would not be justified in making any change.  I do not think that this country can afford to be philanthropic in dealing with surplus incoming traffic.  We are merely asking these people who get parcels from abroad to pay part of their way.  It is not unfair to expect that people who find it necessary to bring parcels from the other side should, at least, do something to relieve the loss which the payment for that delivery would cost their neighbours. In other words, they expect people to do something to pay their own fee in this respect, and they intend to retain <Col N="2069" /> it.  A number of tests were taken during the year as a result of the imposition of that sixpenny fee.  The last test reveals the fact that over a week the number of these incoming parcels dropped from fifty-four thousand, prior to the introduction of the fee, to thirty-nine thousand a few weeks ago.  That is a substantial decline.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  I have not the figures for the previous returns before me, but you may take it that that decrease is gradual.  Some twelve or eighteen months ago we introduced the system of cash on delivery for parcels and we used in the interval all our resources to popularise this measure.  We were then convinced, and we have not changed our viewpoint in the interval, that great use could be made of this system here.  We are satisfied that it has proved a most valuable medium in many foreign countries with profit to <Col N="2070" /> the State.  Deputies here must have noticed that in France and Switzerland it is equally so, but it has not made very substantial progress here. I cannot explain the reason.  This system and, in fact, the Post Office, may be made the commercial traveller for the public through this medium. That is how it worked elsewhere.  We have filled the Press and bombarded manufacturers and traders with literature in the hope that this cash-on-delivery system would take firm root, but it has not worked up to expectations, or anything like them.  Meantime the Minister for Finance has been good enough to permit us to continue the system for some time longer and it may pick up in the meantime.  We have introduced a system whereby dutiable parcels between this country and Great Britain or <i>vice versa</i> may have all the charges paid for in advance.  The only exception to this in our case is where the sixpenny fee is specially collected. This pre-payment will, in all probability, be availed of generally by the public.  It is a facility which is worty of note.  During the year we have made it a point to expedite mail trains everywhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is.  It would have been difficult to compel the railway companies until quite recently to expedite their services.  Latterly, however, we have concluded that the pre-war speed should be reverted to and I am glad to say that the railway companies have responded.  Everywhere our mail train services have gone back to pre-war standards and that, of course, is a pretty substantial advantage to the travelling public who avail of these trains.  Some months ago we discontinued the night packet mail.  In my previous statement I pointed out that we intended to discontinue the day packet.  The cross-Channel service cost something like £21,000.  Its discontinuance was under consideration prior to our time, but our predecessors were not quite satisfied that the services would not suffer disimprovement.  We <Col N="2071" /> have withdrawn our staffs from both services and concentrated our entire sorting work locally and without any disimprovement whatever.  We have, as a matter of fact, been able to improve the Dublin service in some important respects.  By the abolition of the packet we have saved a sum of £21,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get a definite case.  My opinion is that it has not.  During the war, Post Office buildings in this country were not very closely attended to and the Post Office had expanded beyond their facilities. We are now taking steps to see that accommodation shall be improved in many of the important centres like Ballina, Bantry, Dun Laoghaire, Dundalk, Dungarvan, Ennis, Enniscorthy, and a number of other places.  This will necessitate, in many cases, an extension of the offices.  We have opened a big central sorting office at Westland Row.  This is a departure which we had looked forward to for some years.  We have concentrated there the main Dublin sorting work, and, later on, we hope to associate with that place and confine in it the entire work of Dublin, which will include both letters and parcels.  We have, so far, only erected there a temporary building, but plans are being secured for the erection of a sufficiently commodious building&mdash;a building capable of housing a considerable staff and doing the entire work of the Capital. Likewise, we have proceeded to reerect the General Post Office.  Shops are being put up on the Henry Street side, an arcade is being provided for between Henry Street and La Scala Theatre, and, between all these shops, I think the building will cost very little to the State.  At any rate, the revenue from the shops will more than pay the interest on the cost of the entire structure.  We are erecting the building <Col N="2072" /> in sections.  That has already been explained by Deputy Professor O'Sullivan. We are proceeding with the front section in order to relieve Post Office congestion in the centre of the town.  Later on, we hope to get along with the second stage, and then the final one.  It is intended that this Post Office shall accommodate anything up to 3,000 officials.  We will there concentrate our entire headquarter staffs and also the telegraph section, which is now located in the out-of-the-way office at Amiens Street, which is responsible for very considerable delay in the transaction of telegraphic business. The telegraph side of our business is a declining quantity.  Telephones are taking its place.  It is a dying service.  In recent years we have found that the transmission of a shilling telegram&mdash;we did not take into consideration any special delivery fee &mdash;costs two shillings.  In other words, the individual pays one shilling and the State pays another.  It is a very costly service and it is out of date; nevertheless, it is essential for the time being.</P>

      <P>The only development in the telegraph way in recent times is the introduction of a high-speed instrument called the &ldquo;teletype.&rdquo;  This is quite a recent invention.  It has resulted in pretty substantial staff saving, but nevertheless, it will go only a very short way towards the removal of the loss to which I have referred. We suffered in this country from a shortage of wires and a shortage of means of communication, and consequent heavy delay in recent times, but the termination of a number of wires by cable companies who, unfortunately, decided to transmit their work by submarine cable from Valentia to Cornwall, because of the Irregular campaign, freed a considerable number of wires, which we have been able to utilise for speeding up telegraphic work.</P>

      <P>The people are getting sense.  They are sending fewer telegrams. People learn to economise when they have to pay.  In regard to telephones, we have engaged in a general extension of this service.  We have increased our engineering staff considerably during the past twelve months, believing that the future of communications lies largely in this development. We have begun by supplementing the main channels&mdash;those channels between Dublin and the North and Dublin and the other important points in the country.  We have increased telephone trunks to these points, in some cases, by 100 per cent. Following on that increase, we have proceeded to open a number of exchanges. Fifty-six have been opened during the past twelve months.  Fifty-six telephone exchanges is a very large number, considering the number we had here at the time we took over the service.  As a matter of fact, it practically represents 100 per cent. in one year alone, and that will give the Deputies some idea of the rate of development, and also an indication of the time it will take us to lay down a decent system here&mdash;a system somewhat akin to what one finds in countries like Denmark and Scandinavia.  For the information of Deputies, it may be well to mention some of the places where exchanges are being opened, or have been opened&mdash; Macroom, Trim, Dingle, Kanturk, Ardee, Dunlavin, Tullow, Moate, Coolock, Foynes, Dunleer, Rathdrum, Ballybunion.  Twenty further exchanges are on the point of being opened.  These include places like Skibbereen, Dunmanway, Clonakilty, Bantry, Glengariff, Callan, and Thomastown.  In addition to these, authority has been received for new <Col N="2074" /> exchanges at Bailieboro', Kingscourt, Cootehill, Castlepollard, Convoy, Askeaton, Drumcollogher, Crusheen, Bridgetown, Templetuohy, Borrisokane, Manorhamilton, Hollyford, Cappawhite, Pallasgreen, Monaveigh.  In 51 other centres where there are not the necessary number of subscribers for exchanges, we have introduced telephone call offices.  We have also installed the telephone during the past twelve months in 218 Gárda Síochána stations, and a further 67 extensions are contemplated.  In order to facilitate life-saving and communication with ships, we have introduced the telephone to a great number of coastguard stations, and, finally, we have succumbed to the pressure of the Farmers' Party and have provided 'phones to a big number of creameries.  I think the creamery people are quite satisfied with the progress we are making in this direction.  At least, they have so expressed themselves.</P>
      <P>During the year, fifty-seven miles of underground cable was laid and 2,537 miles of single wire.  We are developing the 'phones very rapidly in the Connacht direction.  We intend, within the next twelve months, to take in Roscommon, Castlerea, Ballyhaunis, Claremorris, Tuam, Castlebar, Westport, Ballina, Carrick-on-Shannon, Boyle, Ballaghadereen, Bundoran&mdash; which, by the way, should have been telephonically connected many years ago, being an important seaside resort &mdash;Ballyshannon, Donegal, Muine Beag, Kinsale, Cahirciveen, and other places. A few of these are fishing ports.  We are introducing the automatic system into Dublin and Cork.  Its installation is slow, but that may be all the better. It is an expensive experiment&mdash;it may be said to be an experiment still&mdash;but nevertheless we cannot lag behind and we have decided to introduce it at one Dublin centre and in one Cork centre. I expect it will be in working order in about twelve months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us the number of telephone subscribers to-day and the number twelve months ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>The number would have increased within the past twelve <Col N="2075" /> months by roughly 2,500&mdash;from about 20,000 to 22,500.  A great number have fallen away or declared off in the interval&mdash;mainly military connections &mdash;which would show a more substantial increase in the commercial direction. Our difficulty at the moment is to meet the requirements of the public. Our technical staff is not able to satisfy their demand, and I do not see any hope of expediting matters, for the reason that there are no more technical men available in the country&mdash;I mean technical men who are able to do this particular class of work.  We have explored every avenue for further assistance, but pretty much in vain.</P>
      <P>Practically all the channels of admission to the Post Office are through open competitive examination, the only exceptions being auxiliary postmen, labourers, sub-post office people, and the messenger class in certain districts where it has not been found possible to hold examinations. With these exceptions the entrance to every department of this service is through open competition.</P>
      <P>A statement as to the Savings Bank may not be inopportune.  At the end of December, 1923, we had a balance in the Savings Bank amounting to £1,596,000.  The balance due to depositors in December last was £2,079,000. Withdrawals during the past year were substantial, but in latter months withdrawals have very appreciably declined, while the deposits have moved very much in the other direction, indicating an increase of confidence.</P>
      <P>Savings Certificates accounted for £923,000 during the year ending 31st March, 1924.  Up to the 31st March, 1925, these have reached a figure of £1,175,000.  The increase during the financial year 1924-25 fell substantially short of the initial twelve months, but as in the Post Office Savings Bank, a rather welcome change has come about and during the past two or three months money is again pouring into Savings Certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to our stores and factory, Deputies are probably aware that our factory is the centre for Post Office repairs and the manufacture of a great number of items formerly made in <Col N="2076" /> Great Britain.  On 1st April, 1924, we employed at the factory 126 hands. Twelve months later we employed 250. In addition to repairs and the smaller Post Office essentials, we are now making there practically everything connected with telephones.  Switchboards, for instance, are very intricate instruments and very costly.  We find that we are able to make these switchboards much cheaper than we could buy them abroad.  We are making practically everything that we require in the telephone way in our factory now, and in that way we are laying the foundations of a technical industry that might be of some assistance to other industries at a later stage.  We are also training in that factory a number of people who will in time help to lay the foundations of other key industries, and we have made it known that should any of these industries be started here we are prepared to facilitate those who desire to start them by transferring that particular part of the staff and giving any advice that we can impart.  In other words, we are utilising this factory without any cost to the State for the laying of highly-important technical foundations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be better to discuss that point later on rather than now.  Of the £196,000 expended on stores, £153,000 was spent on Irish manufactured articles; £67,000 on British manufactured articles; £35,000 on articles produced in other countries. It will therefore be seen that a very considerable part of our expenditure was on home-produced articles.  We are now importing raw wood for poles which are being used very extensively in the country because of the replacements for telegraph and telephone work and creosoting them here.  That is a recent development.</P>
      <P>Last year, I think it was, Deputy Johnson raised the question of unemployment insurance and its application to auxiliary postmen.  This matter has been gone into pretty fully in the interval and we find that we cannot apply unemployment insurance to these auxiliaries.  Auxiliary postmen work every second day.  No alteration in that rule has been found possible and, as the Deputy well knows, the Act could not operate in cases of the kind. I see no prospect of meeting the Deputy's wishes.

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister could give some information on these lines?  He may possibly have given it, but I did not take a note of it. Can he allocate the losses or gains on the several departments?  In one or two instances the Minister gave certain figures as the loss on a particular department.  I wonder could he give us off-hand the losses or gains on, say, the letter post, parcel post, telegraphs or telephones?  I think these would cover the main departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I could give that information.  We have twelve or fourteen services and they are all interlaced.  In the case of the telephones, I can say that our profit for last year was £17,000.  It was the first time we enjoyed the advantage of a profit.  In the case of telegrams, for the twelve months, we lost something over £200,000.  It would be impossible to say what we lost in the case of parcels or letters, for the reason that so many other services are mixed up with them.  It would require a great amount of labour to sort them out and come to anything like a satisfactory conclusion as to whether a particular part of the mail service was a profit or a loss, beyond the fact that we are losing very heavily on our mail section.</P>

The telegraph revenue for last year&mdash;I have not the figures here because we are not dealing with a section of the revenue; we are dealing with the whole services&mdash;amounted to something in the neighbourhood of £200,000.  The expenditure exceeded £400,000; it was something like £420,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would it be possible for the Minister to make an estimate, as he has done in regard to letters, of the number of telegrams which may be allocated to business, say, to distributive business, to private inquiry, and to betting telegrams, and say whether it is possible to put an extra charge on the last-named?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is probably the most commercial branch of the Government service that we have. In fact, it is the only commercially-worked portion of Government Departments. I would like consequently to take the things as a whole and make some few criticisms on the general working of the concern.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in dealing with the matter is rather pessimistic of ever being able to turn the Post Office into a Department that will pay its own way, and I rather think that he lays it down that the Post Office service can only be carried on at the cost of the State.  That seems to me a rather bad outlook.  In other words, a Department of the importance of the <Col N="2081" /> Post Office, representing an expenditure, largely in wages and material and that sort of thing, of £2,551,540, seems to me to be a public service that ought to be made at all events self-supporting. Of course, one recognises the difficulty that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is up against owing to the scattered nature of the population he has to deal with.  He told us that a reduction in the 2d. post is impracticable, that it would cost a great deal of money to do it.  I agree that a reduction to 1½. would not be of any use.  At the same time, I think that when he is dealing with what I might call local deliveries he will lose revenue by maintaining the 2d. post, and I would ask him whether he would consider that he would possibly help himself and certainly help the country if he would deal with inland letters at the 1d. rate.  At present it seems to me that an immense amount of local correspondence is being delivered by hand simply because the 2d. is too high a charge for people who live near each other to pay.  I put it to the Minister this way: Suppose there is a business concern that has a fair number of letters to be delivered within a circumscribed area, at 2d. for each of these letters it would pay them to put a boy on for no other purpose than to deliver them.  There would be a more prompt delivery, and it would very much more than pay for the cost of the boy.  Taking the postal service as a whole, 2d. is not unreasonable, but for local services it is too high. As regards the extension of the telephones, I would like to say, as having some experience in the matter, that the Minister's attitude is of great importance to the country as a whole, and his recognition of the vital need of improving and extending that service will, I think, be of incalculable advantage to the country.  That there has been an improvement, I for one acknowledge, but that there is great room for more improvement I also maintain. As regards the telegraph service, I think in every country it is carried on practically at a loss.  At the same time until the telephone service is very much extended and is more efficient, <Col N="2082" /> I do not see that it can be done away with or that the facilities can be curtailed.</P>
      <P>As this is a commercial proposition, I would like to raise a question regarding a matter which is not confined to this Department, but is general all over the Government service.  I maintain that bonuses on salaries ought now to be discontinued.  We have arrived at a time when I think that should be taken into serious consideration, for this reason: the bonus additions to salaries were made during the war, and for the purpose of meeting a very abnormal situation.  It was never contemplated that this system would be extended beyond the period for which it was designed as an emergency measure, and a very imperfect emergency measure at that, but the best that could be devised at the time. It has now been carried on for a very considerable time after the cause of that state of affairs has ceased to exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the cause?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised at Deputy Davin asking that, because he knows perfectly well what it was. It was owing to the world war and the sudden inflation of prices during the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy contend that we have emerged to pre-war prices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not contending any such thing, as Deputy Davin knows perfectly well.  I am maintaining that the object and the reason for the bonus have now disappeared.  It is desirable that the whole condition of affairs should be reviewed, and it should be considered whether the sudden and severe fluctuations in prices are to continue. But I do think that the matter ought to be taken into consideration with a view to abolishing a condition of affairs which, I think, is not natural, in which a man gets a salary and on top of that a fluctuating sum on account of the cost of living. Under that bonus system you are segregating and separating a class of the community, which is made no better off and no worse off by the alterations <Col N="2083" /> in prices, which they have as much to do with as other members of the community who do not get bonus and do not get fluctuating salaries.  At all events, I raise this question on this Vote because, as I say, I think the Post Office is the one and only commercially-worked Department in the Government service.  I say that that system is not now in operation generally amongst the trading community as a whole, and there is no reason why it should apply to Government servants any more than to men in an ordinary commercial undertaking.  It is a case of cause and effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like strikes any more than I think Deputy Johnson likes strikes.  I do not look forward to them; but if strikes are considered necessary by two sensible bodies of men opposed to each other, and if no other way out of the difficulty is to be found, I see no way of preventing strikes, except the ordinary commonsense way of the two sides settling any difference that may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the method of adjustment, in my judgment; it has nothing whatever to do with strikes at all.  That is my view, for what it is worth.  I do not expect every Deputy to agree with me.  I raise the question for consideration.  If in their wisdom the House consider that there is nothing in the contention, I am quite willing to be in a minority, as I often am.  I would like to congratulate the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on the very clear and definite statement he has made.  I would like him to consider the proposition that has been put forward by Deputy Johnson to furnish his accounts, as far as he can do so, in the ordinary way of profit and loss.  I think it would be of great assistance in an undertaking of this kind if it could be shown that certain receipts are from certain branches of <Col N="2084" /> the Department, and what the payments were on account of.  An account in that form would be very useful and helpful for comparison from year to year.  You have the usual Government formula of estimating expenditure in these accounts, but you have no estimate of receipts as against the expenditure. That is really the ordinary Governmental form, but if we could have opposite the big Departments, of which there are only four or five, as you have in a commercial concern, details of receipts and expenditure, it would be much better.  You could have telegraphs receipts on one side and expenditure on the other for each department.  I do not say that that is essential, but naturally, being here under the very uncertain title of &ldquo;Business man,&rdquo; I advocate the adoption where possible, even in Government circles, of business procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be nothing in it; but, at all events, we are more accustomed to dealing with things in that way.  I congratulate the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on what I think has been a satisfactory year's work.  There is one point which, I think, Deputy Johnson will raise later on and I would like to be in the field before him.  I also congratulate the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in his vision as to what the Post Office should do in connection with private enterprise.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs finds himself in the position of desiring to avoid the import of certain telegraphic and telephonic instruments.  He has established a department for the manufacture of those articles and he has proved that they can be made in this country as cheaply as they can be imported. On the other hand he says that, owing to his action, private enterprise may start an industry for the making of instruments which, I take it, he means would be exclusive of this.  I venture to suggest it would be on a much larger scale and that the supplying of the Post Office would only be incidental to a larger business on technical lines.  I think the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would be wrong if he continued to manufacture on his own.  It would be the State competing with private industry, and I do not think that would <Col N="2085" /> be for the good of the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <P>Yes, possibly, but their operations go outside the range of the Tramway Company.  Private enterprise cannot compete with the Government or municipal authorities in connection with the management of their business.  They could do so if they had the same facilities.  I have always maintained that the Government are not capable of carrying on commercial enterprises.  I extend that further than the Government.  I extend it to public bodies as a whole.  Without subsidy and without special assistance I am not in the least afraid of Government competition.</P>

      <P>I have received the losses for the year 1923-24.  Those were, postal losses, £403,000 approximately; telegrams, £344,000; telephones, £25,000.  Last year the losses on posts and telegraphs continued. The position of telephones was reversed. In the case of telephones and telegraphs, you have two fairly definite services.  In the case of postal services you have, perhaps, anything from twenty to thirty services worked into one under the heading postal.  It is impossible to dissect that more closely. One officer may perform forty different duties in a day's work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister certainly is entitled to be congratulated by the House upon the manner in which he has made his statement.  So far as I am concerned, I am sure I can say the Minister is at all times available to consider any proposal regarding any complaint of the users of the Post Office service and to give a sympathetic ear to any reasonable suggestions for improvement that have at any time been put forward.  I regret that the Minister, in dealing with the different items, did not deal more closely with the complaints that were made here last year with regard, especially, to irritation caused in rural areas by the charge made for the delivery of telegrams.  If <Col N="2086" /> the Minister were in a position to give the House&mdash;I think Deputy Gorey has asked for the particulars&mdash;the number of telegrams sent through the Post Office for business purposes by private individuals and, as Deputy Johnson also asked, the number of telegrams for betting information or conveying bets either to the bookies in this country or outside, one would be in a position to know how that could be dealt with. The Minister has given either two or three sets of figures.  Looking last at the telegraph side, he stated there was a loss of £51,000 firstly, and subsequently he stated there was a loss of £200,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>It is roughly £220,000. I have not the figures before me, because the Post Office profit and loss figures are not brought to light for six or eight months after the closing of the financial year.  One can only guess at what the loss may be.  I have given the figures of the loss for the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing the Minister must take into consideration in stating the actual loss in connection with the telegraph side of the service. That is that the £41,000 which he has given to the House as representing revenue for the delivery of telegrams, must be deducted from the figure of £220,000.  Therefore, the loss is as much under £200,000 as he states it is over it.  If you add the detailed figures on the loss asked for by Deputy Gorey and Deputy Johnson, one would be able to work out what would be the increase in the minimum charge, which is now 1s.  That would be necessary to eliminate this charge for delivery, which is the cause of irritation and trouble in this country.  I take it, it is generally agreed that 95 per cent. of the telegrams that are actually forwarded benefits the individual who sends a telegram and is not to the advantage <Col N="2087" /> of the person who receives it.  Looking at it from the point of view of that alone, I think it is unfair that the charge should be imposed on the receiver.  It does not confer any benefit on him.</P>
      <P>If it was necessary to eliminate the charge for delivery, I think the fairest way would be to increase the minimum charge for sending a telegram. The £41,000 would be eliminated by increasing the minimum charge from 1s. to 1s. 1d. or 1s. 2d.  I think that would be more acceptable than the present method of collecting 1s. at one end and then another 1s. at the other end, especially in the rural areas.  This matter was gone into at great length last year when complaints were made here.  I would like to hear from the Minister whether it was seriously considered in the intervening period, and if it was, the reason why it has been impossible to alter the existing system.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that 969 individuals had retired from the Post Office service under Clause 10 of the Treaty. I would be particularly anxious to find out&mdash;and I am sure it is possible to do so from the records&mdash;the average age of those who have taken advantage of that clause of the Treaty.  It seems an extraordinary number of people to have retired from a service like this. The reason I am inquiring is that I am aware that very young men have quit the service by taking advantage of Clause 10.  In some cases I heard it stated that the reason was because there did not appear to be any prospect or security for any young person to remain in the service, and that that was due to promotions through favouritism, more or less, since it was taken over by the Irish Government.  If one had the average age of the 969 officials who have retired, it would be possible to estimate how long this charge of £120,000 for pensions will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have called the Minister's attention to another matter on other occasions by corresponding.  There seems to be a tendency, and I think it is a wrong one on the part of the Post Office, to fill positions that become vacant, at the salaries or wages attached to which, especially in the country <Col N="2088" /> districts, are not up to the standard of a living wage.  I know cases where the wages of auxiliary postmen&mdash;I suppose temporary auxiliary is the designation &mdash;have been as low as 10s. 9d. and 15s. weekly.  In cases like that, I think the tendency should be to extend the area of other postmen in a district and to raise the level generally, so that the employment would be more or less full time and that the men would get a living wage.  Presumably the answer of the Minister will be that the individual who works for two or three hours is only a temporary auxiliary postman and that he has other means of employment.  I think that is a wrong way of dealing with the question.  The tendency of the Post Office authorities to continue that system is to be regretted. I know areas where postmen are getting 32s., 23s., 10s. 9d., and 15s. weekly.  I mention these cases as an illustration of what is generally happening. If the positions of two postmen drawing 15s. and 10s. weekly become vacant, I think the idea should be to increase the hours of duty, and consequently the wages, so that there would be full-time employment for two men instead of part-time employment for four men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure of that.  Your reasoning from that point of view would be quite different to mine, although I may be quite wrong. I agree with Deputy Hewat that the salaries and wages of the Post Office workers should be stabilished, so that salary and bonus should be merged.  I was glad to hear the Deputy make a suggestion of that kind to the Minister. Another question to which attention has been drawn is whether it would be possible for the Post Office authorities to take on the work of insurance in this country.  That matter was mentioned twelve months ago when the Vote for 1924-25 was being discussed. I do not know if any consideration was given to it by the Minister or by the Executive Council.  If the Minister has any ideas in that direction probably he will give the Dáil the benefit of <Col N="2089" /> them and say if there is any possibility of such a proposition being accepted by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given us some figures in connection with one service.  Practically speaking it seems that one of the figures is accurate and the other tolerably accurate.  He told the Dáil that the loss on the telegraph service was £200,000, and that he recovered for what is known as &ldquo;extra charges for delivery&rdquo; £41,000.  If he did not recover that £41,000, I take it the total loss would be £241,000.  That would mean that the telegraph service has been a loss, except in the rural districts. Evidently the rural areas have made good, and the loss of the £200,000 is within the mile limit&mdash;the magic circle.  The Minister's proposition, in other words, is that this nation is justified in losing £200,000 within this charmed circle, and that it is right to recover £41,000 from people living outside, to make it a paying business from that point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Hewat will deal with the question when he is talking again.  Deputy Hewat might have made his case, when he stood up, and not be interrupting other Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a serious suggestion I would like to make with regard to this question.  I do not think that any man of intelligence&mdash;and I am sure the Minister will rank amongst that class&mdash;would make the case that all citizens of the Saorstát, no matter where they reside, should not have the same class of service, and should not have the same facilities, and that any citizen should be denied the same facilities as his or her fellows.  But this discrimination here in the matter of charge runs quite counter to that principle. It does appear unfair that the citizen who lives inside a certain circle should have an advantage over the citizen who lives outside that circle. The nation, as a whole, is making a loss of £200,000 a year on the telegraph service. <Col N="2090" /> Of this loss every citizen bears his share.  In addition to that, the smaller number of people who use the telegraph outside the circle I have spoken of&mdash;and it is a comparatively small number&mdash;has to pay £41,000, a sum that would probably represent all the cost to the State for this service. They probably would have paid 100 per cent. for the cost of telegraph delivery. Deputy Davin, in this connection, said something that has a good deal of sense in it.  But he omitted one thing when he talked about the senders of telegrams. Nearly always the telegram is to the benefit of those who send it out, and sometimes it is of very little importance to the person who receives it. When I get one of these, and I get several of them, I have to pay 1s. for extra delivery, and I have to pay also for reply.  The sender pays 1s. and I pay another 1s.  I am quite satisfied if the Government make such an amendment as will make the telegraph service a paying proposition.  I am quite satisfied if every citizen in the community shoulders his burden or his share of that, and have a common charge for delivery to meet the cost of delivery.  There should be a common charge for delivery, that is an average rate for delivery to every receiver of a telegram, or have the charge for delivery abandoned altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, this sum of £41,000 is too small a sum on which to adopt the principle of discrimination.  Increase the sender's charge and let everybody pay equally.  If you cannot do that, increase the receiver's charge and let everybody pay equally.  If you cannot do that, take off this charge for delivery and this discrimination will have disappeared.  Personally, I may say that for the last twelve months I have paid as much as £15 myself for extra delivery on telegrams.  I was in the habit of sending a wire every Friday evening.  Now we see that there has been a loss on this service this year as so much money was not spent on this service this year as was last year.  I am one of those who have helped towards that reduction.  My arrangements are the same as those of other people.  I used to send a telegram asking to have a car to meet me at the <Col N="2091" /> station.  I send no telegram now, but the car is always there to meet me. Now a telegraph staff is kept on at the Post Office.  They are there at any rate.  They are in receipt of a salary at any rate.  It will be the same cost to the State whether they are receiving telegrams or not.  Then I cannot understand what this extra charge for telegrams is for.  What it is for I cannot say.  It cannot be justified.  The Minister has said that a motor-cyclist could take the place probably of a half-dozen telegraph messengers.  I do not suggest that a motor-cyclist should be provided in place of a half-dozen messengers.  I suggest that this delivery can be effected with the men who are there already.  This telegraph service should be carried out in a reasonably fair way.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister what has been the result of this new method of letter clearance.  He tells us that the clearance system has been put in operation here.  I would like to know what the saving has been to the State, or does it mean extra cost to the State?</P>

      <P>You told us that the previous system was that the clearing station was in London for letters posted to foreign countries and for letters coming in as well as for letters going out, but that you have transferred the clearance system to this country now. Is that right?</P>

      <P>We have transferred no clearance station.  Instead of putting foreign letters in a London bag we put letters, say for Berlin, into the Berlin bag, or whatever bag it may be. The cost is nothing extra.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hewat dealt with the question of bonuses and the cost.  I would not have dealt with this question at all were it not raised already, but when it was raised, a proper explanation was not given. The high cost of living was given as a reason.  That was right&mdash;the high cost of living, coupled with the <Col N="2092" /> prosperity of this country and coupled with the high revenues that were coming into the country for farm produce, and coupled with the great prosperity that was in the country. Now, though the cost of living to a certain extent has remained, the prosperity has not.  The prosperity has disappeared.  It is the other way about now, and it may be said that the change is from prosperity to poverty.  Nobody grumbled in those days when this bonus system was introduced first, because money was plentiful in the country, and money was coming into the country.  Money is not coming into the country now to any considerable extent.  Money is leaving it every year as is shown by our adverse Balance Sheet.  I probably have exhausted my ten minutes.</P>

      <P>In the Minister's statement he dealt with the sixpenny delivery tax on parcels, and while, generally, I am in agreement with the principle of putting a tax of sixpence on incoming parcels that have to pay the cost of delivery, I do hope that the Minister in the period since this tax was proposed has done something to review the hardship it imposes upon business houses.  When the tax was first imposed it was intended to put some kind of a stay upon the tendency throughout the country to &ldquo;shopping by post&rdquo; from across the water.  People in this country purchased goods through the advertisements in papers like the &ldquo;Daily Mail&rdquo; that, unfortunately, circulate largely throughout Ireland.  This shopping is done with London houses to the disadvantage of local business houses.  Those houses in London which, of course, have a huge population of eight and a half millions at their doors, were able to purchase and supply goods at prices somewhat less than the business houses in Dublin which had a smaller purchasing public.  These houses in Dublin have not only a smaller purchasing public but higher overhead charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister points out that this delivery charge really had a dual purpose: first, to help to defray the cost of delivery, on which we learn there is a loss, and, secondly, to put a stay <Col N="2093" /> upon this purchasing of goods from shops outside the country.  I learned from the Minister's statement to-night that this tax has caused a decrease in the number of incoming parcels from 54,000 to 39,000 per week.  I am entirely in approval of the Minister's policy and with his purpose in imposing this delivery charge.  But it imposes a very great hardship upon a number of business houses.  In Ireland, rather of necessity, the policy is to get many articles not manufactured in the country and not available in the country from across the water.  These articles are sold at fixed prices.  This is an imposition that cannot be passed on to the customers, and, consequently, the business houses in the city are forced to bear the extra burden, which is really unfair.  Were it possible to get these goods manufactured in Ireland, there would be no case whatever for asking for reconsideration of the matter.  But unfortunately in this country we are not in a position to produce all the articles and goods we require, and the business houses here are compelled to import many of them from across the water.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I would urge that the Minister might find some means for casing this burden upon the business houses.  The business houses should have some consideration given to them, and I do hope that the Minister will find some way, say, through the establishment of a <i>poste restante</i> for business houses by means of which they can clear their parcels in bulk through a general clearing house and so save them from this tax.  Most of the goods imported are purchased through the advertisements in the big London dailies, and consist principally of drapery goods, mostly women's clothing. The new import duty on these goods of 15 per cent. has put a stay to that trade to the advantage of the business houses in Dublin, which deserve consideration, seeing that they have to pay in Dublin in the way of overhead charges heavy rates and rates of wages which are higher than those across the water.  The decrease from 54,000 to 39,000 in these imports may have been due to the new duties.  During the <Col N="2094" /> Minister's statement, I put a question asking if the decrease was due to the tax of 15 per cent.  I hope the Minister has not said his last word on this, and that he will do something for business houses who, not from choice but by necessity, are compelled to import goods, articles that have to be sold at a fixed price to meet individual orders. These will not bear a tax of 6d.  I hope the Minister, before this matter is concluded, will review the question, and that some way will be found to enable these business houses to get a big number of parcels in each day, and to clear at a fixed charge in bulk.  It would be a great relief to these houses which, owing to the conditions in the country, find it difficult to carry on their business at a profit.  That is a statement which cannot be contradicted.  Any person who has examined the balance sheets of the big houses in Dublin, owned by limited liability companies, will see that their profits during the past year have been reduced to vanishing point, and some relief in the incidence of these duties would be a considerable help to them in enabling them to carry on their business until the country can produce in a greater measure the article required.  I hope some revision will be made in favour of the business community.</P>
