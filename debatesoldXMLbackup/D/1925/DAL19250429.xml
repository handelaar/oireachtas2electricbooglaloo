      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state on what ground Mr. William Larkin, Pension Register No. 1928, of Drumcollogher, Co.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that the Registrar-General has recently notified Superintendent-Registrars of Births, Deaths and Marriages that certificates issued by them will no longer be accepted for passport purposes, and that certificates must be obtained from the General Register Office, and whether, in view of the serious loss of fees to the Superintendent-Registrars and the inconvenience to applicants which will result from the new arrangements, he will have the matter reconsidered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular work is work of an exceptional character. <Col N="457" /> and it arises from the fact that the American consular authorities demand two certificates of birth from all intending emigrants.  As a result of this unexpected demand, there is a very great increase in the applications for these certificates.  If these Superintendent Registrars were entitled to receive all the fees in connection with the giving of these certificates, it would mean an additional increase in their salary of about £290 a year.  It was obviously never intended that the remuneration of these highly-paid officials should increase to that extent. It is obviously a sum to be returned to the Central Fund, which is the fund which has to bear all the necessary expense in connection with the granting of these certificates.</P>

    <P> I do not propose to say anything, at this stage, in reference to the Vote, but I would like to repeat a remark which I made last year, at the opening of the consideration of Estimates.  I think that Deputies should recognise that no Minister, or Parliamentary Secretary, who may be defending an Estimate, can possibly be aware of all the points of detail that may be raised.  Consequently, if points that have not previously been brought to notice, either by way of parliamentary question or of previous discussion, are raised, it is unlikely that they can be satisfactorily dealt with in reply, and the discussion on the Estimates will not be so satisfactory as it would if members gave notice that they wished to raise points of detail, or if in the discussion they confined themselves to matters of general interest, inasmuch as the Minister, or Parliamentary Secretary, defending the Estimates, may be conversant with them and able to answer.</P>
    <P>I remember on the first Vote last year&mdash;I think it was the Public Works Vote&mdash;I was asked about a number of matters which were really points of detail and which, in fact, I never heard of before and could not be expected to have knowledge of, and consequently the discussion was not such as would inform or help the Dáil in coming to a decision to vote the money.  As we are now about to take the estimates up, I think it would be a desirable practice if any Deputy who wishes to raise a matter of detail wrote to the Minister, or to the Department concerned, intimating his intention of doing so.  Then when he raised the matter, he would be able to get a complete reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it might shorten the discussion, to some extent, if I gave a brief resume of the principal points on which the Estimates presented this year differ from those presented last year, especially by way of increase.  In doing so, I think I am more or less following the desire expressed from several quarters of the House that such an explanation might be of some use in subsequent discussion.  Taking the different sub-heads in Vote 11, we have sub-head (a), that is, the &ldquo;Purchase of Sites and Buildings,&rdquo; for which a Vote is asked of £30,000, an increase of £20,000 on last year.  This, as you can easily gather if you look at the sub-head (b), will be mainly for the purchase of sites for Civic Guard barracks.  In all, it is calculated that 820 barracks will be required for the Gárda.  Of that number there are at present 822 acquired, but in about 330 cases there are no premises acquired, or else the accommodation is altogether insufficient and not satisfactory.  It is with a view to meet that that it will be necessary to purchase sites, and the Estimate for the present year is £30,000.</P>
      <P>Coming to sub-head (b)&mdash;&ldquo;New Works, Alterations and Additions&rdquo;&mdash; you have, as a first item, the re-vote of £3,300 from the Vote of last year, in connection with the supply of electric light from the city main to the Governor-General's premises.  The situation at present is that the Governor-General's residence is partly lighted by gas and partly by electricity. In the case of electricity, the plant is on the premises and is worked by a gas engine.  Now, the proposal is to lay a main up from Parkgate Street, North Circular Road, to the Park main road, and then branch off into the Governor-General's residence. It is calculated in that way that we will be able to make an annual saving of about £500 a year.  When it is laid it will be possible to use it in the future for the extension of the electric lighting system to the Park in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Vote for the Oireachtas is purely provisional, that is, we put down £5,000 in connection with some works <Col N="461" /> which will have to be undertaken in Leinster House for the use of the Seanad and other requirements.</P>
    <P>Coming to the Revenue Department, &ldquo;Dublin Customs House partial Reconstruction,&rdquo; it is proposed to spend altogether in restoring the framework of the Customs House, that is, the four portions of the Custom House that look towards the four corners, north, south, east and west, leaving the southern portion of the courtyard undisturbed, existing walls remaining, a sum of £76,000.  This year about £30,000 is to be spent.  For office space we are gaining about 50,000 square feet.  For an ordinary house, such as you have in the Land Commission in Merrion Street, the space is 2,000 square feet.  At present we have various private houses scattered over the residential districts, such as Upper Mount Street.  By restoring the Customs House to the limited extent I have indicated we will be able to concentrate the offices, bringing them close together, and making better provision for carrying out the work and getting rid of the scattered houses.</P>
    <P>In the case of a Vote for Cork City, &ldquo;Inland Revenue,&rdquo; at present we have to rent premises.  They are not sufficient and we will have to rent more. That will be a rental of about £700 a year.  We think it is better to get a site and build at a cost of £7,500, and in that way save a rent of £600 or £700 a year.</P>
    <P>In the Depôt at the Phoenix Park, under the Department of Justice, you have gas at present, and the cost of supplying electric light under the Estimate is £2,800, which includes the cost of a cable from the Corporation supply.  That would be the most suitable way of lighting offices like the Depôt.  We also expect it will be more economical.  By far the greater number of items under this particular Vote this year is the provision of Gárda Síochána barracks.  There are about 330 cases to be met altogether.  This year we propose to make a start and go on with about 120 in various counties. Of the 850 barracks required, in the majority of these 330 cases you will have to build or restore the old R.I.C. barracks.  The idea is, as far as <Col N="462" /> possible, that the most urgent cases, as indicated to us by the Minister for Justice, will be gone on with, that is, if we can come to an arrangement about the site, and so on, The estimate of the total cost will be almost £200,000.  We calculate to spend this year £86,000, according to the urgency of the particular cases in each county. You will notice also in this particular Vote that if we take the total Vote for any barrack that there is a difference between the amount to be spent this year and the proportion we expect to have to give for next year.  By that time we expect to be able to deal with the different barracks&mdash;I was going to say attack the different barracks, but it might not be a happy expression.  In a good many cases the provision of suitable barracks in these 330 cases can be dealt with in the most economic and suitable way by getting the old R.I.C. barracks restored.  In some cases the owners are willing, if they receive compensation, to re-build and then let them to us.  In other cases the owners prefer we should purchase from them the site, ruins, and claim for compensation.</P>
    <P>There is another point, and it is a very little one; that is that in connection with County Cork you have Rathmore given.  I thought that that was another instance of the well-known acquisitiveness of the people of Cork, but I understand it is only a misprint. It is not Rathmore, which is one of the most loyal districts in County Kerry, but it is Rathduff, which is in the County of Cork.  The Cork people, therefore, are free from any blame in the matter.  Then there are minor works, coming to the end of the list, of Civic Guard Barracks, £10,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they are not.  There is simply a little more space between County Wicklow and the <Col N="463" /> rest of the Estimates.  These are simply minor works that we expect will be called for; they are not maintenance works, but works, say, under a cost of £1,000, that may have to be undertaken in the various Civic Guard barracks during the year, for instance, an existing station that we do not exactly re-build but that we lease.  The increase of the expenditure of £1,500 on the Dublin Metropolitan Police District Courts is due largely to the increased jurisdiction of these courts, and to the necessity for finding proper accommodation. The total estimate for the Four Courts is £61,000.  You will notice that a certain amount was spent last year and is included in this Estimate. That is mainly to clear the space, removing certain dangerous portions, and so on.  We intend to build the two pavilions&mdash;that is, those two portions of the Four Courts whose gables, so to speak, abut on the Liffey, and to roof over the portion round the dome.  That will cost £61,000 altogether, and we expect to be able to spend £32,000 this year.  We are not proposing in this Estimate, either for this year or next year, to rebuild the connecting portion between the two pavilions and the central main block of buildings which is concentrated around the dome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure whether the Deputy has made quite clear what is in my mind.  Is the £5,500 included in this Estimate money that has been spent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so. In connection with the Department of Lands and Agriculture, the offices in Merrion Street are partly lit by gas and partly by electricity.  From the point of view of cleanliness, the proper keeping of the documents, and the working and amenities of the offices, it is thought better to have electric light all through.  A sum of £50,000 is down for the building of National schools. This, it will easily be understood, is only an estimate, and it is meant to cover the more urgent things where, through lack of accommodation, sanitation, or for other reasons, it is necessary to go on with the work this year. <Col N="464" /> The normal procedure is that the Government finds two-thirds of the amount; one-third has to be subscribed locally.  In that case the manager carries out the work.  But there is a number of cases, especially in necessitous areas, where the Government may find more than two-thirds, and in these cases the Board carries out the work. You will easily recognise that the carrying out of the work in normal circumstances is not a matter for the Board but for the manager, and this must in certain instances, be the case.  It is founded, so to speak, on past experience.  The only point I wish to make about the vested schools is that we are limited by statute to a grant of £100 in each particular case.  The necessity for the extension of the National Library at the back of the School of Art was, I think, explained last year.  For several years the Trustees of the National Library have been complaining about the great congestion.  Last year it was decided that this work would be undertaken.  A certain portion of the work was actually done before the 31st March.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No, in connection with teachers' residences.  It is a statutory limitation, and we cannot go beyond it.  Coming to the Department of Defence, the question of the Michael Collins Barracks, in Cork, was discussed last year.  The next item is the provision of a military hospital for Cork.  There is no proper provision for surgical cases in the Southern Command, and it is to meet that particular lack that it is proposed to restore the military hospital in <Col N="465" /> Cork.  At present the only military hospital they have is at Haulbowline, and from every point of view that is not a suitable situation.  The restoration of the old military hospital was considered the best and most economical way of dealing with this matter. The expenditure of £8,500 on Griffith Barracks is due to the fact that that barracks is now to be the General Headquarters; Army Finance and the Secretariat are to be housed there.  The heating at present is altogether unsatisfactory, and it has been proposed to make provision for permanent heating.  The estimate for the Limerick Barracks is to provide roofs, floors, stairs, doors, windows, and so on, to restore the barracks so that they can be used when the concentration of the troops, which is envisaged by the heads of the Army, is carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal item in connection with the Post Office is the rebuilding of what was known as the General Post Office.  Three different portions are to be built, the front facing Henry Street, the front, or central, block, and the block at the back of the courtyard.  So far as the Henry Street facing is concerned, the idea is that there will be an arcade between Henry Street and Prince's Street, that the lower portion between that arcade and the corner of O'Connell Street will be taken up with shops, which will be leased, and arrangements have been made for leasing. A pretty considerable amount of money will actually come in in connection with this leasing.  Then we propose to build, as I say, on Henry Street, the front block that is facing O'Connell Street and the other block.  That would provide accommodation for the Secretariat and, to a certain extent, for the clerical branches of the service.  Of course, a Post Office in the ordinary sense is included in the building.  It is probably not the busiest Post Office in Dublin by any means; that would be the one in College Green.  But the question of building the central telegraph office is not included in the Estimates, either for this year, or in the total estimate that is to cover this year and next year.  In connection with the Cork Post Office the space is very cramped, and this proposal is not so <Col N="466" /> much an enlargement as a re-accommodation, so as to make the most use of the space at our disposal and relieve the congestion that undoubtedly gave justifiable grounds for complaint.  The small sum for the Fisheries Office is due to the fact that unless we deal with it the walls, and also the roof, may fall. There is a small provision for workshops in Dublin Castle.  The old stables there are used now as a kind of chance stores for furniture.  It was found that if an effort were made to convert these into offices it would be altogether too expensive and it would not repay the conversion.  It was found that with an expenditure of £500 it would be possible to convert the stables into suitable workshops and at the same time to provide better storage for furniture. For Stephen's Green there is £1,000 provided.  Of that £500 is for this year and £500 for next year.  That is for the purpose of building two hot-houses in Stephen's Green Park.  Probably most of the Deputies may have noticed that for a number of years past there has been a tendency to have a much better show of flowers in Stephen's Green than heretofore.  I think the citizens of Dublin take more pleasure in the Park than they did before.  It may surprise the bulk of Deputies to know that the flowers that are put into Stephen's Green are produced and propagated in Stephen's Green itself, and that as a park it makes one of the best shows anywhere.  The London parks, I understand, have to purchase or get from exhibitors most of their flowers. In the case of Stephen's Green the flowers are produced there in an extremely difficult and cramped position. Probably most of the Deputies have not seen where the hothouses are.  The idea in the past was to conceal them as much as possible.  The idea now is to give a further opportunity for better expansion, and I am sure nobody will grudge that to the citizens of Dublin.</P>
    <P>At present the water supply for the Phoenix Park is very costly and unsatisfactory. The pressure is not sufficient to supply the important houses in the Park, and consequently the pump has to be used, and that costs a great amount annually.  The whole system leads to considerable waste of water as <Col N="467" /> well.  The idea now is to build a water tower under what was known as the Under-Secretary's Lodge.  At night when there will not be so much demand for water, this tank can be filled and the important houses in the Park can be supplied from that during the day. There will be also a necessity for laying down pipes and taking up the old pipes.  The total cost is estimated at £3,000.  Most of that sum will be spent this year.</P>
    <P>I now come to Howth Harbour.  The fishing in Howth Harbour, so far as landing and curing is concerned, is confined practically to the end of the Western Pier.  There the space is very confined.  Supposing there is a considerable catch, a portion of the catch is sent off immediately by train to the different quarters, and a portion is freshly cured on the spot.  Now, when a catch comes in, the unloading takes place.  You have twenty or thirty lorries, or more, continually going along the quay, and they have to manoeuvre, turn, and bring up empty cases, and wait until the cases are filled and then bring away the filled cases.  In addition to that, you have about 40 men and 50 women working there curing. It is thought that the space is altogether too confined.  It does not give a fair chance to Howth Harbour as a fishing centre.  The suggestion is that we do away with the existing coastguard station there, or that we level part of it to the level of the ordinary wharf.  That would provide much greater space for conducting the fishing business.  In addition, we intend to convert some of the coastguard station into a restaurant and a lavatory for the women working on the spot.  The total cost is about £2,500.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is: there may be competition for that space.  It may be allocated to a particular curer, as the office may be allocated.  If there is to be merely an open space, then the allocation of that space is out of your hands and I cannot expect you to answer that question, but if there is to be any segregation of any part of that space by any structural alterations I would expect that there would be a definite purpose in mind.  With respect to the offices, I expect they will be allocated on some basis of letting, allocation for particular merchants who are curing&mdash;&ldquo;splitters,&rdquo; as they call them, or packers.  I want to know whether this is to be a kind of public affair, or is it to be a building set apart by letting to particular curers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The curers will use the open space.  The offices will be let to individuals.  However, that is a matter mainly for the Minister for Fisheries and I would not care to answer in that respect.  We are simply dealing with the provision of space for the industry at present.  There is in <Col N="469" /> addition this year £10,000 asked for in connection with urgent and unforeseen works.  That is not an unreasonable demand considering the large number of Civic Guard barracks that we may have to deal with.  There may be barracks not included to be added, and these may require to be dealt with urgently during the year.</P>
      <P>On the question of maintenance, in most of these cases where there is a difference between the amount asked for this year and last year it is mainly a question of casual variation, a question, for instance, in the case of public buildings where internal painting or external painting is to be done. Roughly speaking, external painting is done every four years and internal painting every eight years.  In other cases it is rather explainable by the expanding nature of the department, by changes which take place when a department is moved from one place to another, say, out of Government Buildings from the old College of Science, and so on to another building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to the amount of difference, a certain number of these may call for a few remarks.  In some cases it is purely a casual variation that will occur from year to year.  In some cases the estimate is smaller than it was last year, and in other cases it is larger. The Revenue Department is larger by £3,000.  Whether we like it or not, this is an expanding department and entails more expense in the upkeep.  The considerable decrease in the case of the Gárda Síochána is casual, due to the expense of things like painting.  In the case of the Botanic Gardens, the increase is due to the muffing of the glass houses, the renewing of defective floors and the provision of a new weighing machine, the present one having gone out of use.  On page 52, in the case of Stephen's Green, there is a slight increase. That is due to the fact that under the management of Stephen's Green you have included a number of gardens taken on when various public buildings were taken over.  The old mowing machine has served its day, and it is considered cheaper now to get a new motor mowing machine.  It is more efficient and more economical.  There <Col N="470" /> are two other matters that call for mention&mdash;sub-heads (J) and (JJ).  (J) is, to a certain extent, a simpler matter. It is £25,000.  It is not a loan; it is a grant.  At all events, it is something for the farmer.  A number of drainage districts will be taken in hands this year in order to get them back to their proper state of maintenance.  They have been allowed to get out of control. £3,000,000 has been spent on arterial drainage.  In most cases, however, so far as the outward effect is concerned, the result is very nearly as bad as it was before the drainage work was undertaken.  That is due to neglect on the part of land owners.  I do not say whether the blame is on past land owners or present land owners living along these streams.  The result is, it is necessary to undertake the task of putting those rivers into a proper state. When I say that the rivers have gone back to their original state, I mean only as regards portion of the work.  When you blast rocks out of a river, at considerable cost, the rocks do not come back but if you remove weeds a lot of them come back causing considerable flooding.  A number of those matters have to be undertaken this year.  We realise that with the present prices and value of agricultural produce, it would not be fair to adopt the older system, which was that the people in the district should pay the expenses.  We propose this year that the State should contribute a certain amount by way of free grant in all the districts we undertake to drain.</P>

      <P>Any drainage scheme undertaken this year.  I am speaking of maintenance and restoration. The present idea is in every case to make a recommendation to the Ministry of Finance to give a grant.  In the case of the Owenmore things are much more advanced than in the case of the Barrow.  In cases under the old Act still in existence, where we had a new drainage system, the following procedure, more or less, had to be <Col N="472" /> adopted.  People who were disgusted with the flooding of their lands came together and made a proposal that a drainage district should be set up. They were called the promoters.  They got an engineer at their own expense and asked him to draw up a scheme.  He drew up a detailed scheme of the works proposed to be undertaken.  He indicated in that scheme each plot of land which was expected to be improved, how much of each man's land was expected to be improved, and also the proportion of the total cost each plot should bear.  That was sent to the Board of Works, who appointed an independent engineer&mdash;not necessarily one of their own men&mdash;to examine this scheme.  If they thought it should not be rejected outright an independent engineer went down and made investigations and heard objections on the spot.  The engineer went back to the Board, and if the Board approved of the scheme, the work could be gone on with.  A plebiscite was taken of the people whose lands were to be affected, each man voting according to the amount of his land to be affected.  If ten acres were affected in the case of one man and half an acre in the case of another man, it would not be fair that the one who had only half an acre should have as much voice in the decision as the person affected to the extent of ten acres.  The Owenmore was a peculiar case.  It was taken up by the Congested Districts Board and they themselves acted, to a large extent, as the promoters.  They got the consent of most of the people, and a bargain was entered into.  Though a provisional order was never issued, a certain amount of money was spent by the Congested Districts Board at their own risk and responsibility.</P>
      <P>The idea is to promote a special Bill to deal with that.  This is an urgent case.  It is different from the other cases, because, practically speaking, the whole of the preliminary work has been actually done.  The actual division of the lands and the proportions for which the parties are liable have been all settled.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper could give you a much more detailed description of it than I can. There are many Owenmores, but this particular Owenmore is in Sligo.  So far as this Vote is concerned, I do not think there is any necessity for further preliminary explanation.  So far as subsequent explanation is concerned, I would remind the Dáil of what the Minister for Finance said, that I am not a political <i>vade mecum</i> of all the police barracks, bridewells, and commandeered premises in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask if there is any change in policy as regards the purchase of premises, as against the hiring of premises.  In the old days, the Royal Irish Constabulary usually hired their barracks and paid rent for them.  I gather from the fact that we are asked to vote £30,000 under this sub-head that the present policy is to purchase rather than to hire.  If that is so, we are placing a burden on the taxpayer of the present as against the taxpayer of the future. In view of our present financial position, I think it would be wiser, where possible, to hire premises rather than to purchase.  I know that it is not possible everywhere to hire barracks for the Gárda, but where it is possible that should be done rather than adopt a policy of purchasing outright.  In the long run, it might be to the advantage of the State that the Gárda should not be dependent on a yearly tenancy but, having regard to the financial stringency of the present time, and to the fact that we are voting large sums for compensation, pensions, <Col N="474" /> and other items of non-recurrent expenditure, I think it would be well to hire rather than to buy wherever possible. While congratulating the Parliamentary Secretary on the portion of his exposition of the Vote, which I heard, I would like to ask whether he can give us any light or leading on the point I have raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of policy one way or another. Each case will be considered on its merits.  In some cases you can get a site and premises which are suitable, and you can hire them.  In other cases you cannot get that.  You must, in that case, either buy a site and build yourself or buy out the old R.I.C. barrack. Each case will be considered on its merits in order to determine which is the more economical method to adopt.</P>

      <P>The point I desired to make has been already covered by the Parliamentary Secretary, in reply to Deputy Wilson: that is, that the criticism made by Deputies Cooper and Hewat hardly arises in view of the fact that if capital expenditure is incurred in respect of these cases the Minister for Finance has said he is going to place it to debt.  I presume, in that case, only the charges on that debt will be dealt with, as in the case of buildings rented.  Is not that the case?  What I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say was that, in the case of restorations, in some instances the Government itself is incurring the cost of the restoration and the Minister for Finance says that that cost is being charged to debt as a non-recurrent item, whereas in the other cases the proprietor is rebuilding and <Col N="476" /> the State is renting.

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the position is somewhat like this: whatever might be done is not yet done.  We are dealing with the Estimates, as presented, and if the Dáil decides that there shall be capitalisation of the cost of new buildings, that would appear in next year's returns, rather than in this year's Estimates.  If there is any difference between the amount estimated as capital expenditure and the amount charged against this year's revenue for rent against that capital expenditure&mdash;interest, if you like to put it that way&mdash;it would appear in next year's return rather than in this year's Estimate.  I would like to have some more assurances from the Parliamentary Secretary on this matter as to the probabilities of the actual expenditure during the coming year of this sum of £419,000 as against £197,000 last year.

We may be able to put it in a more clear light to the Parliamentary Secretary who, I am sure, is most anxious to give us every information. We had expenditure of a similar character last year to what is proposed to be made this year, and what I want to know is, what was the policy with regard to that expenditure last year. It is non-recurring expenditure, and we understood it from the statement of the Minister it was proposed to capitalise that.  I take it that that is a question of policy which should have been considered and decided upon before this.  There was expenditure, as I <Col N="477" /> say, of a similar character last year, and what I want to know is if the expenditure of last year and this year is going to be met out of capital or is it going to be paid out of revenue.</P>

      <P>I think the points that have been raised emphasise the necessity for having two classes of accounts kept dealing with non-recurrent and with recurrent expenditure. As I understand the matter, there is only the one set of accounts kept, and everything appears in that.  There is no distinction made between recurrent and non-recurrent expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">

      <P>I frankly admit that I was looking at this Estimate yesterday, and endeavoured to find out what exactly the phrase &ldquo;Military Works Acts Annuity&rdquo; meant.  I was unable to put my hand on any text that would elucidate the matter, and I should not be surprised if there were a number of other Deputies who found themselves in the same difficulty as I did.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that it would be a practicable and a desirable <Col N="479" /> thing, now that we are conducting the affairs of this country in a Parliament of our own, that we should repeal these Acts, and let any expenditure that arises under them come into the Estimates in the ordinary way.</P>

In any case, before we pass from this sub-head AA, I would ask him to inform the Dáil how long this is going to continue, and in respect of what particular works this sum is going to be expended.  In other words, I would ask him to give a further exposition of the Military Works Acts.  I venture to say that there is hardly a Deputy here who knows what these Military Works Acts are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to know how it comes that the sum is £40,000 this year and was £40,000 last year, and that the year before it was £56,000. That is to say, it is a varying sum.  In the Appropriation Accounts for the year 1923-24 it is explained that the sum spent that year was £2,657 11s. 6d. less than what was voted, and the explanation given for that is: &ldquo;A larger amount was provided for the Military Works Annuity than afterwards proved necessary.&rdquo;  That suggests that this is not a fixed annual sum against particular works, but that it is a varying sum.  I think a little explanation on this matter would be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the variation in the sums is concerned, that is as between £40,000 this year and £56,000 in the year 1923-24, that, I think, is covered by the explanation I gave on the point raised by Deputy Wilson.  A certain number of these annuities drop out in the regular course of time.  As regards the point raised by Deputy Figgis, in some cases public buildings are built by means of a loan that has to be paid back in the way of annuities.  A case in point, for instance, would be the College of Science and the plot on which both the College of Science and Government Buildings stand.  The Government buildings <Col N="480" /> themselves were not built out of a loan but from revenue voted year after year.</P>

      <P>We are asked to vote £419,715 towards new works, alterations and additions.  I do not think the request I am going to make will add very much to that account. Numerous complaints have been made to me by members of the Independent Group that they have no room in this building in which to meet, or to interview friends who may come to see them on business, or in which to hold their meetings.  We had a meeting this morning and I chased about looking for a room.  I felt very much like Noah's dove looking for a place to land, but could find no rest for the soles of my feet.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Finance if they would be good enough to set aside some little place where our very modest group&mdash;we do not require gorgeous premises and would be content with some small place&mdash;could meet to interview friends and transact business.</P>

We have read a good deal in the newspapers and we see something has happened, but we have had no real or full explanation of what is happening; what rooms will be allocated, or whether there will be rooms allocated or not.  Generally, we would like to know what are the plans of the Department regarding the accommodation for the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>And also we would like to know something with regard to the adornment of the buildings. They were adorned before with certain statues of allegorical character and now we have statutes of real importance. But joking apart, there are certain national monuments that I think might have been brought into this building and kept here.  I am not going to mention them at large, because I know some are in certain places where I imagine the present keepers of them think they have made a capture <Col N="481" /> that properly belongs to the State, but I will intimate to the Parliamentary Secretary where certain of them are that I think might be brought into this building.  I join my voice to that of Deputy Johnson, and say that I think it is desirable that a statement should be made as to what is being done as to the allocation as between the Seanad and the Dáil, and I support what Deputy Sir James Craig has said also.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>With regard to the Governor-General's residence, it is to he assumed from the fact that you are installing electric light that that residence is to be a permanent one.  However, judging from the number of buildings and the number of lights to be installed, it would seem from this provision that the Department was making provision for customers of the Shannon scheme.  When the question of £300,000 is being put forward for the future would it not be right that we should know exactly where we stand? The Civic Guard barracks, mainly, and the cost of the Custom House are responsible.  But are we to understand that these sums of money would be portion of loans that will be issued in the future?  I think we might force the Parliamentary Secretary to reply by moving a reduction of this Vote, but I do not want to create opposition and I will move that the Vote be referred back for further consideration and more information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a little more in this case than Deputy Wilson has stated.  It is a fact that the Vote for new works has been increased by £200,000, but it is also the case, and it is much more serious, that the Vote for maintenance and supplies is increased by £3,000.  Practically the whole of the increase of £200,000 has to do with the rebuilding of the Custom House and the Four Courts.  At any rate, the sum of £100,000 of it is for the Four Courts, the Custom House <Col N="482" /> and the Post Office, but I would like to know why there is an increase in the cost of maintenance.  That Vote should be cut down instead of increased.</P>

Deputy Sir James Craig made a remark about a meeting of the Independent Group this morning; that they could not find a place whereon to lay their heads, or rest their feet.  I am very sorry for that.  If I had known, even at half-past eight last evening, that any group wanted a room they certainly could have had it, and a fire and an attendant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a more difficult question which has often been considered by Committees. It is difficult to provide a room with our present limited accommodation, specifically, for each party.  It is not possible at the moment.  But when the Seanad has moved from the Museum into this building here, and when all the rooms are completed, it may be possible to do something of that nature. It may be done, of course, in this way: A Joint Committee of the Dáil and the Seanad would examine the rooms and allocate them, and, if it is possible to have a room for each party or group, that will be done, but it may not be possible.  At present a room for a meeting is always obtainable on notice to the Captain of the Guard.</P>

The question of <Col N="483" /> allocating the rooms generally, when the whole building is properly completed and taken over, will be one for the consideration of the Dáil itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">

      <P>There is a committee room, where we thought we could hold our meeting.  We found that rooms occupied by a typist, writing letters for members of the Government, I presume, and the typist had to be removed from the room while we were holding our meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the important point raised is, who will be responsible in the future for the allocation of the accommodation?  Hitherto the Ceann Comhairle has been the supreme ruler.  Now that the Seanad is being removed from the Museum into this building there will be two kings in Brentford.  Already the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has suffered the fate of the bird in whose nest the cuckoo has installed himself.  We could not find him in the room that we were accustomed to find him when the Dáil was sitting.  I think there is need of some machinery, if not by the Board of Works, then by a Joint Committee, whereby we would know what rooms are at our disposal and what rooms are at the disposal of the Seanad.  We should have some definite ruling on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>That of course can be done by the Dáil itself. I do not know what is meant by saying we may find rooms taken up.  I do not know who could possibly take up rooms that we want.  It is to be presumed that it will be quite possible to come to an amicable arrangement with the Seanad.  I do not presume anything else.  When that is done, we will see what rooms are available.  We cannot do it until we get the whole thing completed, but when it has been completed it will all belong to us, Dáil and Seanad combined.</P>

It is one of the little accommodations that parties get, and that any body that is trying to carry on its business will accustom itself to.  It has been the practice for Deputies belonging to this group to meet in Committee Room No. 1.  They make no special claim to it, and they cannot prevent any other Deputies going into it, unless they are prepared to accommodate themselves as we have accommodated ourselves.  We occupy very little room other than that committee room, and it is a matter of accommodation.  If Deputies who wished to attend this meeting had suggested to us that they were short of a resting place we would have been glad to receive them hospitably and leave the room to them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wilson seems to have raised some point as to whether a particular item in the Estimates was to be provided for out of borrowing or not.  There is no intention of borrowing for particular items.  What I did lay down in the Budget statement as the policy of the Executive Council was, that we would endeavour to estimate what was recurring expenditure and what were the sums in the Estimates that were abnormal and non-recurrent, and that so far as the abnormal and non-recurrent part of our expenditure was concerned we did not propose to impose taxation for the purpose of raising money to meet it, but that we would borrow for it.  You could not go into the Estimates and say: &ldquo;We are building this Gárda Síochána barracks, which will stand for 100 years.  It is abnormal and non-recurrent, and we propose to borrow for that.&rdquo;  There will always be new buildings to be provided every year as long as there is a State in existence. For some reason or other new buildings will be required.</P>
      <P>What we did say was, that out of this total provided for new buildings some sum is certainly abnormal.  There is at present an abnormal expenditure on new buildings.  We have more Gárda Síochána barracks to erect than we would have in normal times.  We have work to do in connection with the Four Courts and the Post Office that we would not have to do in normal times. Consequently, when we are considering what taxation we will levy, it is safe for us to say that a certain sum&mdash;I have put it at £320,000&mdash;is abnormal. We do not propose to take that into account as expenditure when we are deciding on the imposition of taxation. We will borrow for that, and we will proceed to raise taxation for the remainder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no intention of complicating our accounts and creating difficulties that would be created by trying to decide in the case of particular items whether they were recurrent or non-recurrent, or whether they should be provided out of taxation or borrowing. You can only take a broad and general <Col N="486" /> view and lay down some general line that will serve you.  You cannot deal with the matter from the point of view of the Estimates.  So far as the Estimates are concerned, the money has to be paid out of the Exchequer.  The money is required and has to be paid out and voted, and at the present stage the question of whether it will be borrowed or provided out of revenue does not arise.  That arises when we are deciding what our taxation will be.</P>

What I am interested in is the material that is being used&mdash;for instance, the slates.  Some barracks have been reconstructed, and I am told that Irish slates were not used, but that slates were imported. We have at least one slate quarry in Clare which was formerly worked by an English firm, but is closed down now.  Possibly that firm have an interest in keeping it closed down and utilising material from across the water.  I should like to know whether the Board of Works have any policy in that matter, or any power to see that only Irish materials are used.</P>

      <P>Sub-head B is a very comprehensive one, and covers a very considerable number of buildings.  I do not know whether all the works that are embodied in it are to be undertaken in the current year.  Under the head of &ldquo;Revenue Department&rdquo; we have got &ldquo;The Dublin Custom House&mdash; partial reconstruction,&rdquo; and a round sum of £30,000 is put down for that. I would like to know if it is intended to proceed with the expenditure of £30,000 during the year under review. I know that some work has been done, and I should like an assurance that this sum is intended to be expended.  On page 46 you have got an item under the heading of Co.

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure if the Parliamentary Secretary has explained it he has done so to the satisfaction of the Dáil.  I will pass from that.  You have got the Four Courts in the same position as the Custom House, as a sum of £32,000 is put down for expenditure during the current year.  Is that a general sum, or is it to be considered as the amount of money that will be spent on the building during the year? On page 47 you have got the G.P.O. and an expenditure of £39,000.  These are very considerable items, and I would like to have an assurance that they are not put down haphazard but will be undertaken under ordinary circumstances.</P>
      <P>On page 48 you have £2,500 for the provision of a fish-curing station at Howth.  I do not know if that embodies a new departure, or a progressive policy in connection with the fishing industry or whether it is put down haphazard.  Putting down £2,500 in the Estimates for a fish-curing station seems to imply that the matter has been considered and approved of by the Dáil.  I do not remember that matter having come before the Dáil, and I do not know whether it is part of a greater scheme or merely an incidental thing in connection with the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>A sum of £10,000 is put down for urgent and unforeseen works.  I would like to take exception to that item. Within the range of an expenditure of £469,000, there ought to be sufficient margin for all the unforeseen items that are likely to occur.  As a matter of principle, I think estimates put before us should be considered estimates and that we should not be required to provide for unforeseen circumstances in this way.</P>

      <P>There is such a thing as Supplementary Estimates.  If the £10,000 is for urgent unforeseen works in connection with any of the specified items I think it can come out of these estimates when the other money is spent.  If it is something not embodied in the long range of works to be done I think we ought to know what it is for.  If it is something in connection with any of the items here; in other words, errors and omissions excepted, we ought to know that.  If it is for something not covered in these we ought also to know it.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at Deputy Hewat.  The Vote for urgent and unforeseen works is £5,000 more than last year.  I think Deputy Hewat is mistaken in his view of the procedure that should be adopted.  Certain items are set forth and the maximum amount allowed to be spent is set out against these items.  We are setting it out here that that is the maximum amount.  If Deputy Hewat had said that before anything beyond that amount shall be spent in respect of these particular items the Minister should come for powers that I think would have been right.  I wanted to raise that point on certain items in the list.  In respect of unforeseen items, we are asked to vote a sum limited to £10,000.  It was £5,000 last year.  Because they are unforeseen no item can be set against them.  I do not think it is an unreasonable provision to allow a margin of £5,000 or £10,000 to a Department like this for works that they cannot foresee.  I demur from the view of Deputy Hewat that in respect of any of the items set forth the Department may spend more than we vote and then come back for sanction for money already spent.  Of all men that is a doctrine that should not come from Deputy Hewat, because he knows that once it is spent the chance of recovering it is very small indeed.  If the Ministry is bound to come to us for further sanction before spending more than is estimated, then we have a check.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I did, and we tried to curtail them.  Deputy Hewat is rather inviting them to go on with that bad habit.  For instance, take page 47, &ldquo;Department of Defence, Cork, Micheal Collins' Barracks&mdash;Reconstruction,&rdquo; a sum of £20,000 was voted against that item, and up to the 31st March last £25,000 was spent.  That is to say, £5,000 was spent more than we sanctioned.  It may be said that that £5,000 was covered by unforeseen works, but I do not think that was contemplated when we voted £5,000 for unforeseen works.  It was not in excess of expenditure on works that were foreseen. This item of £5,000 was spent over and above what we sanctioned.  I think it requires some sanction.  It is not an item like the Four Courts, where £5,500 was spent, though not voted. That was clearly marked as &ldquo;relief,&rdquo; and it was voted for relief.  In the case of the Collins' Barracks expenditure, there was no suggestion that that was part of relief expenditure.</P>
      <P>I want to support Deputy Hewat's plea for a very definite statement in regard to the amount of these moneys to be spent in the current year.  For instance, take the Post Office.  The Parliamentary Secretary gave some information regarding proposals in respect of Post Office buildings, but I did not gather that it is the intention, or the definite expectation, that £110,000 will be spent in the current year.  I would like to have a statement from the Parliamentary Secretary as to whether there has been a fairly close estimate of the amount it is intended to spend during the current year.  Quite a number of Votes were passed last year for sums that were not expended.  For instance, in certain items re-Votes are included in this year's Estimates.  I suggest that it is better that we should not vote them unless there is a real anticipation that they will be expended.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would help us in that respect.</P>

      <P>I would like to get some more information on the lines suggested by Deputy Hewat and Deputy Johnson.  I do not agree with Deputy Hewat that a margin of £10,000 on a Vote of this size for unforeseen works is excessive, especially in view of the fact that a reduction has been made from the Vote of £50,000 for works which may not be carried out this year. There is one large item of which we have no details at all.  That is under the sub-head of the Department of Defence&mdash;Miscellaneous New Works, £28,000.  That is a very large item to be put in as a miscellaneous item.  I do not know whether the Board of Works is responsible for it, or the Department of Defence.  From past experience of the laxity with which some persons connected with that Department treat large sums of money, I am inclined to think that that Department is responsible.  When we are given details of the smallest sums to be expended on the barracks of the Gárda Síochána, we might ask for a few more details in regard to this sum of £28,000; whether it is to be used in new buildings or repairs, or what it is required for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, too, should like to call attention to the very considerable sum of £110,000 for the Post Office; the considerable sum for the Custom House, and the sum of £32,000 for the Four Courts.  Unfortunately, I was not able to hear the whole of the Parliamentary Secretary's statement, and if I am raising points that he dealt with already, I hope he will forgive me.  What is to be the future function of those buildings? <Col N="491" /> Is it contemplated that the Courts of Justice will leave the Castle and return to the Four Courts?  If not, what function is the Four Courts going to fulfil in the metropolitan life? There is apparently a mania at the present moment for removing the cattle market somewhere.  Is there any danger that the cattle will instal themselves where lawyers once perorated? As regards the Post Office, to what extent has the work of the Central Post Office near O'Connell Street been superseded by the installation of the new sorting office?  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us something of that.  Is the full accommodation there likely to be acquired?  Is it necessary to restore the whole building?  To what extent shall we make a saving by this new building?  What temporary premises shall we be able to surrender? We ought to know those things and put them all against this almost enormous capital expenditure of £110,000.</P>
    <P>The last point I would like to raise is one which I expected would have been raised already.  How far does this rebuilding programme, which, personally, I am glad of, prejudice the Commission sitting on the question of the future government of Dublin?  How far does it rule out of consideration what is called the Greater Dublin Movement?  I am not myself an advocate of that.  It seems to me that a great deal of it consisted in moving every place around and calling it by a different name and leaving us very much as we were before.  Still, it has had serious advocacy and it has come under the notice of a Commission now sitting.  Ought we to vote these sums without some knowledge, without some statement, as to the way in which that Commission will be affected?</P>

      <P>I am in somewhat of a difficulty with regard to this question under the heading of &ldquo;Department of Education, National School Buildings.&rdquo;  I would like to draw attention to the grave necessity existing for a renewal of many of the buildings which do duty at the present time for schools.  I am not quite sure whether it is the function of the Board of Works to look after the provision of <Col N="492" /> school buildings, other than the buildings that are approved of by the Minister for Education.  I will reserve what I have to say on that matter until the Education Vote comes under discussion. It is the function of the Board of Works to see there is no undue delay in dealing with these claims.  I have reason to think, and believe, from facts which have come under my notice, that there is great delay in dealing with schemes for new buildings that have come forward.  The position in a great many cases is that grants for the building of new schools were applied for, and in some cases almost sanctioned, in 1914, or before the grants were finally stopped owing to the outbreak of the war.  There are some cases in which decisions are still outstanding.  I would like to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the fact that complaint is being made in regard to delay on the part of the Board of Works in giving final sanction to these cases and so have the buildings commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this small item of Teachers' Residences, at vested schools, grant for building, £200, I take it this grant is intended to be made in two cases under the Teachers' Residence Act of 1875.  I do not know whether it is under this Vote or under the Local Loans Vote that attention should be called to the present position with regard to the non-operation of the Teachers' Residence Act of 1875.  I think it would more properly arise under the Local Loans Act, and I will reserve what I have to say on that matter until the Vote comes forward.  I would like to ask a question in connection with the grant for the Gárda Síochána Barracks.  Is it the practice, when contracts are declared for those barracks, to publish the contract price?  Say that the building or the restoration of the local barracks is put up for contract.  Several contractors tender and send in estimates. The contract is finally given to someone.  In some parts of the country there is a general belief that no contract is given on the merits; it always depends on the way the particular contractor is able to use some kind of influence. I sincerely hope and believe that is not the case; but in order to <Col N="493" /> remove that impression, it would be advisable, if it is not done already, that when a contract is declared, even when it is a small one, the actual amount of it should be publicly made known, so that the contractors who were disappointed would know that the contractor appointed was under their estimates, and that the contract was given on its merits and not because of undue influence.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask is it possible to have provision made under the heading of new works for opening up an entrance to the Phoenix Park near Knockmaroon Gates?  Applications have been made on two occasions to have this work undertaken, but it was turned down because it appeared it was not provided for in the Estimates. There is a number of private owners in the district who have access to the Park between Chapelizod and Knockmaroon.  There is a fairly large population and there is a considerable number of children playing in and around the area.  If they had access to the Park, it would be a great addition generally, and it would certainly be a boon to the workers there.  The distance between Chapelizod and Knockmaroon Hill is rather far.  The work, I suggest, could be undertaken for a couple of hundred pounds.  I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would indicate if it could be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a number of questions that arise out of these estimates, and we, Deputies, look forward to the occasion when these estimates come up as an opportunity of raising different matters that arise.  I do not know whether it is exactly fair to put these questions to the Parliamentary Secretary, and I am not so sure that when estimates of the importance and the character of the one which we have before us, the different Ministers should not be here in order to explain to Deputies questions of policy that may arise.  We have here on page 46 &ldquo;Improved Accommodation at the District Police Courts.&rdquo;  We have been urging both inside and outside the House that additional accommodation is necessary, first of all, in connection with the Children's <Col N="494" /> Court.  I do not know whether that is a matter with which we can expect the Parliamentary Secretary to deal, but nevertheless it is an exceedingly urgent matter.  All of us will agree, who have had the misfortune to be called to the police courts at any time, that its associations are not ideal for children or parents, particularly female parents.  Therefore, it has been strongly urged that a place, separate and distinct from the police court, should be provided for what is now known as the Children's Court.  The practice at present is to set aside a day in one of the courts, if possible, to hear children's cases.  The other court is functioning on that particular day, and we know that the surroundings of the court on the occasions that children are brought there, have all these objectionable features that we do not like to bring children into contact with.  I want to know when this question of the reconstruction of the courts is given consideration, whether that aspect of the matter has been considered by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point put before the Minister is that for very much the same reasons it is undesirable that those engaged in commercial cases should be brought into contact with the associations of these courts.  Commercial cases, as we understand them, are now under the new regime being tried at the police courts.  A number of typists and young people from the different commercial houses are brought down to the police courts to prove these different cases.  There, again, it has been frequently urged by those who hold responsible positions in connection with trade and commerce that the associations of these courts are not associations that should be identified with commercial cases.  It is particularly unfortunate, when claimants come from the other side, as they have to come in many instances, to prove these cases in our courts here, that we have to bring them into contact with the surroundings of the police courts here.  It is not necessary to press these points.  Every Deputy recognises the importance of them in the two cases I have given.  Therefore we would like to know, when this Vote <Col N="495" /> is under consideration, what is the intention with regard to these two proposals.</P>
    <P>I pass on from that to the question of the National schools.  We find on page 46: &ldquo;National Schools&mdash;grants for building, enlarging, enclosing, etc.&rdquo;  I am sorry that the Minister for Education is not here, as the question I have to raise is possibly one that would more properly come under his Department.  We have had under consideration, and we have been promised legislation dealing with school attendance, which it was intended should embrace&mdash;and it would meet the wishes of the Dáil, I am sure&mdash;the raising of the school age.  One of the difficulties I am told that confronts the Ministry in connection with this very important matter is the question of school accommodation. Therefore we want to know, when this grant is under consideration, whether that aspect of the question has been considered, and if so, to what extent.  There is another question that arises here very appropriately, that is, the question of the provision of school meals in necessitous cases.  There, again, there has been the difficulty of the want of accommodation in the different schools for this necessary provision in certain areas. That is a matter that has been stressed on the Ministry, and we would like to know what the intention is with regard to it and what efforts are being made to meet it.</P>
    <P>On this point there is one other question I would like to raise, if it is possible to raise it under B.  It would, perhaps, come more properly under another letter.  That is, why the Phoenix Park National School is set out separately and distinctly from the other items of the Department of Education. That is one of the matters I would like a little information about.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point I would like to raise in connection with Howth Harbour.  It is proposed to expend a sum of £2,000 on a fish curing station. The necessity for this has been expressed on a great many occasions. Many Deputies in this House are exceedingly anxious that something more should be done than has been done to <Col N="496" /> encourage the further development of the deep-sea fishing industry, and this is the first step in that direction.  If this step is to be successful, other steps in that connection will be necessary.  I may again be going outside the letter we have under consideration, but the point arises more in connection with the fish curing station, and the latter we have under consideration here. There is not the smallest use in expending a considerable sum of money in erecting a fish curing station if the particular harbour in which you establish the fish curing station is filled up and sifted up for a considerable portion of the tide, so that the boats with fish practically cannot get into it.  That is the position at the moment, very largely with regard to Howth Harbour, and it is growing worse.  There is no use in spending money in one Department except you are prepared to follow up that expenditure in other Departments. If the question has been under consideration and it has been decided that it would be for the benefit of the industry&mdash;and I am quite sure that decision is a wise one from what I know of it&mdash;I think consequently on that, the other expenditure should not be overlooked and that it should be undertaken as part and parcel of the proposal.  These are matters that one would like some information about. They are important matters, matters affecting large industries, and I am anxious, if we are not asking too much of the Parliamentary Secretary, who has already given us most lucid and useful information in connection with this Vote, that he would supplement that in connection with the information I have asked for.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my plea to that of Deputy Hogan in urging on the Minister the use of local or home manufactured building materials.  I do not see why the slates, cement, and bricks of the country should not be used in preference to those of foreign manufacture.  We have a considerable number of Civic Guard stations to be reconstructed in Kildare and adjacent counties, and I would urge on him the necessity of getting his department to specify Athy bricks in the restoration of these barracks. <Col N="497" /> The quality and durability of that brick is beyond question and it has been recommended by architects for a great many years.</P>

      <P>I think that cement manufactured in this country should also be specified.  The general tendency of this Department is to buy foreign cement, but if the Parliamentary Secretary inquires from the officials of his Department he will find that so far as Wexford cement is concerned it is just as good as English Portland, but, unfortunately, there may be other interests at work to prevent the Wexford people getting the trade they should get.  I strongly urge the necessity of trying to get the Athy brick works going again.  We have a large number of unemployed there and it is only fair that this old-established works should be assisted by the Government by specifying that Athy brick be used in contracts throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I would like to get a little further information from the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to the expenditure of the £50,000 in connection with National schools.  I am not objecting to this expenditure, but I would like to know if there is any further expenditure in the way of local grants to be accounted for from local sources.  I would like to see this money properly expended. My experience of National schools is that a great many of them are in a very inferior condition, and that any <Col N="498" /> money expended on improving these schools would be well spent.  We find the schools throughout the country over-crowded, badly ventilated, and with bad sanitation.  I would like to know if all this is regarded as non-recurrent expenditure, and if it has been capitalised.  I think that that is a thing that should be done.  I think that perhaps even more money than is specified here might be well spent on improving the National schools, and that such sums might be regarded as capital or non-recurrent expenditure, and might be included in a loan to be obtained by the Government.</P>

      <P>There are a few questions arising in connection with the votes for Civic Guard barracks to which I would like to draw attention.  I notice, under &ldquo;New Buildings,&rdquo; that for rural barracks a sum of from £1,700 to £2,000 is included in the Estimate.  That seems very excessive for barracks where there is established a post of four or five Guards under a sergeant.  It is true that only a certain fraction of that sum is being voted this year, but, even so, it is scarcely a good principle to put up a very large estimate of that kind. Take County Clare, for instance.  I see that for the restoration of the Ennistymon R.I.C. barracks a sum of £1,750 is estimated, and that for Morris's Mills new barracks a sum of £1,700 is mentioned.  There is no village in Morris's Mills.  There is a rural post there of four or five Guards under a sergeant, and it seems an extraordinary figure to set up a new barracks for £1,700.  I would like to know on what basis that amount is estimated.  I would like to know the cost of wages and material and whether this work will be given by contract or carried out by the Board of Works directly.  If by contract, I submit that such a proceeding will increase the expense against the Government.  Anyone, by paying a sum of 5/-, can obtain these Estimates and can see that £1,700 is the sum estimated by the Government engineers.  Is there not a natural tendency, therefore, to base prices on the Government figures?  Undoubtedly there is.  I am certain that if a farmer, or any business man, were putting up a <Col N="499" /> house with the same floor space as these barracks have, he would not contemplate the expenditure of a sum of £1,700, nor in making any restoration would he estimate for £1,750.</P>

      <P>With regard to the questions raised as to the use of Irish materials, so far as possible, we put in a clause to get Irish materials.  It is not always possible to get Irish slate, but wherever we can we try to get it.  I do not think that there is much trouble about Irish bricks, as I doubt if it would pay, in competition with Irish bricks, to import English ones.  We put in a clause that so far as possible they must be of Irish material.  As to Deputy Hogan's point as to whether these works are let to contract, they are let to contract. In regard to the suggestion that we should make a special protective barrier around Athy in our contracts, I doubt if it would be possible. Deputy Hewat, and, I think, Deputy Johnson, asked us in connection with the expenditure which we are putting down this year, whether we have done it more or less in a light-hearted spirit or whether we did it seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We intend, if the Dáil allows us, to spend the money this year, except in particular cases there may be exceptional circumstances.  There may be in one or two instances difficulties that may make it impossible to go on with any particular work before the end of the year, but so far as possible the estimate is a serious attempt on our part to make out what is the likely expenditure we shall be called upon to meet in connection with the new works in the twelve months we are now providing estimates for.  That is the answer to Deputy Hewat's question on that point.  Deputy Hewat was not here when I explained the position.  I made it clear, I think, in my opening statement, explaining the principal items of expenditure, that we do intend to spend the money in order to develop the fishery station at Howth, and it is a serious attempt to develop it.  I explained, more or less, in detail <Col N="500" /> how that is to be done.  If Deputy Hewat wishes the matter gone into again I will do so.</P>

      <P>With regard to unforeseen works, one of the difficulties is that I cannot say what the unforeseen works are to be; therefore, the only question is whether the £10,000 is a reasonable sum.  Considering that there is a total sum of over £400,000 it seems to me reasonable. Deputy Johnson raised a point as to the expenditure last year in connection with the Micheal barracks in Cork, £25,000 being spent before the 31st March, 1925.  The explanation is: before 31st March last year £10,000 of that was spent, and we did not in this case outstep the permission given to us by the Dáil.  The £111,000 in reference to the G.P.O. represents a fairly close estimate, as close as under the circumstances we are likely to go.</P>
      <P>So far as re-votes are concerned, undoubtedly there is a number of re-votes this year, but there is an explanation in each individual case.  For instance, with regard to Cork City Bridewell, we found after having put down the sum we should also have possibly to get the courthouse adjoining.  That modified our outlook in that particular matter.  Negotiations were proceeded with in this connection, and the approval of the Minister for Finance was sought and obtained.  That is the reason for the delay there.  Similarly with regard to Tralee barracks, it was due to the fact that when the work was going on there were certain out-premises that had to be dealt with. There was a difficulty in preparing the plans for the Cork City Union Quay barracks, and there were difficulties in regard to inspection of bills of quantities of contractors, and that meant that the contract was not entered into until September, 1924.  In all cases there is a reasonable explanation.  Deputy Wilson raised the question, and I think more or less argued the point, that if we let out these works in contract where was the difficulty in estimating?</P>

      <P>The difficulty is, before we let them out in contract we have to get the permission of the Dáil.  We do not know what the tenders will be until we let them out in contracts after permission has been given for the estimates.  The contracts come after.  Deputy Cooper raised an important point about the question of unforeseen works&mdash;in connection with the Ministry of Finance, £28,000.  I think the policy of the Minister for Finance is to concentrate troops and not to leave them in scattered detachments all over the country.  There are still in some cases detachments in out-of-the-way places, and will be so until such time as the barracks are conditioned for them.  At the time these estimates were prepared the works had not been fully sanctioned by the Minister for Finance.  Roughly speaking, the necessity of finding accommodation at Tralee, reconditioning the barracks at Kilkenny, making some slight alterations in the McKee Barracks for officers' quarters, and providing better sewerage accommodation at the Curragh, are the items that were before the Ministry of Finance that would be likely to be undertaken during the year, and that is why these sums were put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained in my opening statement, the present condition of Government offices in Dublin is exceedingly unsatisfactory.  You have the same Department scattered over 12 or 15 houses in different parts of the city. So far as the Custom House is concerned, we are providing accommodation of 50,000 cubic square feet.  The accommodation in one of the blocks of the Government Buildings is about 20,000 square feet.  That will give an idea of the amount of accommodation we are getting that will enable the Government to concentrate offices at the Custom House.  With regard to the future of the Four Courts, that is a matter for the Government.  The Government, as I understand, has made no decision in the matter, but there is a <Col N="502" /> strong opinion that the Courts ought to go back to the Four Courts, and to be separated from the administrative offices.  That is not a matter on which I can pronounce, for it is a question primarily for the Executive Council. I do not think that the rebuilding programme, so far as it is outlined in this estimate, will in any way prejudice the proceedings of the Greater Dublin Committee.  We are only dealing with the outer walls, so to speak, of the Custom House.  In the Four Courts we are restoring the dome and the two pavilions.  That work of restoration would be likely to be undertaken in any case at the Four Courts.  Deputy O'Connell mentioned the question of grants for national schools.  I do not know that the Board of Works are concerned with that.  We do not decide where the schools have to be built, or grants given.  The decision in the matter rests with the Department of Education. When they have pronounced on it we supply the plans, and we supply the grants, but it is not our function to decide what accommodation is necessary in a particular district. That is for the Department of Education. As regards the Gárda barracks, I am afraid there is a difficulty about publishing contracts.  Contractors, as a rule, do not like their prices published, but that is a matter for further consideration.  Similarly, as regards the point raised by Deputy Doyle as to a new entrance to the Phoenix Park, no evidence has been brought before me on that matter, and I cannot give any judgment on the question on its merits.  Deputy Good was, by inforence, exceedingly complimentary to me.  Undoubtedly what he says about the Children's Court is admitted by everybody.  I have had to go there myself, not as a child&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly it was most objectionable, and everybody who has ever been there will admit that.  One of the matters that I am sure will be considered, and considered very carefully, by the Executive Council when they are dealing with the question of accommodation <Col N="503" /> for the different courts in Dublin will be this matter of segregating the Children's Court at least from the Police Courts.  There are various suggestions put forward as to where it ought to be, but, naturally, until the whole question of the allocation of court accommodation is considered, the Executive Council will not decide on this matter. Similarly with the other point raised by Deputy Good in connection with the courts.</P>
      <P>So far as school accommodation is concerned we can only, as I say, deal with the actual numbers that are put before us.  The decision in that matter rests with the Ministry of Education; they tell us the size of the school that is necessary, and we provide the plans. But as far as the general policy is concerned, that will rest with the Minister for Education.  I can hardly indicate the policy of different Ministers.  As far as Howth Harbour is concerned, undoubtedly there is provision for it, and it will receive consideration with other harbours.  On page 52 of the Estimates you will find provision for dredging under the heading of &ldquo;Harbours,&rdquo; and I have not the slightest doubt that Howth Harbour will be attended to.</P>

      <P>Deputy Heffernan raised some question about schools that I did not quite follow.  As I explained, there is £50,000 for that, and normally we give two-thirds of the cost of building the schools.  Deputy Connor Hogan raised the question about barracks and suggested that £1,700 was too much for the building of a barrack that would contain four or five people, including a sergeant.  But you have to provide for the sergeant being a married man and make provision for him and his family.  The barrack may contain from eight to ten rooms, and that seems to me a reasonable sum for such a building.  The point that the Deputy raised about not publishing the Estimates for works of that kind may be a perfectly sound one, but if the Dáil wants us to withhold <Col N="504" /> information that is a matter for the Dáil.  We will be, not too ready, but ready to follow the wishes of the Dáil in that matter, if they think in future that instead of giving these Estimates we should give the lump sums.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that immediate action should be taken by the Government, either by the granting of loans or otherwise, to enable farmers to restock their lands, in cases where the owners have lost their stock through disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this motion I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not <Col N="505" /> accustomed to try to make things worse than they are.  I think I have been twitted more than once with pretending that all is lovely in the garden, and I move this motion conscious of the fact that the matter contained therein is a thing of supreme urgency and a thing that will not brook delay, that it is a problem that confronts the country very seriously, a problem that demands the immediate attention of the Government, and one that ought to be tackled by them at once.  It is conceded on all sides that the foundation of this State is agriculture.  It will be conceded by every man who understands anything about the industry, and particularly by every farmer, that the cattle trade is the biggest and most important branch of our agricultural industry.  The foundations of that trade, as we might say, are very largely, almost entirely, perhaps, built on the cattle and cows of the small farmers. If you go through the poorer counties of Ireland to-day everywhere you are confronted with this state of things.  The small farmers of Ireland have never passed through a more trying period since 1847 than they have passed through this last twelve months, and particularly these last three or four months.  The loss in cattle is so great that I do not think any statistics could be compiled that would show anything like a correct return of what that loss means to the State.  If you ask these people what their losses are they will say, and I have met them myself, and heard them say it: &ldquo;I would not like to tell.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I concede that it is not right that anyone should try to magnify a problem like this, a problem that is so really serious.  But I have myself very good reason to know what it means in my own constituency.  I am raising this question because it has been forced on me, that the problem can only be dealt with by the Government, by their tackling it thoroughly and understanding the seriousness of it.  That knowledge was the cause of my putting down this motion.  In my county we have something like 19,000 holdings, and 13,000 of these are of a valuation of £10 and under.  I am sure I would <Col N="506" /> be correct in saying that half of the agricultural holders in my county have lost a couple of cows.  In some cases the number is small; in other cases it is very great.  One-third of these, at least, have lost practically all their cattle.  The unfortunate circumstances are, so far as my inquiries go, that it is the farmer with the three cows who has lost two.  The Minister may question the figures I give, but I have gone to the trouble of making inquiries from other Deputies, and I think that the figures from other constituencies will be found more surprising than mine.  I agree that in the drier counties, where the land is better, the farmers are more fortunate.  They are very lucky.  They have not the experience that the farmers in my county have.  Let us consider what this must mean in the counties where the farmers have suffered. To-day we have thousands of farmers in the poorer counties who have had three cows, and who now have two, and some of them none at all.  Some have lost all their young stock as well. When we consider that, we must ask what is to be the future of these farmers? In the first place, how are these farmers to live?  This season, so far, the prospect for the smaller farmer is certainly not very promising.  He was depending in practically every case for a living on his milk supply during the summer months until the harvest can be reaped.  In most cases, in my experience, his milk is sold to the creamery.  With the loss of his cows, that prospect is now taken from him. That is exactly his position.  What can be done for him, or who can do it?  If something is not done how can that farmer be expected to meet the demands that the State will make upon him?  A farmer without his stock is like a workman without his tools, or the means that are necessary to enable him to work.</P>
    <P>That is the position that many of our small farmers find themselves in now.  They are hardly able to carry on until the harvest comes.  If they are blessed with a good harvest they may manage to live.  But by what means are they to replace the stock which have been lost?  The farmer looks to his neighbour.  Someone may suggest: <Col N="507" />&ldquo;Let him try to borrow money in the bank.&rdquo;  That might be a way out, if the number of these cases were very few.  But we know it would take half the countryside going into a bank to-day to give a guarantee that would be sufficient to enable these men to get a sufficient loan to enable them to replace their stock.  We must then look to some other means of relieving them.  The farmer cannot get the money in the bank, because most of his neighbours are practically in the same position as he is in.  The neighbour that has to borrow himself will not be much of a guarantee in the bank for a man who also wants to borrow money.  There is, therefore, no remedy to be found in that direction. If the State does not come to his aid, if the State does not realise the difficulties that these people are placed in, and does not volunteer to do something to help them out it will, I am afraid, be a very serious matter for the State itself, from more than one point of view.</P>
    <P>As I say, the State is depending on our agricultural exports to maintain its credit.  I fear that our exports at the end of this year may be seriously down, and that if some remedy is not forthcoming they will be down in the years to come.  Someone may ask me why.  If we lose thousands and thousands of the best milking cows we have, all over the country, I would like to ask the Minister for Agriculture how will the Dairy Produce Act get us more this year than the four million cows that supplied us with milk and butter last year?  If we sell perhaps one-third less butter than we sold last year, how will it affect us? When we consider the thousands of people and the thousands of families who are depending on the produce of the sale of milk for their living all through the summer months, and that that is removed, the difficulties of these people are very great, so great that only the State can help them.  They cannot help themselves.  We must agree that something must be done for them.</P>
    <P>There is the other side.  Our exports in cattle, I think, are by far the biggest item of our exports.  These exports <Col N="508" /> depend on the quality and numbers of the cattle we breed and raise. That depends, in turn, on the numbers of our cows.  The exports of our cattle this year are determined largely by the number of cows we kept last year and the year before.  The number of cattle that we are exporting this year may not be altogether determined by the number of cows we have this year, but, unquestionably the number and the value of our exports next year, and, perhaps, the year after, will be determined by the number of cows we have this year. If the number of cows we have now are down by thousands, undoubtedly the number of cattle, suitable and available, for export next year and the year after, must be, and will be, I fear, down by thousands&mdash;perhaps by a hundred thousand&mdash;if steps are not taken to replace the cattle that we have lost.  Undoubtedly, from the economic point of view this is a very serious problem for the State.  I say that, apart altogether from what it means to the individual, and what it means as a livelihood for thousands and thousands of people.  As far as I can see the State, and no other, can give this help.  I say that these people have every claim on assistance from the State in the difficulties with which they are confronted. Men have said to me:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We think the Government should come to our aid.  We think the Government ought to help.  We are not asking anything from the Government. We are not asking something for nothing.  We are asking nothing but what, please God, we will pay back; we think the Government have a duty to do what they can for us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If I could see that it was possible by other means than by appealing to the Government to intervene, I would not ask that any action should be taken by the Government.  I would much prefer that individuals, when confronted with difficulties, would have the energy and the imagination to help themselves to find a way out.  I would prefer that these people should find a way out of their own difficulties themselves by cooperating with one another, with a view to finding a solution for this problem. But I fear, in the present depressed conditions of agriculture, that <Col N="509" /> it is not possible to find a remedy by such means.</P>
    <P>If the Government do not consider that it is their obligation and their responsibility, then the plight of these people for several years to come is going to be very bad.  Many of them will be faced with the sale and transfer of their land.  That would not be a satisfactory solution.  The Government can help, and since they are encouraging&mdash;and rightly encouraging&mdash;increased productivity, they should not neglect the agricultural industry.  They themselves recognise its value to the State.  It is their duty to stimulate increased productivity in that industry. They know the depression under which it is labouring to-day.  These unfortunate conditions make the present position much worse and much more difficult than it would otherwise be and I grant that it is not going to be a simple matter for the Government to deal with this problem.  It cannot be solved by a wave of the hand, nor can it be solved by the passing or acceptance of a resolution in this House.  But with courage and energy, the Government can do a great deal to alleviate the distress which exists at present and which will exist if the causes are not removed.  It should be possible for the credit of the State to be pledged to some extent, so that agriculture&mdash;and particularly the branch of it that is in a very serious plight&mdash;would get a stimulus that is much needed.  It would be but right that the Government should pledge the credit of the State, if necessary, in order to help these people out.  I am not going to say that the Government are not conscious of the duty that they owe to agriculture.  But it is not enough to say that they know the farmers have suffered loss, that their difficulties are very great, that something should be done to help them, but that there are many things they could do for themselves which they are not doing.  That will not solve the problem. While it is not for me nor Deputies on these benches to suggest what the Government ought to do, it is our duty and, I think, a duty other Deputies will feel called upon to discharge, to press upon the Government the seriousness of the situation that exists.  It is <Col N="510" /> their duty and their responsibility to do what they can for an industry which is so important to the State.  The failure of the Government to rise to the occasion will not alone have serious effects presently but it will, as I have tried to point out, affect our productivity, our trade balance and the credit of the State perhaps two or three years hence.  I am urging that the Government ought to take immediate action in this matter, and I feel confident that we will have the support of many Deputies in this House in our request. Further, it is practically the unanimous demand of the country that Government action should be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. CROWLEY Mr. J. CROWLEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. CROWLEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Baxter's motion, and I would press upon the Executive the great necessity for immediate relief to farmers who have lost stock through disease.  I am in a position to know as much as, or more than, any person, perhaps, in this Assembly, about mortality amongst cattle in Kerry, West Limerick and parts of Cork, but particularly in North Kerry, because I happen to be a veterinary surgeon and an inspector of dairies and cowsheds. Our firm are probably the largest buyers of hides and skins in County Kerry.  I have been twenty years veterinary surgeon and about thirty years at the other business, and I can say confidently that during the time I remember&mdash;for the last thirty or thirty-five years&mdash;I have not seen as great a mortality amongst cattle as for the last three or four months. Thousands of yearlings have died and hundreds of milch cows are dying now. Many small uneconomic holders who were depending on the little money that a few yearlings&mdash;two, three or five&mdash;may bring at this time of the year, to pay rates and annuities, now cannot pay.  Unless the State aids them, I can foresee an extremely busy time for the sub-sheriffs of County Kerry and other counties.  In many cases, I believe, they will return: &ldquo;Nothing to seize.&rdquo;  I believe that is the return just now in many cases in Kerry, because many of the small farmers have absolutely no stock left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can quote from statistics as to the execution of court judgments.  During <Col N="511" /> the quarter ended March, 1925, in County Kerry there were, according to the return, 374 judgments executed. That fact speaks for itself.  I know, in some cases in North Kerry, where the sub-sheriff seized the last cow belonging to a poor man.  I saw him take from a small farmer in Listowel six cows out of ten for rates.  I had myself to come to the rescue of some small uneconomic holders down there.  I will quote the names and addresses of persons who have sustained losses in my district.  These are cases that I can prove:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Daniel Foran, Coolard, Listowel, lost 11 cows out of 14; lost all calves.</P>
    <P>Patrick Kennelly, Dromin, Listowel, lost 8 cows out of 14; lost 8 young cattle out of 8.</P>
    <P>John Lyons, Knockburrane, Lixnaw, lost 9 cows out of 24; lost 26 young cattle out of 26.</P>
    <P>Michael Purtill, Kilcolgan, Ballylongford, lost 6 cows out of 12; lost 6 heifers out of 6; lost 4 calves out of 4.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Bridget Kennelly, Moybella, Liselton, lost 4 cows out of 10; lost 12 young cattle out of 12.</P>
    <P>Maurice Carmody, Skehenerin, Listowel, lost 7 cows out of 7.</P>
    <P>T. O'Connor, Derry, Listowel, lost 23 cows out of 35.</P>

    <P>P. O'Connor, Kealid, Newtownsandes, lost 11 cows, 10 yearlings and 6 two-year-olds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CROWLEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  All the yearlings and young animals died of fluke, except the calves.  I can prove to the Minister that in the Rural District of Listowel approximately 4,000 or 5,000 yearlings died.  You can estimate the loss if you take an average value of £8 per head.  I was in our own firm's <Col N="512" /> premises a fortnight ago and in half-an-hour I saw fifteen cow-hides coming in, some farmers having two.  These cows died generally at calving or before calving. Many cows have &ldquo;missed&rdquo; and there are many cases of contagious abortion.  The Department's inspectors and the agricultural instructor in North Kerry would be able to assure the Minister of the accuracy of these facts.</P>
      <P>I say again that the Executive or the Government should take serious notice of this matter and try and help some of these farmers.  If they do not, they cannot go on, and the Land Commission will not get their annuities next year.  How can they hope to get them?  There is nothing there.  The sub-sheriff, even at present, cannot get anything to seize.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a question that cannot be very well overstated.  Although Deputies Baxter and Crowley have dealt with the matter, they have only dealt with, approximately, half of it.  The losses in cattle are not the only ones.  The losses to sheep farmers are equal to, if not worse than, the cattle losses.  The south-western counties, Kerry, and perhaps portion of Cork, Clare, and Limerick, have been remarkable for the losses in cattle.  Go to the north-west, to the counties of Galway, Roscommon, and Mayo, and go to Westmeath, Wexford, and Cavan, and you will find that those counties have suffered equally heavy losses in sheep. In some of those counties there is loss in cattle also.  This question is very serious from more points of view than one.  It is very serious from the individual point of view and from the farmers' point of view.  The farmer is bankrupt; he has lost his stock, and he has nothing to put on his land.  These things also affect national output, the national balance-sheet, and the national credit, and I think the matter cannot be overstated.  I know the Minister appreciates the position.  This matter cannot be handled by an ill-conceived measure.  To be effective it can only be handled by a well-thought-out measure.  Not alone is the position bad for those who have lost, but it is bad for those who have not lost even in those areas.  Cattle-dealers will not <Col N="513" /> operate in those areas, and I ask any Deputy to correct me if I am wrong. Cattle-dealers will not go in to buy stock.</P>

      <P>I do not know.  I know that in the case of cattle-dealers.  The same thing applies to sheep-dealers. Cattle-dealers have no confidence going into a fair where they can buy stock which they can pass on to their customers.  The result is that people if they can sell cattle can only sell them at a small price in the counties of Kerry and Clare.  Then we have the problem of what is to be done with this year's grass and hay.  What is to be done with this year's grass crop? There are no cattle there to eat the grass, and there will be no cattle to eat the hay when it is saved.  It is a more complex situation than the actual cattle loss.  I see nothing for it except a loan to enable those people to restock, not perhaps in a hurry but when the weather has got warmer and the land dry, and when this epidemic has passed.  I suppose the Minister will say that he will find great difficulty in stocking those wet and mountainy districts with cattle suitable to them.  I know it is useless to send down highly-bred cattle to those wet districts, but I know there is more responsible for the death of cattle in these districts than the actual fluke plague.</P>

This is going to be an excellent opportunity to bring home to the breeders of stock that they must change their methods.  Proper food must be got for cattle, and it is a paying proposition to do it.  That does not get us away from the position.  Actual loss of cattle is there.  Anyone can give the <Col N="514" /> numbers, and the approximate cost can be easily ascertained.  The question is, what is the best thing to be done.  It is only by considerable thinking out that a proper scheme can be devised as to what is the best thing to be done. Something must be done, not alone from the point of view of the individual but from the point of view of the nation.  It will not be to the good of this nation to have output reduced or to have national credit impaired, and this is going to do it.  People cannot meet their liabilities and cannot pay taxes.  Something must be done quickly.  I do not advocate rushing. I want a well-thought-out measure, and only want cattle to be replaced in these districts when it is proper to do it. It is no argument to say that these people do not take precautions.  It is a fault, of course, that they did not administer male fern in time.  That is a fault, but it does not meet the situation to say, &ldquo;Why did they not do it?&rdquo; It might not have been got in time or might not have been availed of.  That is not the position we are up against. We are up against a position that the best thing must be done.  It is a duty of the Dáil and the Government to do it, and I am sure the Minister will have as much sympathy with this question as we have.  I want to say that, that the fault has not been altogether the fault of the season.  I said before that it has been the fault of the people's neglect in not being alive to the necessity of keeping their cattle in good health and condition, and in giving them the best turnips.  A good deal of this is the fault of the people themselves, and I hope this is a lesson that the people of this country are not likely to forget.  I hope they will have their cattle properly fed for the future and kept in proper health and condition. If they do that, not alone will the evil of fluke be met, but the evil of bad handling will also be met.</P>

      <P>I rose after Deputy Crowley sat down for the purpose of complimenting him on the most eloquent speech that he could have made. It was perhaps one of the most convincing that he could have made, inasmuch as he gave us a statement of fact in respect to a restricted area.  To me <Col N="515" /> it was most appalling.  I think the only comparison one can really make is the comparison of an earthquake, and then to ask oneself what we would do if an earthquake affected a certain portion of the country and destroyed the industrial works in that area upon which the country relied for its subsistence.  If the sample that Deputy Crowley gave us of the country is in any way at all typical of any considerable area of the country, then we are in a very serious situation.  Of course it is not only the grown cattle, the cows, which are the basis of the future progeny.  The young cattle, apparently, have died in very much greater numbers than the aged cattle.  I am sure the Minister has full particulars, and will be able to give us some information as to how this visitation has affected the remaining areas of the country, whether in cattle or sheep.  I am sure that he has considered the needs of the situation as it affects the country's prosperity in future years.  It seems to me that if loans are the best way of meeting the situation with respect to the individual, the House will be glad to support any proposition of that kind.  It occurs to me that, looking at the problem from the national side, it would require some kind of regulation with respect to the export of milch cows.  If the supplies are to be maintained, if those who have lost their cattle are to be supplied and their stocks replenished, there will have to be some regulation, perhaps, of the market for export.  I think that Deputy Baxter and the Deputies who have supported him are justified in asking for the fullest possible information from the Ministry, both as to the reports from the country as a whole, in respect of this disease and of the destruction caused by it, and in respect of the measures which it is proposed to take to meet these evils.  I can assure the Minister that so far as we are concerned we will give full support to any well-considered proposition for loans or other means to meet the needs of the case that he propounds.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the motion moved by Deputy Baxter.  I am sure that Deputies who have heard <Col N="516" /> his statement, and also the statement made by Deputy Crowley, will agree that these statements are in no way exaggerated, but are a true presentation of facts as they exist in most counties of the Saorstát at the present time.  These Deputies have performed a great public service in calling the attention of the House to the position at the present moment.  Most diseases are preventative, and this is a disease in my opinion which cannot be eradicated without Government aid.  I have had a good deal of experience of the work of the veterinary branch of the Department of Agriculture and Tech nical Instruction for Ireland, and during the 1912 outbreak of foot and mouth disease, and other outbreaks scheduled under the Diseases of Animals Act, I had often times to spend many days visiting these Departments. I must say, from my experience of the work of the veterinary branch of the Department of Agriculture, that it gave us as good and clean bill of health, so far as our live stock were concerned, as any other nation possessed.  But, while I do not unduly wish to criticise the veterinary branch over this epidemic, I believe, from what I have seen, that a great amount of the loss sustained by owners is due to lack of educational propaganda on the part of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty is that this disease, known as fluke, is not a scheduled disease under the Diseases of Animals Act.  As a disease which has caused such widespread havoc among our live stock population, it should be scheduled under the Diseases of Animals Act as notifiable.  Unless you do that, what is the use asking the State to come to the aid of people if there is a repetition of the disease next year?  Something, of course, must be done now, but we must also take precautions that this disease must be stamped out.  Due to the blessing of Divine Providence, we were not visited with foot and mouth disease when it broke out in England.  Had we been unfortunate enough to get it here, it would have perhaps cost us millions of money, as it did in England. I have the figures which the British paid in compensation, and I think they will astound the House.  They show <Col N="517" /> what England did for the agricultural population when visited with such an infectious disease as foot and mouth disease.</P>
    <P>In 1921 there were 44 outbreaks in England, and these cost £48,745; in 1922 there were 1,140 outbreaks, which cost £803,529; in 1923 there were 1,029 outbreaks, which cost £2,209,812; in 1924 there were 1,440 outbreaks, which cost £1,289,696.  These amounts total a sum of between four and five millions. When the disease broke out in England all the money earmarked by the Chancellor of the Exchequer under the Diseases of Animals Act, to cope with that disease was £140,000, and out of that sum £100,000 was earmarked for diseases amongst cattle and anthrax and other diseases amongst horses, and £40,000 for swine fever.  They passed legislation, and most of the money voted by the House of Commons to compensate owners for the slaughter of their cattle was taken from the Imperial Exchequer, and very little fell upon the local rates.</P>
    <P>Now, the difficulty of this problem is the great hold the disease has got of the entire cattle and sheep population of the country.  Of course it is impossible, without a census, to know the numbers of live-stock lost, but, glancing at the returns of the Free State of the number of animals exported for three months&mdash;I take the three months commencing January to 28th March this year&mdash;show, we are not increasing our export.  Our cattle export only totalled 61,128, as against 102,043 for the corresponding period of 1924. Sheep were less this year than last year by 21,000 head.  The total is 46,446, as against 67,143.  In my opinion the hope for the future lies in the methods of disseminating amongst owners information regarding the means by which they might gradually reduce the incidence of the disease in their own flocks.  I do not mean to say that the Department did nothing.  They did a lot. They published leaflets, they published Press notices, but did they do what most countries do when disease such as this breaks out?  Did they set up an experimental station for the purpose of testing the remedy mentioned, or can they state is it a cure as well as a remedy?</P>

      <P>If it is a cure steps should be taken to see that supplies of the remedy should be placed in the hands of every veterinary surgeon throughout the country.  I am aware of cases, and I was speaking to several veterinary surgeons dealing with cases, where they had to wait for days before they could get a supply of the remedy.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of this case that Deputies who spoke did not touch at all, and I call the attention of the House, and also the attention of the Minister for Public Health, to it.  It is that hundreds of those fluky sheep were sold by their owners at any price that they could get for them to butchers, and they were sold for human consumption. I am not a doctor and consequently I cannot offer an opinion as to whether or not such meat was fit or wholesome for human food.  But I believe if some of the Deputies in this House saw one of those sheep opened and the parasites alive and kicking in the carcase they would not relish a mixed grill with portion of the liver through it, or a mutton cutlet from off the carcase.  Now, we are passing a lot of legislation, and in my opinion there is no Bill so urgently needed as the Meat Inspection Bill.  There are hundreds of those kinds of carcases being pawned off on people of what is known as &ldquo;God's own killing.&rdquo;  These must have a most injurious effect upon the health of the public.  What is a man to do with, say, 20 or 30 sheep afflicted with this disease?  He goes to the knacker; he says, &ldquo;I will try and get something for them,&rdquo; and he sells them at 15/-, 20/-, or 25/-, anything he can get.  Where do they go?  The buyer does not invest in this kind of thing unless he gets some return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sheep farming at the present time is the one bright spot in agriculture, but our farmers in this country cannot be expected to gamble in sheep farming unless the State comes to the rescue and <Col N="519" /> helps them to eradicate this disease and gives them some help to restock their lands.  I saw a census the other day with reference to the world's supply of live stock, which stated that there are ten millions increase in cattle from the pre-war census.  Pigs decreased thirty millions; sheep decreased eighty-eight millions.  Now, I think the Department of Agriculture should publish these facts, and I would like to see the Statistics Branch educate the farmers upon matters like that, and I hope that the State will accede to our wishes.  I am sure it is the general opinion of the whole House, and the country, that something should be done to help the people who have been afflicted by this scourge.  The British Government gave last year a grant of £10,000 towards research work to try and cope with foot and mouth disease, and £15,000 this year.  I do not know what research work is going on here.  I am sure there is some, but I do not know what amount of money has been earmarked by the Minister for Finance for research work under the Diseases of Animals Act.  I remember the late Sir Thos. Russell got £14,000 from the British Government for research work to cope with swine fever.  It was insufficient and nothing was done since. Of course the rural districts are practically immune from it.  I will not delay the House further than to hope that the reply of the Minister will be favourable, and that when he approaches the Executive Council he will not be told, in the words of the holy man in the Bible, &ldquo;the Lord gave them and the Lord took them away; blessed be the name of the Lord.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I regret exceedingly that it is my painful duty to inform Deputies of this House, and the public generally, of the misfortune, or scourge, if you like, that has fallen on the poor farmers of the County Galway.  The total number of sheep in Galway last October was in or about 500,000.  I am confident, from information I have received from my constituents, that at least one-fifth of them have been lost by fluke since November last.  There are small farmers in my immediate district who <Col N="520" /> have lost from 10 to 100 sheep each through this dreadful disease.  The loss of, say, 10 or 20 sheep and four or five calves to a poor man means bankruptcy to him except the Government comes to his assistance.  The Galway County Committee of Agriculture, at their monthly meeting on Wednesday last, decided to call on the Government to formulate a scheme for the issue of low rate loans to relieve farmers who have suffered as a result of the ravages of fluke in sheep in that county.  Several members of that important Committee spoke very strongly on this matter, and I hope the Minister for Lands and Agriculture will carefully consider their recommendations and formulate the scheme suggested by them.</P>

      <P>It is not conceivable that we could deal with such a stupendous question, which must be examined as to cause and effect in all its aspects: economical, social and political, in the short compass of an hour.  The thing is impossible.  This question primarily affects the tiller of the soil&mdash;the poor peasant&mdash;and raises issues of such gravity that it could not be debated in an hour.  We are dealing with a very dreadful crisis in agricultural affairs in certain counties in the west.  There, at least, the hardship is greatest.  I am not saying that live stock losses are not frequent in other parts of the country.  I have no doubt of it.  But the fact is that along the Atlantic belt from West Cork to Donegal you have in certain large areas a most serious mortality amongst cattle and sheep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have got some figures here for certain districts&mdash;not necessarily complete figures.  What I have got are certainly reliable as far as the areas go, but I do not say that the return is absolutely full.  Taking them at random, I find <Col N="521" /> that in a certain area in West Clare, called the Peninsula&mdash;that is the district west of a line between Kilkee and Kilrush&mdash;in the townland of Belaha, there are just six calves left out of a total of forty.  In the townland of Baltard 30 per cent. of the calves and some of the elder cattle died.  At a place called Newton, in the same district, there are three yearlings left out of fifty.  Turning to other areas, there were losses amongst yearlings and two-year-old cows.  The mortality amongst sheep was small, because very few sheep are kept there.  I understand, however, that only an odd sheep survives.</P>
    <P>This question must be debated in the light of its economic reaction.  What will the position of these people be this year&mdash;or in some subsequent year? What is the position at the moment?  I am sorry to say that while the mortality has been to a large extent confined to yearlings, the elder cattle have not escaped.  A large number of cows have died, and these which remain are not producing milk.  Possibly this is due to the fact that last year's harvest was a failure, the hay saved was inferior, and the people in many cases were too poor to buy concentrated foods to give added sustenance to their cattle. The fact remains that at present, in many places, the cows are unproductive, and in several of these areas the children of many a poor peasant are crying out for milk.  That may appear to be an exaggerated statement, but I am prepared to assert that it is essentially true.  In any case, it may be taken that the cows will not produce much milk this year&mdash;where the owners have been lucky enough to have any cows left.  These cows will not produce much milk or butter, and in the west butter-making is more or less the staple industry.  The sale of the butter keeps the family, while the yearlings are sold to meet certain charges, such as land purchase annuities, rates, and other demands. The money realised from the sale of butter really goes to keep the home from week to week.  You have, then, this position: that, with a lot of the young cattle gone, the week-to-week earning power of the family has sensibly diminished.  That is a very <Col N="522" /> serious position.  In addition, you have to remember that charges are pressing on these small farmers, and as a rule the farms are exceedingly small, three, five, or seven cows only being kept.  A man with twelve or fifteen cows is considered a very large farmer in the districts I am speaking of, and is recognised as an opulent and well-to-do man. It has been amongst the poorest class that the mortality has been highest. I would not lay that down as a general principle, as it would be scarcely fair to do so, but when the question is examined it will be found that the small peasant has been the most unfortunate in losing most of his stock.  I beg to move the adjournment of the debate until Friday.</P>

      <P>I should like to get some information as to what is the basis on which awards to persons whose houses have been commandeered by the Army are computed.  Is it based on the rent of the premises, or is it some fictitious figure estimated by the Board of Works?  Does the damage done by troops during the occupation of the houses come under this sub-head?  In many cases, perhaps owing to want of discipline or proper supervision by superior officers, very serious damage was done.  Doors and windows were smashed and a lot of unnecessary destruction occurred which could have been avoided perhaps by the enforcement of strict discipline.  How much of this could really be regarded as avoidable damage?</P>

      <P>I should like to know how many of these drainage maintenance <Col N="524" /> schemes exist.  I am interested in the River Fergus, which is in a very bad state.  Unfortunately, boards of trustees are largely to blame.  At the beginning, I think, there was a fundamental mistake made, as these boards of trustees became more or less autonomous bodies.  When they repaid certain charges to the Board of Works for works that were executed 60 or 70 years ago no further control was exercised over them.  They were permitted to do as they pleased.  They struck a rate, and there was a certain amount of legal responsibility on them to maintain the sluices and rivers in a good condition.  In the absence of law or of proper machinery for enforcing it, the statutory obligations of these bodies have gone by the board for the last ten years.  In many places the boards of trustees are non-representative, and are not elected by any riparian owners.  It is difficult to get a record of an election. Apparently these bodies continue in office indefinitely.  I should like to know how many of these boards have been dissolved.  Under the Maintenance Drainage Act, 1924, how many schemes have been transferred to the county councils, and how many will be taken in hands so as to carry out the necessary repairs that are required by that Act?</P>
      <P>I notice that the Department is giving £25,000.  It was stated that the estimated expenditure was something like £90,000.  In other words, the State is giving about one quarter of the amount.  I would be glad if I could get some information from the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to the River Fergus.  When will the work begin?  I realise well that the Clare County Council have adopted it and have given a promise that they would bear the expense of part of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any machinery by which the Government could expedite this question and set about draining the land, thereby doing necessary works and improvements in the immediate future? What would be the contribution of the Government, and what will be the cost of this drainage scheme?  I believe a preliminary inspection has taken place, and I have no doubt an estimate has been prepared.  What will the cost be <Col N="525" /> and what percentage of that cost will the Government contribute?</P>

      <P>The argument of Deputy Hogan might not quite meet the situation.  I refer to the River Robe.  It has been flooding its banks for the last ten years.  Whatever plan was adopted for draining this river, it has fallen into disuse.  The river has been neglected and has become choked up.  The situation was so serious five or six years ago that it was brought under the notice of the British authorities at the time, and even they were sympathetic enough to consider doing something. Plans were made out and levels were taken.  Even the Development Grant Commissioners, or whoever had charge of the grant, allotted the sum of £3,000 for this work.  Then the war came on and the plans were all dropped.  The money was allowed to remain wherever it was, but the river continued flooding, and it has been flooding all the surrounding land ever since.  It is pitiable to go there and hear the farmers complaining of their crops being under water year after year. How can the people till that land when they are subject to so much flooding? The Board of Works was applied to several times, and an inspector was sent there, but we did not get much further than that.  I would like if the Parliamentary Secretary gave us an assurance that this serious state of affairs will be taken into consideration and that the Robe will be one of the rivers that will come under the drainage scheme.  I would like him to assure us that we will get a share of the £25,000 grant.  This is a very serious situation.  The people are paying their taxes and their crops are being washed away.  They submit that the expenditure of a very small sum would clear the river, and allow the water to flow, and so put an end to all the flooding.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="526" /> to the necessity of facilitating the drainage of the Awbeg.  There is some of the best land in the country in that particular area and it is continually being flooded.  We heard a lot a little while ago about the great losses brought by diseases in cattle.  There is no greater method of spreading disease than flooded land.  Lands flooded during the winter months that have to be grazed during the summer are most dangerous.  The parasites that create those diseases are hatched in the saturated land, and they are a great means of spreading disease.  Along by the banks of the Awbeg some of the very best of land is completely flooded.  Some farmers down there this year were not able to let their cows out; they had to confine them to the stalls during the winter months and later, because they had no dry land on which to put them. I dare say if they did allow the cattle out they probably would have got the fluke, the same as happened in County Clare and in other parts of the country. I wish to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to this matter, so that it may be possible to have an inspector sent down.  If this matter were facilitated I would be very grateful.</P>

      <P>While this discussion about drainage is going on, I would like to draw attention to the state of a river in comparison with which, unless I am greatly mistaken, the River Robe is a rivulet.  It is a case that could hardly be set right by the expenditure of a small part of £25,000.  I refer to the River Moy, in North Mayo.  During the Christmas season I was in North Mayo.  I travelled along the road from Castlebar to Ballina.  Practically all that area from Castlebar to Ballina was under flood at the time.  Many hundreds of people are affected by that flooding.  While knowing very well that the situation there is of such a magnitude that it can hardly be dealt with by an incidental Vote like this, I should not like to let the matter go by without drawing the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to it.</P>

      <P>I suppose if one were to allow this opportunity to pass in connection with matters affecting drainage, <Col N="527" /> if one were to make representations further on in the year one might be told we appeared to be satisfied when this particular debate was proceeding. I would like to enter a plea on behalf of my constituency, and would draw attention to a drainage area which, I believe, is a scheduled one, which Deputy O'Sullivan is conversant with.  That is the question of Cahore.  He certainly sent an Inspector there in consequence of representations made by me, and he sent me two letters which were pretty ambiguous; they meant nothing or anything.  I would like to ask if the Minister is prepared to say in what areas is the £25,000 to be expended?  It is due to the House that that information he given.  I do not think any useful purpose could be served by a comparison between a large river or a small river. I take it that no matter what the river is, if it overflows its banks, it will be able to create an atmosphere which is neither good for man nor beast.</P>
      <P>In connection with the Cahore area, a doctor's certificate has been sent to the Board of Works, pointing out the fact that the river overflows its banks and keeps the land under water for about six months, is responsible for a very low state of health amongst the people.  Not alone are the lands to the extent of six hundred or seven hundred acres flooded, but roads have been rendered impassable.  I think everyone will agree that this is a disgraceful state of affairs.  In view of the fact that this is a scheduled area, I would like some answer from the Parliamentary Secretary which will enable me to tell my constituents that something is going to be done.</P>

      <P>I have in mind particular districts where there are hundreds of acres submerged by rivers overflowing their banks.  There is one river, in <Col N="528" /> particular, that overflows its banks. The people are, meantime, expected to pay annuities and rates on these submerged areas.  I know one person who offered his farm to anybody who would pay the rates on it.  The entire farm was submerged.  I know the Department is taking notice of these things, and is seriously considering them.  The Deputy who is in charge of the Department has given me some information on the matter to the effect that those things are receiving attention.  I am convinced they will get attention.  I would like, however, to point out that immediate attention is necessary, and that the figure here does not adequately represent what is required to carry out the work intended.</P>

I have one instance before me at the moment, where a drainage area does exist, in which 40 occupiers of land have had 664 acres submerged for eight months of the year.  That is a matter that requires attention.  If you have that, as one example, in one county, what must it be in other counties? I submit the matter is one that ought to be dealt with seriously and this particular method does not appear to be a particularly serious way of dealing with it.</P>

      <P>Precisely.  The first claim I would make is for the Glen River in the Glen of the Glenties.  I might mention to the Parliamentary <Col N="529" /> Secretary that he has a right to call upon the Minister for Fisheries for a contribution because he has certain rights in the river, which flows along a hatchery which he has built there. This river is a very valuable addition to the Owenee.  The second river that I wish to make a claim for is in the district of Falcarragh, and it flows into Falcarragh Bay.  I was recently in that district.  It is the average good farming country, but it is entirely flooded over.  About 200 or 300 acres of good land have been destroyed owing to the flooding.  I believe, I heard at all events, that several gentlemen from the Board of Works had previously inspected this area.  I know that an inspector of the Land Commission, whom I asked to report on the matter, described this as a very necessary work and one of great importance to the district.  That is the Falcarragh district. The third river to which I would draw attention is near Letterkenny. It drains the country down from Kilmacrennon and flows partly through mountainy land and partly through arable land.  If in the allocation of this £25,000 something is set aside for these very necessary works, I shall be very much obliged to the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

Before doing so I would like to bear testimony to the manner in which he has met one particular district which was badly flooded last season, that is, the area through which the Blackwater flows in the north part of the county. The River Greise, a tributary of the Barrow, has been flooding very badly recently, especially in the vicinity of Ballytore.  The people have been subjected to much damage; not even the houses have escaped.</P>

I would be very glad if Deputy Professor O'Sullivan would give some attention to it.  There are several other minor streams not yet under the control of the county council to which attention should be given. They are doing a great deal of harm and affect very seriously the people of the district through which they flow, especially one near Newbridge at a place called Clongorey.  It has done a great deal of harm and obstructs people from getting the turf in the bog.</P>

      <P>I would like to support Deputy Conlan in impressing on the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry the necessity of dealing with existing drainage schemes which are under the control of the Kildare County Council.  I sent letters to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Local Government last week referring to the amount of unemployment in the county generally.  I think that it would be a wise thing to get this work done now, as we have such a large number of unemployed in the rural areas.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary might have entered another sub-head here as KK, to represent Kildare, and put down a similar amount for KK as he did for the Owenmore river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Gárda Síochána barracks, I made the proviso that I was not exactly a living inventory of all the barracks and jails in the Saorstát.  I might make a somewhat similar disclaimer as far as the rivers are concerned. There are about 300 drainage districts in Ireland, and by far the largest proportion of these are in the Saorstát.  I am asked not merely to have acquaintance with existing drainage districts, but to know practically every river in the Saorstát that floods during the winter.  Coming to individual streams, there was an advance of the Dalcassians from Clare in the shape of the two Deputies Hogan.  They put forward claims for their particular district.  Deputy P. Hogan mentioned no river in particular, but I take it that <Col N="531" /> he has had the same river in mind as his colleague, Deputy Connor Hogan&mdash; that is the Fergus.  Proposals have been made, as far as the Fergus is concerned, and to carry out these it is estimated that it will cost, roughly, about £15,000 to put the Fergus in a fair state.  We propose that, if the County Council is willing to take on that burden of 25 per cent, that is, £3,750, that we will also make a grant of £3,750.  That has been put before the Clare County Council.  As I have already explained, before the Act of 1924 was passed, the total cost would have fallen on the district.</P>
      <P>Let me here point out that we are not responsible for misbehaviour or the non-performance of their duties by the drainage boards; we have no power over them, absolutely none, except that we could go in, before the Act of 1924 was passed, attend to the drainage, and charge the cost on the farmers whose land was benefited&mdash;the whole cost of it.  That was the only check, before the Act of 1924 was passed, over the drainage board or the drainage trustees.  I doubt if that would have been a satisfactory solution at any time, within the last six or seven years at all events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we propose to take up a number of districts.  It is quite true that £25,000 is not sufficient or represents the total expenditure.  I do not say a total expenditure of £90,000, but possibly between £75,000 and £90,000.  That is not sufficient to meet the drainage problem of this country.  There are only a certain number of works which we can undertake in any year.  We calculate that with the engineering staff at our disposal, and we have increased that staff for this purpose, we will be able to do a pretty fair amount of work.  So far as the rivers generally are concerned the question was asked when we may be expected to make a start.  I think the question was raised in reference to the Fergus.  First of all, a certain amount depends on the county council in that particular case. Secondly, a lot depends on the weather. Our principal engineer has been in the West recently, and he has reported that at present the rivers are  in a condition <Col N="532" /> to be dealt with owing to flooding. In Mayo the River Robe was mentioned.  So far as Mayo is concerned, it is proposed to do some work there.  So far as the Robe district is concerned it was planned originally in a very ambitious way.  The actual estimate of the amount of benefit was altogether in excess of the benefit actually accruing from it.  The expenditure was altogether underestimated.  It was to a certain extent famine relief work and, like many drainage districts that came into existence at the time, when a certain amount of money was spent beyond the estimated cost, the Government of the day got frightened and stopped the work when it was only half finished.  To a certain extent that is the position in regard to the Robe.  The work was not properly carried out, and we have no powers to carry that work further than what was done originally. All we can do under the existing Acts is to maintain it.  We have had the river inspected and I may say that some of the worst portions of it are not in the actual drainage district of the Robe. Our engineers are of the opinion that the only proper solution is a complete tackling of the problem afresh and extending the district.  That cannot be done under present legislation, but a Bill will be introduced, I hope at latest, next week, which will make it possible to set up a new district.  A proposition has been made in connection with portion of the river where we think useful work can be done at present.  We put that before the County Council, because under the Drainage Act of 1924, if work of this kind is done by us, automatically the care of the whole district rests in the county council.</P>
    <P>As we are dealing with only portion of the work, we thought it fair to give the county council an opportunity of declining the responsibility or not.  So far as Deputy Tierney is concerned, having been down there about Christmas, he probably saw things on a big scale, and as compared with the Moy other rivers became to him merely as simple rivulets.  We have no authority to do anything with the Moy at present. The same applies to that slow, sluggish, and meandering river, the Awbeg.  There are difficulties there, <Col N="533" /> too.  If you drain the upper portion you have to provide somewhere for the flooded water, and possibly the only way to drain it is to take a certain portion of the land which you could flood lower down.  Then there is a further difficulty presented by certain mills.  Then there is the question of Cahore, which Deputy Corish is insisting upon bringing before the notice of the Board of Works.  We had it inspected, and it would be a very costly scheme.  Apart from the character of the district itself, the water comes down from the hills to the lowlands just near the shore, and there is involved the silting of the shore itself with gravel and sand.  It is doubtful whether work of that kind would pay at Cahore.  I promise the Deputy that before we come to a final decision it would be well to have an expert valuation of the land made.</P>

      <P>Not ambiguous but a little indefinite perhaps. Deputy Doherty mentioned three rivers, but I have on this occasion to plead that I know nothing about them. He assures me, however, that they are existing drainage districts and that they could be brought in under this work.  As they have not been brought to my notice before, I cannot say anything definite about them now, but I will look into the matter.  As regards the points mentioned by Deputy Conlan and Deputy Colohan, I may say that the Kildare County Council has, on the whole, kept the rivers entrusted to its care in pretty good order.  Deputy Conlan mentioned the River Greise, a tributary of the Barrow. Its fate is indissolubly connected with the fate of the Barrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>What I mean is that I intended to deal with that particular tributary of the Barrow in connection with the Barrow scheme. As regards the proposal of Deputy <Col N="534" /> Colohan, that we should especially devote our attention to County Kildare, I admit that there is a great amount of unemployment in County Kildare, but we can hardly undertake to restore in this year all the drainage districts there.  We will do a certain amount, and in determining what districts we will take up we are trying not to confine ourselves to any particular district. Certain factors operate in choosing a district such as finding out whether certain counties are poorer than others.  That in itself would be a claim.  There is also the question of the state of the rivers and how far they can, comparatively speaking, be made remunerative.</P>

The Board of Works are doing certain drainage in the Fergus, and the Land Commission are doing certain works as well.

I refer to the Anner, referred to in the poem, &ldquo;She lived beside the Anner.&rdquo;  I have had communications with regard to that river <Col N="535" /> There has been a considerable area flooded, and this could be remedied by clearing the bed of the river.  There is another river, the Tar, a tributary of the Suir.  I do not know if the Secretary has heard about it.  There is a river in North Tipperary, which I think Deputy Morrissey is interested in, the Nenagh, a tributary of the Shannon.  I have also had communications from my constituents with regard to that river. I do not think, however, that the Drainage Board has any responsibility in connection with these rivers.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask why rents show only an increase of £200 on the previous year.  We have had laid on the Table of the Dáil a series of documents under the State Lands Act, giving particulars of the renting of the coastguard stations, and rents for military barracks, and so on, which, though I have not had the leisure to make a complete estimate of them, strike me as likely to come over £200. Tolls and dues have increased enormously, the increase being £7,500.  Surely some of those leases of lands let under the State Lands Act should be shown as rents rather than as tolls and dues? I only ask for an explanation.  It is quite clear that the Departments concerned have been wisely husbanding their resources, and that a considerable amount of Government land has been let to private individuals.  I think we are entitled to information as to how this is worked out in relation to the <Col N="536" /> Estimate, for the increase of £200 is not quite commensurate with the operations of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, I am afraid I cannot answer that right off, but I will have inquiries made for the Deputy.  I can give an explanation, I think, as to the dues and tolls.  Under the State Harbours Act of last year&mdash;possibly the Deputy suspected something of the kind&mdash;it is proposed in future to charge reasonable rates to the boats that use Carlisle Pier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I will defer the subject to enable the Parliamentary Secretary to obtain the information, for it does appear inconsistent and unbusinesslike to lay papers on the Table of the Dáil showing that Government land has been let at in some cases considerable rents, almost in every case at rents higher than private owners would charge.  The rents charged for the coastguard stations in the West of Ireland, though these stations might be more eligible than the houses in some of my cottage property, are 100 per cent. higher.  It may be that the appropriations referred to last year, and that the rents only became payable possibly three months ago.  These papers have been laid on the Table of the Dáil within the last six months, but if the appropriations are intended to be the appropriations of the coming financial year there ought to be a considerably larger increase than the £200, unless something has happened to account for the falling off.</P>

      <P>I suppose we may take it that the amount set down for rents is inclusive of rents for coastguard stations?  I would like to know what arrangements have been entered into between the people who have taken these houses and the Board of Works.  In some areas one individual has taken a whole block of houses at what might be considered a low or nominal rent, and that individual is <Col N="537" /> profiteering and charging an exorbitant rent out of all proportion to what the people would pay only they are so badly off.  He can fleece them.  The rent he charges is certainly not in keeping with the rents in the area.  I think it inadvisable to let houses on such a system, giving them to one person at a nominal rent.  Is this individual responsible for repairs or is it the Board of Works?</P>

      <P>Following up that point, I received to-day, from Tralee, a letter touching on a similar question. I will not go into details, but I will give a general statement.  A certain person has two distinct and separate quarters in the Staff barracks at Tralee.  The two quarters of the barracks let to the same individual are divided.  One of them this person occupies herself, and the other she sublets at 10/- per week.  The rent she pays for the two is 2/6.  That is my information, and it seems to be a state of things that ought to be put a stop to.  It is done in the case of private houses, as Deputy Good has pointed out, but in cases where you have State-owned premises which are let at low rates we ought to be able, I think, to put a stop to profiteering of that character.  I do not know whether the Minister's attention has been drawn to this sort of thing, but it is now drawn, and I hope it will be possible to prevent a continuance of it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might give a short explanation of some of the differences between the figures in this year's Vote and last year's.  The particular item of increase in regard to the Secretary's Branch is that in 1924 there were five Higher Executive Officers, and in 1925 there are Seven. That is explained in the following way: If Deputies will look at the General Accounts' Branch they will find that in 1924-5 there were Five Higher Executive Officers, while this year there are Four.  One of the Higher Executive Officers was, by mistake, included in the Accounts' Branch last year.  This year he is put in where he rightly belongs. The other Higher Executive Officer is necessary to deal with the new service that has been started, the service of Land Loans.  There is a similar explanation in regard to the increase for Clerical Officers, which is due to a certain extent for particular work in connection with drainage&mdash;the increase in the number of typist and typist-shorthand writers.  In connection with the next increase of any consequence, in the Architectural Branch, that is to a large extent a re-arrangement, though undoubtedly we have a great deal more work for the Architectural Branch this year owing to the large number of public works that we have just passed. The Drawing Office also has to take these matters into account, and in the Drawing Office there are Four Temporary Junior Architectural Assistants. Their presence is necessitated by the amount of new work that we have taken on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Sub-head B, we have an increase in the travelling expenses of the Engineering Section.  Most Deputies, especially those who represent country districts, will be able to understand what is responsible for that.  The number of demands for inspectors in existing drainage districts, and in others, that comes into the Board of Works, is extremely high.  There is an increase of £100 in the incidental expenses. That is mainly in connection with the necessity for advertising contracts for the building of Gárda Síochána barracks.  The amount of the increase for telegrams and telephones is simply the result of our experience of the amounts that these services actually cost.  Last year it was more of a guess.  Then you have the Land Improvements Act and the land loans under this.  The loans under these Acts require a large number of inspectors.  Six of these inspectors belong to the permanent staff, but for some years past there were no land loans: the service was suspended.  But these inspectors were not idle; they were transferred to other pressing work, as in the case of the Architectural Staff.  Some of the land loans inspectors, for instance, were acting as assistant architects in different parts of the country.  This year we require them for the administration of the land loans service, and, in addition, we require for the same service the ten temporary inspectors that are mentioned. I may say that in that connection. prior to the European War, when the Board of Works were administering the <Col N="541" /> land loans, there were eighteen specially qualified inspectors dealing with the issuing of loans for the improvement of land.</P>
    <P>The fall in connection with the appropriations-in-aid from £8,000 to £2,500 is due to the fact that some of the work we undertook for the English Government has dropped off.  We were getting a certain amount of money for carrying on that work of providing houses for ex-soldiers.  That has now practically ceased, and the work that remains is covered by the £2,500.</P>

      <P>I wish to find out exactly what are the regulations governing the issue of loans to small farmers for drainage, fencing and reclamation. I understand that a rule has been adopted by the Commissioners of Public Works that not less than £35 and not more than seven times the Government valuation of the holding, can be advanced.  Why this rule has been instituted I cannot understand. In my own county the average valuation is £8, and the valuations run from £1 to £300.  This rule means that 60 per cent. of the people in that county are debarred from getting loans for any of these purposes.  I think that that rule is altogether ill-advised, and I cannot understand why it was made. Besides, seven times the Government valuation is a very small amount to advance on land.</P>

      <P>No, seven times <Col N="542" /> the Government valuation.  The Secretary will tell us whether that is true or not.  That is my information on the subject, and I think it is absurd to limit it, to have it seven times the valuation or even to seven times the annuity. In any case that would debar the people of the County of Donegal.  It would debar sixty per cent. of them from taking advantage of this which, to my mind, is a most valuable provision, and one that the Dáil should strongly insist is utilised to the fullest possible advantage, in order to bring the benefits that we expect to derive in agriculture from the doing of these works.  These people would be able to carry out these works at the present time and earn the money amongst their own families when unemployment is very rife.  I think the insistence on this rule has been ill-advised, and I would like to know if it has been altered, or if this established rule is to be adhered to?</P>

      <P>I would like to say a word with regard to the rate of interest. I think that £7 17s. 10d. seems very high, and that is the sum the borrower has to pay.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would promise that in the future we could get loans at 6 per cent., paying as we did before the war, when these loans were repayable at 6 per cent. and covered themselves in 22 years, mostly for haysheds. At present the repayment is at the rate of £7 17s. 10d., and the value of money is not half as high now as it was then, and yet the interest is much higher.</P>

      <P>With regard to the grant for ex-soldiers, it appears there was a large amount of that grant allocated for the building of houses in the Fermoy district, which was one of the biggest military centres we had in the County of Cork.  For some reason or other that grant was diverted to some other channel last year, and there were no houses built there, with the result that within the last week there was an unemployment demonstration in Fermoy. It would be well, as it is believed down there that the Government were responsible for diverting that grant, that it would be explained to the people that that was not the case.  These people are under the impression that <Col N="543" /> the Government is responsible.  I would like to have it explained that the Government have not diverted any portion of this money from the building of houses in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the matter raised by Deputy Noonan, this is entirely a matter for the British Government.  We are not responsible for the diverting of this grant.  It is their grant and we cannot dictate to them where it is to be spent. With regard to the point raised by Deputy Wilson, I wish to say that I share the hope that we will be able to get money at the rate we got it before the war.  I am sure it is also the wish of the Minister for Finance that he will be able to get money at that rate. Coming to the actual rate mentioned by Deputy Wilson, I would say that the Deputy is perhaps a little out of date in that matter.  The position is this: in the case of certain grants for farmers, the number of years for which the loan was granted was 35 years. That would be, for instance, for buildings. But for buildings with corrugated iron, such as haysheds, and for farm roads, drainage and such things, the term was 22 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true that if you work out that at the rate of 5½ per cent. which the Government pays, you will find that you will get £7 17s. 10d.  It struck me that that was too high a rate, or at least it struck me that farmers would think it was too high a rate to pay back.  I put the proposition to the Minister for Finance to increase the term of years under which it could be paid back.  There was undoubtedly serious objection against that particular course.  It was held, for instance, that the life of a corrugated iron shed as normally looked after&mdash;I am not saying of a shed that is properly cared &mdash;is not worth more than 22 years. Also the life of drains not properly made or maintained would not be worth more than 22 years.  However, the Minister for Finance met the proposal I had put to him, and agreed that in the case of roads and drainage, as well as in the case of buildings, the paying-back period would be 35 years.  And <Col N="544" /> the annuity, therefore, at present that we propose to charge is not £7 17s. 10d. but £6 9s. 6d.  Undoubtedly, in the beginning, before that decision was come to, and when the land loans were restored, we had, before we got the permission of the Minister for Finance, sent out notices saying that the rate was £7 17s. 10d.  In all these cases a correction was made, pointing out that the rate on a 35 years' loan is £6 9s. 6d. That is to cover the interest and the repayment.  But if people prefer the shorter loan they can still have it.  There is an exception made in the case of corrugated iron sheds.  In that case the period is 30 years, and I think that would work out at about £1 under the sum mentioned by Deputy Wilson.</P>
    <P>The point raised by Deputy McGoldrick is rather a difficult one.  First of all, there is the statutory limit in a good many cases.  Originally £100 was the smallest loan that we could give. Then there was also the old rule that £35 was the limit that could be given in the case of the owners of land.  That meant, in these old days, that the amount that could be borrowed was, in the case of the tenants, only three times the valuation, and in the case of the owners only five times the valuation. Again, being anxious to facilitate the farming community, we determined that an increase should be made there, and that in the case of tenants it would be five times the valuation, and in the case of the owners it would be seven times the valuation.  That means, of course, that originally, for instance, in the case of the owners, the lowest valuation on which they could get a loan would be £7.  We have reduced that now to £5.  Then it is only fair in connection with this fund to consider this fact.  Under the British this was a self-supporting fund for the following reason.  Many years ago the British had a certain rate.  Then there was a State fund, the Local Loans Fund.  They charged the Local Loans Fund with a half per cent.&mdash;sometimes a little more&mdash;more than the actual rate they paid.  That meant that the Local Loans Fund got the benefit of that half per cent.  There were, in connection with that Local Loans Fund for Ireland and Great Britain, large sums of <Col N="545" /> money borrowed by municipalities in England.</P>
    <P>A half per cent. in that case meant great revenue to the Local Loan Fund. The result was that it was self-supporting even in the case of a service like the Irish Land Loan, a service which, taken by itself, would never pay.  It was not merely the preliminary expenses, but the expenses of inspecting the various stages of the work which had to be met.  This is not the same as a loan where a farmer goes into the bank and pledges his farm.  It is a loan for a definite purpose, and consequently it is the duty of the person who gives the loan to see that the loan is utilised for that purpose.  Preliminary inspection of the plans and regular inspection afterwards were necessary in that particular case.  These were expensive, and the Irish Land Loans of themselves would never have paid.  But the Local Loans Fund, of which the Land Loan Service was a portion, owing to the half per cent.  I have mentioned, and owing to the great borrowing that took place in the case of municipalities, was a self-supporting fund.  That is not so in connection with our land loans.  They are not self-supporting and they are expensive.  The smaller the loan is the greater is the expense.  £35 would be expensive, and £50 would be expensive. If there were many of them it would make the administration exceedingly expensive in proportion to the value of the money lent, and in proportion to the amount of good that could be got out of the loans.  If you bring the loan below 35 per cent., naturally you increase the economic character and you make it still harder to justify the giving of those loans.  So far as Deputy McGoldrick is concerned, remember, this is a loan that can only be given once.  A man cannot get it this year and get it again next year.  It is not a panacea for stopping emigration.  If it is only a loan of £20, a man who has a farm of that size surely ought to be able to do himself the particular work connected with the farm.  This is meant to be spent in the way of money given out for labour in those particular parts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephMcGoldr" hpid="Mr. McGOLDRICK Mr. McGOLDRICK">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Parliamentary Secretary that <Col N="546" /> five times the valuation could be given to the tenant and that seven times the valuation could be given to the owner. Now, as the tenant has become the owner himself, will twelve times the valuation be given to him?  That would enable the holder of a £3 valuation&mdash; which is the case in the county I refer to&mdash;to carry out reclamation.  Reclamation is needed.  A great deal of land can be brought into cultivation and we have a possibility of doing it.  Unless you give us the facilities we cannot do it.  Unless you make some arrangement of that sort, we cannot do it.  It would be hopeless in the case of the counties that most need those things and that could turn them to best account unless you give facilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>One aspect of the case has not been fully considered by this Department.  It is the lowest valued land that needs most improvement.  If we take unreclaimed land, mountain land, you will find because of its wild state, that it carries a small valuation. The same thing applies to bog.  A very wet bog will scarcely carry any valuation in money at all, although it may cover a considerable area.  Most money will be needed there.  You may get good security, but the policy of restricting the loan to a certain number of years' valuation is not sound, and it certainly will not mean good development. Corrugated iron houses and sheds are exempt and put on a different plane from houses, drainage, and road making.  I speak for one of the counties that has put up more haysheds than any other county in Ireland. I think I may make that claim. Most of them have been put up under the Board of Works.  I have three barns myself.  The whole loan has been paid off and they are still good security for the money.  I do not think this exception ought to be made. There is nothing more needed under the present system of agriculture than better outbuildings and better sheds. There is nothing more suitable or cheaper than corrugated iron.  If the proper gauge iron is put up there are no grounds for saying that the property is not good security for the money.  If the proper gauge is not there it is the fault of the Board's Inspector <Col N="547" /> who allows bad iron to be put up.  I think it will be good State business if the same period is extended to this particular class that is extended to other houses.  That is the class of houses that I anticipate will be largely used in the future, and it is certainly as good value for the money as the other class.  The figure in the past on which this was based was roughly twenty-two, and it was prohibitive.  It would be prohibitive in these days, considering what that class of house is costing.  In the days when they were used extensively, that class of business could be done cheaply, and would be good business.  It would not be good business to-day.  They are different prices, and I wish to draw the attention of the Department to that.</P>

We have to go on the experience of what the average life is of such a shed, normally looked after, not carefully looked after. It was pointed out to me that twenty-two years was a very generous life for the ordinary corrugated iron shed, as things worked out.  I made the point that probably, under improved conditions, <Col N="548" /> with the farmers looking more brightly at things and owning their own lands, that they would take more care.</P>

      <P>It is founded on the facts that have come to us from all over the country, from the different individuals to whom we have given loans.  In the case of a corrugated iron shed, if, after twenty-two years, it becomes a wreck, the payment of the annuity on it is felt to be harsh by the person who is paying it.  The thing is not so obvious in the case of a neglected drain.  In the case of a corrugated shed it is too obvious.  The Board's experience is that the normal life of those sheds is twenty-two years. We did agree that that should be extended to thirty years, and that practically meant almost a diminution of a pound in the annuity.</P>

I would like to know on what counties he has based his figures.  I could understand the early deterioration of galvanised wire and corrugated iron near the sea, but inland the conditions are quite different.  I have seen such deterioration near the sea in England.  I am prepared to admit that corrugated iron of bad quality has a short life near the seaboard.  It is not a paying proposition there.  The effect of the sea breezes will rot it in a very short time, but inland it is quite a different proposition.  I can tell the Parliamentary Secretary that I have seen sheds, put up 33 or 35 years ago, which are as good to-day as when they were first put up.  The inspectors of the Department should know that it is not a good investment to put up corrugated iron sheds of inferior quality along the seaboard.</P>

I want something in the nature of justification of the fact that the Executive permits those sums to be transferred to England, in view of the fact that under Article V. of the Treaty a Financial Commission must be set up to go into the relations between the two countries.

For instance, we pay over the land purchase annuities, which we collect, as a contribution towards the payment of stockholders.  This money was paid out of a particular fund.  It was not in the nature of a general payment out of the British Exchequer. These loans were made out of the Local Loans Fund, and were always repayable to the Local Loans Fund. That has not been apportioned, and the repayments go to pay interest to the stockholders.</P>

Are there, then, other inquiries made as to whether the applicant has paid his rates or his land purchase <Col N="550" /> annuities, or do these matters count when the Board's decision is being taken?  It has been brought to my notice that an application was turned down on the strength of the fact that the applicant was some months in arrear with his annuity.  I understand his annuity has since been paid.  Does the fact of his paying the annuity remove the difficulty as regards his getting a loan, or are these matters taken into account?</P>

      <P>The Minister's figures as regards the lifetime of corrugated iron sheds may be right if he refers to &ldquo;H&rdquo; iron, but an old railway sleeper will last for ever.  The inferior stuff, which contains a large percentage of steel, will rust away in flakes, and that would, perhaps, justify the argument the Minister has put up.  But I want him and his engineers to try and induce the manufacturers to give us a better article than we have been getting, and one which will contain a smaller percentage of steel.  I know that the class of stuff of inferior quality that has been used goes away in shelling of about a quarter of an inch.  I can quite understand that stuff rotting in a very short time, but I hope the Secretary's advisers will try and get a better article and one that will last longer.</P>

      <P>I have had a case put before me similar to that mentioned by Deputy Baxter.  There was some irregularity in the payment of annuities, and on that ground, the application for a loan was refused.  We all know that there have been a great many irregularities in the past as regards payment of annuities, and I think it is scarcely fair to refuse a loan on that account.  It would be well if the Parliamentary Secretary would think over the matter, and induce his officials to take a less strict view in that connection&mdash;particularly, if people are making up for default in the past by prompt payment at present.</P>

      <P>This question of corrugated iron sheds is of considerable importance.  It would be a great advantage to the farmers if they could secure loans for these sheds at the same rate as they secured them for other <Col N="551" /> purposes.  In my county there are probably more of those iron sheds than in any other county in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In my experience, I do not know of any sheds of corrugated iron which became worthless and had to be destroyed.  They are all still in existence. I know a farmer who had a corrugated iron shed put up about 35 years ago.  About 20 years ago, when it was three-quarters full of hay, an outbreak of fire occurred, and all the hay was destroyed.  The shed, of course, became red hot, but it is still in existence, and, in my opinion, is as good now as it was the first day.  As regards the point made by Deputy Gorey about sheds put up on the sea coast, I have no doubt, of course, that the sea air might have a bad effect on the iron.  As regards the rate of interest charged, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have further inquiries made into that.  The farmers are entitled to get every penny of benefit that they can out of these loans. There is no reason why the rate of interest charged should be any higher in regard to loans granted for the erection of corrugated iron sheds than it should be on loans granted for any other purpose.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to making inquiries, and if the results are as Deputy Heffernan suggests, then the matter will be reconsidered. Our experience is certainly not that.  Inquiries will also be made along the lines suggested by Deputy Corish.  Deputy Baxter and Deputy Conlan raised another question&mdash;namely, the question of the refusal of these loans in some cases. Publication does take place in the newspapers, because it is only right that people should know, and that we should know, whether there are any <Col N="552" /> claims against the particular lands in question, whether certain other people have claims besides the person making the application for the loan.  So far as the non-payment of annuities is concerned, and what Deputy Conlan mildly referred to as some irregularities, may I point out that these are loans.  One of the factors which we must take into account is the character of the person making the application, not his character in general, but his character as a person to whom a loan ought to be made.  One of the factors that we must take into account in that case is the readiness with which that person pays up his debts and pays his annuities for other loans.  In connection with land, it is pretty well known that the people who fail to pay their land purchase annuities are almost the same set of people who are in default year after year.  Undoubtedly that is a very serious factor.  If we are giving people a loan, and find that those who apply for it are people who are not accustomed to pay up when the time for paying up comes, that is a factor that we must, as ordinary business men&mdash;as Deputy Hewat would say&mdash; take into account, and I do not think there is anything unreasonable in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to say very much on this Estimate. As Deputies will observe, there is no very great change under any of the sub-heads.  There is a decrease of £4,440, but that does not arise because of any decrease in the Estimate itself, but because of an increase in the Appropriations-in-Aid. That increase has arisen as a result of exceptional circumstances, namely, the fact that the American Consular authorities are insisting on intending emigrants being provided with two certificates of birth in the case of single persons, and certificates of birth and certificates of marriage in the case of married people.  Heretofore, these certificates were granted by the Superintendent Registrars.  In former times the Superintendent Registrar was generally the Clerk of the Union, but since the passing of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, these duties, as a general rule, are now carried out by the Secretary to the County Board of Health.  Generally there is only one such officer in each county, and as a result of that change the emoluments that would be derived from this particular source would be exceptionally high.  In a great many cases intending emigrants apply directly to the General Registrar's Office.  It was accordingly decided that it would be much better to have all those applications made direct, because there was no justification for the salaries of those officials being increased. The increase would amount to something like £290.  It was considered that that sum should, in the ordinary course of events, more equitably be paid to the Central Fund, which stood all the expenses of carrying out the registration and granting these certificates.  Accordingly, we anticipate, as a result of the granting of these certificates for which a charge of 7s. 8d. will be made, that the Appropriations-in-Aid this year will be considerably increased.  That is about the only change in the Estimate, and accordingly I do not think it is necessary for me to make any further comment.</P>

      <P>One is rather disappointed with the explanation given by the Minister in connection with the General Registrar's Office, because looking through the accounts generally, there seems to be a uniform increase in cost under the head of &ldquo;salaries, etc.&rdquo; Turning to the Vote, I thought we had a bright and a shining example of a Department that was out strenuously for economy, and that it expected to save a considerable amount.  It appears, however, that there is no saving in this case.  It is merely that the receipts, through an exceptional cause, have been increased, and that tends to reduce the total amount of the Estimate.  That rather takes away from what one was inclined to regard as a tremendous effort at economy in this Department.</P>

There is an allowance made for the registration of marriages all over the country.  There are 109, and twenty of these get £20 each.  I want to know from the Minister if the business of these 109 registration officers deserves that outlay, and whether there is sufficient marrying going on to necessitate the payment of £2,180.</P>

Do I understand the Minister to say that because of alterations made, whereby a secretary of a county board of health becomes now a registrar for the county, the funds that come into him are transferred to the headquarters here; that all the 7s. 8d. 's or whatever may be the payment for a certificate, are all brought up to headquarters? If that is so, what allowance is made to him, or is any allowance made to him?  Where a man was formerly a registrar of a district, does he still do all the work?  He was formerly paid a certain sum accruing to him as a sort of income because of keeping the register.  Is all that taken away from him, and have all the fees he collects to be sent up to the head office here?  If so, then, on what basis is payment made to him for the work he does?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied at all with the explanation given by the Minister in this connection, because from the very wording of the circular issued from the Registrar-General's Office, it appears that praccally the same labour will come upon the superintendent registrar of the district as heretofore.  It says: &ldquo;You will therefore please note that all applications for certificates received by you on and after the date above from intending emigrants should be forwarded to this department.&rdquo;  That simply means, as I understand it, that not only is he acting still as superintendent registrar, but that he will have to forward to the Registrar-General's Office these applications.  That arrangement, to my mind, does not seem to take into account that in some cases it makes a great deal of difference to the people applying for certificates as to what they pay.  I know in some cases where the superintendent registrar has found is necessary to issue certificates free to people because they could not pay for them.  That does not seem to be taken into account.  The Minister says the emoluments derived by those particular officers in that direction are very high, but the department, it seems, are anxious to make them higher by putting on a correspondence fee of ?, which was not in existence before. <Col N="556" /> I think this demands greater explanation than the Minister has given, not alone from the point of view of the officers concerned, but from the point of view of people looking for these certificates.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to answer the last question put by Deputy Good.  I have not got the statistics, but I have no doubt I could get them for him later on.  With regard to the general question raised, superintendent registrars are not really placed in any worse position. It was always in contemplation that if there were any exceptional circumstances, emoluments arising out of this registration work for the granting of certificates, the officials performing these duties would not benefit greatly by that, and that they should be recognised more or less as nominal, because in the ordinary course of events very few certificates are looked for, and that principle was recognised in previous legislation.  For example, the Friendly Societies Act of 1875 led to a great many of these certificates being granted, and accordingly the fee asked for these certificates was only 1/-, and in the case of any other certificates being asked for it was only 6d.  That was also the case when the Trades Union Amendments Act of 1876 came into operation and when the Factories and Workshops Act of 1876 came into operation.  It was never intended that these officers were to benefit to such a great extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Office is put to considerable expense as a result of the increased demand for these certificates. and the State as a whole loses greatly as the result of emigration, and accordingly it is only considered right that the Central Office should get the benefit of these fees.  The ordinary certificates granted by superintendent registrars are no longer acceptable for passport purposes.  The Minister for External Affairs has written insisting that sealed certificates should be <Col N="557" /> granted, and accordingly all these certificates have eventually to come through the head Department, and to save unnecessary expense, and unnecessary administration charges, it was considered desirable that all the work should be done through the central office, and for that reason the change has been made in the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear yet on this matter.  After all, most of the certificates granted, or many of them at least, are for intending emigrants. What I want to get at is: what percentage of the fee, or does all of it, go to the office?  I am not so much concerned about the pay of the registrar or whether he gets enough.  I have no doubt at all that most of these posts are sufficiently well paid.  I am concerned to discover, if I can, what is the basis of payment to the registrar for the work he does.  Has he got any more pay for doing the work of the county than he got for doing the work of the district, and what is the basis of his payment?  Is it on the number of certificates issued?  Is he permitted to take an average of what was coming into him when he had a small district, or is there a fixed salary for the position? How much of the fee collected by the registrar goes up to the head office, and how much is gained by it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act of 1863 empowered the superintendent registrar to issue under his signature copies of entries in the books in his custody at a fee of 3/6 for each. That is to say, 1/- for search and 2/6 for a copy.  With the exception of the expenditure incurred by the superintendent registrars all these fees are now going to the Central Fund.  In addition to that, there is ? as a correspondence fee.</P>

The portion that will not be claimed by the registrar should revert back to the local rates.  The fees would now amount to a considerable sum in some counties where there is a large number of intending emigrants. It is hardly fair for the Minister to claim those fees.  The administration expenses would certainly not be increased by £5,000.  It is only fair that this money should go towards the relief of local rates.</P>

      <P>The most striking feature about this Vote is the increase in the appropriations-in-aid.  The other items are pretty much the same as last year.  This increase arises from the fact that last year it was anticipated that a number of patients in this asylum belonging to Northern Ireland would be re-transferred, and no appropriation was anticipated to pay for them.  During the year, however, it transpired that these persons were not going to be re-transmitted to Northern Ireland.  Accordingly, their full appropriation fee was paid, and we are taking credit for it again this year.  The Northern Government pays all the expenses of their patients in Dundrum. There has been a certain amount of adverse criticism of this asylum on the grounds that the cost per patient is higher than that of the ordinary district mental hospital.  This arises from the fact that it is in some respects a unique institution.  It is a criminal institution having some of the aspects of a jail.  The inmates are practically all criminals who are mentally deficient. Accordingly, the cost of administering and keeping up this institution is higher per head than in the ordinary mental hospitals.  The number of patients is also much smaller than in any other asylum, and accordingly the overhead charges bear a much higher proportion than in any other asylum. That is the reason why the Vote seems rather high when compared with other district asylums.</P>

      <P>I want to call attention to &ldquo;H-Telegrams and Telephones.&rdquo; I see the amount has decreased from £160 to £60 per annum. It seems an extraordinary thing if it is possible to reduce the charges from £160 to £60.  I am sure it does not mean that the Post Office is decreasing its charges.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister under what conditions criminal lunatics are kept in Dundrum <Col N="561" /> Asylum.  The reason I ask that is that I know cases where lunatics were sent to Dundrum Asylum during periods which were abnormal.  According to the existing law these unfortunate people cannot apparently be kept there unless they are under a sentence and when that expires they are liable to be sent back to the local asylum from which they originally came.  That seems to me a rather peculiar state of affairs, and I would like to hear the Minister's explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not exactly know what information the Deputy requires. The facts are as he states.  This is a criminal asylum, and is reserved exclusively for criminal lunatics.  When they have served their sentence or ceased to be criminals they are returned to whatever institution is under an obligation to maintain them.  I do not know that I can make any statement as to how they are treated.  This is a semi-penal institution, where the inmates are under much closer supervision than ordinary mental cases.  I do not think there is much difference in other respects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major MYLES Major MYLES">
      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might further explain the position&mdash;if a lunatic in a district asylum commits a serious assault he is tried and sentenced.  I understand he is then confined in Dundrum. When he serves his period there he is sent back to the district asylum.  He must commit another assault before he is again sent to Dundrum. In Dundrum he serves a sentence under similar conditions to that of a gaol.  When that sentence is complete he is let loose on the local asylum again until he commits another offence, when he is again tried by the local court and sent back to Dundrum. If such a person is a really dangerous lunatic he ought to be kept in Dundrum while he is in that condition.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is no <Col N="562" /> doubt aware, as he is a member of it, that a Commission has been set up to inquire, amongst other things, into the working of mental hospitals and the treatment of mental cases.  No doubt, the question he has raised will get very careful consideration from that Commission. At the present time there is no doubt that the asylum system leaves very much to be desired, as there has been no proper attempt made to segregate mental patients in anything like a scientific manner.  I hope as a result of the deliberations amongst others of Deputy Myles that we will be able to arrive at a happier solution of this very difficult problem.</P>

      <P>There is no change of any importance in this Vote from last year, except the disappearance of the Concordatum Fund.  It is a very old fund, and came into existence, I think, in the time of Charles I.  It was originally a fund granted for all kinds of miscellaneous purposes, but eventually became exclusively devoted to charities. When the Vote for 1873 and 1874 was under discussion in Committee of Supplies, a strong opinion was expressed by some members that the fund should be gradually extinguished. The complaint was made that it was largely applied to the relief of widows and families of the Irish Church&mdash;a practice which, it was alleged, ought not to continue after the disestablishment of that Church.  That discussion led to an inquiry on the part of the Treasury, and ultimately to the present arrangement for the extinction of the fund.  From that forward there were no new charges on the fund, and it gradually approached extinction.  The last person who was receiving any pension under the fund died last year.  The fund then automatically disappeared. I do not know if there is anything arising out of the general Vote, but if any Deputy raises any point, I will be prepared to answer him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a question as to whether the Minister has any views regarding the continuance in the present form of these allowances to hospitals.  The allocations were recommended as far back as 1854 and 1855, and they do not seem to have any clear regard to the needs of the hospitals at the present day.  For instance, we see on page 148 that there are certain payments made, according to a fixed scale, to a number of hospitals in Dublin. They are not calculated upon any basis of deficiency of expenditure, of the number of patients, the number of doctors, or even cubic space, and they do not seem to have any relation at all to present-day needs.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that it is necessary to have some reconsideration of this whole question of the amount of money which should be provided out of State funds for the aid of hospitals.  I do not want to make any suggestion, at the present time, as to whether there should be increases, or how these increases should be allocated.  I would like to hear from the Minister if he has any views as to the relation of the State to hospitals, and particularly in regard to the present method of allocation of the sum of £15,850.  It does not seem at all sensible to continue paying grants-in-aid, based upon some scheme which probably had a sound basis as far back as 1854 or 1855.  That basis has completely altered in 1925. Perhaps the Minister and Deputies generally might have some enlightment on this matter from Deputy Dr. Hennessy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Deputy Johnson's suggestion.  I suggest to the Minister that he should place this matter of grants-in-aid to hospitals and charities under the care of that particular Commission which he has mentioned.  I am aware that one grant was given, and I mentioned that particular grant to a Deputy who was interested in the medical profession. That Deputy was strongly of opinion that there was one grant which ought not to be continued, and which could be very readily avoided.  That grant ought to have come under the aegis of this Commission.  I would strongly support Deputy Johnson's suggestion. The Commission which sat in 1854&mdash;the time of the Crimean War&mdash;could not <Col N="565" /> possibly understand the needs of the present day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Johnson and Deputy Wilson that these charitable funds have been allocated in a very arbitrary way, in a way that it is very difficult to justify when looked at from a modern standpoint. These charities go back very far.  For instance, the Foundling Hospital was established in the reign of Queen Anne. This institution eventually became the South Dublin Union, in 1838.  Then, the House of Industry, of which at the present time Richmond Hospital is the principal institution, was founded in the reign of George III, and it became the North Dublin Union in 1838.  You have all the hospitals receiving grants from these charity funds.  They gained a statutory right to that fund at different times and under peculiar conditions. It is a very difficult thing to interfere with those grants.  These institutions were carried on in anticipation of the grants recurring from year to year, and it is a very serious matter to cut them off.  That should not be done without having a thorough inquiry into all the circumstances of the case.  It is a matter either for a Commission or for a consultative council. I hope, at an early stage, we will be able to set up such a Commission or to get the advice of a consultative council on the matter.</P>
      <P>With regard to the particular hospital referred to by Deputy Wilson, which, I presume, is the Lock Hospital, there is at present a Commission dealing with venereal disease, and this particular hospital will come within the purview of that Commission.  No doubt they will have some recommendations to make with regard to its continuance or non-continuance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we would be unanimously of opinion that these grants should be revised in some shape or form, not, I hope, with any idea of reducing the amount, but, if possible, rather increasing it.  At all events, it requires readjustment.  I take exception to the table showing the estimated expenditure and income of certain hospitals in Dublin.  If you look at that table, there is a uniform deficit in all <Col N="566" /> the hospitals in Dublin, and the deficit is a very considerable amount.  That would seem to indicate that all these hospitals have an annual deficit.  I do not know whether that is so or not; but, at all events, from the accountancy point of view, it would seem to indicate they are all rapidly entering into bankruptcy.  I do not think that is the case, and, therefore, a table that purports to show that every hospital on the list is suffering a deficit at the end of every year, to the extent indicated, is a very serious matter.  That is, if it is accurate; if it is not accurate, then it is misleading.</P>

      <P>From my knowledge of the hospitals in Dublin, they are in debt; they have ceased to fulfil their main functions&mdash;that is, being hospitals for the poor people&mdash;simply because of their indebtedness.  A hospital now devotes a considerable number of beds to people who can pay for them, and that is mainly due to the fact that they have not sufficient money to go on with.  As regards the hospitals, it was the original intention that they were to be utilised, to a large extent, for the very poor; but it can be no longer said that they are for the poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="567" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, in a sense; but it is not altogether true.  In most of the hospitals, particularly some of the older hospitals, while they are compelled to make charges now for a number of the beds, especially in the case of those who can afford to pay for them, there is still a large percentage of what are known as free beds.  It is only right that that should be said on behalf of those hospitals.  The Deputy is quite right when he says that nearly all of those hospitals are in debt.  That is quite true, but in a great many cases that is owing to the number of free beds they provide and the amount of work they do absolutely free for the poor.  That ought to be said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrThomasHennessy" hpid="Dr. HENNESSY Dr. HENNESSY">
      <NameTxt>Dr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>If those amounts were originally intended to aid hospitals for the sake of the poor, it would be interesting to know what relation the amount bears to the number of poor people attended free.  If all the hospitals are in the habit of charging now, it may happen that the number of free beds is rather few compared with the amount of money received, and in that case I think there is an added reason why the Commission should be hurried on, and why the whole scheme of hospitals should be based on more scientific principles than in the present haphazard way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisMcCullough" hpid="Mr. McCULLOUGH Mr. McCULLOUGH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCULLOUGH</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lack of proportion in the grants for the various hospitals.  Some receive nominal sums and some receive quite big sums.  It is very interesting to know, as Deputy Sears has pointed out, what services they give to the poor for the moneys they receive.  I hope the Minister will take steps to have an examination of this whole question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be taken that <Col N="568" /> the hospitals give very good value for the money received.  As I said before, the money has been allocated in a very arbitrary way, in a way that is rather difficult to justify nowadays.  Of course, the hospitals are maintained out of public charities.  The Lock Hospital exists solely on the Central Government funds, but I do not think that Deputies need worry as to the value given to the poor for the amount of the grant.  The grants are not on the whole very large, and they certainly give excellent service for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I would rather emphasise is this&mdash;that I have not any complaint that the State is not getting full value for the expenditure up to now, but that the State's contribution to hospitals is confined to these hospitals.  There are other hospitals that are equally in need, and it is a question as to whether we ought to continue the old allocation, and say that out of such moneys as we can spare to hospitals, £16,000 in this case, we ought to apply it only to those hospitals on the basis of the recommendations of 1854 and 1855.  I think if this matter is gone into it will be found necessary to increase the amount of money voted, and to re-allocate it according to some basis of present-day needs, and to allocate it to all other hospitals as well as those named in the old list.  I would impress upon the Minister the desirability of having some form of inquiry into the needs of the hospitals, and having some declaration of policy on the part of the Ministry as a whole as to the amount of further financial assistance that should be given and the conditions of that assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not like it to go forward that in raising the matter I had any thought that the money was not expended satisfactorily and value given for the money.  I have no doubt that the money is well spent, and that they would be very glad to spend equally well a great deal more, but I think <Col N="569" /> there are other hospitals that would require assistance.  I think the whole question of the relation of the State to the hospitals and charities has to be considered with a view to further grants, and with possibly some conditions as to these grants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the inquiry that Deputy Johnson suggests would be necessarily a more exhaustive one than he thinks of.  That inquiry would need to be an inquiry as to the number of hospitals required for the country as a whole, because the old contention was that there were too many hospitals in Dublin.  I think the question as a whole should be considered in relation to this grant and the amount to be given in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make one point with regard to how these hospitals cater for the poor and to the references that have been made to free beds.  It should not be lost sight of that the poor people who are sent up from the country to the Dublin hospitals are paid for by the local authorities.  It should be also remembered that practically all the members of the trades unions in the City of Dublin pay a sum every year into the different Dublin hospitals.  As far as I know, there are comparatively few people who get absolutely free treatment in the hospitals at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that that is exactly so.  A number of the patients that come up from the country is paid for by the local authorities, but I do not know that that number represents by any means a majority. I am rather inclined to think that it is quite the other way.  A very large number comes up from the country, but they contribute a very small sum to the hospitals.  I would be also glad if it were true that many of the trades unions had an arrangement with the hospitals, whereby they pay for their members when they are in hospital, because this whole question of the upkeep of the hospitals, from the figures we have before us and from other figures, is becoming a very serious question.  The cost of the maintenance <Col N="570" /> of these hospitals is amounting to a very alarming figure.  On the other hand, the incomes they are receiving are decreasing for reasons I need not go into.  They have lost some very generous supporters, and there are also many people who, by reason of their incomes in the past, were able to contribute towards the hospitals, and who are not able to contribute to-day.  The whole question of hospital finance has changed very seriously in the last decade.  It is a question, as Deputy Hewat properly pointed out, if we are having an inquiry, that should be included in the terms of reference of that inquiry.  Speaking now on behalf of the city, I may say that a question that has confronted some of us who have taken an interest in hospital work, is that very question as to whether there are not too many hospitals and as to whether the work could not be more efficiently and more economically done by a larger hospital rather than in a number of smaller hospitals. These are questions which are of very considerable importance, and which might well engage the attention of any inquiry such as Deputy Johnson suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrThomasHennessy" hpid="Dr. HENNESSY Dr. HENNESSY">
      <NameTxt>Dr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>In reference to the statements that patients from the country pay for their maintenance and that members of the trades unions pay, I might point out that they do not pay a weekly economic sum.  That is, they do not defray the entire expenses of the bed that they occupy in these hospitals. Perhaps if they had to pay the full contribution to defray the full expenses, the charge would amount to £4 or £5 a week.  They pay 30/- or £2, which is a substantial contribution, but it is only a contribution towards the expenses of the hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have no doubt at all that there are a large number of free beds in all these hospitals, and that the hospitals give a good return for the money, an unfortunate impression remains amongst the poor in Dublin that you cannot get into one of these hospitals as a free patient.  It is known that there is £16,000 of State money paid to these hospitals, and, so far as the poor are concerned, it would be much better if there was an hospital set aside for the poor people.  I think a large hospital could be maintained for the amount of the grant.  That is another aspect of the question which should be inquired into by this suggested Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may be allowed to give some information to Deputy Baxter which the Minister has not available at the moment.  Evidence was given before the Committee on Public Accounts on the matter which answered this question.  It was explained that a Select Committee of the British House of Commons was appointed in 1854, and it allocated grants in the form mentioned in the Estimate, and they have been paid in the same way since 1858 as they are paid at present.  As to the point which Deputy Baxter raises, there was a Committee constituted, called the Board of Superintendence, to keep an <Col N="572" /> eye on the work of these hospitals.  An Act was passed immediately afterwards creating that Board, and that Board still exists.  The person who acts as Secretary is borne on this Vote. The Board of Superintendence is, presumably, the Board of these people managing the hospitals, and there is no supervision of any kind regarding the accounts.  The Auditor-General does not check the accounts, because this is a grant-in-aid, and it is thereby excluded from the supervision, and there is no check of any kind respecting the public supervision over the work of the hospitals.</P>

      <P>I do not understand whether this is going to come within the scope of the inquiry, but it seems to me that we are voting a certain sum annually in aid of the hospitals, and if there is a Board of Superintendence, it would not be too much to expect that the Board would exist and function, and I have no doubt that there are very serious functions to discharge.  If that Board exists, would it not be right that the Ministry should nominate somebody upon it?  It seems to me that it should come within the scope of the work of members of that Board to revise the sums that would be paid to the different hospitals and see whether good value was given.  I am quite well aware of the very valuable work which is done by the hospitals.  I do not know what the amount of control is, but I am inclined to the view that when these contributions are voted here, the Ministry owes a certain duty <Col N="573" /> to the public, and it should have somebody on the Board who would answer to the Ministry and enable the Minister to answer to this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Board was created by 19 and 20 Vic., Clause 110.  The members are not to exceed 12.  They are appointed by the Lord Lieutenant. I presume that now means the Governor-General, and, perhaps, in practice the Minister for Local Government takes his place.  Their duties are to inquire into the due performance of the rules and regulations required to be observed by any Act, charter, testamentary bequest, or bye-law existing in 1856 under any proper authority in any hospital in the City of Dublin supported wholly or in part by moneys appropriated by Parliament for such purposes, and to examine into and report on the state of the buildings, the situation of the patients, the government of the hospitals, and the conduct of officials (Sec. 12).  The Board, or in their default, the Lord Lieutenant, may make general rules for the government of the hospitals.  They make an annual report to the Lord Lieutenant, which is presented to Parliament (Secs. 16-18).  The Lord Lieutenant can appoint a secretary with £150 per annum salary, payable from Votes of Parliament (Sec. 14).  That is the position as it stands.  I have not made any change in the Board of Superintendence since I became Minister, and I do not believe that either of my predecessors did so.  I presume that the Board, which was originally appointed by the Lord Lieutenant, is in existence. If a vacancy arises, the filling of it would, I imagine, be a matter for <Col N="574" /> the Ministry of Local Government or the Governor-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us whether that report has been laid before the Oireachtas for the last two or three years, as he is by statute bound to lay it.  If it is the duty of this Board of Superintendence to report to us as to the conduct of the hospitals, the state of the buildings, the position of the patients and so on, we could get some enlightenment on the general administration, and it would be well to have that before we pass this Vote.  I think that is a very important document that has been read, because, so far, we have not had any notice given of the fact that such a report had been presented to the Oireachtas.  It certainly passed my observation, and I would be very much interested in it if I could have access to it.  I think we should postpone the decision regarding this Vote until we get those reports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I take up the position that this is a grant-in-aid, and that, therefore, it is a donation.  We have just as much right to inquire into the grant in aid of the University, and to appoint our representative there, as we have on this body, and more so.  The grant to the University is a huge one, and the grant to the hospitals is only a small one.  For that reason we should let it pass, for it is getting late.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the grant-in-aid is concerned, I would have no objection, but I would like to have the report of this Board of Superintendence which the Minister is bound to present to us.  I think it would be better if we had that before we pass the vote.  We might be induced then to plead with the Minister for Finance to increase the amounts.</P>

      <P>The document I have read from is dated 1921-22.  There may have been some legislative changes in the interval which may have made this matter unnecessary.  I am not aware that it is so, having seen no report from this Board of Superintendence, and I do not know if such exists. The law may have been completely altered with regard to that.  I do not think it would be fair to hold up the <Col N="575" /> passing of the estimate in anticipation of getting such a report.  If there is such a report I would be quite willing to make it available for Deputy Johnson and the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite serious about this.  There is not a great urgency for passing this vote to-night. It might be left over until later stages of these estimates.  If it is a statutory obligation, as appears from the Minister's statement, that such a report should be presented&mdash;probably it has been presented to the House before 1921&mdash;we should receive it, and should know what is in it.  I think it is quite reasonable that we should have some information from this Board, which presumably is in existence, before we decide that this shall be the sum to be granted according to the statute, because I take it that though there is a statute we could refuse to vote this money.  I think we might defer this matter until the Minister can give some information as to the position of this Board of Superintendence.</P>

      <P>These hospitals have now entered on the current period to which this Vote applies, and if the discussion which has taken place raises some doubts in the minds of the Governors as to the possibility of reduction in income, it may mean that they will have to reconsider the situation. That may react in other directions that might not be desirable, so that however desirable it may be that we should have information with regard to the report, and the appointment <Col N="576" /> of these officials, I certainly would not be in favour of taking any action that might have the result I have indicated.  I think we will all agree that for the current year, at all events, there should be no withholding of the money from these particular hospitals.</P>

I am not in a position to lay my hands on them at the moment.  I think, in view of the fact that they have been presented, Deputy Johnson should allow the Vote to pass, having regard to what Deputy Good has said, that the holding up of it might result in a serious hampering of the work of this Board of Superintendence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    <P>I must apologise for bringing this resolution on at this late date.  The regulation of the International Labour Conference with regard to recommendations is that they ought to be brought before the competent authority within a twelve-month period of the closing date of the Session at Geneva, or in exceptional cases an eighteen-month period.  This is the last day of the eighteen-month period for bringing the recommendations before the competent authority, that is the Oireachtas.  It is not simple neglect that has caused this to be delayed.  In order to show that we are moving on the lines of the general principles with regard to factory inspection, it is necessary that certain appointments should be made or determined on before I came before the House with this recommendation. Deputies may have noticed that in to-day's papers there appears an advertisement with reference to industrial inspectors.  One is to be a woman, and that is in accordance with paragraph three of &ldquo;the organisation of inspection&rdquo; in this recommendation. It was not possible to have steps taken even with regard to the advertising of these appointments until quite recently. This resolution was adopted and agreed to be forwarded for the acceptance of the Oireachtas by the Executive Council some time in March.  The delay since has been due to the fact of not noticing the critical date of the 29th of this month, and having regard to the bringing forward of certain proposals regarding conventions, which appear on the Order Paper to-day, I thought it better to bring the two together.  That is why we come at this late hour to discuss these regulations.</P>
    <P>Recommendations, as distinct from conventions, are supposed to be general affirmations of principles, whereas the conventions are set out in a form which really is the basis of legislation.  With regard to this recommendation the principles affirmed in it are definitely looked to in the carrying out of any inspection that we do under the Factories and Workshops Acts, and consequently the adoption of this recommendation, or the principles which it affirms, will entail no new legislation on our part.  I may say, however, that I do not pretend that the administration of the Acts is quite in accordance with the recommendations here laid down.  But the recommendations are drafted in rather a wide way so as to embrace the conditions of all countries, leaving each country to pick the exact form in which the recommendation will be put in force to suit its own particular needs, so that we are not exactly bound to be completely in line with everything that is stated in this recommendation.  I do, however, admit that the administration of the Factories and Workshops Acts will have to be improved if their administration is to be brought within the scope and the principle of this recommendation. The spirit of the recommendation is a little broader and somewhat more spacious than that in which our Acts have up to this been administered, but that has been due in the main to administrative difficulties which we are surmounting, surmounting slowly, but at any rate surmounting.</P>
    <P>I might point out one or two of these things.  On the second page of this recommendation the paragraph headed &ldquo;I.&mdash;Sphere of Inspection,&rdquo; it is stated &ldquo;That in so far as it may be considered possible and desirable, additional duties may be assigned, provided&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;  The provisions that follow speak of &ldquo;not interfering with the inspectors' principal duties.&rdquo;  From the advertisement published to-day it will be seen that we apply for what are called &ldquo;industrial inspectors,&rdquo; and the heading is &ldquo;under the Factory and Workshop Acts and the Trade Boards Acts.&rdquo;  It is our intention to have them industrial inspectors and not merely factory inspectors.  We do not think that we are contravening the spirit of this particular statement, that additional <Col N="579" /> duties may be put on the inspectors, provided that they do not in any way interfere with the inspectors' principal duties.  We do not think that the duties are in any way contrary: we think that it is not a matter of additions to their duties; it is only a matter of bulking the duties, and that may be met by increasing the number of inspectors, if necessary.  But there is nothing different from the type of work which would make the addition of these duties contravene what is stated in Section I.  In Section II. the nature of the functions and powers are set out under paragraph 5, which states that inspectors should be empowered to bring breaches of the laws which they ascertain directly before the competent judicial authorities. Our representative at this gathering at Geneva voted for this clause, making what was called a reservation, but what was in reality an explanation, showing that there was really no reservation about it.  The reason for the incorporation of that clause appears to have been this, that in certain countries, certainly in France, there are a kind of administrative officers who are more political personages than the type we know here, and it was thought that if they were to be put into interposition to those officials, who are political officials, between the inspector and the actual bringing of the cases before the court political influence might be brought to bear and prosecutions might be stopped.  Our representative, without adverting to this, said that he rather had to reserve the word &ldquo;directly,&rdquo; because, he pointed out, the method adopted here was that when breaches were discovered the inspector initiated the prosecution but the chief State solicitor carried it out.  But when he explained the relations existing between the inspector and the chief State solicitor, and the chief State solicitor in relation to heads of departments, etc., pretty general agreement was expressed that although not in line with the wording of this recommendation, we were actually in line with the spirit of it.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of &ldquo;B. Safety,&rdquo;<Col N="580" /> sub-paragraph (d) states &ldquo;that inspectors should endeavour to promote the improvement and perfecting of measures of health and safety, by the systematic study of technical methods for the internal equipment of undertakings,&rdquo; and so on.  I cannot pretend at the moment, with the limited staff that we have for inspection work, that they have any opportunity for the systematic study of technical methods for internal equipment, and all I say is that if we adopt this we adopt it as something to which we may aim, rather than having any hope of immediately attaining it.</P>
    <P>On Page 4, Paragraph 11, it is stated that, &ldquo;It is essential that experts having competent medical, engineering, electrical or other scientific training and experience should be employed by the State for dealing with such problems.&rdquo; There has been, in practice, a distinction as to the type of inspector appointed for these purposes.  In some cases they are appointed on a functional basis, that is to say, you have one inspector who examines questions dealing with a particular trade and industry, and he attends to matters, such as sanitation and ventilation, in connection with that trade. In other cases you have a division; you have medical inspectors who inquire into such things as sanitation and ventilation in all factories, and you have engineering inspectors who inquire into matters of machinery, and other matters like that, in all factories.  This is one of the points which is simply put in so as to cover pretty well all the conditions operating all over the world.</P>
    <P>The actual reaction in the Saorstát towards this is on somewhat different lines from the principle that I have explained.  We have inspectors, and we obtain the aid of experts of the type mentioned who are associated with other Departments in matters which seem to call for expert inquiry and expert report.  So that we do employ them for dealing with such problems, but they are not employed in the position of inspectors.  They are rather attached to different Departments as experts in certain lines, and they are called upon when the necessity arises.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> Paragraph 12 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That in conformity with the principle contained in Article 427 of the Treaty of Peace, the inspectorate should include women as well as men inspectors; that, while it is evident that with regard to certain matters and certain classes of work inspection can be more suitably carried out by men as in the case of other matters and other classes of work inspection can be more suitably carried out by women, the women inspectors should in general have the same powers and duties and exercise the same authority as the men inspectors, subject to their having had the necessary training and experience, and should have equal opportunity of promotion to the higher ranks.</P>
    <P>It may be noticed that in the advertisement in to-day's papers a lower salary is set out for women inspectors than for men inspectors.  But there is nothing that contravenes Paragraph 12 in that, because there will be the same powers and duties, and I think the same authority, and there will be equal opportunity for promotion to the higher ranks.  It may, however, be argued that if there were the same powers and duties and the same authority, why should there not be the same emoluments?  That comes back to the difficulty of which the Minister for Finance has spoken twice, once in connection with the secondary school teachers, and again in some other connection. The end towards which we are striving with regard to discrimination is, that the discrimination will be on the basis of dependency.  That is, the division will be between married and unmarried.  But until we arrive at that basis of discrimination I have had to proceed, if I want to get my inspectorate staff together at all, on what now operates, and that is, I think unfortunately, a position in which women are paid somewhat lower than men, even although they do the same work and have equal duties.</P>
    <P>Paragraph B, speaks of the qualification of inspectors, and says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is essential that the inspectors should in general possess a high standard of technical training and <Col N="582" /> experience, should be persons of good general education, and by their character and abilities be capable of acquiring the confidence of all parties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And then again it goes on, and says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the inspectorate should be on a permanent basis and should be independent of changes of Government; that the inspectors should be given such a status and standard of remuneration as to secure their freedom from any improper external influences, and that they should be prohibited from having any interest in any establishment which is placed under their inspection.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And, finally:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That inspectors on appointment should undergo a period of probation for the purpose of testing their qualifications.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some of these things we are definitely and actually in line with.  There is a probationary period, and we look forward to having people who possess a high standard of training and experience. There may be some query as to whether the inspectors are being given such a &ldquo;status and standard of remuneration as to secure their freedom from any improper and external influences.&rdquo; They are certainly prohibited from having any interest in any establishment placed under their inspection. Then that raises this question, which will be answered very differently by different people, as to what sum will be necessary to offer in order to secure freedom from any improper external influences.  If it is found that inspectors of the proper type cannot be got for the salaries offered there will have to be a new facing up to that situation.  At any rate, an attempt is now being made to get people for that particular salary. Section C, paragraph 18, states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is desirable that, as far as possible, every establishment should be visited by an inspector for the purposes of general inspection not less frequently than once a year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, of course, we have not been able to act up to by any means.  If our <Col N="583" /> progress with regard to inspection were merely to continue at its present rate I think we should only have an inspection of every establishment once in three years.  But, with the addition of the people now advertised for, we hope to arrive at the position when every establishment will be visited once a year.  Consequently I move the acceptance of this recommendation, stating again that as the principles laid down are generally in accordance with the principles on which our factory inspection is organised, no legislation is required, and also stating for the information of the Dáil that I do admit that in many points the administration of the Acts falls behind the spirit of this recommendation, and that we will simply have to make an attempt to make it progress so as to get it properly in accordance with the spirit of this recommendation.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the Minister has allowed this matter to wait until the last day.  It is not a matter that should be dealt with hastily. I have read it once, and only read it in a very light manner.  I have not yet grasped its full implications.  And I cannot understand it.  The Minister says it does not involve legislation, but it certainly involves the payment of extra officers and extra expense to the State.  I do not take up the position of opposing it, but I state that the Dáil has no time to consider adequately this paper that has been placed before us. There are some points with regard to the general acceptance of such conventions about which I would like to know something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>These recommendations are placed before the different members of the International Labour Organisation.  I would like to know how many other members of the Organisation have accepted this recommendation. I would also like to know does that mean that it will be carried out.  Is it not possible that a great many countries which have no great regard for the carrying out of the promises <Col N="584" /> they make, or even for the carrying out of legislation which they pass, might accept this, as it were, as a pious expression or counsel of perfection, but that they may not carry out the recommendations at all, and that we may find ourselves going to unnecessary expense and trying to live up to promises we have given when some of the other members of that conference may not do so.  As far as I know the International Labour Organisation possesses no power of punishment and has no powers of insisting on its members carrying out the recommendations which they accept.  I do not intend to deal with the matter in detail, nor am I in a position, nor am I, perhaps, capable, of dealing with an industrial question of that kind.  But I would be inclined to say that this country is predominantly agricultural and that industrialism forms so small a part of it that, in view of its financial conditions, it would be inadvisable to accept any recommendations which involve the payment of inspectors and the spending of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that there should be a clear understanding with regard to this proposal.  The motion is that the Dáil approves of the adoption of the recommendation concerning the general principles and the organisation of systems of inspection, and so on; that it approves of the recommendations concerning the general principles, and after a certain number of paragraphs beginning with &ldquo;whereas&rdquo; it concludes: &ldquo;in order to put the experience already gained at the disposal of the members,&rdquo; including Saorstát Eireann,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;with a view to assisting them in the institution of reorganisation of their inspection system, it is desirable to indicate the general principles which practice shows to be the best calculated to ensure uniform, thorough and effective enforcement of conventions and more generally of all measures for the protection of the workers; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having decided to leave to each country the determination of how far these general principles should be <Col N="585" /> applied to certain spheres of activity;</P>
    <P>And taking as a guide the long experience already acquired in factory inspection;</P>
    <P>The General Conference recommends that each member of the International Labour Organisation should take the following principles and rules into consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We know from replies of Ministers to questions how ready they are to say: &ldquo;We will be glad to take this matter into consideration.&rdquo;  They know quite well that it is not binding them to take it into consideration, or that any definite promise to do so has been given. This is not a convention, as the Minister has pointed out; it is a recommendation with regard to the general principles set out, and which the Minister has gone through and touched upon: that we shall at least approve of the general proposition that those principles and rules which have been drawn up by a conference of representatives of many States, and agreed to by that conference, should be taken into consideration in fixing the application of the principles in legislation.  That is surely the least thing that we can do.  The representatives of I do not know how many nations attended the conference and appointed a committee to go into matters very closely.  Prior to the meeting of this conference the various Governments had their expert authorities going into the questions of the principles relating to factory legislation, the protection of workers in factories and workshops, and general questions of inspection.</P>
    <P>Having got all that experience from different parts of the world, having met in conference and committee and discussed intimately and in detail this matter, they agreed that these general principles were such as could be recommended for consideration to all the nations, so as to improve steadily the conditions of the lowest, moving them towards the highest.  These general principles were drawn up and adopted by that conference of all nations, including the Saorstát.  All this motion postulates is that the Dáil approve of the general principles being taken into consideration.  That, I hold, is the very <Col N="586" /> least that the Dáil should do.  While I could probably go as far as others in criticising the way these general principles have been applied in practice in the Saorstát&mdash;because they have not been applied as effectively as I would like&mdash;nevertheless, I think the Dáil ought to agree to the proposition, which is a very mild one, that the principles be taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>We ratified two conventions, and I believe there was one other recommendation.  I am not absolutely certain of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson usually has a good memory in these matters. Perhaps he could enlighten us?  I think there was a recommendation before us, which we approved, with regard to hours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been two conventions ratified, but this is the only convention dealing with inspection of factories.  The conventions we have ratified dealt, in one case, with the rights of association and combination of agricultural workers, and, in the other case, with workmen's compensation in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought we had some convention or recommendation before us which dealt with the period of the working week.  I had an idea that a longer number of hours were recommended by the conference than are worked in a number of our industries. Possibly Deputy Johnson could give us a little information on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that that has been brought forward for definite consideration by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Has such a decision been arrived at?  Deputy Johnson is now moving us on, stage by stage, and he says that these are ideals that we ought to aim at.  Would he give us some information as regards the number of hours that have been decided upon as <Col N="587" /> constituting a working week?  Perhaps we might anticipate the ideal in that respect by getting that information now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to say that the Dáil has not yet even had under consideration the recommendation of the Washington Conference regarding a 48-hour week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Did not this convention that we had before us make a recommendation with regard to the working week?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The International Labour Conference passed a convention with regard to the working week.  That convention was one of the earliest.  In the series of resolutions I have down, I am endeavouring to clear up the old conventions.  The Deputy who reads the resolutions will note that I have omitted the convention with regard to hours.  That is one of four which I have omitted, for the reason that action has not yet been taken regarding the matter.  The others relate to shipping matters, and I am holding them over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to think that these resolutions should all come together.  When Deputy Johnson is urging us to aim at these ideals, I think if this ideal with regard to the working week were included we might look upon the matter a little differently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Deputy is under a misapprehension.  A great variety of conventions have been passed by the International Labour Conference, but they do not deal with inspection of factories.  This convention deals only with the principles governing the inspection of factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Instead of taking this matter up in sections, I think it should be brought up as a whole.  One thing hangs on another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of factory inspection has nothing whatever to do with the restriction of the number of hours in industry.  A convention has been passed by the International <Col N="588" /> Labour Conference which dealt with the number of working hours. Another convention deals with the weekly rest period.  Those are separate and apart one from the other.  This convention stands by itself, and anything that might have elsewhere to be effected by legislation is effected by our present legislation.  We are not dealing with the question of a forty-eight-hour week or a week of any other number of hours.  To meet Deputy Good's idea, I would have to bring up all conventions and recommendations in one mass and, presumably, as new conventions were passed at any succeeding meeting of the International Labour Conference, I should again have to bring up the whole mass, so that the matter could be viewed as the Deputy says, in perspective.  We are only dealing with the question of general principles regarding factory inspection now.  The adoption of those principles involves no new expenditure of money and no new appointments.  If no such recommendation had been passed by the International Labour Conference I should, nevertheless, have to make the appointments which are advertised to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>There are in the hands of the Minister four different recommendations, and two of the four come before us at this stage.  Why should not the whole four come before us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There are about 13 recommendations and 17 conventions. I am bringing forward one recommendation and six conventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are those two singled out?  There is a great deal to be said on this point, and I am not sure that the Minister will not find that legislation is necessary to bring it into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is of that opinion, even though a technical breach of the regulations is being committed with regard to the presentation of those recommendations, I would prefer to run the risk of committing that breach rather than come forward with a recommendation that I was not, in fact, <Col N="589" /> acting up to.  I believe I am acting up to it in present conditions, and on account of the new posts advertised to-day. If the Deputy has any new objection, I would rather have the matter discussed, so that we can go to the International Labour Conference knowing that what has been passed has been deliberately and definitely done by the House.  I move, therefore, that the debate be adjourned until to-morrow, after Estimates.</P>
