      <P>The amount of compensation awarded by the Compensation (Ireland) Commission in this case was £860, with interest at 5 per cent. from 31st May, 1920, and £78 10s. costs, and, as no portion of the award was subject to a reinstatement condition, the award was duly discharged by the issue of a paying order for £1,045 6s. 5d. to Major Webb's solicitors on 2nd October, 1923.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied on the evidence before me that Mr. Wall's resignation from the Royal Irish Constabulary in August, 1921, was caused by his national sympathies, and I have, <Col N="602" /> therefore, felt unable to authorise the grant to him of a pension under Section 5 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923.</P>

      <P>The application in this case was not made until 12th May, 1924, and was, therefore, too late to be considered by the Committee of Inquiry into Resignations and Dismissals from the Royal Irish Constabulary, which presented its final report in July, 1923.  I have, however, recently decided to consider the case, and the application is at present under investigation.</P>

    <P>Of these, 18,152 have been allowed; 967 have been disallowed because the applicants had no unexhausted contributions to their credit; 912 were disallowed, either because less than 12 contributions had been paid in respect of the applicants since the commencement of the Act, or because the applicants were disqualified under the first part of Section 8 (4) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, and the disqualification had not been removed by the payment of 12 further contributions; 193 were disallowed on other statutory grounds; and 6,040 claims recently made were still awaiting decision on the 9th November.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he can state the number of employees (of all grades) in the service of the Great Southern Railways Company on January 1st, 1925, the number employed on full time on September 30th, 1925, and the number working short time on that date; how many employees have so far been rendered redundant as a result of the operation of the Railways Act, 1924, to what grades they belong, and by what companies they were employed previous to January 1st, 1925, and also whether compensation has been paid in accordance with the terms laid down in the 3rd Schedule of the Act.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Great Southern Railways Company that the position is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of employees of all grades in the service of the Companies <Col N="605" /> now constituting the Great Southern Railways on the 1st January, 1925, was 17,447.  On 30th September, 1925, 13,022 employees were working on full time, and 3,508 were working on short time.  The number of employees so far rendered redundant as the result of the operation of the Railways Act, 1924, is 250.  Particulars of the grades and employing companies prior to 1st <Col N="606" /> January, 1925, involve much detail, and I would propose to circulate them with the Official Report.  Compensation in accordance with the terms of the 3rd Schedule of the Railways Act, 1924, has been paid to a large number of the men concerned, and further claims in this connection are under investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCULLOUGH</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil approves of the representations made by the Executive Council to the Boundary Commission regarding the provisions of Article 12 of the Treaty as set out in the President's reply to Deputy Johnson on Wednesday, 11th November, 1925.</P>
      <P>The motion standing in my name arises out of the answer given by the President to Deputy Johnson on the 11th of this month pointing out that representations had been made by the Executive Council as to their views of the meaning of Clause 12 of the Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland.  I suppose I have no right to suggest what reason prompted Deputy Johnson to put the question, but I venture to assume that it was because of reports appearing in the Press uttering suggested solutions or a suggested line as to the result of the Boundary Commission findings.  Evidently the same reports exercised the minds of the people in Tirconaill, judging by the amount of correspondence, resolutions, telegrams, etc., that have reached myself and other Deputies.  These reports have caused what amounts to consternation in the minds of the people in the border counties.  That may not be justified by the result, and perhaps it may seem premature to raise this question merely upon the appearance of predictions in the public Press, given without authority.  But it seems to me that when you have had a volume of expressions of opinion, amounting to what I may almost call propaganda, by the other parties to this problem, it is time to raise it in the Dáil and to get an expression of opinion, a clear expression of opinion, from the Dáil as to what its view of the meaning of Clause 12 of the Treaty is.  As a matter of fact, I have come to the conclusion that it is overdue; that the Dáil in general, and Tirconaill Deputies in particular, and not the Tirconaill Deputies alone but the Deputies from all the Border counties, have remained silent overlong on this matter, and that they have allowed a march to be stolen on them by the people of the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="610" /> Taking human nature into consideration, it is quite probable that the amount of propaganda done against our view of the meaning of Clause 12 of the Treaty may have an effect upon those who are engaged in drawing the Boundary line.  Consequently, I think the Dáil, without equivocation, should, as clearly as it can, express an endorsement of the views set out by President Cosgrave in his reply to Deputy Johnson. It is quite possible that the Government may not approve entirely of my bringing this motion before the Dáil.  They are, perhaps, in a difficult position and they have a huge responsibility in this matter.  They may not desire that any pre-discussion should be given to a question which is at present under consideration by another body. But I would say that no less than the Government and the Ministers, Deputies have responsibilities also to their constituents, responsibilities and duties not less important in degree, at all events, to their constituents, than have Ministers to the Dáil and to the country. For that reason I have found it necessary to bring forward this motion.  I am moving it in response to practically a unanimous request from all over Tirconaill and Monaghan and various other parts of the northern end of the Saorstát. I am doing it in response to that request and probably it might be said that I am playing the game of the politician in order to meet the outcry in my constituency by moving in this matter.  Well, I am doing it in pursuance of my duty as a Deputy and in response to requests amounting to demands that I have received from all over the North.</P>
    <P>Statements have appeared in the Press recently, made by Sir James Craig, a responsible man in the Six Counties, giving definite assurances to meetings of various people there&mdash;the last was a meeting of the Orange Order &mdash;that they would be satisfied with the result of the Boundary Commission. Similar assurances have been given by practically every Minister in his Cabinet at various times at meetings throughout the Six Counties.  We have not received any similar assurances from any side that our interests will be satisfied by the Report of the Boundary <Col N="611" /> Commission.  Ministers assure us that they are not in a position to do so, that their nominee on the Boundary Commission has kept strictly to his undertaking to keep inviolate the proceedings of the Boundary Commission. I have no fault to find with the carrying out of that pledge and undertaking provided that similar good faith is kept by other persons who are associated with that Commission.  I accept the word of the Ministers in this matter, that they have no information to give the Dáil or the country as to what the probable findings of the Commission will be.  President Cosgrave, in his reply has assured us that he has made representations, both oral and written, as to the view the Executive Council take on the rendering of Clause 12 of the Treaty.  But in the absence of any assurances of a similar or comparable kind to those given in the Six Counties, there should be an expression of opinion from Dáil Eireann that it has not altered its view as to the attitude or point of view it takes of the rendering of Clause 12 of the Treaty.  My motion is down here to-day in the hope that the Dáil, and every Deputy in the Dáil, will by its and their vote affirm again their view that Clause 12 of the Treaty was to change the Boundary in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants of the border areas.  It is a motion framed in words that make it possible for every Deputy of whatever complexion to support it by his vote. It is a motion that I venture to say no Deputy of Dáil Eireann, having taken the oath to the Constitution, dare vote against.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I hope there will be unanimous support from every Deputy in this House for the point of view put forward by the Executive Council: that the wishes of the inhabitants are to be considered and that there is no power inherent in Clause 12 of the Treaty to give to anybody the right to take any part of the territory of the Saorstát from it.  We have also the answer given in this House by the President, in which he stated that the Government were prepared to accept the findings of the Boundary Commission. Some people hold the view that <Col N="612" /> that is binding the hands of this Government and this House.  I do not hold that view at all, and I press the point of view which I am going to put before the House as the correct point of view and the correct attitude to take towards this matter, namely, that the acceptance of any decision of the Boundary Commission that is not in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants, ascertained how it may be, is not a fulfilment of Clause 12 of the Treaty and is not a finding in accordance with the powers given to the Boundary Commission by Clause 12 of the Treaty and, consequently, that it absolves the Executive Council from any responsibility for its findings.  Any finding of the Boundary Commission that is not in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants is a grave breach of faith with our people in the Six Counties.  It is a breach of faith inasmuch as Ireland was assured in general, and they were assured in particular by all those who supported the Treaty, that under Clause 12 the people along the Border who desired to come under the jurisdiction of this Government would be enabled by the operations of the Boundary Commission, to change their allegiance to this Government if they so desired.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that the Nationalists of Ulster made sacrifices no less great and no less continuous than the sacrifices that were made by every other part of Ireland to achieve the freedom that we now enjoy and to set up the Government under which this country now works.  The Nationalists of Ulster took no small part in the movement, in the work, in the sufferings and in the sacrifices that brought about the Treaty with England and which gave us the free institutions we now enjoy in the Saorstát&mdash;free institutions which we in the Twenty-Six Counties enjoy, but which they do not enjoy, free institutions for us, but a disimprovement of the position for them, with an alteration of affairs that has left them worse than they were under the British regime.  For these services, for these sacrifices and for this loyalty to Ireland, the people on the Border and in the Six-Counties in general are entitled to the consideration <Col N="613" /> of this House.  I would think that Ireland was not worthy of my loyalty if I thought that the people of the other Twenty-Six Counties, no matter how remote they may be from the Border problem in point of distance, felt no obligations towards their fellow-countrymen in the Six Counties&mdash;I would feel that Ireland was entitled to no loyalty from me if I thought that the rest of the country would sit down in selfish contentment under the measure of freedom that they had obtained and leave their fellow-countrymen in the Six Counties under a form of Government and under government institutions which they find irksome and tyrannical.</P>
    <P>I hold it is a debt of honour which the people of the Saorstát, and particularly the Government of the Saorstát, owes to the people in the border counties. Ireland won the measure of freedom which we now have because the people stood together, sharing their sacrifices and sharing their efforts.  An injury to one was an injury to all in that great movement, down even to the very groups of men in the prison camps at the time.  All acted together, and there was no question as to what part of Ireland you came from, because they all stood for one cause and all were prepared to take their share in whatever the result might be.  Consequently, when these people are left out of the operations of the free institutions that have come to the Saorstát it is our duty and our honour to see to it that as far as we can they are not cheated out of the full and beneficent effects of the Treaty as applied to other parts of Ireland.  Therefore, I do not alone move this motion as a Deputy from Tirconaill.  I move it as a duty of honour to that part of Ireland from which I come and to those people who worked with me and helped to bring about freedom for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Born in Belfast myself I understand and appreciate the feelings of the people.  I understand and appreciate the desire they have to come under the jurisdiction of this Government.  I understand and appreciate the disabilities under which they labour under the partisan Government that exists in the Six Counties.  Consequently, I feel <Col N="614" /> that the duty incumbent on me is a duty of honour to get what support I can for the view held by the Executive Council that no part of the territory of Saorstát Eireann can be taken from it to be placed under the jurisdiction of another Government, and that, further, the wishes of the inhabitants in those areas near the border who desire to come under the jurisdiction of this Government shall not go unheeded.</P>
    <P>On St. Stephen's Night, 1921, I was sent to Dublin from Belfast in company with the late Commandant Joe McKelvey to interview Mr. Griffith and General Collins as to what the position of the people there was under the Treaty, and to ascertain their views on the matter and give our point of view and our allegiance if we were satisfied. General Collins had no difficulty whatever in assuring Commandant McKelvery and myself that Clause 12 of the Treaty was a clause which would enable every part of the Six Counties near the borders of the Saorstát, and where the majority of the people desidred, to come under the jurisdiction of the Saorstát Government&mdash;he assured us that Clause 12 of the Treaty would offer means whereby they would be enabled to change their allegiance, or at least enable them to give their allegiance to this Government.  When discussing the matter at full length, he explained to me in particular how this clause was arrived at, and why the subsidiary sentences were put in&mdash; those relating to economic and geographic considerations.  That is the reason, and the only one, that induced our delegates to agree to the subsequent conditions.</P>
    <P>It may be no harm to take a short survey of the whole story of partition, because many interests are endeavouring to make political capital out of the position that might arise in the event of a non-satisfactory report being issued by the Boundary Commission. Many resolutions have been sent to me by people condemning myself and other Deputies representing the Border counties for the results, or the supposed results, of the Commission's findings. I just want to set out here, so that the public should be reminded of it, that neither Deputies in this House nor the <Col N="615" /> Government nor the signatories to the Treaty were responsible for partition. They did not make partition.  They found partition made for them by England, and in England, and presented as a <i>fait accompli</i> to the delegates who were discussing the whole Anglo-Irish Treaty.  Early when the first suggestion was made in favour of it to the House of Commons by Mr. Agar Robartes, no support could be found for it.  But his suggestion germinated subsequently in the minds of British politicians when Home Rule was in the making as offering a way by which they could still keep control of Ireland. The matter was raised subsequently. I remember a meeting being held in the County Tyrone by Mr. F.E. Smith, now Lord Birkenhead, and Lord Carson. Mr. Smith made a tentative reference to the cutting off of the Ulster counties from the rest of Ireland, and the huge monster meeting he was addressing received that suggestion in complete and dead silence.  Not one voice at the whole meeting was raised in support of it, and so cold and frigid was the reception it got that Sir Edward Carson, rising to his feet afterwards, in order to put heart into the crowd, said: &ldquo;We do not consider north or south, east or west; we want only Ireland and we will not have Home Rule&rdquo;; and in response to that statement the crowd rose in enthusiasm. That was the denunciation of partition.  It came again from the Buckingham Palace Conference, but it was partly baptised in St. Mary's Hall, Belfast, and it then became a reality in the political problems of this country.</P>
    <P>Six or seven months before the Treaty was signed the Parliament in Belfast was opened with ceremonial panoply by the King of England, and partition was then an accomplished fact.  It is well to remember this, and I state it in reply to some of the many resolutions I have received from various bodies.  We have Mr. de Valera making utterances at present, as appears from the Press, speaking of the Government of a Republic for all Ireland. This question was almost made <Col N="616" /> concrete by a statement from Mr. de Valera that there would be no coercion for Ulster.  Why I have never been able to understand.  While all Ireland was to be coerced, crushed and battered in the most ruthless campaign ever raised against a white people, Mr de Valera publicly stated there could be no coercion for Ulster.  I do not want coercion for Ulster.  I never did, but why the leader of a people who were coerced in every act of their lives should absolve or remove from the possibilities and the necessities of the case some coercion to be applied to a minority standing out against the majority and against the will of the people of the rest of Ireland I never could understand.</P>
    <P>Further, it may be interesting to note that the Dáil Cabinet, when considering the terms of the Treaty when it was being negotiated, did accept in principle partition, and no voice was raised against it there.  Consequently, it is too late for those people to attack either the Deputies in this House or the Government for partition.  It is too late for them to try to get back to safe ground and make their attacks upon us as if we were the responsible parties for it.  We are not.  Further, I may say that this difficulty would have been solved, in my personal opinion and to my personal knowledge, had not certain people in Ireland started raging like mad bulls and turned the country into a welter of strife and war.  This is a question that far transcends in importance for Ireland any other question arising out of the Treaty, and this question would have been settled by agreement with the people of the Six Counties to come in under one Parliament for all Ireland.  Throughout the whole of the negotiations that gave rise to partition everything in turn has been ceded to the people of the Six Counties.  The first suggestion was that four counties only would be cut off from the rest of Ireland.  Then again it was suggested that areas would be taken and plebiscites got, and that those areas that declared for separate Government for the North would go under, and those who declared for the Government of the rest of Ireland would come in under that Government. <Col N="617" /> Correspondence was carried on between Mr. Lloyd George and Sir James Craig in which these points were discussed, but finally, when the matter was settled, the Ulster Unionist Council and their supporters in England had their way as usual and the Six Counties were cut out.  Two of these counties had majorities in each opposed to their inclusion under the Six-County Government, and now under Clause 12 they want to push the matter even further.</P>
    <P>They want further concessions given to them.  They want further concessions of territory to increase in extent and to strengthen economically the area they are in possession of.  I see by to-day's Press that they are asking, further, that compensation should be given to those of their people in territory taken off them and that they should be enabled to move back under the jurisdiction of the Six-County Government.  I think it is time that these people recognised that they have equal rights with the other people of Ireland and no more.  I think it is time they recognised that they are going to have equal rights and no more&mdash;that the vote of one Irishman is as good as that of another, and that the old and bad tradition descending to us from the British occupation of this country must pass away for ever. When one considers what the position of Nationalists under Sir James Craig's Government is, it is no wonder if consternation and alarm spreads over the border counties at the suggestion that any portion of their territory should be brought under that Government. In County Tyrone protests have been made by responsible men that such a division of the county has been made by the Government that it takes practically four Nationalist votes to equal one Unionist vote. Gerrymandering has been carried to a fine art there and our people are in such a position that they are not represented in the Six-County Parliament in anything approaching their numbers and importance.  All the principles of democracy have been reversed and a property qualification has been substituted for the personal one.  In the Senate not even one seat would be ceded to the minority.  It was said by <Col N="618" /> one member that it would be a good thing in politics and a good thing in fact to have given one seat to the minority in the Senate, but they found that was not possible either.  Not even minor jobs, like probationary nurses, fall to the lot of the minority, except in exceptional circumstances.  Nationalists in the Six Counties to-day are in a worse position than the Catholics were in Ireland in the penal times.  There is no reason whatever why we should abandon those on the Border who desire to come under our jurisdiction. There is no reason why we should abandon them if we can obtain for them justice and right under Clause 12 of the Treaty.  When, one contrasts the policy existing in the Six Counties with the policy of this Government, I think a further reason is given and further backing is forthcoming for the clamant desire of the people on the Border to get under the jurisdiction of this Government and for those who are under it to remain under it.  We have, in this State, testimonies to fair dealing and fair play, without any regard to religion, status or politics.  Indeed you have one section of the country stating from the housetops that the Government have handed over the control of the country to their opponents &mdash;to those who differ from them in politics and religion.  I do not accept that view, but still it is evidence to every one that this Government endeavours to give justice and fair play to all within the borders of the State, as far as they humanly can and as far as they control the exercise of the functions of government.</P>
    <P>I would refer again to the statements made by Sir James Craig and to his assurances to the last meeting of the Orange Order in Ulster&mdash;assurances that they would be fully satisfied with the report of the Boundary Commission. If the Boundary Commission reported as was forecasted in the &ldquo;Morning Post,&rdquo; they would have every reason to be satisfied with the report, because it would strengthen Sir James Craig's Government in every particular. But it would do something more terrible, something fatal&mdash;it would stereotype partition for our time and possibly for all time.  It would <Col N="619" /> give an economic background to the towns and cities that rightly belong to this part of the country.  It would give to us, as somebody said, the best grouse-shooting in Ireland and very little else.  It would give to us, on that showing, bits of territory which are practically made up of mountain land and which, where habitable at all, provide only for uneconomic holdings. These bits of territory would serve, perhaps, chiefly to make an addition to our Old Age Pension list.  If it were thinkable at all&mdash;I hold it is not and cannot be&mdash;that any pant of the county which I have the honour to represent should be partitioned&mdash;it is suggested that the eastern part of the county be taken from the jurisdiction of this Government&mdash;you would have two results.  You would oblige the city of Derry, which contains a majority of inhabitants favourable to this Government and opposed to Sir James Craig's Government, to continue under the jurisdiction of the Craig Government, which it desires to escape from, and you would give it a territorial hinterland which would enable it to carry on where, as now, it is practically broken down.  You would take from Donegal County portion of the richest part of that county.  East Donegal contains the best land in Donegal and possibly some of the best tillage land in Ireland.  In extent and value, this land forms a considerable part of the rateable valuation of the county.  If any considerable part of that territory were filched away from us, I say here that it would be impossible for the county administration to carry on.  It would be impossible for the County Council to carry on the public institutions which it now has under its control, and it would add a burden to the rest of the county that would be impossible to bear.  If such a thing were thinkable, or if any responsible member of this Government were to give pre-acceptance to a finding such as forecasted in the &ldquo;Morning Post,&rdquo; I say it would strike a death-blow at the peace of this country and at the life of this Government. It would achieve a result that would not make for the unity of the country. <Col N="620" /> It would achieve a result that would bring weakness to the Government and weakness to the country.  It would be bad policy for the present and disastrous policy for the future.  It would be a breach of faith with our people in the Six Counties, and I believe that it would be a breach of faith engineered by English statesmei.  I say that because of the public utterances of some of the English representatives at the Anglo-Irish Treaty Conference. If the facts are what I have stated here, there is no doubt about what the intention of the signatories was at the time of the signing of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Later on, when these men find themselves out of office, under the pressure of that small, but extremely small, section in England who have always hated Ireland and hate it moreintensely now because of the freedom that Irishmen have attained, they make statements about Clause 12 of the Treaty contrary to the views expressed to me by General Collins fresh from the Conference. I do not say this because of any policy of hate of England or of hate of the Six-County Government. I recognise that no good thing can be built upon a foundation of hate, that any policy built upon hate is built upon sand, and that it cannot last or bear good fruit.  I say it because I desire that we should have lasting good relations with England, that we should have amity and peace and progress, that we should get definitely and finally down to some relations with our countrymen of all colours in the Six Counties that would enable us, in the fulness of time, to bring about genuine unity in the country.  I say it because I recognise that there is more than a community of interest between our fellow-countrymen in the North and ourselves and that there is at least a community of interest between ourselves and the English people.  It is because I recognise that community of interest and that I recognise that this country's progress and prosperity will be added to and strengthened by a proper understanding and by a peaceful condition of affairs in our relations with England, that I desire to see this Boundary question settled in a way <Col N="621" /> that will bring some peace of mind to the people concerned&mdash;that will not perpetuate injustice and create further hatreds, further bickerings and further strife in this land of ours.  If any such unthinkable finding as was forecasted in the Press were to be brought about, it would destroy all hope of peace and unity in our time.  It would set passion again raging in the land and re-create the bitterness, the ill-feeling and the hate which we desire to allay.  Consequently, if for no higher purpose than interest alone, it is the duty of this Government and of the Dáil to see, as far as they can see, that the Boundary Commissioners are fully impressed with what we were led to believe was the true and proper rendering of Clause 12 of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>I venture to say that the Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland would never have passed Dáil Eireann were it not for the recommendations made by those who were responsible for it, that the wishes of the inhabitants in the Border areas would be taken into consideration when the Boundary Commission was set up.</P>

      <P>That is a matter of point of view.  I do not care what the area taken is.  It can be by county or by electoral areas, or by another unit that may be decided upon. If the counties are taken into consideration, even judging by the election which took place in the Counties Tyrone and Fermanagh since the Six-County Government was set up, there would be a majority of inhabitants in these two counties who would claim to come under the jurisdiction of this Government.  I do not desire to set myself up as a judge in this matter, or <Col N="622" /> to say what area shall be selected or what area shall be taken as a unit to ascertain the wishes of the inhabitants. I merely state the principle and leave the working out of the matter to those who are responsible for it.</P>
      <P>To return to my point, that the representations made by those who were responsible for the Treaty when it was signed induced members of Dáil Eireann to vote for the Treaty in Dáil Eireann, in the belief that that common measure of right and justice&mdash;self-determination&mdash;would be accorded to the people concerned.  Therefore, I return to the point that it is an obligation of honour on us who enjoy the free institutions of Saorstát Eireann to see that faith is kept with our people on the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may be asked what I propose should happen if the findings be not in accordance with the principles I have endeavoured to set out here.  The opinion expressed by all those who have written to me and in the volume of resolutions that has reached me, is that this Government should withdraw its representative from the Boundary Commission rather than sign a document that would take away one inch of territory from the Saorstát, that would not in some measure carry out the representations which the Executive Council made to the Boundary Commission, that would not take into consideration, in accordance with Clause 12 of the Treaty, the wishes of the inhabitants in coming to a decision as to the territory to be transferred. There might follow, perhaps, a report by two members of the Boundary Commission. I am not going to prejudge what may happen, nor am I going to prognosticate what action should be taken, but whoever else is responsible for such an unthinkable result it should not be the responsibility of this Government.  The responsibility should be placed, if necessary, where it belongs, and should not be in any measure shared or taken part in by the representative of this Government.  We may be threatened that many things will happen.  Many things will happen, both in regard to the Treaty position and the Government position. as a result of any such action.  But, I <Col N="623" /> think matters have progressed too far to allow us to go back, and our obvious duty is to see that the Executive Council are strengthened, as far as this House can strengthen them, in any action they may take to secure justice and right, and that a true interpretation of Clause 12 is given in the considerations of the Boundary Commission.</P>
    <P>I have been asked about the areas by Deputy Johnson.  I have mentioned two county areas.  I would mention the towns of Newry, Omagh, Strabane, and Derry.  Every one of these towns desires by majority of its population to be transferred under the jurisdiction of this Government.  Newry has a strong and absolute claim to be taken under the Government of her choice, and not to be continued under a Government to which she is opposed.  Enniskillen, while not holding such a strong Nationalist majority, has a majority in favour of the Saorstát Government.  Omagh has an undoubted majority, and all its past traditions and outlook would point to its desire to come under the jurisdiction of this Government.  The same may be said of Strabane, in a greater measure, because the economic life of Strabane has been practically brought to a standstill by the Boundary at its doors, and of Derry, whose whole economic life is admittedly coming to a dead-stop as a natural result of the Boundary, because I think it is a truism in commercial life that trade moves westwards, and in all these towns and the city of Derry their area of business activity lies to the west and entirely over the Border in Saorstát Eireann.  Consequently, from economic considerations alone on the part of these towns and the city of Derry, there will be no hesitation whatever in their desire for transference to this Government's jurisdiction.  Nor geographically can it be said that Derry is bound to the Northern Government. Derry City proper is on the Donegal side of the Foyle, and is in County Donegal geographically.  Strabane is at its very door.  Omagh is across the river.  Enniskillen has a natural boundary which should bring it in with Fermanagh.  The same may be said of Newry.  I do not want to act as a <Col N="624" /> prophet here as to what would result if any such finding as was forecasted by the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; was brought in by the Boundary Commission, but I venture to say there would result a state of affairs that at least would not be desirable.  I know already that threats are being made.  Threats of trouble are made by those who are threatened with removal from the jurisdiction of this Government, and, while I recognise that this Government can probably deal with any difficulty that may arise, I say the position will not be a happy one, or one that they can look forward to with pleasure.  In the case of any trouble, the Border would be the rallying ground for every discontented element in the Twenty-six Counties, and it is quite possible that a fire may be lit that would present grave difficulty in extinguishing. While certainly for my part I would desire to say nothing now or hereafter that would inflame passions or encourage any tendency in that direction, I venture to give a warning that unless the representations made by the Executive Council are taken into consideration by the Boundary Commissioners, and unless the wishes of the inhabitants are consulted, the result may be a disastrous one for Saorstát Eireann. It may be a disastrous one for the whole country, and it may bring about results on both sides of the Border that we would long regret.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  As a Deputy who voted for the Treaty in January, 1922, I did so mainly because it contained Article 12.  Many others did the same That Treaty would have no possibility of being accepted were it not that it contained Article 12 and the interpretation of that Article then was as is laid down now by our Executive.</P>
      <P>That Article provided for the setting up of a Commission to fix the Boundary should Belfast opt out within a month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such a Boundary was to be fixed according to the wishes of the inhabitants unless these were found in conflict with economy or geography.  Belfast opted out.  The Commission was set up over twelve months ago.  It is now nearing the end of its labours and no steps have been, we are told, either <Col N="625" /> proposed or taken to ascertain the wishes of the inhabitants concerned.</P>
    <P>Bear in mind this was the fundamental basis on which the Boundary was to be fixed as laid down in this Article of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Under a British Act passed in 1920, without either acceptance or consultation, an arbitrary Boundary was formulated. This was drawn so as to give the maximum area to Belfast that it could hope to control with a composite majority, and such an area was constituted by attaching to Belfast and Antrim, where they had tolerably large majorities, communities on the Border line fiercely opposed to them, such as in Derry City, Tyrone, Fermanagh, Armagh, Newry and Down.</P>
    <P>Article 12 was designed to relieve these Border areas by giving them rights of transfer according to the wishes of their inhabitants through the Boundary Commission.</P>
    <P>Though this still left area majorities of our people marooned in the Northern Enclosure in the Glens of An-trim, South Derry and West Belfast, to which economy and geography would deny transfer, it was accepted in the circumstances by us that it might at least to some extent be counterbalanced by similar areas on our side of the Border.</P>
    <P>Any attempt now to diddle with this, the most important provision of the Treaty, would be absolutely disastrous, and should our representative envisage any such possibility he must at once either be recalled or withdraw himself from the Commission.</P>
    <P>Any accordance of sanction for transfers short of what the Treaty ordains, or any denial of right to transferable areas to have the wishes of their inhabitants ascertained and acted on, or any attempt to force any areas out of the jurisdiction they prefer, would spell utter ruin for the whole country as well as total violation of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Should anything so diabolical be deemed in contemplation, then our representative has no alternative but to at once withdraw and break up such a Commission.</P>
    <P>Much better the present Border than any change denying self-determination <Col N="626" /> to majorities for the Free State on the Northern side of the Border.</P>
    <P>If the wishes of the inhabitants, according to Article 12, decides the Boundary, all will be well; but if such wishes are flouted or ignored, then Article 12 will have obviously been over-ridden, the Treaty violated, and the consequences immeasurable.</P>
    <P>A London and Belfast newspaper canard was put in circulation recently, hinting at the possibility of County Donegal being involved, a county 90 per cent. Nationalist.  Any attempt to interfere with the integrity of the Co. Donegal would surely be a limit in audacity.  To propose cutting out of Donegal the area as suggested by these newspaper-men would leave Donegal economically paralysed.</P>
    <P>To order through this Commission the armed Specials of the Northern Government to overrun East Donegal, or any portion of Innishowen, to replace our unarmed civil forces and Guards, with the good relationship as now existing between our law-abiding people, would be nothing less than an outrage justifying the most determined resistance.  I wish solemnly to warn the Government that any acceptance of any such decision or even any neglect to withdraw our representative before any such stage could be reached, would spell absolute disaster to the Government, to the Treaty, and to the whole country.</P>
    <P>I at least am satisfied from the answer of the President to Deputy Johnson, as referred to in this motion, that no such decision will be permitted to reach any stage that would forebode or contemplate possible acceptance of or permission for the perpetration of such an outrageous atrocity.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCullough has travelled over the field widely, and I think he has dealt with it in a very capable and wise way.  The question is one of the most serious importance for the Government and the country, and it now falls upon our Executive Council to take serious note of their responsibilities and to see, if any such proposal emanates from a Commission of the kind, that they at least keep themselves free to be able to take such action as will enable the country to save itself from the irretrievable <Col N="627" /> disaster that such a decision would entail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. WHITE Mr. WHITE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to take part in this discussion with a considerable amount of diffidence, because I realise the difficult and delicate position in which the Government finds itself, and in such an issue perhaps &ldquo;silence is golden&rdquo; for men like myself.  I have recognised from the start that no Boundary Commission will settle this vexed question, and that when the Boundary Commission did not assemble within three months of the signing of the Treaty it was simply asking for trouble to assemble it afterwards.  Accordingly, if the Free State loses any territory now I will put the blame first on those people who came to Dublin jumping down the Government's throat for a Boundary Commission which was sure to do more harm than good, because the Free State would only have one member against two who had been given unlimited powers to interpret a very vague clause.</P>
      <P>It does not require much political prescience to see that whatever chance we had of a fair decision from a Boundary Tribunal set up immediately after the Treaty, we had absolutely none after the civil war and the events that occurred in 1922 and 1923.  What I blame the Government for is that they should have bound themselves in advance to accept the decision of the Commission under these circumstances, and I maintain that this agreement must be repudiated if decisions are given such as are indicated in the forecasts which were published last week, and which indicate decisions against evidence and against facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is said this is a judicial Commission. I deny it is a judicial Commission. Is Professor MacNeill, for whose work for Irish and ancient Irish history I have the greatest esteem, a jurist?  Is Mr. Fisher, the Belfast representative, a jurist?  Both gentlemen are no doubt very eminent in their own lines, but I would not accept the judicial decision of either of them even in the case of a breach of warranty of a cow.  This is not an ordinary case between Tom, Dick and Harry, <Col N="628" /> but a case where the lives and fortunes of thousands of Catholic people are concerned and where arbitrators are appointed to decide their fate.  This, therefore, is an arbitration Commission and the attempt to make it appear that it is a judicial Commission is only trying to throw dust in our eyes and to impose a silence on our representative which is not observed elsewhere.  This attempt to wrap the proceedings of the Commission in mystery has not prevented Belfast from getting information. Otherwise, how would Sir James Craig be able to announce, as he did the other day, that the Orange Party was certain to be satisfied with the findings of the Commission?  You have Sir Robert Anderson, one of the members for County Derry, in Coleraine on Friday or Saturday last saying: &ldquo;If certain things happen, and I trust they won't, then you may take it that the Prime Minister and the members of the Government will hand in their resignation and take the field.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sorry to throw doubt on the integrity of the Commission, but its whole procedure from the start leaves no other alternative.  Although the point was raised at the very beginning that they had no jurisdiction over Free State territory, they postponed taking a decision on this point; they postponed the interpretation of their terms of reference until all evidence was taken, and they took no steps whatever to ascertain the wishes of the inhabitants of the areas affected.  In fact every act of the Commission has been without precedent in boundary-making commissions.  That is why people are so uneasy and are inclined to regard the forecast of the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; as fairly accurate.  If the border outlined in these forecasts is anything like correct, then the Commission will have violated the people's will and ignored every consideration of economics and geography, and the duty of the Government is to take steps immediately to burst up the Commission, or, in the language of Mr. Lloyd George, to &ldquo;torpedo&rdquo; it.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, say that the first duty of the Government is to safeguard the nation's honour and interests and to <Col N="629" /> see that the Boundary Commission, which was designed to implement the Treaty and to complete its work by the emancipation of the Catholics of the North, is not turned into an instrument of further aggression and an excuse for the turbulent elements in this country to throw us back into the bloodshed and turmoil from which we have emerged.</P>

      <P>I have submitted an amendment, but before reading it I want to say that the motion put forward by Deputy McCullough asks us to approve of representations which we have not seen and do not know the purport of, beyond the very bald statement made by the President in answer to a question of mine.  But the course of the discussion so far indicates that in the minds of those who are interested a question of at least equal importance is that which is not touched upon in the motion: that is to say, the ascertainment of the wishes of the inhabitants. Also, I might say, particularly from Deputy McCullough's speech, that though the motion would in his view safeguard the interests of those people for whom he speaks in his own constituency, it would have no effect whatever&mdash;it would not even indicate that in the minds of Deputies or of the Dáil there was any thought of the position of the inhabitants of the Six Counties.  The amendment which I have submitted is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the words &ldquo;That the Dáil&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;knowing that the wishes of the inhabitants referred to in Article 12 of the Treaty have not been ascertained and that no decision of the Boundary Commission unless it is in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants can be recognised as a fulfilment of the said Article, deprecates any agitation to influence public feeling on either side of the existing boundary on the question of the transfer of territory which would distract the people's attention from the failure on the part of the two Governments to deal effectively with the problems <Col N="630" /> of unemployment and the depression in agriculture and industry.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>These words are preceded by a Preamble and followed by a reason.  The amendment is not relevant to the motion. The motion is:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil approves of the representations made by the Executive Council to the Boundary Commission regarding the provisions of Article 12 of the Treaty as set out in the President's reply to Deputy Johnson on Wednesday, 11th November, 1925.</P>
      <P>The motion is definite.  The amendment is about a different matter, &ldquo;Deprecation of agitation to inflame public feeling.&rdquo;  That is one of the reasons why the amendment seems to me to be out of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If Deputies refer to the discussion whch took place in the Dáil in June, 1924, when the Bill amending the Treaty&mdash;as I contended an entirely unconstitutional <Col N="631" /> proceeding in the circumstances&mdash;was under discussion, in reply to my opposition to that Bill Minister after Minister said that the Boundary Commission was to draw up its definition of the Boundary according to the wishes of the inhabitants.  We have to assume that until the Boundary Commission ascertains the wishes of the inhabitants it cannot draw up any report affecting the Boundary which can be recognised as valid.  That is the position of the Government.  If it is not, I hope they will state it.  That being the position of the Government, is it wise to add fuel to the agitation that is being waged on the other side of the Border, and that has begun to be waged on the Saorstát side of the Border on this question, which, in the Minister's submission and in my submission, cannot be a matter of immediate necessity, inasmuch as the wishes of the inhabitants have not been sought?  There can be no change in the Boundary until the wishes of the inhabitants have been ascertained, and I put it to Ministers that they would not allow any change in the Boundary until that ascertainment of the wishes of the inhabitants has been made.  Then what is the purpose of this agitation, both on the other side of the Border and on this side, and what will be the effect of it?  Undoubtedly it will be to inflame public feeling and to divert the minds of the public from those questions which are infinitely more important, questions affecting their livelihood, and how they will feed, clothe and house their children.  These are questions which affect the people on the other side of the Border.  The incitement that is being engendered there is being engendered with the same object and the same purpose to divert the minds of the public from the failure of Governments to deal with these evils consequent upon depression in agriculture and in industry&mdash;the evils of unemployment and poverty.</P>

The Oireachtas agreed with them a year ago that it was a desirable thing to amend the Treaty to allow the appointment of two nominees of the British Government upon the Commission.

      <P>I knew that would frighten the Minister for Justice.  I say without any hesitation that the effect of this agitation on both sides of the Border will be this, that members of the Government Party are not satisfied as to the integrity of Ministers in regard to this question and that it is necessary to arouse the feelings of the people on the matter, and by that means to divert their attention from the economic questions of bread and butter and livelihood.  It is an old practice and very often it is done unconsciously by people who do not like, by a kind of subconscious or inherent antipathy, to hear the cries of the unemployed, or the demand for Government intervention in the field of economics and industry.  But I want to say that is going to be the effect of an agitation of this kind on both sides of the Border.  We are to respond to the movement across the Border and we <Col N="633" /> are presumed to have no confidence in the intentions of our own Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCullough said towards the close of his speech that what was necessary to develop and inculcate was a &ldquo;community feeling&rdquo; with all citizens on the other side of the Border, as well as on the other side of the water.  We are dealing with the problem as it affects the other side of the Border.  I wish Deputy McCullough had been able to suggest methods moving in that direction.  Has he any alternative to the provisions of the Treaty in respect to the Council of Ireland?  I have endeavoured to press upon the Dáil time after time that within the Treaty itself there was a means whereby this community feeling could be developed and the ultimate unity of the country could be guaranteed, but unfortunately the functioning of that Council has been postponed at least for another year.  I hope that we shall be able to say before the Boundary Commission reports, having ascertained the wishes of the inhabitants in the meantime, that the Council of Ireland will have been established and that there will be a unification of authority in respect to the three functions of Government dealt with in the Treaty, namely, the fisheries, the railways, and diseases of animals, and that by the very fact of there existing a single national authority to deal with these functions of Government in the North, that we would be on the way to meet the problems of the Boundary, and that the boundaries, in fact, would be of small importance when we have a single national authority functioning, even in respect of two or three of the smaller matters of administration and Government.  I believe it would be unwise to pass this motion.  The Dáil will be committing itself to approving of representations which we have not before us.  We do not know what the oral and the written representations were, and it is unwise to ask an assembly of this kind to approve of matters which have not been placed before it.  Had my amendment been in order, the Dáil would have recommitted itself to the view that Article 12 of the Treaty would not be fulfilled until the wishes of the inhabitants <Col N="634" /> mentioned therein had been ascertained. It would also have committed itself to the view that it is an undesirable thing to encourage agitation in the country on this matter, because to do so would be tantamount to diverting the attention of the public from matters of very much more concern to them than the actual line of the Border.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the motion is tabled for the specific purpose of showing the intensity of feeling and the apprehension which is felt at the publication in certain unfriendly British journals of a forecast of the decision of the Boundary Commission.</P>
      <P>The discussion on this resolution has followed two main lines, the first being a consideration of the contention of the Executive Council made to the Boundary Commission that that Commission were not empowered, in their delimitation of the Boundary, to look south of the existing Border or to transfer to the Six Counties any territory which now forms part of the Twenty-six Counties.  That contention has been argued before the Commission on our behalf by our Attorney-General and by the other distinguished legal gentlemen who appeared with him.  The second was a criticism of the line which has been foreshadowed in the Press.</P>
      <P>The contention of the Executive Council that the provisions of Article 12 of the Treaty do not empower the Boundary Commission to transfer Free State territory to Northern Ireland depends on the intention of the parties as evidenced, in the first place, by the Treaty itself, and, secondly, by the circumstances with which the Boundary Clause was intended to deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the instrument itself, the very form of the Treaty does not leave room for doubt as to the intention of the high contracting parties. Under this instrument, the whole of Ireland received recognition as the Irish Free State, and provision was made for the Parliament of Northern Ireland, which, at the time of the making of the Treaty, had been set up and was functioning under British statute, to continue functioning inside the Free State without any change in the area of its jurisdiction.  The Treaty <Col N="635" /> further contained a provision that, in the event of the Parliament of Northern Ireland electing to dissociate itself from the Free State, the Boundary Commission was to determine the limits of the area over which its powers should be exercisable.  Provision was contained in the Treaty for the suspension of the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Free State over the Northern area until this option had been exercised or rejected, and the Boundary, if necessary, redrawn. In other words, as the position stands to-day, the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Free State are in a state of suspension over Northern Ireland, and will come into instant operation in any area assigned to the Free State by the Commission. There is no corresponding arrangement whereby the powers of the Government of Northern Ireland are in a state of suspension over any Free State territory.</P>
    <P>In plain terms, what the arrangement means is this: in order to provide for the wishes of a minority of our countrymen a local legislature had been set up in Belfast under British law, prior to the Treaty.  The parties to the Treaty intended that this Parliament should be the recognised authority, within its limitations, for the six north-eastern counties, if the majority of those represented in it did not wish to carry their dissociation from the legislature of the Irish people further than the maintenance of this local institution. If, on the other hand, they wished for a complete dissociation from the Parliament of their country, the area which they should have power to dissociate from the jurisdiction of the Irish legislature was to be cut down as nearly as possible to the area inhabited by those who desired the arrangement, or, to use the words of the Treaty, the Boundary was to be drawn &ldquo;in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants so far as may be compatible with geographic and economic conditions.&rdquo;  I think this is the fair interpretation of Article 12, which would be the ordinary interpretation of any outsider who studied the Treaty for the first time.  Our claim is that <Col N="636" /> the wording of the Treaty makes clear in this way the intention of the contracting parties, and it is the intention of the parties that effect must be given in the interpretation of any contract.</P>
    <P>As regards the circumstances with which Article 12 was intended to deal, they furnish what seems to me conclusive evidence that our interpretation of the Treaty is correct.  As far back as June 12th, 1916, the Ulster Unionist Council accepted the Six Counties as the area to receive separate treatment under a Home Rule settlement.  On March 10th, 1920, a resolution in favour of including the whole Province of Ulster in Northern Ireland in the 1920 Act was defeated by that Council, and a resolution adopted to the effect that no opposition should be offered to the passage of the Bill.  The Six Counties represented the whole claim of the Unionist Party, in deference to whose wishes the Belfast Government was set up.  The National Party never agreed to this arrangement and, when the Treaty was entered into, it was clearly intended that the Unionist claim should be cut down by a Commission appointed to take away from the Northern Government the areas adjacent to the Free State which had Nationalist majorities.  The National Party on their part agreed that if this was done they would recognise the Northern Government for those who desired its existence.</P>
    <P>After the Government of Ireland Act was passed and members had been elected to sit in the Parliaments of Southern and Northern Ireland, the members elected for Southern constituencies all remained away and repudiated that Act except the members for Trinity College, whilst in the North some only of the elected members attended.  At the date of the Treaty, the complete abstention of the members for the twenty-six counties of Southern Ireland showed unanimity in these counties regarding the rejection of that Act.  In the North, however, the fact that 12 members elected for constituencies, including Tyrone, Fermanagh, Derry, Armagh and Down, absented themselves from the Northern Parliament, showed that the people of Northern Ireland were far from being <Col N="637" /> unanimous in accepting the Government of Ireland Act.</P>
    <P>There is a further argument appearing on the face of the Treaty itself.  It is provided that, in the event of Northern Ireland electing to remain in the Free State system, with its entire territory, a Convention should be entered into with a view to protecting the rights of minorities in Northern Ireland. There is no such provision in case Northern Ireland elected to go out.  Why?  Because, in that event, the Commission was to be set up for the purpose, as was clearly indicated at the time, to consider what portions of Northern Ireland inhabited by those minorities should be excluded from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The forecast published in the Press is not the report of the Boundary Commission.  I do not know what its report will be.  I only know that the report has not yet been made.  I do not like to enter upon a discussion based upon a purely hypothetical case, but since so much importance has been placed here, and in other quarters, on that forecast and since it has, in fact, been the pivot around which discussion has centred to-day, I will permit myself to say a few words in its regard.  I must begin by stating that, to me, it is quite inconceivable that any body of men, respecting the terms of reference which were placed in their hands by Article 12 of the Treaty, recognising their functions as a judicial authority and setting upon their reputation for impartiality and honour the value which honest men place upon those things, could lend their names to such a decision.  The line which, for shortness, I may call the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; line fulfils none of the conditions called for by the clearly-expressed language of Article 12.</P>
    <P>I do not think even our most hostile opponent would dare to suggest that it respected the wishes of the inhabitants, and it would take an amount of sophistry to persuade even the most avidly-receptive, that if no consideration whatever was given to those wishes, the line conformed with economic or geographic facts and requirements. That line cedes to the Six Counties an area of territory in Donegal. <Col N="638" /> On what grounds?  As far as the wishes of the inhabitants are concerned, the overwhelming majority are bitterly hostile to such a transfer.  The Commission are well aware of that fact.  It is the richest portion of County Donegal.  Its removal from County Donegal would be a serious economic blow to County Donegal&mdash;infinitely more serious than any economic advantage which it might be supposed to confer on a Londonderry, improperly withheld from our jurisdiction, even if that were a factor which the Boundary Commission were entitled to consider; and we deny that they are entitled. Therefore, that portion of the line, far from conforming with either the wishes of the inhabitants or economic conditions, would not alone ignore them, but would be deliberately drawn in defiance of such considerations.  To suggest that it is based upon the only remaining consideration available to the Commission&mdash;that of geography&mdash; is to suggest a travesty of justice and a farce.  That is only one example. There are many others.  There is the exclusion of the overwhelmingly Nationalist town and district of Newry, which that line proposes.  One wonders what consideration could justify that proposal.  But I am only wasting time.  The Boundary Commission is bound by the facts and by the evidence before them.  On these facts and on that evidence there are no grounds, there is no justification, there is not even the semblance of an apology, for this line.  I admit that Deputies are not apprehensive without certain justification.  I realise that, from the moment the Boundary Commission was being set up, a most scandalous campaign of intimidation and misrepresentation has been waged.  A most indecent and flagrant violation of judicial procedure has been indulged in.  This has not been confined to the Press&mdash;though they have contributed to the best of their ability.</P>
    <P>Important personages in public life, both in Great Britain and in the Six Counties, assisted in the endeavour to influence the Court.  So scandalous, indeed, were these proceedings that I have no hesitation in saying that if the Commission were a Court of Justice <Col N="639" /> it would be incumbent upon it to commit personages in very high station to imprisonment for flagrant contempt. We, on the other hand, have been most meticulous in our abstention from any course of action which would be out of harmony with the elementary principles of respect for judicial procedure.</P>
    <P>But the Commission has no right to allow itself to be influenced by intimidation or by cajolery.  Neither Sir James Craig's &ldquo;not an inch,&rdquo; nor the threats of an armed special police, nor the dishonest statements of persons in high places, should intervene in their discussions.  Until I have some better proof to the contrary than the publication in the &ldquo;Morning Post,&rdquo; I prefer to believe that the members of the Commission are men who place a value on impartial justice, that they will respect the considerations which have been laid down for their guidance and direction, and that they will not allow outside considerations to sway them from the path of judicial honesty.  If, as I hope, I am justified in placing this reliance in them, then the apprehensions expressed by Deputies to-day will have proved groundless.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, should it transpire, when the report of the Commission is available, as I sincerely hope it will not transpire, that they have allowed themselves to be intimidated or cajoled into drawing a line based upon considerations other than those laid down in their terms of reference, then I say&mdash;and I say it with all earnestness&mdash;that they will have done a bad day's work not for Ireland alone but for the whole commonwealth.  They will have created an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion which will go far to prevent the development of those cordial, fraternal relations which were rendered possible by the Treaty and which were daily growing apace.  They will have reopened old wounds that were healing; they will have created new grounds for friction; they will have dishonoured themselves and they will have sullied before the nations of the world the reputation for judicial impartiality of which the British Commonwealth is so jealous.  In such a case, the very fact that the &ldquo;Morning <Col N="640" /> Post&rdquo; had been able to secure, if it had secured, information from the Commission that is supposed to be a profound secret between the three Commissioners will require an explanation which the Commissioners would, I venture to say, find it difficult to give.  And the British Government, which has so far, with the utmost punctiliousness, fulfilled its obligations under Article 12 of the Treaty, could not, of course, escape moral responsibility for the action of its nominees.  They would have to consider, just as we would have to consider, how best such an injustice could be remedied.  I have, perhaps, dwelt too long on this aspect of the case.  I have done so, however, because the consequences which would arise in the hypothetical circumstances around which the discussion to-day has centred, would be of the utmost gravity.  It is, perhaps, only right that they should be appreciated here in this House and elsewhere.  But I hope these circumstances will never arise.</P>

      <P>I do not want to add much to what I said in proposing the motion except to deal with the suggestion made by Deputy Johnson. I quite realise there may be a point of view that such a discussion will have the possible consequence of creating heated passions and ill-feeling and distract the people of Ireland from their ordinary business.  I would like to assure Deputy Johnson I had no such intention.  I have given my pledge to the House to-day that I will not lend myself to propaganda to inflame feelings that may lead to dangerous results. I was not a member of this House when the amending Act to which he refers was passed.  I had no responsibility for the Treaty, because I was not a member of the then Dáil, nor have I been consulted since in my personal or representative capacity, and I feel myself entirely free from all responsibility in the matter, but I would like to say, as a son of the city of Belfast, I feel this matter deeply.  I have moved in it from the depth of that feeling entirely, and in order that we might have some reassurance in the words that would be said in this House <Col N="641" /> and which I might venture to say we have received from our President in his reply, for those uneasy minds and uneasy hearts whose future lives will have to be lived on one side or the other of the Border.  That was my intention in moving the motion, and not to inflame any passion, I assure Deputy Johnson, the House, and you, sir. Those of us who have lived through the past few years do not desire to stir up passions easily again.  I desire, with Deputy Johnson, a better spirit between North and South, and I desire to see a change of heart towards our common interests, and it is because I believe that a just and true rendering of the findings of the Commission on the lines laid down by President Cosgrave to-day will help materially to bring about that result that I moved this motion to-day.</P>

    <Title>AGRICULTURAL CREDIT SOCIETIES. - DEPUTY BAXTER'S MOTION (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil is of opinion that the establishment of Agricultural Credit Societies have failed to afford the necessary relief to farmers who lost their live stock through disease in 1924-25, and that other steps should be taken immediately to introduce a system of short-term loans at low interest so that the farms may be re-stocked.&rdquo;&mdash;(Pádraig Baxter.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was endeavouring to direct the attention of the House towards, what I would consider, the inconsistency of the Government in connection with the affliction of fluke disease which came upon our cattle.  In June last the Minister for Agriculture stated that on account of the abnormal visitation of this disease in various districts he considered that it was his duty to make some advance towards helping farmers who had lost their stock.  To make good his efforts a Vote of £100,000 was passed and the Minister for Agriculture advised that that could best be employed by the institution of credit societies in those areas which the disease had ravaged. Four or five months afterwards we are here, in this motion, pointing out that <Col N="642" /> these credit societies have failed to do what the Minister intended they should do.  Therefore, we are asking that an alternative method should be used for helping those farmers who have been afflicted.</P>
      <P>What is the Government's method? To bring in an amendment which is merely a reiteration of a truism, a reiteration of what we all agree to, in the hope that it will by that means side-track the motion here.  That motion of Deputy Baxter's positively asserts what is a fact, and the amendment by Deputy Tierney, on behalf of the Government, is merely a parliamentary trick to side-track the issue.  Of course we all agree that credit societies are good.  That is not an answer to our motion.  We want you to give, at least, good terms to the farmers whose losses are well known.  You have yourselves agreed they exist; unless they did exist it would not be the duty of the Government to interfere.  We say that you ought effectively to use the money voted by the Dáil and not hold it up indefinitely in the furthering of those schemes of credit societies which undoubtedly will be good, but which will not be effective in the emergency which now exists.</P>
      <P>Those are the reasons why I cannot accept the amendment.  It is said that the farmers should not be always looking for State aid.  I agree.  We should not always be looking for State aid; but this is a case where it is admitted by the Government that State aid is necessary.  From my own experience I have known other Governments, in cases of drought in other countries, to come to the aid of the farmers.  Here is a case where you agree that help is needed.  Your method is wrong and we ask you to change your method. Give us these short-term loans which have been so effectively used in the north, and by which means the money voted by the Dáil here may be put into proper use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £3,500 has been loaned in four months.  The need is there, but the farmers are placed out of employment and there is no hope of their being able to make a living.  The period has lapsed when whatever money that could be made on the farm <Col N="643" /> would be available for credit societies. Yet, with all the activities of the Minister and the organisation society at his back, with the help of the Deputies on these Benches, and with the help of the Deputies of the Cumann na nGaedheal, he has been able to start only eight societies and loan them £3,500.  Is that able to meet the case that exists and for which the money has been voted?</P>
    <P>This is an effort to stop the allocation of money and to give the help needed.  If the Government thinks that by this method they are going to escape the blame&mdash;for they are blameable for inaction&mdash;and if they think that by persevering in this slow-going motion they are going to escape censure, you may take it that they are mistaken.  There is a feeling in the country amongst the farmers&mdash;I wonder how the farmers on the Government side will counter that feeling&mdash; that the Dáil's efforts to help them in their distress have been nullified by the inert action of the Government.</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland, with its small resources, can give short-term loans through the banks at 2½ per cent.  Why cannot this Government, having voted £100,000, do the same, or better?  What is wrong with this Government?  We agree that credit societies will help; but they will not help in the emergency which at present faces us, and for that reason I have no hesitation whatever in objecting to and voting against the amendment.</P>

      <P>Before going into the general question, which is the need of credit in the country, I would like first to endeavour to clear up a few points.  I want to say that I appreciate the spirit in which Deputy Baxter proposed the motion.  He proposed it quite moderately, and he put the case from his own point of view quite fairly, I admit.  Having said that much, I want to say also, in conjunction with it, that I am a convinced believer that the credit society is the correct method; I am a convinced believer <Col N="644" /> that the loan system is wrong. I will give my reasons for this afterwards. I say that in connection with the way in which the matter was presented.</P>
      <P>Deputy Baxter reminded me that if a census had been taken, if the Gárda Síochána had visited every farm in the country for the purpose of ascertaining all about the crops and getting other figures for publication in the statistical reports, these visits might be availed of for the purpose of getting some information as to the magnitude of the problem.  He asked me whether I had instructed the Gárda Síochána, in addition to their normal duties, to make definite inquiries at each farm or place they visited as to the losses from fluke. My answer is that I did not give such instructions, and I deliberately refrained from doing that.  I deliberately refrained because I am convinced that by that method I would get no accurate information from such a census. Deputy Baxter has more faith in census of that sort than I have.  I venture to say he has very much more faith in a census of that sort than the normal farmer has who knows the conditions in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I took considerable pains to ascertain, by methods which I consider sound, the extent of the losses through the fluke last winter and spring.  I have nothing to add or subtract from the estimate which I gave the Dáil then, nothing whatever.  I do not propose to go into those figures again.  I quoted them at length.  I do propose to tell the Dáil the methods I adopted. The Department of Agriculture has competent officials, agricultural instructors, live-stock officers, etc.  Some of them permanently reside in every county in the Saorstát.  They are working in every parish, and the Department of Agriculture has other officials who are constantly going from one county to another.  I get reports periodically from every one of these officials.  As I pointed out, many of them reside in every county, and the others are visiting, in one way or another, at very short intervals, every part of the Sáorstát.  They have no interest except to get the truth.  I regard them as quite competent to <Col N="645" /> draw up a programme of accurate information as to the extent of the problem. I have absolute confidence in the results they have given me, and which I have given to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>In addition, I took some pains myself to investigate the problem in the county from which I come where there has been, probably, as great a loss from fluke as in any other county.  I refer to Galway.  I consulted reliable farmers and they are easily found in various districts.  I got their opinions for certain typical districts.  I consulted farmers who came from districts where you have high, healthy, lively land, and farmers who come from districts where you have low-lying, sodden land.  I consulted a great many of these farmers. I have been all over the country in connection with the Live Stock Breeding Act.  I took every opportunity to consult practical farmers whom I regard as reliable men, and I got their opinions as to the losses.  It was on the information I obtained in that way that I formed my conclusions.</P>
    <P>I put it to Deputy Baxter or to any farmer anywhere, whether in the Dáil or outside it, whether that is not a more reliable way to get an approximate estimate, the only approximate estimate you could get of the losses, than by the method of sending around Gárda to each house asking them the naive question: &ldquo;How many cattle and sheep have died on you through fluke?&rdquo; with the implication that the Government was going to come along with a free grant, perhaps.  The Deputies may be shocked and say I have a very low estimate of Irish human nature and of human nature in general. I have not, but we must take human nature as it is, and, speaking as one man who knows the conditions in the country, I have no doubt that the estimate that I arrived at on that basis is more likely to be accurate than the figures I could get by the crude method of sending out the Gárda Síochána to inquire from every Tom, John and Pat how many cattle died on them from the fluke, with the implication that there was to be a Government grant.  That was my method, and I think it is a sound method.  That was the way I arrived at my figures.  I have always <Col N="646" /> realised that considerable numbers of stock died of fluke.  I have equally realised that many more stock died of starvation.  I pointed out often in the Dáil that one very serious aspect of Irish agriculture is that stock in the winter-time are under-fed.  I will be told that the people have not the feeding; that is not an answer.  Some stock died of starvation last winter and last spring.  They did not die a year before; but they were under-fed, and, as a rule, they are under-fed, not so much in the poorer counties, but often in the rich counties where there is more feeding, where there are better crops, better land and more money.  That aspect of affairs is not explained, and cannot be explained, by poverty, for the simple reason that under-feeding is as much prevalent in the good rich counties, where practically every farmer has an economic holding, as it is in the poorer counties.  I have nothing to add to or subtract from the estimate which I gave of this problem last spring.</P>
    <P>Now, we were told that this was a pretence of dealing with the problem. I never claimed that this is going to deal with the problem <i>in toto.</i>  No man who has given a moment's consideration to the matter can deny that no possible scheme which the Government could put into operation would deal with more than 25 per cent. of the deserving cases.  If you consider the figures concerned with this problem, I cannot see how there can be any doubt about it.  Last spring I gave the figure of 5 per cent. as being approximately&mdash; as being at least a shot&mdash;at the losses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Assume that it was only 2½ per cent.  That percentage, when applied to 350,000 farmers, would mean about 17,000.  If you give each of the 17,000 farmers £50, the total would be £850,000.  Deputies have talked about the decimation of flocks and herds.  I am talking of a 2½ per cent. loss.  Remember that the normal mortality amongst live-stock is close up to that; that is, the normal mortality from old age and one thing or another.  I am not talking of flocks <Col N="647" /> or herds being decimated; I am not talking of Egyptian plague, or anything of that sort.  I say that if you were to attempt to deal with only 2½ per cent. of the farmers, you would require to put up £850,000 in order to give them a loan of £50 apiece.  Addition and subtraction are non-political and nonsectarian. I doubt very much if the figures I have given will be questioned. Let us assume we had £850,000 put up for the purposes of fluke.  Deputies will, of course, remember that money comes out of the pockets of the other farmers.</P>

I dare say if £850,000 were put up Deputies would look cheerfully for £1,000,000, and if £500,000 were put up I am sure a little more would be sought.  I am trying to face this matter on its merits.  I am trying to face the problem in a business way and to give the real reasons that convinced me that the scheme proposed by Deputy Baxter, the loan scheme, is the wrong way to deal with it.  As I have said, £850,000 constitutes a big sum which will come out, to a very great extent, of the other farmers' pockets.</P>

Let us say that the money is made available by the Minister for Finance.  I wonder how many applications would we have?  Would we not have 15 per cent. instead of 2½ per cent.?  Deputies will agree, I am sure, <Col N="648" /> that that is the very least we would have.  Will any Deputy who faces the problem seriously tell me how any Government Department could institute a scrutiny close enough to get down to the deserving 2½ per cent. out of the 15 per cent. applications?  I am trying to use accurate minimum figures.</P>

I assume Deputy Wilson would hardly go to the North to find out how they work out their mental processes; he may think himself sufficiently competent to know how they arrived at their figures.  I use the figure 15 per cent. as the minimum.  You would have fully that percentage applying for the money allocated by the Minister for Finance. Giving 2½ per cent. of the farmers £50 apiece would mean an outlay of £850,000.  Will any Deputy tell me how a Government Department would be able to institute a scrutiny close enough to sift that 15 per cent. down to the 2½ per cent. that would represent cases really deserving?  Of course, we are blamed for not being infallible.  I have never claimed that I am infallible.</P>

Deputy Wilson and every member on the Farmers' Benches knows what would happen, and it is mere pretence to say that what I have stated would not happen. It is because I do not stand for pretence in dealing with this problem by this loan system that I am against it. Neither do I claim&mdash;I would be long sorry to do so&mdash;that the system of credit societies is going to meet it <i>in toto</i>, but in time it will.</P>

He stated, in a sort of <i>ex cathedra</i> way, and as a sort of infallible economist, that he could give you the latest theories from all the Fabian tracts.  He stated everybody knew that, while credit societies could deal with the ordinary credit needs of the farming community, they were never intended by anyone, and could never have been intended by anyone, to deal with a special emergency.  That is a very interesting point of view.  I want to point out to Deputy Johnson that, even though he may be infallible, I will have to take the liberty of having my own opinions in the matter, and to point out to him further that when we debated this question, as Deputy Wilson reminded us, six months ago, he did not state on that occasion that credit societies, of necessity and of their very nature, were incapable of dealing with an emergency. He only discovered that since the Shannon wages dispute.</P>

      <P>I am glad it is from experience the Deputy learned that. From the way the Deputy announced it he led me to assume it was the fundamental economic doctrine of a great economist who knew all about this.  Of course, the ignoramuses&mdash; someone referred with a certain amount of amusement to professors&mdash; on the Government benches did not know these things.  Now the Deputy admits that he is like the rest of us, and that his deductions are not philosophical and abstract, but rather that he deduces from experience.  I think, therefore, I may take it that he is not an <i>a priori</i> economist.</P>

      <P>The point I am making is that you must look at this problem in perspective.  There is no use in talking about flocks and herds being decimated. We will not reach any real conclusions until the problem is stated as it really is.  In considering the steps to be taken to deal with this problem, any responsible Minister for Finance would have to consider whether he would be entitled to make public funds obtained from taxation on the farmers of the country available to meet this problem, or whether these funds could not be more reasonably spent in another direction. You have, I say, to look at this problem in its proper perspective.  I pointed out in the debate on this question before that the annual losses, the unavoidable losses, through contagious abortion were far greater than the losses that have occurred through fluke this year.  I wonder are there any dairy farmers here who would venture to disagree with me on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">

      <P>Yes.  As I have stated already, to consider this problem you must put it in its proper perspective. Deputy Johnson, in answer to the Minister for Justice the other day, boasted that he was proud to say that he stood for a policy whereby a farmer in the country, <i>qua</i> taxpayer, had to pay a far higher wage to labour working outside his own farm than he could pay to labour working on his own farm.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that if I was not under the necessity of speaking on this motion I would not do it.  With regard to credit generally, I am of opinion that there is too much credit of the wrong kind in the country and not enough credit of the right kind.  If you go into any parish in the country, any district you like, you will <Col N="652" /> find there from 60 or 70 per cent. of the farmers who are sound and who, as a rule, are very hardworking, intelligent farmers.  They are sound financially and otherwise.  Then you will find a balance who are not nearly as well off, with a tail of 15 per cent. that are really badly off.  Now credit would be really useful to the 60 per cent., and that is the real credit problem of this country, and every farmer knows it, in so far as there is a need for short-term loans.  The real use of agricultural credit is for the 60 per cent. of farmers who know how to use it.  I will go further and say in regard to the 30 per cent. or the 15 per cent., that is to say the people who are worst off, that credit is of more harm than good to them unless it is given extremely judiciously and unless it is supervised in the closest possible manner.  Now it is 15 per cent. we are dealing with, because everybody knows that if money were made available this 15 per cent. would apply for it.  If they are to get credit the credit must be strictly calculated so as to bear some reasonable proportion to their security, and to the possibilities of their handling the money economically when provided with it, and, so far as the great percentage of them is concerned, too much credit too readily obtainable would do them more harm than good.  When I state that, I am stating nothing that any farmer, in his heart of hearts, will not agree with.  Remember it is that 15 per cent. that is certain to apply. The moment it becomes known that the State is making money available for loan purposes they apply immediately, and become energetic, and make a real good try to obtain it, and use all the influence they know how to obtain it.  That type of man is the man always looking to obtain money at a cheap rate and always hoping that, if you like, he will be able to pay it back. These are the sort of people who would apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have shown that £750,000 would not deal with more than 2½ per cent. of those people, and I ask how many of the actual 2½ per cent. who would get it would find it useful unless they got it in very small doses and were very strictly supervised and had a full <Col N="653" /> realisation that they had to pay it back. I put these considerations to the Farmers' Party for what they are worth. I have shown what it would take to deal with only 2½ per cent. of the farmers of the country, giving them only a small loan of £50 each.  I tried to show that so far as the farmers of the country are concerned 15 per cent. would apply; that loans would only be useful to them provided they were very small loans that they could reasonably handle, and provided there was the closest possible scrutiny and supervision, and I have shown that no machinery the State could adopt would enable the State so to discriminate as to sift out that 2½ per cent. that would get loans and supervise the spending of the money afterwards.  These are the reasons, whether they be good or bad, for which I oppose this loan system, and I oppose it with the full knowledge that one of the big questions agriculturally is this question of credit. I am as anxious as any Deputy to see this very big question of agricultural credit tackled as it should be, but I do not want it to be side-tracked.  I do not want the temporary misfortunes of this sort used for the purpose of rushing us into credits that are no good to anybody, and which can only have the effect of increasing taxation and taking money out of the pockets of the hard-worked farmers of the country, and to give it out in such a way that it would be of no use to the men who receive it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is merely, as Deputy Baxter knows, shutting his eyes. If I had £50 to spare, which I have not, and if I wanted to lend it to a neighbour or somebody else that I knew, I could easily pick out a man who lost cows and whom I know would make good use of it.  But Deputy Baxter knows that is not the position.  The position is where you have something like 40,000 or 50,000 people applying for a loan and the State, through the Department of Agriculture here in Dublin, has to sift them down to 2½ per cent. of that number.  It could not <Col N="654" /> be done, and in its results it would do no more than I have said, namely, that the effect of such a scheme would be to take the money out of the pockets of the hard-worked farmers and put it into the pockets of others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Not all, but a good many of them.  It would be taking the money out of the pockets of the hard-worked farmer and giving it to people, and so far as 50 per cent. of the people who receive it are concerned, it would do more harm than good.  That is the problem, and whether credit societies are the right way of solving the problem or not, the problem is there, and I think I have stated it correctly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister speaks of 2½ per cent., and that appears to be 2½ per cent. of the stock, but most of his arguments seem to be about 2½ per cent. of the farmers.  Would he disentangle this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming that the number of farmers who would apply would represent, roughly, the amount of stock lost.  It will not make much difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an assumption in all this argument from figures that the loss is spread evenly over the whole country and all the farmers.  The case made is that in districts some groups of farmers side by side, neighbours in groups, have lost cattle.  In other districts in the country no cattle were lost beyond the normal.  Now, to talk of the percentages of farmers, and mix that up with the percentage of stock is quite misleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree.  It is not misleading to say, first of all, for the purpose of argument, that we propose to deal with only 2½ per cent. of the farmers of the country and that to give them £50 a piece would mean £750,000. There is nothing misleading in that, whether they be in this district or in that district, whether they be spread over the country evenly or whether they be confined to special districts; it <Col N="655" /> is not misleading to say that to give a loan of £50 to 2½ per cent. of the farmers of the country would mean £850,000.  That is point number one.</P>
      <P>Now, with regard to number two, Deputy Johnson stated that the ravages of fluke were confined to certain districts. To say that it was confined to certain districts would be wrong.  They are most serious in some districts than in others.  The fact is that there are certain districts in the country that you could schedule as fluke areas, but, on the other hand, there have been losses to a smaller extent in other areas, and all our experience in connection with the applications that have come in regard to the setting up of credit societies showed that cases had been made from practically every district, whether rightly or wrongly, for loans on account of fluke.</P>
      <P>Deputies will remember that the Ministry of Finance made it a condition of the scheme that these credit societies should not be organised except in districts where losses from fluke had occurred.  Now, in practice, that never stopped us on a single occasion, because you will always, in fact, find people to say, &ldquo;Well, fluke occurred here.&rdquo;  I am not now saying that fluke occurred in every district. I know it did not.  I know there are special areas which were more hardly hit, but I am saying that in practice the consideration that fluke did not occur in a certain district is not going to stop a single man from applying and from putting up the case that there was a certain loss one way or another.</P>

I did not understand that it was the proposal of the Farmers' Party that any county should be precluded from applying.  I do not think it is.  I am open to contradiction if I am wrong, but I certainly did not understand that the proposal was that certain counties should be excluded.  It was not.  There was no such proposal, and, in any event, it makes very little difference.  You would want to cut down the area to a very small area, or at least 15 per cent. of the farmers would apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but when the Dáil was sitting this matter was discussed, and at that time the application of this scheme was confined to nine counties.  Afterwards I approached the Ministry of Finance myself&mdash;I hope I was not wrong&mdash;and I said I would like them to consider applications from any other county in which losses occurred and the Minister <Col N="657" /> agreed.  Surely the Deputy does not quarrel with me for that, but in any event to go back to the point, our experience was that we had applications from practically every county.  I do not say that losses occurred there, but you had these applications, and I say, that even if you do in fact confine the areas, limit them in any way you like, you will have to limit it to a very small area indeed or you will have applications from 15 per cent. of the farmers. Then I go and I ask you is it possible to discriminate?  How is it possible for any State machinery to get down to the 2½ per cent. who really did lose and further to invesigate so as to discover how much money would be really useful to them and, finally, to superintend the spending of that money?  And yet, so far as a very great percentage of these people are concerned, credits are no good to them except small credits and credits given for a specific purpose, and the spending of the money supervised afterwards.  If that is the position, I suggest that it is wrong to say that we are making any pretence in this credit scheme.  I say the other scheme is a pretence.</P>

I have pointed out that so far as 60 or 70 per cent. of the farmers are concerned credits would be useful to them, but so far as about 15 per cent. of the remainder are concerned they are people whose present position is this, that credits would not be useful <Col N="658" /> to them except in small amounts for a specific purpose and accompanied by the closest superintendence.

The fact that the Northern Government made these credits available is really not evidence in itself that the considerations which I have put forward are unsound.

      <P>I have had a fair number of interruptions.  That is one of the conditions, and I wonder how much of this £37,500 would have been lent by the Northern banks, even if this preliminary form which is sent to the Department of Agriculture in Belfast, were not filled in at all.  I have been endeavouring to get some real information on this Northern scheme, and I put it to Deputies that it may mean, as any business man examining the scheme for himself would see, very much less than it means on its face.  The farmer does get his money at 2½ per cent., and £37,000, which would give loans of £50 to about 500 farmers, has been given out.  But the farmer must go there absolutely solvent himself and with two <Col N="659" /> absolutely solvent sureties.  Is that the sort of farmer that the Deputy wants to deal with?  It may very well be that this £37,000 would have been lent if the Northern Government had never intervened. No one knows the arrangement between the Northern Government and the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the advantage of the 2½ per cent., but it is no advantage to give money at 2½ per cent. to a certain class of people if you are really aiming at giving money to another class.  I do not know what the arrangement between the Northern Government and the banks was, and I have been unable to find it out, but I know that on the face of that scheme it is quite possible that most of that £37,000 would have been given out if the Northern Government had never intervened, and that the only thing that has been done is that certain people, who would get the money from the banks in any event as ordinary borowers, are now getting it for two years at 2 per cent. less.  If that is so, and I make that suggestion, how does it touch our present position? Deputies do not want to reach people who can get money from the banks. Deputies are not concerned with the sort of farmers whose security is itself sufficient to enable him to get money from the bank and who is able to get two solvent sureties.</P>

      <P>Deputies, I pointed out, are not concerned to any great extent with the kind of farmer who is able to get money on his own security, and who is able to get what a bank manager would call two solvent sureties. I understood that Deputies were concerned rather with the other class, the class that could not get credit from the bank at the moment.  So far as the Northern scheme is concerned, I do suggest it is possible that every penny of that £37,000 would have come out of the banks if the Government had never intervened.  I stated that I did not consider at any time that this loan scheme would deal <i>in toto</i><Col N="660" /> with the fluke.  I never had any such illusions.  But I do state that it is the only way at present, the only temporary arrangement, under which you can effectively make credits available to the small farmer who belongs to the class that I have mentioned, not to the 60 or 70 per cent. of people who are sound, but who belongs to the other class, the class that are not security for large loans, the class to whom loans are no good unless they are small loans which they can economically handle, and the class that must be supervised in the spending of these loans.  That is really the point of view that I had in the matter, and I see no way of doing that except by the credit societies, and for this reason: assume that a credit society is formed.</P>

No one wants the big farmers &mdash;I want to remind Deputy Johnson of that&mdash;to come along and put their money in.  The big farmers did not put in their money in Tralee, where there is four or five thousand pounds going out, and it is extending every day. Again, the big farmers did not put their money into the three societies that are formed in the poorest county in Ireland, Leitrim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  It was not the big farmers who put their money into these new societies in Leitrim and Tralee; it was the small farmers.  What happens in a case like that?  The small farmer in such a case wants £22 or £23 to buy a cow, or to meet any emergency you like.  Such a man is generally able to find £5 or £10.  Anyone who knows the economy of the small farmer knows <Col N="661" /> that when an emergency occurs it usually happens that a man is able to find £5, £6, or £10, but not the whole of what he requires.  All these people met and pooled their resources, and for every £1 they put in the Government put in £2.  That came to something like a couple of thousand pounds.  I will give the Deputy the figures.  Kiltogher and Eslin Bridge are the new societies in Leitrim.  Carrigallen is an old one that is extended.</P>

      <P>Six hundred pounds is the total in Kiltogher.  Eslin Bridge is £867; Tralee is £2,685.  They have applied to-day for £300 odd and are getting it.  There is not a single shopkeeper, I am informed, in the Tralee Society; they are all small farmers, none of them farmers like those you see in Tipperary, Waterford and Kildare, but small farmers, most of whom have to live on uneconomic and miserable holdings, in the case of Leitrim, of £10, £11 and £12 valuation.  And they have met, in a county where there was very strong opposition to these credit societies. They started without delay and are going ahead, and we expect further demands immediately from these societies. While I do not anticipate any quick developments in these counties, or in any counties, I anticipate that the fact of these societies being successfully started in a county like Leitrim will bring about other societies also, as there is another society about to be registered in Kerry one of these days.  These small farmers met and pooled their little resources. They made up their minds that this agitation for getting free gifts would not come to anything.</P>

These societies were not popular, I agree.  People would prefer to get the money directly.  It is an unfortunate point of view at the moment, but people do prefer to get the money directly.  They do not want to go to all the trouble and organisation that would be entailed in setting up these societies, and for a long time branches of the Farmers' Union, and I will go further and say, branches of the Cumann na nGaedheal&mdash;not so many, though&mdash;sent in resolution after resolution on this question.</P>

      <P>I am perfectly satisfied from reports I have received that probably the principal causes for the delay in making a beginning with these societies was the belief, fostered by organisations, and mainly by branches of the Farmers' Union throughout the country, that they were going to get grants in some cases, and in other cases loans.  The people in counties like Leitrim and Kerry made up their minds that they were not going to get them and they formed their societies. They pooled their savings and they are now in a position to make small loans.  The societies are extending very slowly, but they are extending.  If a man comes up and wants a loan of £18, £20, or £25 that would be useful to him he is known to his neighbours.  He knows that he is spending his neighbour's money and that it is not the money of a far-away entity like the State.  He knows that he will meet his neighbours going to Mass or at fair or market.  Undoubtedly, he will be far more careful how he spends that money and more careful to repay it than if he was getting a grant of £50 which might probably swamp him.</P>

      <P>A loan.  That is the only effective way that I can see for dealing with the problem of the very small farmer in counties like Leitrim, Roscommon and so on, who want, not big loans that are no good to them, but small loans.  They realise that they have to spend it carefully as they have to pay it back.  That is my method of meeting the problem.  I know that these societies will develop very slowly. In the past they developed slowly, mainly because the local authorities, the county councils, and branches of the Farmers' Unions did not give them the chance they were entitled to.  I remember that in the first fortnight after the Government's decision five or six resolutions were received from branches of the Farmers' Union in Clare saying: &ldquo;It is no good; this will not do; we want loans.&rdquo;  We got them also from other councils.  The people themselves were not anxious.  Farmers are not particularly anxious to organise themselves for business purposes. They hoped to get the money by holding up the scheme.  But we have got societies started in counties like Leitrim.</P>

We have started a society in Tralee in which there is not a single shopkeeper and practically no big farmers.  The money was deposited by small farmers in mountainy holdings in Kerry and at present they have practically £3,000. These are facts and in the light of these facts there is no use in saying, in counties like Kilkenny, Tipperary, Waterford and the midlands, that there is not enough money to start these societies. They can be started.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the number. £867 is a small amount, but, spent on really deserving cases, it will do more good than eight thousand times £867 would do if spent without proper supervision and went to the wrong people.  I am not making any promise about credit societies.  I say that it would be mere pretence for me to ask the Minister for Finance to put up loans amounting to, say, £1,000,000 for farmers for this purpose.  I have given my reasons for doing that.  I have shown that it would be impossible to get down to the 2½ per cent. of farmers who really need the money.  The results you would have would be that a certain number of farmers would be in a worse condition than they were at the beginning.  I shall make no comments with regard to small societies. They will develop only very slowly in this country for reasons that everyone is aware of&mdash;the slowness of the average farmer to organise for business purposes.  The feeling of the Government is that they will develop.</P>
      <P>When fluke is forgotten, in two or three years, you will have something there that will meet the needs of the small farmers.  They are the ones I am concerned with.  I am not concerned with the big farmers, even where there are big losses, as they might be better off to set some of their land rather than restock it.  If a big farmer has plenty of land he has fair security.  I am not concerned with that problem, though there are hard cases. I am talking about Leitrim, Donegal and Kerry, where the small farmers are concerned, and I see no other effective way of dealing with the fluke problem as it should be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The loan system would be a mere pretence, nothing else, and would be waste of money, in my opinion.  On the other hand, in County Leitrim, or counties in a similar condition, if the <Col N="665" /> people could be organised, they will be able to make small loans to small farmers. That will go somewhere to meet the losses, and meet them gradually and slowly.  When fluke is forgotten you would have these societies functioning. They will be there for the provision of seeds, fertilisers, and for other purposes, and will be doing real education work for farmers, and amongst the farmers who want it badly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a very interesting and a very clever speech, but he said little about the problem we are discussing for the last six months.  He has talked about percentages and averages, but I say that that is misleading, perhaps not deliberately. What is the use of talking about 2½ per cent. of the farmers of the Saorstát?  We are not dealing with the farmers of the Saorstát.  We are dealing with the farmers in five or six counties who have been, badly hit, who have been thrown down and cannot get up.  We are not dealing with the case of a man who wants £22 or £23 to replace one cow.  We are dealing with the cases of men who had five or six cows and who have none now, or with men who had ten cows, nine of which died.  We are asked to believe that credit societies are going to deal with this problem, that the Minister says will run pretty well into one million pounds if the figures were known.  He is asking these societies to deal with this big problem.  Nobody with any common sense will deny the usefulness of credit societies in normal times to meet normal losses but, when you are dealing with a plague of this description, it is obviously impossible for credit societies to do so before £1 is subscribed.  I do not think any sane man would say that credit societies could deal with this problem at the moment.  Even if those societies were societies of long standing they could not deal with it, but to expect you to deal with a problem of this description, without any organisation, without the question ever having been discussed or put to the test, is asking for the utterly impossible.  It is not asking for the success of credit <Col N="666" /> societies.  It is asking for the death of credit societies at their birth.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tierney has said that these societies would help to supply pigs to people.  So they could.  They could help to supply sows to breed pigs.  The cost would be two or three pounds.  It might be even £10 or £15, but when you come to deal with £200 to an applicant, what can you do then?  Those losses have occurred in townlands.  No one was immune.  Everyone had a common loss. Where was the money supposed to come from, and where were your credit societies going to get a foundation? What I said yesterday was that the ordinary resident of the district who might not have had much loss and who happened to have a few pounds would be slow to put money into a society of that description, and Deputy Beamish told us that because an individual would not come to the help of his neighbour the State owed the individual nothing.  That was the gospel of Deputy Beamish that I and a few others here may have suffered loss. Then if Deputy Beamish refused to go to our assistance the State would be absolved from coming to our assistance.</P>

That is borne out when the farmers acknowledge that they will pay the £750,000 if they are taxed for it.  They are only asked to produce £250,000 under this scheme. Let them produce it and the scheme is a success.</P>

Where great losses have occurred in Kerry, in Clare, in Galway, perhaps, and in some of the other counties, it is asking too much from the residents in those districts who have met those losses to put money into societies. If they had another year like last year the whole lot would be swamped.  They would have no security. Anyone knowing the country will recognise the slowness of members of the societies to proceed against their neighbours in case they fail to pay.  It needs somebody behind them besides local societies to go to the extreme limit in enforcing the law in this connection. People are anxious to avoid a position of this description.</P>

From whatever cause this problem has occurred, whether it is fluke, starvation or anything else, the problem is there and that problem has to be dealt with or the nation has to pay the loss.  There is no getting away from it.  I made it my business to visit people in North Kerry and I found people who lost 10 or 11 cows.  That occurred to one individual and he has not been able to replace them.  He has got in two.  There are seven still to be made good which he cannot make good. That is a loss to the individual and to the nation.  He cannot pay his annuities or anything else and that is only an example of what is occurring in the counties.  I say this scheme of credit societies cannot reasonably be expected to meet the situation.  This is an urgent problem.  There is only one way to meet it and that is by a generous loan.</P>

If we are determined <Col N="669" /> to deal with the question now, let us do so in the right way, and we maintain that the only way to do it is by loan.  It is very easy to ascertain the position.  Send round inspectors, if necessary, and let them find out the ordinary number of cows which a farmer had.  Let them find out the usual carrying capacity of a farm, and what it is carrying at the moment.  If the farmer has a good character in the district, and can get security, give him a loan.</P>

I never read a speech made by any of the half dozen ex-colonels who controlled the Farmers' Union in which the Government was not denounced for extravagant, wildcat schemes of one kind or another or ill-conceived legislation.  Yet the Farmers' Party come forward to the Dáil with the suggestion that they should be enabled to go down the country and tell their friends that there is money in Merrion Street for any of them who lost stock last winter.  Then the problem begins to commence, so to speak, and applications pour in.  How are they to be dealt with?  Deputy Gorey says, &ldquo;Send round inspectors if necessary.&rdquo; Does he think it would be necessary?  Does he think it is a matter that can be dealt with on paper by taking the word of a man who writes up and says: &ldquo;I lost 9 heifers and 35 young sheep last winter&rdquo;?  How many inspectors would it be necessary to send round, and what would the ex-colonel say at the next meeting?</P>

      <P>Deputy Baxter can be very sympathetic about things <Col N="671" /> like that.  The position is that the Farmers' Party are to have it every way.  They are to tell their friends that there is money above in Dublin for those who lost their stock last winter. They are to be at liberty to criticise the expense of the administration of that scheme.  They are to be at liberty to talk about the horde of interfering officials who are poking their noses into the business of farmers; they are to be at liberty to talk about extravagance, and to criticise taxation, and to say, &ldquo;Why on earth is not taxation reduced?&rdquo; Finally, if there is an attempt to recover any loans, they are to be at liberty to criticise the hardhearted, inhuman Government who sent out the under-sheriffs to collect the money.</P>

      <P>I, like my colleagues, thought that if we managed and tried our best to get one or two societies started, others would possibly follow. As Deputy Baxter said last night, I accompanied him to the first meeting of the new County Council in Cavan, expecting to get a fair welcome there, but after a considerable amount of criticism we were told that we might go back to the Government and say that their proposal was of no value. We thought that even if we failed with the county council the publication of the discussion in the local papers would create a certain amount of discussion throughout the country and that inquiries would be made as to the possibility of starting societies.  I consequently attended other meetings with Deputy Dr. O'Reilly, but the result was the same.  The county organiser attended, and we explained the proposal at length, but it was of no value.  We could not get a man to put in a single pound.  I am chairman of a creamery society and, knowing the distress that there is in our parish, I introduced the matter at a meeting of the society.  Another man and I proposed to head the list in case we got support for the project. In the creamery we had a certain amount of money on hands, and we proposed to add this to the fund so as to raise £100.  It was no use, and I was not surprised, for I have known cases <Col N="672" /> where farmers who had lost cows had not a penny to replace them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I may safely say I was the first member of the House to raise this question.  I suggested to the Minister for Agriculture that he should make inquiries through the country with the aid of the Civic Guard.  He did not do so, and if he had done so, he would give a more sympathetic hearing to the pleading we now put forward.  I am aware he made certain inquiries through creamery managers, but men who are not paid for a job are careless about it in many ways, and consequently particulars that might be obtained would not be got.  In addition, it must be considered that many of these small farmers would, perhaps, minimise their losses through pride, and there would be cases where dishonest men might try to exaggerate their losses if they thought there was anything to be gained by it.  I do not think the inquiries were made in the proper way.  I listened with great interest to Deputy Tierney's speech in the hope of hearing what he had done or proposed to do.  I waited to hear if it was a fact that there was such a society started, or such a proposal considered by the committee of his County Council, and whether it was turned down as a complete failure.  I would like an answer, yes or no, as to that.  If he failed in his attempt, what is the use of trying to prolong the agony?  Why not admit, as others of us have to admit, that the scheme is not a success, and is not likely to be so.  I think the Deputy argued that the farmers must try and help themselves in the future.  I agree it is time that the farmers should make a move to do that, but it must be remembered that we had not such a bad season as the last one within the memory of any member of the House, and I would say it is now the real pinch of that bad season. If the Minister will not agree the losses are as severe as have been stated, and as I hold they are, I ask him how does he account for the great number of decrees going out from the Land Commission?  If these people had cattle, or even a cow, to sell, it is not likely they would be inviting the sheriffs to their doors.  I think in that, <Col N="673" /> even if there were no other evidence, we have sufficient proof in that that the people are in poverty.  Deputy Beamish made the very strong point that, because the farmers do not help one another by the way of going security for one another, the Government had no right to do so either.  I consider these are two different propositions altogether.  The farmers, looking at it from a selfish point of view, have nothing to gain by helping their neighbours, while the Government have everything to gain, because, if the Government assist the farmers in the way the farmers assist them by paying rents, they will get the money back again in a short time.  I would suggest that the Government, through the Land Commission, should allow the farmers to raise a small loan in the bank.  The Land Commission are in the position of knowing the character of the men who apply for the loan.  They will know whether in bygone years they have kept their engagements by the payment of their annuities, and in that way they would have a good idea as to the character of the applicants.  It would be a very easy matter for the Government to advance to a small holder a few pounds on his land security.  The Land Commission could earmark that land in such a way that it could not be sold or in any way disposed of, and if the loan afterwards was not paid it would be impossible for the farmer to sell the land until the loan had been paid.  If the arrears of payment had accrued for a certain number of years, the Land Commission would have the same means of recovering the loan as they would have of recovering the annuity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean that no loan is to be made to any man who is in arrears with his annuities or other charges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. COLE Mr. COLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLE</NameTxt>
      <P>If the arrears are only for a year or two I would not take that into account, but if the arrears are for a number of years past that should be considered.  Another matter is that, if the farmers advance this money to a credit society, they would want collateral security, or mortgage <Col N="674" /> on the farm, and that would increase the cost of the loan very considerably. I happen to know a good deal about that.  The Minister does not seem to realise that a small loan to farmers would be of great assistance.  If the Minister went down the country he would find farmers frequently hanging about around the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. COLE Mr. COLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLE</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time the Minister does not think that it is of great advantage to farmers to get loans.  I wonder does he know that farmers have to struggle at present to pay, as I know, in many cases the exorbitant interest of 20 per cent.  It is cases like this the Government should assist.  When a man has to pay exorbitant interest on a loan it is difficult for him to repay the loan.  If the Government would lend money at 2½ per cent. interest it should be of advantage to the farmers.  The Minister has laid great stress on the £750,000&mdash;I think this is the figure he calculates will be necessary.  Supposing the farmers did borrow £750,000 through the banks, and that the farmer paid 2½ per cent. and the Government paid the balance, it would amount to something less than £200,000, which would be a mere bagatelle in comparison with the value of the land that would be given as security to the Government.  In the meantime the Government would have the rents coming in, so that a good deal of the money would be coming back in a short time.  I would like to compare the figures of the present loan society with what they would be supposing the Government authorised the bank to advance money at 2½ per cent. on the security of the land.  The Government propose to give £200 for every £100 raised, and on the £100 they are willing to pay 4 per cent.&mdash;I presume they will be paying 5 per cent. on the other £200 which they would advance.  That would be £300, and the cost would be £14.  If they would advance the £300 through the banks at 2½ per cent. it would only cost £7 10s.</P>

The Northern Government has lent £37,000, according to the figures of the Minister.

What are the facts in connection with these credit societies <Col N="676" /> and the fluke disease?  The scheme of relief put forward by the Government has, to all intents and purposes, completely failed to meet the emergency. What is the use of the Minister telling us a society has been established in Tralee and two societies have been established in Leitrim?  How does that deal with the whole problem?  Things must be looked at in their proper perspective, and, surely, to say there are established three or four little societies to meet a problem that amounts practically to a national catastrophe is no answer to the case we have made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that some of the societies were concentrated upon, and every effort was made by the Government to render them successful.  When the Minister introduced his scheme for dealing with this problem I told him I had no faith in the prospects of its success.  I am now sorry to realise that my prophecy was correct.  I would have been glad to see the scheme successful, in spite of the fact that even from the outset I had little hopes that it would be.  It has completely failed to meet the emergency. There was something wrong about the attitude taken up by the Government to meet this catastrophe, of the fluke disease.  It cannot be called anything short of a catastrophe, because it is a thing that did not occur in the country within living memory. We hope it will not occur again for a very long time.  It was met by an expedient which should have been reserved for normal times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the credit society system is required by the farming community of this country.  It is a thing which the farmers and their representatives have been seeking for a long time.  The very fact of attempting to foster the further establishment of those credit societies in connection with this emergency has done irretrievable harm to the credit society idea. It will be associated in the minds of the farmers in future with the failure which has occurred in connection with the attempt to establish them.  In my opinion that is almost the worst <Col N="677" /> feature of this attempt by the Government to meet this emergency. It has given a black mark, so to speak, to the system of credit societies, and will make it extremely difficult to have them established in the future.  It would have been much better if the Government met this emergency by a system of loans, and waited until times were normal and people were in a receptive mood, and farmers were prepared to take up the scheme seriously. That would be the time for the Minister to come forward with his scheme for the fostering of those societies.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us a lot of figures that were not very relevant to the matter under consideration.  The question of what percentage of the farmers was composed of good or bad farmers, and what class of farmers would or would not come forward for the loan, was touched upon.  We are aware there are bad and middling farmers, but it would not at all follow that those who would look for the loans would be bad farmers, the hopeless ones of the farming community.  It has happened that a great many of the people who lost cattle through this disease included some of our best small farmers.  Those men are now in the practically hopeless position of not being able to obtain any money to restock their land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme has failed to work.  The position is aggravated by the fact that the banks, as is well known, are slow now to advance money to farmers.  I agree with the Minister that this question of advances in this country has been overdone in some cases; but there are other cases in which it has been underdone.  Money has been advanced for bad purposes and wrong purposes; but now when money is required for good purposes, it is almost impossible to obtain it.  Take the case of a farmer, who has lost practically all or a very large percentage of his cattle, going into a bank.  I believe the bank manager would be reluctant, even on good security, to advance money for that man.  The bank manager would require that the man himself <Col N="678" /> would be in a sound financial position before he would advance money.  The banks are slow to advance money to a poor man, even though there is good security.  The banks do not care to have to go back on securities in order to get the money if the principal fails.  It is an unpopular thing; it gets them into bad favour with people, perhaps good customers, who may be the securities. In most cases the banks require that the man obtaining the loan is in a fairly sound position.  A statement was made by the Minister to the effect that 50 per cent. of the cattle that died, died of starvation.  I am sorry that statement was made.  It is a reflection on the farmers, and it is not a correct statement of facts.</P>

      <P>Yes, 90 per cent. of their livers are not hopelessly discased, but they have indications of fluke disease in the livers.  Probably as regards a small percentage the livers <Col N="679" /> are completely destroyed by fluke and these have to be cast aside as altogether unfit for human food.

      <P>I was glad to hear that statement made by the Minister. In future we can accept it as a Government pronouncement that, in the final issue, the farmers are responsible for practically all taxation in this country.  Anything in the way of bounties or subsidies or grants will eventually fall back upon the farmer taxpayer.  Now, the Minister made very light of the attempts of the Northern Government to deal with this matter. The fact remains that the Northern Government has made this attempt and that the attempt has succeeded to the extent of advancing £37,000 over a very small portion of the area.  Compare that with the Minister's credit societies, where, so far, only £3,500 has been advanced. It is all very fine to cavil and sneer at the work of the Northern Government, but the simple facts proclaim that they have attempted to deal with the question and that they have found a method for dealing with the question, and that they have not found it impossible, as the Minister in his speech stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated it would take another Department as big as the Department of Agriculture to administer the scheme successfully.  I wonder has the Northern Government instituted a second Department of Agriculture to administer their scheme?  I do not think <Col N="681" /> they have.  Furthermore, I do not agree with the Minister for Justice, that it would be impossible to get officials to secure this information.  I believe it would be easy to get the officials to get that information.  I believe that any of the competent instructors could supply the information required.  It is all very well to heap objection upon objection, but difficulties are always in the way of every scheme that has to be carried out.  The difficulties are not insuperable; they are surmountable.  I maintain that there is no difficulty in advancing money to the farmers that could not be surmounted by a proper system of administration.  Now, the Minister for Justice took part in this debate.</P>

We hear a lot in this House and outside it as to the necessity for an adequate Opposition and for adequate criticism, but the moment the criticism touches a weak spot and becomes a bit unpleasant, then we are not to be tolerated for a moment, but are to be gibed and sneered at by the Minister.</P>

      <P>It would be as well, I think, to acknowledge at once that the scheme failed and that there is no prospect of it meeting the emergency. Meantime, we have throughout the country numerous farmers who are in a very bad way because of the losses they have sustained from disease in their cattle.  Their present condition is very serious indeed.  If something is not done to improve their condition they will not be able to pay their Land Commission annuities, their local taxation, or their shop debts.  These men are anxious to get a start in life again.  If they did get a chance of making a real start they would, in the majority of cases I believe, make a success of it.  They have been prevented from making a restart in life because the Government is not meeting the situation as it ought to have met it.  I would say to the Minister that it would be better and perhaps more honest for him to acknowledge that the attempt made to meet the present emergency, as it exists in the country, has failed.  I cannot see how anyone can say anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to start anew, and offer a loan that would enable these men to restart in life.  Doubtless, the Minister would have the worthless ones coming along if he were to offer loans.  That always happens in such cases.  We all know that when a new bank manager goes to a district all the worthless ones in that locality are in to him for a loan. But surely in a case like this the Government must have at its disposal adequate machinery to weed out these worthless ones, to see that only worthy persons are selected for the loans given, and that they will get a chance of making good.  As one who took a certain amount of interest in the establishment of credit societies, I regret that the attempt to start them was made under such unfavourable auspices as those that obtained in connection with the present emergency.  I believe it would be in the interests of the country and the farmers that the present scheme put forward by the Minister should be withdrawn, and that he should come forward with a generous offer of loans to farmers who <Col N="683" /> can prove that they have met with losses.</P>
    <P>I deny that it is outside the power of the administration to find out the men who really suffered losses.  I would like to point out, too, that we are not asking for a grant.  We are asking for a loan, and these men, when they apply for it, will know that they will be bound to pay back the loan, and that all the legal forces at the disposal of the Government can be used for the purpose of forcing them to pay back the money loaned to them.  We do not hear of men clamouring for Board of Works loans in the hope that, by some extraordinary happening, they will never be asked to pay them back.  The fact is that men only apply for these loans when they require them.  Similarly, I believe that only a certain number of people would apply for the loans that we suggest should be given to meet this emergency.  People would only apply for them who really require them because of the emergency which has arisen.  It is up to the Government to take a risk which banks, for instance, or other people could be expected to take.  The emergency is such that the Government ought to be prepared to face a certain small percentage of loss; but my opinion is that, if the Government come forward with loans, the losses they would sustain would be comparatively small.</P>

      <P>In order not to expose myself to the rejoinder levelled from the Farmers' benches at Deputy Professor Tierney and Deputy Beamish I might start off by saying that I am a bit of a farmer myself, and therefore might be allowed to express an opinion if only on that account.  The Minister for Agriculture seems to be puzzled as to what percentage he will attribute to mortality amongst cattle from fluke and what percentage to starvation.  I think that is really immaterial, because the deaths from fluke and the deaths from starvation are primarily due to our wet climate.  The wet climate is undoubtedly the cause of fluke&mdash;excessive and persistent wet, and another contributory cause was rotten hay.  The rotten hay killed the cattle by starving <Col N="684" /> them.  That is the position we have to face and it does not matter whether they died from fluke or starvation&mdash; they are dead at any rate.  The result is that farmers who were unfortunate enough to suffer from mortality amongst their cattle are now in a very precarious position.  For that reason I would suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider the whole question. I fear that this motion of Deputy Baxter's has possibly been treated from the Government benches as a political stunt.  I do not think it is a political stunt, and if it is a political stunt I would not let the farmers walk away with a clean victory.</P>

      <P>The Irish farmers have suffered at all times from want of capital.  The English farmer is a capitalist, with the result that he gets the best out of his farm.  The Irish farmer is always dragging the devil by the tail.  He has to sell his cattle when they are unfit for sale.  He has to sell them simply to stop a gap.  That is a very common expression in the South of Ireland.  It is very expressive and conveys the meaning.  Agriculture is our main industry.  It is a national asset, and I think it would be well to have the present crisis tided over by following the example given by the Government of Northern Ireland&mdash;that is to say, by lending money on somewhat similar terms.</P>
      <P>We recognise the administrative difficulty of the Minister.  But I say when making a loan it does not matter whether the loss was due to fluke or rotten hay.  Look for character in the borrower.  If he is an honest man he will give sureties, and he will retrieve himself.  I appeal to the Minister to do justice to himself. He has done a lot for Irish farmers and I believe he has the capacity to put this country on a level with Denmark. Possibly the farmers are trying to queer his pitch.</P>

      <P>There is really no doubt that the condition of several of these farmers, through no fault of their own, is very bad.  Of course, there are farmers in Ireland who are hopeless. Nothing that could be done will get them out of the rut they have got into, and they give a bad reputation to the general body of farmers in the country, and although I have said things very disagreeably of farmers, I know that 30 or 40 per cent. of the Irish farmers are as good farmers as can be found in any country.  It is well, in my opinion, to reconsider this question, and I would ask the Minister in his final reply not to shut the door.  These credit societies are dead and gone, and that may be due to want of organisation.  You can organise nothing in Ireland except you organise it behind the revolver.  (Deputies: &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;)  It is a very powerful weapon, and it does influence organisation.  With these remarks I leave things to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'REILLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very reluctant to break my long silence in the Dáil, but I feel bound to do so, as my name has been mentioned in connection with some matters raised by Deputy Baxter and Deputy Cole.  They stated that I helped in some cases to try and form credit societies.  Deputy Cole and I went to one particular place, and during the discussion that took place there the principal thing I heard from people present was this: that if by putting down £5 they could get the Ministry to put down an extra £10 so as to make £15, they would do so.  If that was the case credit societies could be formed at once, because they could get any amount of borrowers, while there were very few of their more fortunate neighbours who were ready to come to their assistance.  They could get any number of men to come into the credit societies as long as the Government would be prepared to put up the extra £10.  The person who was there to explain the workings of the credit societies told them that it would be possible to form credit societies if that could be done, but that that was not the ideal aimed at by the Department.  Now, I think when the Government were prepared to put up the £10 extra, even although it was <Col N="686" /> not the ideal they aimed at, they showed a little better spirit than the farmers in the neighbourhood showed who were not prepared to put up anything at all.</P>
      <P>It has been said by many Deputies that the credit societies have failed because of this lack of support from the better-off farmers, and from a lack of co-operation with their more unfortunate neighbours.  Certainly I believe that lack of financial support is one of the causes that contributed to the failure, but there were possibly other reasons for the failure and one of these would be political reasons.  I found at that meeting to which I have alluded, that when it came to the formation of the organisation in various parts of the district in which the credit society was to be formed, the party who named the organisers named them all from one political party.  I did not know that because I was not well acquainted with the neighbourhood until I came outside when my attention was called to it by members of the party to which I belong.  The members of our party would not be very keen in getting into that society considering that the members of the other party were aiming at making political capital out of any benefit that might accrue from the formation of that society.  My reason for thus putting forward this&mdash;and it is rather unfortunate that my first entry into the debates in this House should take this form&mdash;is, that it shows a great lack of the co-operative spirit on the part of the farmers of the country.  I believe that co-operation is going to save the farmers if anything at all is going to save them.  I believe that the credit societies were to a great extent damned by this entering of politics into the question, and I believe also that co-operation will be similarly damned.  The Farmers' Union Party have always said that they are very desirous of helping the farming community. To my mind, the best way they could attain that end would be by dropping out of politics, or else joining some of the other political associations or organisations in this House.  That does not mean that they should join the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. COSGRAVE Mr. COSGRAVE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COSGRAVE</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion moved by Deputy Baxter. Whatever may be said for credit societies in normal times and circumstances, they have proved insufficient, if not altogether useless, in the emergeney with which we are dealing and which, I regret to say, requires immediate serious attention.  I am not aware that there are any of these societies in Galway, which I have the honour to represent, but even if they were established and operating there they could not be availed of by the people who require financial assistance because they have lost their live stock through disease.  I know personally people who have lost ten, twenty and thirty sheep and who could not comply with the credit society terms in trying to replace them.  Take, for instance, a man who lost twenty-five sheep.  The credit society may offer him a loan of £2 at 5 per cent. for every pound he himself has on hands, but in most cases it would be all in vain, as the pound per £2 would not be available <Col N="688" /> in present circumstances.  The man who requires £100 to replace twenty-five sheep cannot, in most cases, produce a third of that sum, and so qualify him for a loan of two-thirds from the credit societies.</P>
      <P>It would be simply cruel to make him such an offer, while if the Government, as has been done elsewhere, provided a loan of the whole £100 at 2½ per cent. all would go well and there need be little doubt as to the repayment of the amount to the Government. I, like Deputy Cole, was quite surprised to hear Deputy Tierney's amendment and his speech in favour of it, and I have no hesitation in saying that he has not expressed the view of the small farmer community.  It was only a short time ago since I read a report of a meeting held in the Deputy's native parish&mdash;Ballymacward, Co. Galway&mdash; calling attention to the fact that the people of the district had lost five per cent. of their sheep and calling upon the Government to assist them in the manner now proposed in the motion before the House.  At that meeting, strange to say, it was a respected brother of Deputy Tierney who presided. He had a close personal knowledge of the situation and knew what he was talking about.  If the credit societies were the all-powerful benefactors which Deputy Tierney represents, that meeting presided over by his brother need not and would not have been held.  I know poor people who, if they were offered loans, of £10 to every £1 they could scrape together themselves, would not be able to comply with the conditions of the credit societies. I should like to hear the views of the other Galway Deputies.</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly in many districts very serious losses have been sustained through fluke, but even the farmers themselves who have supported Deputy Baxter's motion must admit that there are considerable administrative difficulties in the way. I know of very poor districts, in the West of Ireland, where serious losses have been sustained.  I think there might be a third way of coming to the assistance of these people who have sustained those losses and I wish to make a suggestion to the Minister to <Col N="689" /> consider this third way.  Where there are small farmers who could not possibly raise any money, I would suggest that, as was done last year, in certain limited areas, relief works on productive schemes ought to be carried out. These would not be done by loans; they would be done by grants.  Farmers' sons would be employed on them.  They would do work that would be reproductive to the county in opening bogs, widening roads and work of that kind. The Government has already spent a considerable sum in that way. This Dáil voted £100,000 and most of that was spent on relief works and brought great comfort to the districts where the works were carried out.  I would suggest that the Minister should entertain the idea of a scheme in some of these poorer districts that have been hard hit&mdash;and there are not so many of them&mdash;which would go to the relief of all affected.  Once the money was earned they would not have to pay it back, and it would be better than a loan.  I would suggest that for the consideration of the Minister and of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>May I draw the attention of the House to the fact that although this amendment is moved, I presume, in the name of the Government, the Minister, and the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, the Minister himself stated that he did not intend the credit societies to meet, and they had not met the fluke problem.</P>

The Minister himself gave us no evidence.  Why? Because no evidence was forthcoming; because the facts are all to the contrary. Up to the present, and for the past five months, eight credit societies have been established and £3,500 given out.  At the end of the financial year the balance, I presume, will be surrendered to the Exchequer.  The Minister tried to prove that in Kerry and Leitrim societies were started.  I want the Deputy from Leitrim to say what is the opinion of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in Leitrim?  Not more than six weeks ago, at a meeting in Leitrim, over which Canon Masterson presided, a gentleman who was the Cumann na nGaedheal candidate at the last election, declared that if the Government were not prepared to come forward to assist the farmers in some way other than they were proposing to do by the credit societies, he would never raise his hand for them again.

The figures given by Deputy Dolan, when this matter was discussed here previously, showed us that 4,000 head of cattle were lost in South Leitrim.  These were the statistics collected by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  How far is £1,400 going to replace 4,000 cattle? Deputy O'Reilly, I notice, has left.</P>
      <P>There were three Deputies in Cavan, all doing what they could to try to put into operation the credit system advocated by the Minister and accepted by the Dáil.

I have probably gone to more meetings for this purpose than any other Deputy here, or any Deputy who is not here, and by every means we did what we could in Cavan. I would have liked Deputy O'Reilly to declare what his opinion was about the possibilities of the success of his efforts, of Deputy Cole's, and of mine combined in trying to have these societies established to see whether it was possible, in the conditions that prevailed there, that we could get enough of them established to get sufficient money to enable the farmers to replace their stock.  I give it as my opinion that it has not been possible. We tried honestly, and we failed, and we have come to the Dáil to tell it so. I say that Deputy Tierney did not tell us what he had done.  I think not one society has been established in Mayo, and I say that not one will be established.

He wants us to accept it that he is the only reliable man, that his statement is the only statement that can be accepted, and when I go to the trouble of going to a district and having figures compiled that I am prepared to swear to, the Minister suggests that the House is to accept it that I am not telling the truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's attitude is to do nothing, to leave things as they are, that if these farmers cannot find any help he cannot and will not do anything for them.  That is exactly what the policy of the Minister and of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party means, and that is what the policy of every farmer Deputy who supports them amounts to.  We should be clear on this matter.  When it was raised first the Minister accepted the view that this problem existed and that it is not now solved.  He further recognised the fact that credit societies would not solve the problem, and yet he has no alternative to offer; he will not do anything; things are to be left as they are.  I say that if that is all the encouragement that honest farmers are to get from the Government when they find themselves in difficulties, the Government cannot expect that the farmers will give them allegiance and support.  Many Deputies come from constituencies which have not had losses, and these Deputies will have to be asking farmers in such cases, if <Col N="694" /> these loans are made available, to bear their share of them when they are going to poorer counties, and they are prepared to do that.  What is done on the Government side?  What are their responsibilities or their obligations, and what is the difference between the Minister's position in that matter and Deputy Gorey's?  Deputy Gorey's constituents, who have not had losses, will not benefit by these loans, and the same thing applies to Deputies from other constituencies.  But take the eight or nine parts of counties where the farmers have suffered so severely that they are practically down and out, so much so that their farms are to-day without stock, that many of them are in the hands of auctioneers and cannot be sold.  If you are trying to carry on with men like that as the basis of your State, I ask, is the basis sound, and if it is not sound, what kind of State will you build, how do you expect to carry on, how do you expect to get taxation from men who are not able to carry taxes?  You have to give these men a chance.  If you do not put them into a position to live and carry on it is not they alone who will suffer, but the State.  The State eventually will be the greatest loser.  The State has its obligations towards people like these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that from the beginning the Minister did not go about this problem in such a way as would lead one to feel that he meant to solve it.  If he was really serious about it he should have tried to collect authentic and definite information as to the magnitude of the problem, the number of cattle lost, and their value.  He would then know what the State was really faced with.  I say that the machinery for doing this was at his command.  What is the use of the Minister telling us that the information that the Gárda would supply would not be authentic and reliable? How will you collect your tillage or your Census returns if these men are not capable of doing it, and how can you expect, if the Gárda, on visiting a farmstead are not able to get correct information from the owner as to what his position is, that they are capable of doing such work at all?  I say that the information could very easily have been obtained through the Gárda when <Col N="695" /> they were collecting tillage returns, without in any way creating the impression that loans were to be made available.</P>
    <P>I say further that I have the feeling that a good deal of the returns given to the Gárda are not correct.  I have been given to understand that very many farmers in some districts disguised their losses when the Gárda went to their farms.</P>
    <P>Now nothing is to be done.  The farmer can go and help himself, and, if he does not, the State is not going to give him any help.  Very good, if that is the policy of the Government in this matter we want to be clear about it and to know that that policy is being backed by Deputies on the Government benches who are farmers.  The Minister for Justice had something to say. I suppose he must have been nearly a colonel himself.  He might have been an ex-lieutenant.  It comes very badly from the Minister for Justice to make any remarks about any organisation. He is one of those who is prepared at all times to stand up and defend the right of every citizen in the State, so long as he is law abiding.  I suppose he agrees that that citizen has a right to express his opinion.  Sometimes he would like to deny it.  The Minister for Justice gave us about five minutes abuse.  That is typical of him.  In that five minutes the Minister was able to make the objection that if what the farmers wanted were done the farmers would be able to go down the country and tell what they had done.  We did not introduce this motion in that spirit, and it is unfair of the Minister for Justice to meet it in that spirit.  We know that a problem like this is not going to be solved by any party or in that spirit.  We can show some of that spirit if the necessity arises.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands and Agriculture wants us to accept it, that because eight credit societies have been established in five months, and that £3,500 has been distributed out of £100,000 that was voted, these credit societies are going to replace, by their operations, the thousands and thousands of cattle that have been lost throughout <Col N="696" /> the country.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture is responsible to the Dáil and is outside the Executive Council. I would ask the Minister to leave this question to an open vote of the Dáil to decide.  Let the Dáil decide it. After all, it should not be a party question, and, so far, it has not been made a party question.  Men from the different parties have done all they could to try and make these credit societies a success.  They failed.  I say the decision should be left to the Dáil as to whether Deputy Tierney's amendment meets the situation or not.  Leave it to the Dáil, and there is no question what the result will be.  The Minister will not do that.  He will not take that chance.</P>

      <P>When this proposal was first introduced I said that credit societies would not meet the situation, and that it would confront him again. It will confront him again, and, though the Minister may carry this amendment, I say he is not finished with the problem.  Let there be no mistake about it.  To the men we have to meet down the country, and who hold us responsible for trying to represent their point of view, we will have to say: &ldquo;The Government failed to give any help when we put the position before them.&rdquo;  The Minister knows the position that many farmers are in&mdash;at least, he ought to know it. Their plight is bad enough.  How much worse does this make it?  What chance is there for thousands of men to carry on if nothing is done for them?  If the State does not do something, no one else can.  I think it is the duty of Ministers to use the resources of the State in order to assist farmers in their plight.  If Ministers do not do that, I say that they are not doing their duty.</P>

      <P>At the outset I am glad there is such an unanimity of opinion on this question.  Listening to Deputy Tierney I gathered that he <Col N="697" /> seemed to think the credit societies have failed.  I have listened to the Minister for Lands and Agriculture very carefully, and, as far as I could gather, credit societies have failed.  I listened to Deputies on the Farmers' benches, and I gathered that credit societies have failed.  I thought that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture would have told us, if he accepted the view that credit societies have failed to meet the situation, what he proposes to put in their place.  He has practically acknowledged a bankruptcy of policy in this matter.  I may say that I am unprejudiced.  I come from a county that is very severely affected, and I have some reason to say that I understand the position fairly well.  I listened to the arguments with an unprejudiced mind, being neither a farmer nor a professor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not, thank God. I approached the matter impartially. Deputy Tierney told us that we were likely to prejudice credit societies if we sided with this motion of Deputy Baxter.  Deputy Baxter has stated that credit societies have failed to meet the emergency, which is a very serious one.  There is an urgent need to do something to relieve the distress that prevails in some districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You cannot get people who have perhaps some money to put it into these credit societies.  What about districts where there is no money, where the ravages of fluke were so great that a good many people have no stock and where there are no people to help them to replace stock?  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture is a sufficient agriculturist to know the old saying that &ldquo;You cannot knock blood out of a turnip.&rdquo;  There are some districts in West Clare where you cannot get any money out of the people, for the simple reason that they have no money to give.  How are small farmers who have met with losses to meet the difficulty? They cannot be got to put money into a society when they have no money. These things are plain and it would be better if a little more consideration was given to them by the Minister than <Col N="698" /> many of the empty platitudes he gave us this evening.</P>
    <P>What the Dáil must realise is that in some districts the margin between competency and impoverishment is the margin of a few head of cattle.  If these cattle are taken away how does the Minister propose that these people will be able to carry on or meet the expenses of local administration?  How does he expect them to pay the Land Commission with that miserable margin in most cases in districts that I know thoroughly?  How does he expect them to pay the local rates or to carry on unless the State does something?  There are no people in their districts to help them.  Who is to help them?  Are they to be left to stew in their own juice? That is practically what the Minister has told us this evening.  I do not believe that the Minister is anxious that that should happen, but in effect he said that credit societies have not been a success.  I do not believe they will solve the fluke problem.  The Minister stated that, and I give him credit for being honest about it.  If they will not solve the fluke problem and the consequent poverty what will solve it? What are the people to do?  What is his solution?  He has not told us.</P>
    <P>There was another aspect of it, and possibly that attitude of mind should be expressed.  It is more or less a matter of psychology that the Irish people do not want to tear open their wounds in the presence of their neighbours. Anyone who knows the Irish people will know that a man will not go into his neighbour's house and say: &ldquo;I have lost three cattle and I cannot pay my rates and annuities.&rdquo;  He hides it and holds up his head.  That mentality is there and you have to take account of it.  As I fancy I am rather wedged in between Cavan and Leitrim I do not want to delay the proceedings to the extent of keeping Leitrim from speaking. I should like to express to the Minister the necessity for reconsidering this matter, not indeed in the light of all that the Farmer Deputies said. I do not accept all that.  I ask him to accept his own statement that the credit societies have not been a success and that he does not expect them to be the immediate solution of the poverty <Col N="699" /> created by the fluke.  In the light of that statement I ask him to give us some promise of a solution that will help the people to face the serious propositions that face them.</P>

      <P>Those who suffered are mainly small farmers with an average valuation of about £7, and those men worked at productive works started under the Ministry of Agriculture, such as making bog roads. <Col N="700" /> Drainage schemes and various other works were started in those counties because they were so much affected by the disease.  People were glad to earn the money and it gave them capital, because otherwise they would have been doing nothing.  Credit societies did not get a decent chance.  When the scheme was launched in this House the debate was most damaging because the Deputies on the opposite benches prophesied that it would not be a success.  If they had taken up the credit societies scheme, had made the most of it, and endeavoured to work credit societies, things might have been better.</P>

Deputies will have to listen to other Deputies no matter how unpalatable or unpleasant it is or no matter how they may consider other Deputies inaccurate or misleading unless some personal point arises.  We are reaching a stage now when points of explanation are going to destroy debate.  We are here for the purpose of debate and I am prepared to give every Deputy the fullest opportunity of making himself clear, and of clearing himself of any accusations made against himself or his party.  We <Col N="701" /> will let Deputy Dolan proceed on this question generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNicholasDolan" hpid="Mr. DOLAN Mr. DOLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We are at any rate tackling the question.  I admit we have not got very far but we are under way and the spirit is there to work credit societies.  If you got that spirit in every area I see no reason why the Minister for Agriculture could not continue the good work he did by another scheme of productive works, in the badly affected areas.  To my mind the question would be best met in the county I know best, which is referred to here, which is a county of small farmers, by the institution of productive works for the development of the different societies within the county.  It would give the people employment through which they could earn a reasonable wage and it would do useful productive work for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind the question can be best met in that particular county by the encouragement of the credit societies by continuing the work that has been started there.  Let us not condemn the credit societies, and stop any start that has been made, but let the credit societies work on.  When this evil pest has passed, and when we have forgotten about the fluke of 1924-25, then, as the mover of the amendment has pointed out, these societies would be of great assistance to the small farmers in the congested districts.  It is said that <Col N="702" /> farmers will not invest their money, and that they have no security.  To my mind the farmer should be encouraged to invest his money in credit societies by Deputy Baxter and his colleagues, for the farmer in most cases has his money lying idle in the bank at small interest, and he has not the courage to take it out and invest it where he will get twice the interest, as he would in the case of credit societies.  In these societies he has first-class security, for he has his own local committee, and they know the people.  Each man who gets a loan has to have guarantors, so that, in that way, there is first-class security for any man who invests his money in a credit society.  There is no county so poor that there is not a certain amount of dead money lying in the banks.  We would be much better employed in encouraging farmers to co-operate to help themselves than by saying that the farmers are not able to do anything for themselves.  Even in the congested districts they are well able to solve their own problems if their leaders would only help them to do so.</P>
