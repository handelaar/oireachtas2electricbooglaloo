      <P>I understand that as was expected on amalgamation, there has been reduction in staff on what was the system of the Midland Great Western Railway, but I have no details as to the number. All those who are qualified will receive the compensation provided for in the Railways Act.  If they register at the Employment Exchanges their names will be submitted for any suitable employment. The amount of staff required for economical and efficient working of the railway service is a matter for which the Railway Company is responsible and in which I am not prepared to interfere.</P>

      <P>Joseph Mitchell, 9 Auburn Terrace, Mullingar, claimed special benefit on the 19th December, 1924.  In lodging his claim Mr. Mitchell stated he had not previously applied for an unemployment insurance book.  It was subsequently discovered, however, that he had on two previous occasions applied for, and received, unemployment insurance books, and in respect of each of those applications an account had been opened for him with the Unemployment Insurance Fund into which contributions had been paid on his account. His failure to disclose the fact that these two accounts were in existence, was responsible for delay in making payment of benefit to him, but his claim has now been authorised for 96 days' benefit in respect of the Fourth Benefit Year, which ended on the 24th March, and payment will be made to him at a very early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>John Kelly, of Church Street, Baltinglass, was in receipt of benefit up to the middle of December.

The investigation has now been completed, and <Col N="1878" /> payment of all further benefit due to Mr. Kelly will be made to-morrow.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment insurance benefit laid down in Section 7 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, is that the applicant must be unemployed and unable to obtain suitable employment. The claim of Thomas Wills was disallowed by the Insurance Officer on the ground that he failed to fulfil this condition. The claimant exercised his legal right to appeal from that decision to the Court of Referees, which, however, recommended that benefit should be disallowed.  The Insurance Officer accepted the recommendation, and the case, therefore, remains disallowed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. EVERETT Mr. EVERETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that condition generally, but with regard to Thomas Wills, he first of all had his claim considered by the insurance officials and then, when his <Col N="1879" /> claim was disallowed, he exercised his legal right and it went to the Court of Referees and they, knowing the conditions, and the statutory conditions necessary for the receipt of benefit, also disallowed the claim, so that the claim at the moment remains disallowed.</P>

I am not aware that there are any serious negotiations going on with the object of re-opening this mine. The Department is aware of the past history of the attempts to work the copper deposits in that district, and as far as can be ascertained, the whole proposition is of a very speculative nature.  It is proposed, however, that an officer of the Department should visit the district at an early date when a fuller report may be available.</P>

      <P>I have informed the public bodies who communicated with my Department on this matter that the possibility of my rendering assistance depended, firstly, on my being satisfied that the re-opening of the navigation, which I understand has been practically derelict for years, was a sound proposal from the economic point of view.</P>
      <P>I pointed out that the best evidence of this would be a scheme of practical local co-operation to which the various bodies concerned would contribute, as suggested in the report of the Canal Commission, but I have not yet received any such proposition.</P>

      <P>I will not delay the House more than a very few minutes, but I think it is very desirable to allow those of the newly-elected Deputies who were not in a position to discuss this matter to have an opportunity to declare themselves on it.  With all the amendments I do not think it is a Bill that should receive the final approval of the Dáil, and therefore I intend to call for a division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor TIERNEY Professor TIERNEY">
      <NameTxt>Professor TIERNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I hardly expected that I should be suddenly called on to address the House, or that I should have to make a speech on a matter like this at such short notice.  I have been sitting here for the last fortnight listening to debates on this subject particularly, and on a variety of other subjects, and hearing the implication put forward pretty constantly from various parts of the House that the old and the new Deputies on these benches were to a certain extent men who were dying to get at the throats of the Government if whatever mysterious power that is exercised over them could only be lifted by some magic spell.  I take the first opportunity I get to dispel, for my own part at any rate, that peculiar notion, certainly as regards this Bill.  I have been of the opinion for a long time that we were badly in need of a measure like this, and the only regret I have is that the Bill was not introduced and put into operation a good deal sooner.  In addition to that, beside my own private opinion, I am also fortified by a very clear consciousness of the opinion of my constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was standing beside the Minister for Justice in two of the largest towns in my own constituency when he referred to his action in bringing this measure before the Dáil, and I can certainly say, quite conscientiously and <Col N="1898" /> without being compelled by any Government Whip, that I heard no statement from anybody so vociferously cheered or received with such acclamation as the Minister's statement was on these two occasions.  I would like to add also that these were occasions of the two biggest public meetings that have been held in that constituency for a big number of years.  I am in agreement with the Minister in regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>I think there may have been a small number of things in which the Bill needed amendment when it was introduced. I certainly thought it was a bad thing to set up offences which the State could not in practice punish; that it was easy to pass penal legislation which could be set at naught.  That was the only criticism I had to bring against the Bill, that it would be very easy to rise up against certain provisions in the Bill and to render them difficult to carry into practice.  If it were possible to carry them into practice I should have supported them most strongly.  I think the Minister was right when he said on the occasion of the last debate on the Bill that it leaves the Dáil a somewhat better Bill than when it came in, and that the improvements made in it were practically altogether due to the Minister himself.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter about which I have often wished to say something with regard to this Bill.  Deputy Johnson seems to differ from the Minister, not only in regard to the temporary provisions of a Bill like this, but there seems to be a fundmental difference in their points of view.  Deputy Johnson seems to think that the functions of the State in this or any other country should be to act as a kind of schoolmaster, as a good parent to the citizens, who ought to be regarded to a certain extent as the children of the State.  I do not know how far that view is accepted by the rest of the Dáil, but I must say that I cannot agree that it is a view that I share to any extent.  This is a country which has a very democratic Government, and in which the State is very much responsible to the wishes of the people.  The State does not make the citizens; the citizens make the State. <Col N="1899" /> Deputy Johnson, I think, is inclined, in regard to this and a great many other measures, to put the cart before the horse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Prof. TIERNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard Deputy Johnson speaking at great length on this measure, and I have heard him putting forward sentiments of that kind.  I have heard him say that this Bill will not make good citizens. I do not think it is the function of or that it is possible for any Bill to make good citizens.  It is the function of citizens to be good, and if they <Col N="1900" /> are not good the State can prevent them from being bad to the extent of doing harm to themselves or other people.  But I do not think that the State can be expected to undertake the work of uplifting the moral tone of the citizens.  I do not want to delay the time of the Dáil by expatiating any further on this subject.  For myself I must say that I am in hearty agreement with the purport and provisions of this Bill, and that I am as confident as any Deputy can be that I have the full support of my constituents in saying that.</P>

      <P>I was so successful on the last occasion in calling forth a very eloquent speech from one of the new Deputies I think it well that his colleagues at least should have an opportunity to explain themselves in regard to this Bill.  Perhaps, in view of their absence during the earlier discussions, it would be desirable to explain that this is a Bill to authorise the payment of pensions to middle-aged barristers who served for less than two years as judges in the Dáil Courts, and to pay them pensions amounting to two-thirds of their salaries, or £500 a year for life, for that two years' service.  It is said in regard to one of them that he <Col N="1901" /> does not recognise the authority of this assembly to legislate or pay any public monies to anybody.  That, however, is, perhaps, beside the question.  It is well, I think, that Deputies who have not made themselves acquainted with the provisions, purport, and intentions of this Bill, should understand it, and if <Col N="1902" /> I succeed in persuading other Deputies, or even the same Deputy, to express himself on this Bill before he votes I shall be quite delighted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor TIERNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended at the beginning to say something against this amendment, but my own particular private reasons for speaking against the amendment have been somewhat lessened by the form it has since taken.  I thought I could see a certain danger to this Dáil that nobody else perhaps has seen if the amendment in the form which Deputy Figgis <Col N="1903" /> proposed to put it had been allowed to go on.  We have all seen the Experts' Report, and I for one must say that I found it a rather rugged document, and not very easy to understand.  It is, of course, perfectly intelligible, and written in good English, but at the same time it is a translation from a German technical work, and it suffers from defects that must accompany such translation.  The fear I had in my mind was, considering the rugged character of this report and the difficulty of understanding it, what would be the case if a Commission, including representatives of the Farmers' Union or the Farmers' Party in the Dáil, were to deal with this matter, and if Deputy Connor Hogan, who, I suppose, is that Party's chief expert on this subject, were entrusted with the task of writing another report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Dáil to consider on its own behalf what would be the effect of this report if, already having passed through a translation from German into English, it had to go through the fiery furnace of a Commission, and in addition, have to go through Deputy Hogan's polysyllabic zeal, but, unfortunately for myself, that danger has been somewhat averted by the form the amendment has now taken, and I have to confine myself more to the definite business of the scheme itself.  I think I can start off with a clear conscience by saying I know very little about electricity, and I think I run no risk of offending the dignity of the Dáil by saying it would be rather difficult to find more than half a dozen Deputies who could tell me or anybody what the difference is, if there is any difference, between volt, watt, and ampere, for instance.  I say that not because I pretend to know anything about that myself but in order to raise a point which, I think, is the cardinal point in all this discussion.  It is a point which has been already dealt with by Deputy Johnson.  This House, before going into any detailed discussion of a scheme like this, should first of all make up its mind as to its competence to deal with a matter of this kind.  This House has a certain competence in a matter of <Col N="1904" /> this kind which goes to a certain distance and no further.  This House could and should see that any scheme of this sort brought forward should be submitted to people who are properly and thoroughly qualified to deal with it, people who are experts on it and who are capable of giving an expert opinion in every detail.  This House should see that that report is brought before the House and that the House is assured that the experts have been given every opportunity to examine the scheme. Beyond that, I fail to see what the real competence&mdash;the competence from the point of view of knowledge&mdash;of the House is with regard to a scheme of this kind.  I think once we have got the report of those four experts of high European reputation before us that our duty is to make up our minds whether that report, in fairly plain language, recommends or does not recommend the scheme.  We cannot and should not take up our time by discussing all kinds of minor details in connection with a scheme which we are not really competent to discuss.  The criticism that has been directed against the scheme, I think, might be said to fall under two heads.  There is one kind of criticism which really might be said to be subterintelligent, might be said to be beneath the level of the average intelligence, and there is another kind of criticism which might be said to transcend the average intelligence.  These two kinds practically exhaust all the criticism directed against this scheme.  In the public Press in particular there has been scarcely a vestige of real intelligent criticism based on the motive of appealing definitely to reason and to the intelligence of the people.  In this House there has been a considerable amount of both those kinds of criticisms as well.</P>
    <P>The first kind of criticism is typified in particular by the amendment now before the House, and amendment which one has only to follow out to its conclusions in order to see its absurdity. It is proposed that we should postpone action on this scheme after having got this report from four European experts until the Farmers' Party in particular and the Dáil in general have been able to satisfy their intelligence <Col N="1905" /> on every detail, and until they are perfectly satisfied that they understand everything about it.  I suggest that if we are going to wait until every single technical detail of this scheme has been explained and discussed by a public assembly like this or until Deputy Hogan or Deputy Heffernan have made up their minds and can prove to the public that they understand every detail of it, we are going to wait a long time.  We are hardly ever likely to see the electrification of the Shannon proceeded with at all.  I suggest that probably enough the Farmers' Party will be doubtful about the success of this scheme until they suddenly find their byres lighted with electricity, and then they will suddenly demand that the advantages of this scheme should be extended a great deal further. Then they will raise a cry that they have not been treated fairly in getting still more advantages from this scheme than they have got.  The really troublesome sort of criticism, however, that has been directed against this scheme is not that kind of criticism that wants to put off the scheme because it cannot be understood by people who, by the nature of their profession and education, are not fit to understand it, including people like myself.  The really dangerous criticism directed against this scheme is the criticism which is typified by Deputy Figgis, and still more by the campaign that is being conducted so sedulously in the public Press against this scheme. It is a kind of criticism which really transcends intelligence, that is to say, it is a criticism carried on to a large extent by intelligent people, but carried on with means that do not appeal to the intelligence, carried on for the specific purpose not of appealing to the intelligence, but to some emotion or other, to some prejudice or other, to some jealousy or other, appealing to some terror or other that can be aroused in the minds of ignorant people.</P>
    <P>Making no reflection on the motives of anyone, looking at the matter from the point of view of literary analysis, if you take that criticism that appears in the Press and examine it you must come to the conclusion that the motives that lie beyond criticism of the kind that brings in the housing question in connection <Col N="1906" /> with this scheme, criticism of the kind that talks of the terrible danger to Limerick if the dam should burst, criticism of the kind that you had in one of the leading journals of Dublin this morning that misrepresented the statement made here yesterday by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that it was not necessary for the success of this scheme that it should provide power for industry at all, criticism that takes that statement and makes it mean that under this scheme you will not get any power, that this scheme is incapable of supplying power for industry&mdash;on the face of it criticism of that sort is based on motives which are themselves analogous to the motives they attempt to rouse in the minds of the public.  When you find an intelligent man criticising a scheme like this and basing his criticism not on intelligent arguments, but on arguments deliberately calculated to raise all sorts of unreasonable prejudices and terrors against this scheme that man's convictions are something more than reasonable and intelligent convictions; they might be based on any one of the various emotions he is trying to arouse in the minds of the public, jealousy, for instance, terror, for instance, definite conviction for instance, or any one of those various motives, but I certainly think anyone who examines the great mass of that criticism must come to the conclusion that, whatever they are based on, they are not based upon reasoned conviction of that author's criticism, and do not care about reasoned conviction.  They are making an appeal from their own prejudice to the prejudice of the people whose minds they are trying to arouse against this scheme.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal of talk in all this matter about submitting this scheme to expert Irish opinion, to the opinion of expert Irish engineers.  The Press has been full for several weeks past with criticism, purporting to come from eminent Irish engineers, from people expert in this particular subject. Looking at the matter from the point of view of the ordinary layman, it seems to me that the Minister and the Government have shown their perspicacity and good judgement in no matter more strongly than in this <Col N="1907" /> matter.  They took this scheme, when submitted to them, out of Ireland altogether and submitted it to experts in other countries in Europe, where they knew they could get real experts, where they knew they could get people who would look at this proposal from the technical point of view and give them a real technical discussion on it, and make no attempt, in discussing it, to appeal to the emotion of jealousy or terror, as against any other emotion. Characteristically enough, the promoters of the criticism against the scheme try to make it appear that all the propaganda and all the publicity work is being done on the side of the Government and on the side of the scheme.  In that connection, I might refer to what Deputy Figgis said yesterday about Dr. McLoughlin.  Dr. McLoughlin cannot himself reply to any statements that are made about him in this House, and I think in justice as few statements as possible should be made about him.  Deputy Figgis made some kind of vague accusation against him of having attempted, at some stage or another, to get hold of the Liffey scheme for Siemens-Schuckert. He based upon that accusation, which is substantiated only by his own word, another accusation&mdash; that Dr. McLoughlin was not acting in this matter purely from patriotic or disinterested motives.  One thing I would like to say about Dr. McLoughlin and the promoters of this scheme in general is, that whatever they have done&mdash;and they have done a great deal of work in order to get this scheme brought before the country&mdash;they have not entered into a dishonest campaign in the public Press to &ldquo;down&rdquo; any other scheme that is a rival to this scheme.  They have not fomented a correspondence in the public Press from every would-be expert and from practically every idiot in the country to &ldquo;down&rdquo; any other scheme which is a rival of theirs.  In that respect, I think the promoters of the Siemens' scheme have a great deal more claim on the sympathy and support of intelligent people than the supporters of other schemes.  The sooner this matter is raised above that level altogether, <Col N="1908" /> the sooner the methods of picture-house advertisement and theatrical advertisements are dropped in this matter of the electrification of Ireland, the better it will be for everybody.  The sooner people begin to realise that you are not going to get away with any scheme by appealing to all sorts of terrors and foolish prejudices and by insinuating all sorts of lying statements, the sooner it is realised that any scheme that is put into force will be put into force on the advice of the experts and only after reasoned discussion, the better it will be for everybody.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson yesterday, in discussing the possibilities this scheme opens up for the country, said practically everything I had in my mind to say on that point.  But I would like to stress slightly one or two of the things he did say.  He mentioned the possibilities that are in this scheme of opening up a different kind of life for people who live in the country and the possibility of redressing the balance in Ireland as between town and country. Justifiably and rightly, he used that point as an argument in favour of this scheme&mdash;provided this scheme is sound &mdash;as against any scheme for the development of any particular district in Ireland.  I think that particular possibility is one that cannot be too strongly emphasised.  It seems to me that, in this matter of electrification, we are entering upon a new age altogether in the history of Europe, if not in the history of the world.  We are, to a large extent, coming out of the age of steam, gradually but surely.  We are getting away from the influences which, for the last 150 years have been herding people in the huge towns, to become serfs around large factories worked on coal-driven machinery.  We are reaching a stage where it will be possible, economically and on a sound business basis, to get small manufacturing enterprises carried on to a greater and greater extent all over the country.  We are getting away from the concentration of industry into huge centres, and we are getting into a state of affairs where it will be possible to set back the hands of the clock, to go back&mdash;which we can do easily in this country&mdash;against that <Col N="1909" /> development which I personally believe has been the greatest disaster that England, to mention one country, has ever suffered: the development which has cleared her lands of inhabitants and driven her population to be serfs in her towns.  I do not see that there is any prospect before this country brighter, in that way, than the prospect opened up for her by this scheme for the powerdevelopment of the Shannon.  If it were only in consideration of the enormous advantages that this scheme might ultimately open up for the ordinary people of this country, it would be worth giving it a fair chance and honest, fair and intelligent criticism. The great problem for us in this country will be, if we are to develop industry: how are we going to develop it?  Are we going to clear our lands just as the British did 100 years ago? Are we going to herd our people into towns or find, by some kind of modern development, an industry suitable for this country that can be carried on without the disastrous social consequences that have followed upon the development of industry in England? That is one of the points that should make us most careful to see that every chance is given to the Shannon scheme of development.  It is a fine thing to see that the Labour Party in this country is prepared, on these grounds, to give a scheme like this a fair chance and to try and secure that it will have intelligent criticism and will not be snowed under by all sorts of appeals to mass prejudice or emotion or terror.</P>
    <P>There are one or two little questions in connection with this matter of the supply of power that might perhaps be stressed also.  It has been said very frequently recently that there is no use in supplying power, that the cost of power is only a very small part of the cost of industry.  It has been almost urged that power is of no importance at all.  There is one consideration in regard to that which is worth putting forward.  Even admitting that power costs are only a small portion of the costs of industry generally, even admitting that you can run industries on coal nearly as cheaply as you can on electricity, I maintain that that statement is beside the point in considering <Col N="1910" /> this matter.  The problem is not the dearness or cheapness of power; the problem is really the non-existence of power in this country.  What you are faced with is the substitution of something which will provide native power in this country for power which you can only get from foreign materials.  That seems to me to be a consideration which absolutely rules out all discussion about the price of power and all irrelevant details on that point which have been brought into this debate.</P>
    <P>If we could get a supply of native power, whether it be cheap or dear, and particularly if we can get it in these conditions where it would be available almost for nothing, the value of that supply of power will, of course, be out of all proportion to the cost of power in any particular industry or even in the aggregate of industries worked in the whole country.  Its value will lie, not so much in the amount of money it saves to any particular capitalist, but in the possibilities it opens up of an industry being started in every village in Ireland where there is material for an industry.  In the large report of the scheme supplied by Messrs. Siemens you have at the end some information about the possibilities that exist in other countries for that sort of small industry, particularly about types of motors which seem to be very cheap and portable and capable of saving an enormous amount of labour.  If we could get motors and devices of that kind into this country, and that as time goes on our farmers should avail of the opportunity of getting their work done by electricity, then we would have done for the country a work which would be enormously greater and more advantageous than the supply of cheap power for any particular concentrated industry in our big towns.  I have read the report of the experts very carefully. I do not claim to have read it with absolute application to every detail, or that if I had, I would be competent to form an opinion on every detail.  I do claim that, after a fair familiarity with written documents, I am competent to know whether or not a man, when he writes a book or a paper, knows what he is talking about.  I am competent to know whether a man is an expert on the subject on which he says he is an <Col N="1911" /> expert.  I am perfectly satisfied with the experts who, remember, were not called in to do propaganda on this matter, as someone said they were at a recent meeting of the Institute of Engineers. The experts were not called in to do that, or to take up the cudgels on behalf of Messrs.  Siemens, but what they were called in for was to assist the members of the Executive Council in making up their minds about this matter.  I am perfectly confident that these experts have not only given the scheme fair consideration, but that in a good many cases they have weighted the balance against the scheme, and have gone out of their way to overestimate the difficulties that will lie before the scheme, and to under-estimate the advantages of it.</P>
    <P>I am fairly confident that, if the scheme gets a fair chance, before ten years have passed there will be a demand in Ireland not only for the electricity supplied by this scheme, but for electricity supplied by a big number of minor schemes.  Before very long you will be faced again, I think, with the problem in this country of looking for other power besides electricity; and our difficulty will be not that we will have a supply of electric power for which we cannot find a market, but that we will have a demand for power which we cannot meet out of our own resources. I think, then, that when we have a scheme like this, and a report like this in our hands, there is a certain amount that we can do and a certain amount that we cannot do.  We can decide whether, in our opinion, the experts who prepared this report were honest and capable, and from a study of the report it is possible to say whether they were or not.  We can decide whether their report is a fair account of the possibilities of the Shannon scheme, but beyond that I do not see where we can go.  I do not see what advantage is to be gained by entering into all sorts of details as to the effect of spade-cuts in the embankments and so on, or by entering into arguments as to the first neolithic ancestors of Deputy Figgis, and as to when he was presented with his first bow-and-arrow.  That sort of argument is not going to lead us anywhere. What we can do, and what we <Col N="1912" /> ought to do, is to make up our minds definitely as to whether we think that the report of the experts put before us is a competent and an honest report, and whether we think that on that report the Executive Council can go forward, subject to the passing of a Bill, and put the scheme into operation.  I have no doubt that the report is as competent and as clear and as definite a report as we are likely to get from any source, and that the county need have no fear if the Executive Council goes forward in taking up at once the preliminary work necessary for the execution of that scheme.</P>

      <P>I rise to congratulate the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the courage and ability he displayed yesterday.  I can assure him that I have good confidence in the course he adopted, and in the report that he has obtained.  We are told that we should not have that confidence in that report and that we should have an appeal to a committee.  Who would form the committee?  I suppose engineers here at home, because nobody else is fit to sit on these committees; nobody else will be fit to contradict one of them, whatever might be said.  I hold that these committees, if formed, could hardly in justice to themselves give an unprejudiced report, because let any one of us say to ourselves that we were overlooked for greater men, I hold that we would be in a small way jealous of one another and that we would try to get our own back.  We have been told for years by every great man coming into the country, having a look round, especially if he was a Yankee, who would squeeze his nose:&mdash;&ldquo;What a wonderful country this is if it were only developed! What splendid endowments by nature these people enjoy if they were only clever enough to put them into practice. They must be a lazy people, or they must be uneducated, or there must be nobody amongst them who can see what we can see.  Waters are running waste that could be converted into oil, into coal and into horses if you like.&rdquo; What a great man the Minister for Industry and Commerce would be if he struck a rock and produced an oil well or a coal mine!</P>

      <P>He would be an Irish Moses.  But he did more.  He struck the Shannon and has abolished the use almost of oil and coal if we only allow him to go ahead.  And not alone will we allow him to go ahead, but it is the unanimous wish of the representatives of the Saorstát that we should push him ahead.  People living in districts where they enjoy water supplies and are anxious to start industries would be in a position to do so and to give much needed employment in those districts if this scheme is passed.</P>
      <P>We are told that this is going to be a very expensive scheme, but I hold that a whole lot of the money that is being spent weekly could be spent under the Shannon scheme productively instead of being given away for nothing, as some parties in this House complain.  But now when the Minister for Industry and Commerce is making a bold bid to relieve that unemployment and do away with the dole in big measure, I think every man in this House should be behind him.  By means of this electricity&mdash;I will venture into the field of engineering now, and I am sure I will not get far until I am bogged&mdash;I am sure we can get supplies of water where water previously could not be obtained.  That would be a great advantage to the farmers.  I hold that agriculture would be helped scientifically in a short time by the spread of a system of cheap electricity in the country.  As some Deputy said yesterday, instead of candles, we will see the labourers' cottages beautifully lit by electricity.  In short, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Executive Council will convert this island of fire-machines and candlesticks into an island of electricity and will have fitted this country, in my opinion, to take her place amongst the nations of the earth.</P>

      <P>I would like to congratulate Deputy Professor Tierney on his well-reasoned maiden speech, and I should like to add that we, as Deputies, <Col N="1914" /> welcome individual expressions of opinion fromt he benches on which he sits.  With regard to what has been said about criticism, and notwithstanding the risks that one may run in further criticising these proposals, I feel it is our duty as Deputies to carefully examine every detail of a proposal of this magnitude before we can give it our assent.  If I might be permitted to do so, I would rather differ from what Deputy Professor Tierney said in discouraging criticism.  I agree with the sensible remarks made yesterday by a Deputy who said he was glad to see the interest that was taken, throughout the country generally, in those proposals. He looked upon that, and I look upon that, as a healthy sign from the point of view of the country, and I hope that the desire of the Dáil will always be to encourage criticism of a useful character rather than to discourage it.</P>
      <P>In the criticisms I have to offer I do not pretend to pose, as many Deputies here have posed, as an expert on the matter under consideration.  I leave the technical details of this scheme to those who are much more qualified than I am to criticise them. But it is an extraordinary feature that all the criticisms of these experts, while not against the scheme in principle, have been against the scheme in detail.  That is a point that should not be overlooked, because, condemn these experts as we may, there are men amongst them who are just as keenly interested for the welfare of this old country as any of the Deputies either on the Government or on the other benches in the House, and just as capable of coming to an independent opinion on the subject.  But there are important aspects of this question, apart from the technical details, on which we, as laymen, can give a useful opinion.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us yesterday that the contract for this scheme was really based on two clauses in the White Paper&mdash;Clauses 11 and 12.  These are matters on which Deputies are capable of expressing a useful opinion, and they are very important matters in connection with the financial aspects of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider for a moment the <Col N="1915" /> two clauses that the Minister told us yesterday were the basis of the contract for this proposal.  The first is Clause 11, which reads as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;If the report is approved and the Government decide to promote a scheme as a State enterprise&rdquo;&mdash;that is practically what is conveyed in that resolution.  &ldquo;You propose&rdquo;&mdash;that is Messrs.  Siemens&mdash;&ldquo;that your firm should have the contract for the supply of all material and for the construction of all works at market prices subject to the material being up to first-class specification.&rdquo;  I would like to know exactly what market prices mean.  Those of us who have experience of contracts in the carrying out of the work of local authorities, and other schemes, know that there are three forms in which we can obtain contracts.  There are what are known as lump sum contracts&mdash;that is a fixed amount for carrying out a scheme in accordance with the plans prepared by the engineers.  Then there are contracts based on a schedule of prices, and, again, there are contracts based on a percentage of cost.  Those are the three forms of contract as we know them, in commercial circles, to-day.</P>
    <P>But these proposals on which the contract is based are another matter. If we pass this resolution, these are the proposals which will form the contract, because on the one side you have the proposals put forward, and on the other side you have the acceptance put forward, so that that forms in itself a definite contract.  Once we pass this resolution we are committed to that contract.  Any further Bill that will be introduced can only embody what is contained in that contract.  Therefore it is very essential, before we approve of this contract, that we should know exactly what it means.  World market prices!  I do not know exactly what that means.  I do not know what it is that you would call a world market price for any commodity.  You have a price at works, and you have a price on delivery.  The delivery and the carriage in every country will be different. I am open to conviction on this point: I do not know what exactly is meant <Col N="1916" /> by world market prices in this contract. The President, who is experienced in the making of contracts on local bodies that he was connected with, will agree that contracts come under the three heads that I have mentioned.  But I cannot bring this contract under any of the three heads.  Clause 12 then goes on to state:&mdash;&ldquo;The civil engineering constructional work is to be offered to the Siemens Bau Union at a minimum tender, the firm agreeing to employ to the fullest practical extent Irish labour and Irish contracting firms.&rdquo;  Is that to be a competitive tender?  If it is not to be a competitive tender, how are we going to know whether it is a minimum and a reasonable tender?  The word &ldquo;competitive&rdquo; is not there.  If we pass this resolution, as I have said, we are accepting this contract.  It is in the vaguest terms.  These are matters that should be explained, that should be thoroughly understood, before they are accepted.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;When the contract for the construction is drawn up the Government should make the contractors undertake to assume a reasonable share of the increases in wages.  The experts were struck by the relatively high charge for building machinery shown in the estimates.  On the other hand, there is no item in Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert's estimate for &lsquo;unexpected costs&rsquo; such as is usual in similar calculations and which <Col N="1919" /> amounts in hydraulic constructional works to about 10 per cent. of the total construction costs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, further on, they proceed to say in the second paragraph, page 80:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The plan handed to the experts does not show any detailed constructions. According to the rules of the Swiss Institute of Engineers and Architects, with regard to the drawing up of engineers' plans, three different kinds of prepared plans are distinguished, viz.:&mdash;(1) General plan with approximate estimate; (2) building plan with estimates; (3) detailed elaboration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From the point of view of this differentiation Messrs.  Siemens-Schuc-kert's plan must be considered as a &ldquo;building plan.&rdquo;  It permits of a judgment&mdash;this is the important point&mdash;&ldquo;of probable costs,&rdquo; but it only permits of a judgment of probable costs &ldquo;within a margin of about 10 per cent.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>May I interrupt the Deputy for one moment?  He left out&mdash;I am sure it was unintentionally&mdash; in quoting from page 79 the word &ldquo;risk.&rdquo;  The paragraph reads: &ldquo;to assume a reasonable share of the risk of increases in wages.&rdquo;  I think had he not stopped in the paragraph where he was reading he would have found some explanation of what he complained of, to my mind a rather reasonable explanation.</P>

      <P>I do not want to take up the time of the House more than is necessary.  I want to be quite fair in any criticism I offer and if I have left out anything I am sure the President will see that that omission of mine is put right.  I would like an explanation from him of that last paragraph I have read, paragraph 2, on page 80.  It states that the plans supplied to the experts only permit of a judgment of the probable costs within a margin of about 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be wrong, but I read that very much in conjunction with the previous paragraph in which they say it is usual to put in unexpected costs to the extent of 10 per <Col N="1920" /> cent.  Then they go on to explain that what they have got in the nature of information permits of a judgment of the probable costs within a margin of about 10 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter on which I am glad to say I am capable of giving information, because it is a matter I have to deal with myself every other day.  If the President will allow me to correct him I will show him the reason of the statement of the experts in the last portion of the clause if he reads the first portion which I read.  The first portion of paragraph 2 is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The plan handed to the experts does not show any detailed constructions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Without a detailed plan it is impossible to give a definite estimate.  The plan supplied to them was only a general building plan without any details. On a general building plan it is impossible to prepare a definite estimate without details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is using one word which may not express the precise meaning.  The experts have divided the plans into three parts: (1) general plans with approximate estimate; (2) building plan with estimates, and (3) detailed elaboration. The Deputy now speaks of a general building plan.  If he means the first, they have got more than that.  He should refer to the second, as it is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the reason why they say that, on the information supplied to them, it is not possible to give an estimate nearer than a margin of 10 per cent.  The reason of that &mdash;and it is obvious to anyone who has experience in that particular industry&mdash; is that no details were forthcoming. Without the details it is not possible to give a definite estimate for a definite amount.  That is why they say that the figures they put forward can only be accepted as accurate within a margin of 10 per cent.  As I have said, there is a looseness and an indefiniteness, to put it mildly, about these proposals that will have to be cleared up, as far as I am concerned, at all events, before I will vote for the resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1921" /> If there is one thing more necessary than another in schemes of this magnitude, it is to see that the contract on which they are based is carefully and properly drawn.  I need not tell any Deputy in this House what might follow from a very loosely drawn contract and the larger the amount the greater the liability.  As I said, this is a subject on which I can speak with some authority, and having examined these proposals carefully and, I hope, reasonably, I have come to the definite conclusion, as the result of that examination, that the proposal before the House is one that I cannot subscribe to without further inquiry.  I pass from that aspect of the question to another aspect.  A great many criticisms have been offered and there seems to be a very considerable consensus of opinion among many who are entitled to form an opinion on this subject, that there is more than a doubt as to whether there will be a demand for the output of this scheme.  I am sure that Ministers and Deputies have heard many criticisms on that point.  Evidently the point was in the minds of the Government when they were considering the scheme. Those of you who have got it, will notice in the White Paper, in clause 3, the last clause on page 1, where it is mentioned: &ldquo;You&rdquo;&mdash;Messrs.  Siemens &mdash;&ldquo;propose to examine not only the existing market for power but to report on the future possibilities&mdash;industrial and other&mdash;that cheap power would promote.&rdquo; Messrs.  Siemens reply to that: &ldquo;We are dealing with a new country, and we have to base our estimate to a large extent on statistics from other countries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That does not appear in the White Paper, but I have taken it from their report.  The countries on which they base their statistics are&mdash;Norway, the Western States of North America, and Canada.  From what one knows of these countries, and of our own country, I do not think there is much in common. If a prudent business firm were to embark on an expenditure of this character as a commercial enterprise, I am quite sure that they would not be satisfied to take the figures of any of these other countries, but that they would have the district which it was <Col N="1922" /> proposed to supply, if not in whole, certainly in part, canvassed to see what the probable demand was likely to be. If any body of directors were to embark shareholders' money in a scheme of this magnitude without taking that necessary precaution, I am afraid that when they came before their shareholders there would be a bad time in store for them.  If you and I were shareholders and we found they had embarked on this expenditure without making any canvas of the area or forming any estimate based on that canvass, as to the likely demand for current in that area, we would be inclined to say that it was time we got other directors, that they were not looking after our interests.  What do we do here?  We are quite satisfied, apart from any canvass to take the figures from other countries and to apply them to our own.  That is not sound.  It is a method that would not be adopted by a commercial concern.</P>
    <P>I would urge that something of that character be done before we are committed to this proposal.  If the proposal be embarked on we all want to see it a success, but if the farming community are not behind these proposals where are we going to get the consumption for the current?  The Minister yesterday put before us data based on Dublin, and said that in 1932 the demand would be so-and-so.  Let me say on behalf of the cities that this scheme is not going to help the demand; it is not going to retard the demand in the cities.  We can get current to-day practically as cheap in Dublin to within a decimal part of a penny, as we hope to get it under this scheme, provided it is a success.  Current, as many Deputies know, and as the President can tell us, can be manufactured to-day in Dublin under a penny per unit at works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy, but, as a matter of fact, on the last returns published&mdash; the accounts of the Dublin Corporation for the period ended 31st March&mdash;the cost per unit sold in 1924 is 69d. for coal, and for other expenditure of generation, distribution and management, <Col N="1923" /> 1.66 of a penny.  I would like, furthermore, to direct the Deputy's attention to the fact that it is the most favourable year that could possibly be taken as far as the city of Dublin is concerned.  The total maximum supplied was 11,054 out of 12,000 kilowatts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Corporation is ideal, but I am sure the Corporation can do it.  We can manufacture current to-day in Dublin for less than 1d.  If there is any doubt on the point experts can come forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I must certainly express my grave doubt of that.  I will admit it is possible if capital costs have been written down and huge sums provided for depreciation.  You may arrive at it that way.  I am taking these particular figures that lend themselves to exact examination on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the tramway returns and I have not examined them, I do not want to take up time by going into them now.  I am satisfied that current can be manufactured to-day at 1d., or less than 1d., and I challenge the statement.  What is it proposed under this scheme to supply current at in Dublin?  It is something like .6 of a penny&mdash;something between ½d. and 1d.  The advantage we are going to get in the city is something between .6 of a penny and a penny.  That is assuming your scheme is an economic success, you can produce current at the rate set forth, and assuming that everything goes well and that you carry out the work within the estimate. Is that going to benefit the city?  In an area that I am connected with we had in the last few months a reduction of 1d. a unit, not a decimal part of a penny, but 1d. a unit, and as a result of that reduction I do not <Col N="1924" /> see any queue of possible consumers waiting outside or asking for current. When you come to commerce, the cost of power, after all, is a small matter. It is not the cost of the power that is the real expense to commerce.  It is the distribution and the installation of it.  There are Deputies who have had some knowledge of the cost of production and distribution.  In Dublin to-day the cost of production is in or about a penny&mdash;it may be something more.  What is the charge for current? Eightpence.  The cost of production is only one-eighth of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to interrupt the Deputy, but it is scarcely fair to say that the cost is eightpence.  The Deputy is leaving out of consideration the fact that actually more units are sold in the city for power and for heating than for lighting, and these units are certainly not sold at eightpence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>As the President knows, the profit in connection with a lighting station is not made on the powerunits sold.  They only give in a power station what is known as a day rate, and what is necessary, in order to run the station economically.  To get a consumption for that day rate, either by way of power or by way of heating, they are prepared to offer it practically at cost price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes under it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes under it.  But the scheme is never made successful by the power price; they rely on the lighting price, and I notice that the experts have relied very largely on a large consumption of current for lighting, knowing that thereby the revenue will be considerably augmented.  Deputy Egan touched the point yesterday when he said, and said rightly, that cheap current of itself will not be a very attractive thing, either for those in industry or for those who want power for private purposes.  The difficulty is the cost of installation, and except some means is devised for getting over that difficulty I am afraid that the demand will be exceedingly poor.  In connection <Col N="1925" /> with the different electricity systems in Dublin, I do not know whether or not the President is aware of the fact, but at their inception we had to provide means for getting over that difficulty. I do not know whether the President can call to mind the difficulties we had in connection with free wiring installation. I do not know whether that difficulty arose in the city, but we have had it in the townships, and it was a considerable difficulty.  I mention that as a factor for which no consideration has been given or provision made.  I am not in a position to form an idea as to what the cost of this installation will be, but I am quite satisfied that it will require a very considerable amount of money and, except as Deputy Egan very properly pointed out, something is done in that connection you will not get consumption for the current.  As I have said, I am not satisfied regarding the basis of consumption.  That is a matter, to my mind, that it is essential for the success of the scheme should be more thoroughly inquired into and put on a more definite basis before we are asked to accept the proposals.  Next I would urge that a canvass should be made of a portion of the district in order that an estimate might be formed as to the probable requirements, because I think everybody will agree that there is no use in producing the current except there is a demand for it. Deputy O'Sullivan said, in reply to another Deputy, that in this scheme we are putting the cart before the horse.</P>

      <P>I will go on with my argument and not have a discussion. If I let that in I would never finish it, and I must close the door.  Why were the experts not called in?  I do not know whether Deputy O'Sullivan has very much experience in matters of contracts and schemes.  I would ask him if he can call to mind any scheme <Col N="1926" /> where experts were not called in in the first instance to prepare the scheme and plans, and having got them, they were then sent out to contractors in order to get estimates?  That is the customary procedure.  That is putting the horse before the cart.  What is being done in this case?  They have put the cart before the horse in going first to the contractors.  This is a contractor's scheme, a contractor's estimate.  After they had received it they sent it to the experts for their report.  If that is not putting the cart before the horse I do not know what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go further into details.  I would only like to say in conclusion that there is not that confidence on the part of the public behind this scheme that one would like to see. If this scheme is to be made a success that confidence is necessary.  The only way that that confidence will be obtained is by opening the doors in connection with this scheme and giving the public and the citizens of the Saorstát full information in connection with it.  What is the position?  What is being done?  After pressing in the Dáil for months for copies of the Experts' Report and of the original proposals of Messrs.  Siemens we got them some two weeks ago.  We had not seen the plans; we had not seen the detailed estimate, and before these details were very little over two weeks in our hands, a resolution comes along binding the Dáil, and binding this State to this particular proposal.  That is not the way to carry confidence.  We are a new Government; we want to carry the confidence of our people; we want to establish a method of doing things that will be above suspicion.  Is that the way to do it?  We have in the Dáil, as I said, men who are experienced in carrying out schemes of this kind in connection with local and other authorities. I ask them as a result of that experience to say if they have ever been parties to a scheme of this character? Is it any reason, therefore, why an amount of suspicion shrouds this scheme?  I would urge upon the Government that the only way to get rid of that suspicion and to get that confidence behind this scheme which is essential to its success is to stop these <Col N="1927" /> rushing tactics, and give every information that is required.  As a result of having that information then bring your scheme before the Dáil, and if approved, we will put it through.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, when opening this debate, pointed out that we were debating the Shannon scheme and expressed shortly the hope that we would confine ourselves to the merits of that scheme.  Deputy Figgis raised various points.  He protested his own disinterestedness.  He praised Dr. McLaughlin, and he discussed certain relations between the Government and the promoters of the Liffey schemes. These have absolutely nothing to do with the merits of the Shannon scheme, and whatever may or may not be the relations between the Government and the promoters of the Liffey schemes, these are other questions that will have to be settled at some other time.  They can only be discussed now on the basis that some commitments in connection with the Liffey schemes shall prevent the Government from adopting the best scheme on its merits.  That is the question here&mdash;what is the best scheme on its merits, and any commitments there may or may not be in connection with any other scheme is something that will have to be settled on some other occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in opening the debate, put the whole position very clearly.  Let me quote some of his figures.  He pointed out that the scheme will proceed by definite steps.  There will be the canal, the power-house and the various distribution lines.  First of all, there is the 100 k.w., then the 35 k.w., and then the 10 k.w. lines.  The scheme will proceed in that way by various steps.  He pointed out distinctly and clearly that the consumption of electricity for domestic purposes, that is, for heating and lighting, as distinct from power, will be sufficient to make this scheme a <Col N="1928" /> paying proposition.  He made abundantly clear, I think, to anybody who was listening to him, that the scheme was not depending for its financial success on the consumption of electricity for power or that the real big argument in favour of the scheme was power. The Minister for Industry and Commerce gave certain figures, as I say. He pointed out that various tariffs could be imposed, that it was indeed extremely elastic, and that the particular rate here or there, whether it was to be a flat rate or whether it was to be a different rate for Dublin, a different rate for Cork, and a different rate for the small towns&mdash;one rate for big towns and another rate for the country&mdash;were questions which had to be decided later on, as a matter of policy, and on which the Dáil would have its say.  These are questions which should be decided.</P>
    <P>But he did give us samples of the various tariffs which could be adopted under the scheme.  He pointed out that if there was no demand for current except from Dublin and Cork, that at a certain figure, namely, 52d., electricity could be supplied here at the end of the 100 k.w. lines to Dublin, Cork and Limerick&mdash;these are the termini of the chief lines&mdash;at .52d. in bulk and would pay for the whole scheme up to that point, provided there was increased consumption amounting to 15 per cent. per annum.</P>
    <P>He made that abundantly clear to anybody who listened to him.  He gave other alternatives; he said that if you want to adopt a flat rate you can supply current in bulk, assuming always a certain increase in consumption,. at .74d. at the end of the 100 and 35 k.w. lines, that is, to Dublin and the towns of over 5,000 inhabitants, assuming a consumption of fifty units per inhabitant.  He went further: he pointed out that that would justify the scheme.  That was your second step, that the scheme would be a paying proposition on these assumptions, first of all to Dublin, Cork and Limerick, next, at the ends of the 35 k.w. lines, and again at the end of the 10 k.w. lines, taking the flat rate of .82d., the same rate as for Loughrea and Kilkenny, and assuming a certain increase in consumption, twenty-six to <Col N="1929" /> thirty units per inhabitant, the scheme would again pay.  These figures have not been challenged, and they cannot be challenged in any direction except one, that is the question as to whether you will get the increased consumption or not.  This is a very complicated scheme, and it is not to be wondered at if laymen become a little confused on various matters arising out of it.  But there are some things that should be clear, and it is clear, mathematically, provided you get the increased consumption which the Minister specifies, that at, let us say, .52d. at Dublin, Cork and Limerick the scheme pays, and so on at a flat rate of .72 for the second development, and .84 as a flat rate for the third development, the scheme will pay.  These figures simply cannot be challenged; they are mathematically accurate, provided you get the increased consumption. Before dealing with that question of whether you will get the increased consumption or not, we ought to be as clear as we can be on certain other matters which I think are simply not debatable. We are not dealing here with the price of electricity to the consumer, the price to the householder; it was never intended that we should, though that question may arise; Deputy Johnson mentioned it.  It may be, and I think that a time will come when the significance of this scheme, when all its reactions are realised, that there may be some demand in the Dáil some day that not only should the State control the production and distribution of electricity to the ends of the power lines, but should also control its distribution from the ends of the power lines to the householder.</P>
    <P>That may be, but the question we are dealing with here is the production and distribution of electricity up to the end of the transformer stations, whether they be in Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Kilkenny, Tipperary, or any other place.  That is the question.  We are basing our scheme on the simple economic proposition that it is a sound scheme if we can show that we are doing that work&mdash;producing and distributing electricity to that extent at a rate which is from 100 to 400 per <Col N="1930" /> cent. cheaper than that at which that particular work is being done at present, or is being done by any other scheme, or by any scheme which is in contemplation as a rival to this.  We ought to have that clear.  I was a little surprised&mdash;the Minister for Industry and Commerce mentioned it&mdash;to hear the extraordinary doctrine that the cost of production and distribution up to a point did not matter.  People who are absolutely sound, and who have the most respectable economic dogmas and beliefs, but who look upon the rest of us as theorists and a little dangerous in economics, sometimes enunciate doctrines which surprise me, and which would, I am sure, surprise Deputy Johnson.  We have been told by Deputy Good that the cost of production from 200 to 400 per cent. does not matter.  I sat here and listened to Deputy Good telling the Dáil that the cost of production varying from 200 to 400 per cent. did not matter, and did not enter into the economics of this scheme at all.  I think he justified that extraordinary economic heresy by saying that the difference, as regards the cost of production and distribution to the transformer stations, or what correspond to transformer stations, and the cost to the factory or household is very small in one case, and very big in the other.  That is the way he justified it.  We could get the facts. These statistics are known, and we have not to depend on eminent European experts for them.  They are here. I would like to know if Deputy Good, or any other Deputy, will contradict me when I say that the cost of production and distribution of electricity in towns in the country, outside Dublin and Cork, to what will correspond to transformer stations in this scheme, varies from about 2d. to 7d.  I have a list before me in the &ldquo;Electrical Times,&rdquo; and I can read it if necessary. The cost to the huseholder in these towns varies from about 6d. to 1/4, in other words just about double in some cases.  In other words, in the country towns of Ireland, and I venture to say in those of most countries, the costs with which this scheme deals are just about half the total costs.  Are these figures denied?  I am sure that <Col N="1931" /> there are various Deputies here who are on electric light committees and who will be able to deal with these matters.  These facts are undeniable, and yet we are told that the cost of production and distribution does not matter, and that the cost to the transformer stations to the end of the kilowatt line, the particular work which this scheme is doing, does not matter, notwithstanding that at present in practically every provincial town that cost amounts, roughly speaking, to between one-third and a little more than half the total cost.  These figures can be checked, and I should be delighted to be shown where they are wrong.  I know the figures for my own town. They have never been denied.  I discussed this with men in various towns.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tierney spoke of criticism, and I am surprised to hear that sort of criticism from Deputy Good, or, I should say, I am surprised a little bit, and perhaps satisfied.  We may have differences on other economic matters with Deputy Good, and I am delighted that he has made me a present of this extraordinary statement.  I am genuinely surprised that a business man would stand over such a statement.  We know that small matters make all the difference in business.  We know that in agriculture they make all the difference, and we know that counting the pence and the halfpence makes all the difference.  This is a matter of 50 per cent. of the total cost, so far as the country towns are considered.  I deliberately left out Dublin because the position of Dublin seems to be a bit debatable.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Good say that electricity was produced at a penny for distribution to the citizens of Dublin.  I have here a supplement to the &ldquo;Electrical Times&rdquo; for 1924 which was not prepared for the purposes of the Shannon scheme, or for the Liffey scheme, or for any other scheme, but for the purpose of a first-class paper giving accurate information of its own.  I find the cost of production, at what corresponds to the transformer station in Dublin, is 2.42d. and the average cost to the citizens is 5.07d.  That includes power. That means that the cost to the citizen <Col N="1932" /> for lighting and heating is probably more than 5.07d. but it does not affect the cost of production of 2.42d.  The &ldquo;Electrical Times&rdquo; may, of course, be wrong.  I am making a present of it to Deputy Good.  I have discussed this with many people besides going to the obvious sources of information and this is the first time I heard that electricity was, in fact, produced and delivered in bulk in Dublin at less than one penny at what would correspond to the transformer station under the Shannon scheme.  I venture to accept the figure of the &ldquo;Electrical Times&rdquo; as against that of Deputy Good.  I have here the cost all over the country and every town in the country, and it is, I should say, between about an average of 6d., or, to be absolutely conservative, 4d., and I should say that the cost to the householder is between 6d. and 9d., going up to 1/- and 1/2.  Dundalk is undoubtedly the best served of any provincial town in Ireland for various reasons, and it supplies a large quantity for power purposes.  The cost of production and distribution is 2.64d.  That is easily the best town in Ireland, and it is probably amongst the best in England or Scotland.  Yet the cost is 2.64d.

      <P>The Deputy knows perfectly well that is like the flowers that bloom in the spring: it has nothing to do with the case.  We are comparing what the Shannon scheme can do under present conditions against any other scheme, and we must compare figures with figures that are approximate.  I am comparing the figures for the cost of power delivered in bulk to the transformer station here with the cost of the power delivered in bulk to the power house in Dublin.  The Shannon scheme proposes to regulate electricity from production to distribution in bulk at the end of k.w. lines.  That is undeniable. It is not proposed at present, <Col N="1933" /> but another day it may come, when the distribution of electricity from the end of the k.w. lines to the householder will be controlled.  Let us compare things that are comparable.  These are the figures from the most conservative paper.  Anything is good enough to kick this scheme with, but nothing is conservative enough or statistically accurate enough to adduce in its favour. We are supposed to be hilarious Irishmen, scattered brained.  We produce figures and facts from the sources where you go normally for these things, but they are all wrong, but matters of opinion, provided they come from the experts in this country, are quite all right.  I leave that point. As lay men, as jury men, there are no two questions about it; we are forced to accept the facts as we find them.  I am not saying that electricity cannot be produced by a power plant under certain conditions at ½d. perhaps less. I could probably do it myself at home if I set out to produce electricity at .5 by a power plant.  I would buy a special sort of engine, and go into the whole case of producing, not exactly the amount of electricity I wanted for commercial purposes, but just to show that I could produce electricity at .5.  But this is a commercial proposition, and I am pointing out that the Shannon scheme as proposed is a commercial proposition.  It is not for Deputy Good to say that we should judge it on any other lines.</P>

      <P>May I make the point clear?  What I said was that the current could be produced in the city at 1d. The Minister does not doubt that.  He tells us, what is not new, that current can be produced in bulk at 1d.  It certainly can be produced in bulk at 1d. There is no doubt on the subject at all. Under the Shannon scheme it would be .52 of 1d.  I say it will be produced in the city at 1d., and he says under the Shannon scheme it will be reduced to .52.  There is the only advantage of the scheme, if it is an advantage at all to the city.</P>

      <P>I stated deliberately that I omitted the City of Dublin, because <Col N="1934" /> there was a difference of opinion between the figure there and the country. I had the authority merely of the &ldquo;Electrical Times,&rdquo; but I may say I am entitled to take that as correct.</P>

      <P>I say the figures for the production and distribution of electricity in the &ldquo;Electrical Times&rdquo; are in bulk 2.4.  It is that figure that is to be compared with .5 of the Shannon scheme.  I admit that you could produce electricity at .5 if you want to do it, but it is not being done, and there is no scheme that contemplates doing it for Dublin and the rest of the country. That is all I say.  It is possible to misconstrue this in other directions.  It may be said it is not proposed, in fact, to give electricity to a country town at .84.  It was not proposed, or rather, I should say, that it is not decided yet. That is merely possible&mdash;it is merely a tariff&mdash;that is, a flat rate.  For instance, it may be decided here later on to give electricity to Dublin at .03 I want to reduce it to absurdity, and for that reason to increase the price to the country, or at least, to come down to a business matter, it may be decided to give electricity to Dublin at one penny, which, according to the &ldquo;Electrical Times,&rdquo; would be 100 per cent. less than it is given at present&mdash; that is, it would be one half less.  In order to give power particularly cheap there are immense possibilities of variations. I pointed out that the only possibility of these figures being in error was the possibility that the consumption would not be increased.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in opening this debate, told the Dáil the particular considerations on which he rested his belief&mdash;that the consumption would increase up to the point needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He gave certain figures for consumption in other countries.  He took the case of Dublin, and he showed that the increase required from the present figure was from 42 to 80, bringing the consumption for power and other purposes to 118, and he compared that with the figures in other countries, <Col N="1935" /> Switzerland, Norway and Denmark.  It was very much less than in other countries. He showed that the average for Norway was 400 to 800.  Switzerland from 600 to 700, and that in Denmark, which is a country fairly comparable to ours, or at least with which our country is often compared, the consumption was considerably more than we were asking for or expected here, but he did not confine statistics, facts and comparisons, with other countries. I do not understand why it is necessary to attack this particular point by assuming that the Minister rested his case exclusively on foreign countries as Deputy Good did.  He asked why should we incur all the expense, why should we undertake this scheme, solely by reference to conditions in other countries, and merely comparing our expectations with the conditions in other countries.  He did not do anything of the kind.  He pointed out that he was taking&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS AND AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS AND AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS AND AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>He pointed out that he was taking the opinion not only of the continental experts, but of the City Engineer, Mr. Kettle.  He pointed out that the City Engineer had stated professionally that he expected an increase of 15 per cent. per annum, and that that increase of 15 per cent. per annum would work out to more units per head of the population in Dublin than actually Messrs. Siemens require. Deputy Good will hardly deny that. Yet the statement is made that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is resting his case solely on foreign experts. The Minister for Industry and Commerce pointed out that the increase last year was 17 per cent. in Dublin.  There was a comparable increase in Rathmines, and a very considerable increase in the various towns electrified in the country.  He pointed out that per head of the population owing to the special circumstances, this country was not merely so well electrified as other countries, but that it was very far, indeed, from saturation <Col N="1936" /> point.  Yet we are accused of resting our expectations of an increased consumption solely on the opinion of foreign experts.  Supposing we did.  Deputy Good suggested that there were very big differences between Norway and this country, that there were big differences also between Denmark and this country and between Sweden and this country from that point of view.  It is not good enough merely to say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are differences between Norway and this country, between Sweden and this country, and between Denmark and this country, but we must have more than the <i>ipse dixit</i> of Deputy Good to show that certain developments which took place in Denmark or Norway or countries like those are not going to take place here.  We must have a little more than the theory of a double dose of original sin, or that nothing ever works out properly here.  Deputy Good did not, of course, say that.  I know conditions well in Denmark and Sweden, and I cannot see why there should not be some comparison between the conditions of Denmark and this country and Sweden and this country. I have not the slightest doubt that we shall show Denmark a thing or two in agriculture in a few years.  We have done it already in some things, and I have not the slightest doubt but that our development in other directions will be as good as that of Denmark or any of those countries.  I refuse utterly to reject the evidence which can be obtained by comparison with those countries, especially when that evidence is verified by the experience of at least one man who is in a peculiarly good position to judge, and by what has actually happened in the last two years, and what has actually happened notwithstanding the present hopeless conditions and the present price of electricity. The fact of the matter is that if we are not prepared to take a decision on the facts which we have before us in regard to consumption, then we do not believe in ourselves, and there is no use in arguing against anybody who refuses to accept the logical implication of those figures.  We will not get any further by doing it.  The position of <Col N="1937" /> the Government is that they are prepared. That is the one debatable point.  The scheme is absolutely water-tight provided you accept that, and provided you accept the position that Messrs.  Siemens are competent engineers for this work, and that the four experts who have examined it, not for the purpose of holding a brief for either side, are competent to judge the technical details of this scheme.  It must work out.  Let us assume&mdash;I know the assumption will shock some people&mdash;that it works out financially as has been projected; that is to say, that it works out successfully, as a result of the increased consumption of electricity for domestic purposes, that you have your 100, 30, or 35 kilowatt lines, distributed through the country; in other words, that you have your transformer stations all over the country, down to every village of 500 inhabitants.  The price is whatever you like; it may be smaller in Dublin, and higher in other parts of the country, or bigger here. The scheme is paying interest, sinking fund, overhead expenses, and is paying that, as is contemplated, on the consumption of electricity for domestic purposes.  The Minister pointed out that the production of electricity was based on the production in the driest year for thirty years, and that under normal circumstances you would have a big increase&mdash;nearly twice as much electricity produced at the bus bars in the centralisation in Limerick.  He made it abundantly clear&mdash;this is the point which even the morning papers are unable to get&mdash;that he would have that electricity together with any other electricity not required for domestic consumption for practically giving away for power.  There was no necessity to include in the price of that electricity any of the overhead or distribution expenses down to the end of the ten kilowatt line.  Looking at it commercially, there is no necessity to charge any other expenses except the cost of distribution from the ten kilowatt line in the small village down in the country to any little business near it that wants electricity for power purposes&mdash;an infinitesimal cost, if you want to put it on a commercial basis, and only .00 something of one penny.  There <Col N="1938" /> is no getting away from that, if you once admit that the scheme works out as intended.  I merely insist on that to show what are the possibilities of this scheme.  Assuming that it is sound, assuming the consumption for domestic purposes is what it is expected to be, assuming that you have, in fact, dotted transformer stations all over the country, power can, as a matter of national policy, be given away practically for nothing.  For instance, I spoke a moment ago about the possibility of increasing the present figure of .5d. to 1d. for Dublin.  That might very well be.  That would certainly enable you to give away power for nothing. Or do what Deputy Professor O'Sullivan suggested when he pointed out that power available under this scheme was the most effective and efficient form of protection which the State could have at its disposal.  There are simply immense possibilities, and there is no class in the country stands more to gain from the scheme than the farmers, not only from the social point of view, but from the strictly economic point of view as well.  Deputy Good will agree that, in these matters, what makes the difference between success and failure is the having of all the requisites together.  You may have your port, you may have fairly perfect transit arrangements, you may have your river, and you may have your raw materials, but you have not the power. What we have often seen happening in this country is that all the requisites are present except one.  And that one makes all the difference.  Here you can distribute power practically for nothing. There is no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>If I were asked: what are the possibilities of this scheme for agriculture, from the economic point of view, I would not care to risk quoting concrete examples at the moment.  But I do know that, as farmers get more educated, and as agriculture develops in this country, the industry will become more industrialised.  It must, undoubtedly, prove a tremendous advantage in that event to agriculture to have cheap power distributed practically all over the country.  I do not want to quote concrete examples.  We are talking <Col N="1939" /> business, and a particular example, for a good many reasons, might not work out.  It is obvious that if agriculture is to become industrialised at all&mdash;and it must become industrialised in a great many directions&mdash;that the possibility of having power not only in Dublin or in Limerick or in the twenty-thousand-inhabitant towns, but if necessary in the recesses of the country, is going to be a tremendous advantage.</P>
    <P>We are urged to give this scheme very careful examination.  We are told that it should be criticised in every detail.  We are told that the whole future of the country, in one way or another, may depend upon it.  We get that good advice from all quarters, and we agree with it.  But, as Deputy Professor O'Sullivan pointed out yesterday, this scheme has got incomparably more criticism and incomparably superior criticism to any other scheme ever put before the Dáil.  There is no doubt whatever about that.  We all welcome criticism.  Deputy Professor Tierney was, I think, a little misunderstood to-day.  He, too, welcomes criticism. He made that quite clear.  The extraordinary thing about this scheme is that the scheme has obviously got no attention and no examination of any kind from the wise men and the people of sense who were advising us to pause, to hesitate, and to give the scheme the most elaborate and careful criticism. I know a certain amount about the scheme as a layman, and I would be able to judge somewhat of the merits of particular points raised.  But I must say that if I am to take seriously the criticism that this scheme has got in the Press and by the Press&mdash;criticism through letters, through reports from various organisations and criticism by the Press itself&mdash;then, I can only come to one conclusion, if I wish to be charitable&mdash;that is, that the people criticising this scheme have never paid it the compliment of examining it or examining the report of the experts.  That is the only conclusion, if you wish to be charitable.  You can come to other conclusions if you like, but the most charitable explanation of some of the criticism which I have seen of this report in the Press and by the <Col N="1940" /> Press is that the authors did not think it worth their while to read it, while at the same time impressing upon this &ldquo;young and enthusiastic Government&rdquo; the importance of <i>Festina lente.</i> Deputy Heffernan made the same point, that we should have this report examined carefully, and, as I say, I agree with him.</P>
    <P>As I say, I agree with him.  He suggested something like the procedure at a Private Bill Committee: that the experts should be cross-examined.  The Deputy's suggestion was that these experts should be brought in and cross-examined by other experts on this scheme in the same way as experts are examined before a Private Bill Committee. I know what happens with these experts.  They are briefed on each side.  One side gets up and makes certain statements, and, of course, the experts on the other side contradict what has been said.  That is what happens in every legal case, and that is exactly what we are saving Deputy Heffernan from.  We asked the greatest firm of engineers in the world for this kind of work to put up a scheme.  We then picked out four men of outstanding European reputation, not to defend the scheme, but to advise the Executive Council judicially as to the merits of the various points in the scheme.  We will not get close to each other unless it is accepted that these experts were, first of all, men of outstanding reputation in their profession, and that they came into the scheme not to defend it or to condemn it, but to examine it judicially.  That is the fact and that is what has happened.</P>
    <P>While you can understand the point of view that experts&mdash;that point of view has been put up here in the Dáil &mdash;are always biassed, I suggest to Deputies that they ought to remember, when dealing with these particular gentlemen, that they are dealing with profound scholars and scientists, with men who have spent their lives not in commercial occupations but in the pursuit of pure knowledge for its own sake.  That is their standing in the scientific world, and you must realise that.  When you are criticising them, you must make up your mind as to whether these are the sort of men that <Col N="1941" /> should be brought before a special committee to be cross-examined by various parties holding various briefs.  You have to ask yourself this: whether a firm like Messrs. Siemens, whether men of that sort of experience, men whose opinion is sought after in every centre of enlightenment in Europe, would forget, for instance, to consider the strength of the embankments or to go into a question like the nature of the subsoil, or that they would neglect to go into the various footy points that the ordinary engineer goes into when preparing a contract for, say, a body like Town Commissioners.  That is really all I have to say.</P>
    <P>Your best guarantee of the soundness of the scheme put forward is the reputation of the contractors who are undertaking the work and the reputation of the men who have given it their approval.  That is the best guarantee you can have, and a delay in examination of the usual kind which we are used to, in connection with schemes in this country, would not give you anything comparable to, or anything that could be substituted for, that sort of guarantee. That is the position.  In any event the Government are quite satisfied, and rightly satisfied, with these men, and they will have to be given some better reasons for delay than the argument that has been adduced up to the present. I am extremely glad indeed that this scheme is to be proceeded with immediately. I do think, if it were nothing else, this scheme will give this country an image and a picture of how great things are done by great countries. It will give the country something to think about besides the little sordid personalities and jealousies and so on that have been masquerading under all sorts of guises during the last two or three years here.  It will be good for this country to see a firm like Messrs. Siemens in the centre of the country carrying out a big and a great undertaking and carrying it out in the way that things are done in great countries&mdash;in countries that have become great, and that have made a name for themselves, not only in their material but in their spiritual and mental work.</P>

      <P>The Minister for <Col N="1942" /> Industry and Commerce invited Deputies to direct their discussion on this motion to the report, and to specific points in the report.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture has invited criticism, and, I believe, the Government, as a whole, invite fair criticism.  I am anxious to give fair criticism, and I want to be fair&mdash;as fair as Deputy Good was&mdash;in every sense of the word. I regret that more Deputies in the Dáil did not accept the invitation of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. To my mind, much of this debate is taken, on one side, in support of the amendment of Deputy Connor Hogan, simply as a request for delay without giving reasons for it, and as a request for an appeal to more international experts. On the other side, there is a misapprehension of what I believe to be the position of the proposer and seconder of this amendment&mdash;namely. the imputation to them of opposition to the Shannon scheme.  Now, I would like to make my own position in the matter perfectly plain from the very start, and then to proceed to justify it. I do not feel that I can support the amendment of Deputy Connor Hogan. I do not want more international experts brought into criticise the international experts we have had, and I am entirely in favour of the Shannon scheme.  If Deputies remember the remarks I made after the Minister for Industry and Commerce introduced this scheme on the 19th December last, they will recollect, I think, that I am as much attracted by the glamour of the Shannon scheme as anyone.  I am absolutely all out for development, and I say, let us have it.  But we are asked to-day to go a little further, very much further: We are asked, not to say that we want the Shannon scheme, or to say that we want the Shannon scheme in preference to the Liffey scheme.  If we were, I would say, let us have the Shannon scheme in preference to the Liffey scheme, and let us go over the whole country rather than over a section of it.  What we are asked to say is, that we must take this particular Shannon scheme, with all its engineering specifications and details, and bind ourselves to it.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but what we are <Col N="1943" /> asked to do is to bind ourselves to this particular method of carrying out the Shannon scheme.  It is there that I begin to find myself in difficulties.</P>
      <P>I do not think I should be doing my duty in this House if I did not endeavour to put as much knowledge as I have at the absolute disposal of Deputies. I have no interests to serve in this matter at all.  I am not an engineer, though I may have a good deal to do with the training of engineers.  I can, therefore, claim to speak, to a certain extent, with some knowledge on a scheme of this kind, and I do not think I should be acting rightly if I did not acquaint the Dáil absolutely with the conclusions at which I have arrived after as much study as I could give to the scheme in the time at my disposal. I hope the House will bear with me while I try to put them in possession of the conclusions I have arrived at. I may become somewhat technical in the statement I have to make, but in doing this I am accepting the invitation of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I therefore intend to go into certain details of the report. I want, in the first place, to see if I am correct myself, and if I am to put Deputies in possession of what the full scheme really means, and as to what possibilities of power it holds out to the country.  In that connection, I desire, first of all, to draw the attention of Deputies to the table opposite page 102 in the experts' report, to which the Minister referred.  I want to state what I understand from that table, and if I am not right the Minister will correct me.  If I am right as to what the table means, then I want Deputies to understand it, too, because in this matter I cannot find myself in complete agreement with Deputy Johnson.  We are not having this scheme put before us as a State scheme in so far as it is to be financed by State money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are having this put to us as a commercial proposition, and we have got to justify it as a commercial proposition. We have to see that there are in the scheme full possibilities, what those possibilities are, to what extent they can satisfy the demands of the country, and to what extent if the country will <Col N="1944" /> develop, as I hope it will, this scheme can pay for itself.  We are not being asked to vote money for it from the State.  In the request I am going to make to the Government I shall urge upon them that in the attempt to make this a commercial proposition, to make absolutely sure that the first step we take in the development of the country shall be a step forward and not a false step, and one which, if false, will retard the development of the country for a generation, they should be absolutely assured, as far as human beings can be, that the step they are taking will work out successfully for the development of the country.  A few weeks spent more or less in satisfying themselves as to its soundness from the engineering point of view and the commercial point of view will not be waste time and will not expose them or those who ask for it to the imputation that they are throwing back this question for ten years or anything of that kind, but that it will simply let the people know, for one thing, that the Government is determined to take every step humanly speaking they can to satisfy themselves that the scheme is engineeringly and commercially sound before it asks for public support for it.  Now, I wish in connection with these tables to draw Deputies' attention to what apparently is going to be promised by the Shannon scheme in a dry year, in a year of average rainfall, and in a wet year, and to ask Deputies to satisfy themselves that they fully understand what the proposed scheme means in the future.</P>
    <P>Before I quote figures I think perhaps it is worth while spending a little time, I will not be long, on the technical point of view, in explaining how I approach this myself, and then asking Deputies to approach it that way.  I take Mr. Chaloner Smith's figures.  I take his rainfall for the last 30 years. I notice how the rainfall fluctuated.  I took his calculations and I checked them as to the average total quantity of the flow that can be secured if we were able to completely store all the water that fell in a year, all the excess rain in a wet year, so as to set a balance against the fall occurring in a dry year. The upshot of that is that that average flow would amount to something between <Col N="1945" /> 8,000 and 9,000 cubic feet per second, and that if you were able to store all the water so that you could count on that, it would mean allowing, which is very nearly the case, fifty million units for every 1,000 cubic feet on a fall of 100 feet, very nearly four hundred and fifty million units per year if you were able to make use of the whole flow by storing up in the wet years and keeping that excess for the dry years.  But, as Mr. Chaloner Smith himself points out in the discussion of this report before the civil engineers, to do that you would require eight million acre-feet of storage, and that would be equivalent to from 68 to 69 feet in depth over 136 square miles of lake and river surface in the Shannon above Killaloe.  The Government, to get the average they count on of between four and five hundred million units, would have to be able to store up the whole losses, assuming no loss by evaporation, in a wet year to balance a dry year, and then they could count upon that for the average power&mdash; about 400 million units to the year. That 68 or 69 feet of rise in the river, at Lough Derg, is not a thing that we can regard as a possibility.  It is not touched, or anything like it, in this scheme.  I will give, in a moment, what the storage in this scheme really does. It practically does not affect that aspect of the question.  It does not at all secure for you that in the average year you can count upon that average amount of electricity for a year, that is 400,000,000 units.  It does not secure that for you at all.  It practically means that in any particular year you could count upon the minimum.</P>
    <P>You may have more, you may have an average amount, and you may have an excess amount.  Moreover, what you are going to have you will not know until it comes, because it depends upon the rainfall.  You can again have a minimum, and that minimum flow, instead of being a flow of between eight and nine thousand cubic feet per second, is a flow of about six thousand cubic feet per second.  You can depend upon getting 260,000,000 units per year, and that is the utmost amount of electricity that you can count upon getting <Col N="1946" /> from this scheme if developed to the very fullest.  You may count, if you can arrange for, the selling of 260,000,000 units; you may have more, but you will not know until you get it. But what chance will there be of selling it if it comes suddenly, and you do not know it is coming beforehand? It simply means that you will not know what to do with it, because there is not the customer handy to whom you can sell it.  That is taking the matter up from the first point of view&mdash;namely, the average that you can count upon per year, but unfortunately that does not settle the question from the engineering point of view.  You must take that flow, and consider how it is distributed throughout the year, and that is where the question of storage comes in as dealt with in this scheme.  In this connection the engineers approached the matter from the point of view of what the demand for their output is likely to be, and they have found, favourably for us in that connection, that the demand in summer is very much less than in winter.  That is very favourable for us, because, of course, our supply in summer is also much less than it would be in winter. But it is very much less, and in order to secure that there should be available in the summer the supply that would be required if the demand rose as the engineers hope it would rise they had to provide themselves with this additional storage so as to equalise the flow, and to get enough flow in the summer in order to meet the demand. I think I am right in understanding the remarks of the Minister in this connection, and my interpretation of them is rather different from the way that Deputy Johnson understood them, and I hope the Minister will check me if I am wrong.  He used some words which, to my mind, indicated that he was going on the basis of the dry month in the dry year, but he did not at all indicate that the total number of units proposed to be supplied in the year was calculated for the whole year as a certain number of times the flow that would take place in the dry months of the dry year.  What I understood him to mean was that he took the supply for the dry months as meeting the <Col N="1947" /> demand in the dry months, and that along with that he took the increased demand in the winter months, and matched that off with what he knew would be available&mdash;namely, the increased supply in the winter months. And, therefore, his estimate of 115,000,000 units as consumed in the year being based on a dry month as a start was quite right, but it did not at all mean that he took the total supply as determined by the amount that came down in the dry month in a dry year, because the supply fluctuated very much with the demand in that respect. Now, taking that does not even exhaust the extra supply that occurs in the wet months, and that is where this additional 50,000,000 units comes from that the Minister said would be available in the winter months, and which it is proposed to deal with in this report by means of seasonal industries.</P>

      <P>Quite true.  That was the point I was coming to, but taking the average year you would have a total flow a great deal more than that in the minimum year.  If you had a minimum flow you would have an excess, but if you had an average year, instead of a total flow of between five and six thousand feet you would get a total of between eight and nine thousand feet, which would give you a total maximum number of 260,000,000 units instead of 165,000,000 units to which the Minister referred.  That is the point, I think the Minister wished to make.  What do we understand as a matter of fact by this average year? Many of us, I think, would probably be ready to say that in an ordinary year you may expect that, and you will have that amount of electricity still.  But it does not mean that at all.  It means that making that mathematical calculation spread out over a certain number of years, adding up the whole flow and dividing by that number, you get that figure.  If you take the whole rainfall over 30 years you will not find a single year in which the flow was that <Col N="1948" /> amount.  In about half you will find it appreciably above and in the other half appreciably below.  Taking the whole thirty years, you will find that about ten, or perhaps a little more&mdash; somewhere between ten, twelve and thirteen is my calculation&mdash;will bring you pretty close to the average.  For a large number of years you might get the full excess, and then for a considerable number of years you would have a good deal less.</P>
      <P>The average year in this report does not mean at all the year that you may expect.  That is quite a different thing. The average year in this report means what you would get year in and year out.  If you were able to check the full excess in a wet year, and then check it in a dry year, it would be different but you cannot do that.  The total amount of electricity you can count on getting from this scheme is not 400 million units, as might be gathered from the statement.  I do not think it was ever intended it should be.  It will be more like 260 million units.  You may have, quite unexpectedly, far and away more than that.  You may have, perhaps, twice that output, and possibly more.  But you will not know you have it until the period comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object which I have set before myself in getting up is that I want to try to show that the scheme requires more investigation.  The very report of the experts requires a certain amount of technical knowledge before it can be accurately understood.  I understood the Minister to say&mdash;and I think I was right in so understanding him&mdash;that he himself had been hampered since last December by not being able to spend money on the investigation of this report.  I quite appreciate that he must have been.  I put this to the Dáil: we should set the Minister absolutely free; we should empower him to spend all the money that he pleases&mdash;I go so far as that&mdash;in testing this scheme in any way that the Government may think desirable.  We should empower him to spend what money the Government pleases in getting any expert or other information that they like, in whatever way they like, whether they choose to get it tested by people here with technical <Col N="1949" /> knowledge&mdash;I do not call them experts &mdash;or in any other way.  They should put the matter to the fullest test, and spend money in so doing, so that they could be completely satisfied as to the soundness of the scheme, and so that they shall be advised by those who do know whether the scheme is completely sound or not.  I took up the report with a certain amount of knowledge, and I come across repeatedly&mdash;I do not know how often&mdash;statements, some of which have already been referred to in the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, for certain. I have not gone at all into the matter technically.  I do not want to be too technical; in a debate of this kind one cannot be technical.  The only way one can satisfactorily debate a thing of this kind is over a table when you would have figures and facts to go upon, and you could then debate it in a close way.  As far as I can understand, I am convinced that you can count upon getting, with complete development, about 260 million units.  You may be suddenly faced with having at your disposal over twice that quantity. In an average year you will be getting 400 million units instead of 260 million; but you do not know when the average year is about to come.  You can, however, be certain on having 260 million units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full storage capacity, as proposed in the full scheme set forth here, is based by taking the demand curve, as it is called, considering what the demand will be in the summer and in the winter, and making up the total power required to meet it.  That is balanced by means of your storage, and that is where the second average comes in.  By this increased storage you can balance your flow throughout <Col N="1950" /> the year in such a way as to get over the great difficulty which occurs in the curve in summer, when the flow is very small.  You can meet the demand in the summer and the increased demand in the winter by means of that storage; but when you do that, taking the experts' curve, it simply means that you are providing power which is produced on a flow of a little over four thousand feet instead of 5½ thousand feet, which occurs in the minimum year.  What do the experts propose to do by means of this storage?  Because of the fact that there is such a drop in flow in summer, they can only propose to meet with a comparatively small demand in summer, and that is the meaning of such a paragraph as you will find in the report.</P>

      <P>Page 109&mdash;&ldquo;The National Supply must not only limit, by suitable clauses in the contracts, the maximum power to be used by the large consumers, but they must also limit for every month of the year the amount of energy (units) which the consumers may use.&rdquo;  It would not do if you had too great a demand in the summer.  Even the storage proposed in the later scheme will only give a limited supply in the summer, because the flow is so small, and it will be found that the total power sold then with that storage does not correspond with the total flow that occurs in a dry year.  It only corresponds with the flow of 4 thousand feet instead of the minimum flow of 5½ thousand cubic feet.  The scheme does not propose to use, and it could not use, the whole flow unless you are able to utilise the storage to a far greater degree than is either commercially or engineeringly possible.  I was about to put forward the reasons for which I claim, in specific points, that this report requires further consideration.  I am prepared, as I say, to leave it absolutely to the Government as to how they will give it that further consideration. Let them satisfy themselves in any way they please, on the specific point, that the scheme is sound and will be a paying proposition.  Let <Col N="1951" /> them not be hampered by any restrictions as to money.  Give them a free hand.</P>
      <P>I ask the Government not to ask us to-day to commit ourselves to agree to a scheme in which we are bound to engineering details, as I take it we will be doing if we agree to this scheme. If we pass this resolution that the Government asks us to pass, we are bound to engineering details and to the scheme put up by Siemens-Schuckert in that form.  I say that you have only to read this report with some comparatively small technical knowledge and you will see&mdash;over and over again you will come across a place&mdash;where the experts in their report say they want further information.  I say you should get that information.  Go to further expense if necessary and let them satisfy themselves.  The time that will be taken up in so doing will not be waste time.  It will be time well spent, and quite possibly it may result in securing further support for the scheme.</P>

      <P>That is not quite clear.  I will read one or two passages that I have in mind.  &ldquo;At all other places, when peat was at all present, it was in very small quantities.  From this it follows that the construction of embankments on the Shannon river between Lough Derg and Lough Rea in all probability should cause no difficulties.&rdquo; That refers to later developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>True; but suppose the engineers, when they come to work out the scheme, find that the thing is a matter of very great difficulty, it will then be too late to mend your hand without landing yourself in enormous costs.  You would want to <Col N="1952" /> know your costs before you undertake a scheme of this magnitude.  It will not do to undertake the scheme believing that everything will be all right and that it is going to cost you, say, five millions or six millions, and then you find that it will cost you about twice as much.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <P>In view of the engineering difficulties which arise in schemes of this kind, difficulties of a very serious character which may arise say in the foundations of your embankments, does the Minister really think the ten per cent. margin is sufficiently safe to meet the serious possibilities of that kind in a huge scheme of this sort?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I say simply this, that when the experts who discovered these difficulties say that a 10 per cent. addition to the cost is a reasonable addition, for such contingencies, I am prepared to accept that.</P>

      <P>You read on the very next page: &ldquo;Thus the material for the embankment can be got by dredging, but the experts would nevertheless point out that the choice of the spot for dredging is one for particular care and will require further borings.&rdquo; It is just the kind of thing which you meet in an expert's report, when they want to be extremely careful lest things turn out differently from what they expect. It is not guaranteed by any means.  It is a sort of danger signal in the report when you really read it carefully. I think Deputy Johnson already drew attention to one very important point.  He drew attention, I think, to the end of page 20, where some of the experts have this very vague statement: &ldquo;The material available does not appear unsuitable for embankments as it is water-tight.  On the other hand, it is not resisting enough to withstand the attack of flowing waters.&rdquo;  One <Col N="1953" /> would want something a great deal more definite than that before one binds oneself to a scheme of this kind.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  I do not want to be unfair.  I had better read the whole thing: &ldquo;Therefore special protection is judged necessary for the bottom of the canal, as also for the slopes where they do not lie in rocks.  This point will be further referred to in the constructional section.&rdquo; I do not think, however, it is completely dealt with in the constructional section; there is certainly nothing definite in that connection.  I am only giving him my opinion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misunderstanding the point I made.  I referred to the paragraph which said that the materials are capable of resisting the pressure of the embankment.  My point was that the materials referred to are capable of resisting the pressure of the embankments but that Sir John Griffith had raised the question and I thought for the purpose of reassuring a timid public that point should be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not quite understand that that was the reason that the Deputy raised this matter.  I thought the Deputy was objecting, as I am, to the very vague way in which approval is given to these embankments. The sand appears to be somewhat too fine: that is a very vague statement, indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  My point is simply this.  I do want to go into technical matters, but going through the report it makes me come to the conclusion over and over again that the experts really wanted more time to consider this scheme, and is not that quite natural?  You bring experts over from a country where conditions are completely different to those obtaining here.  No matter how good they may be it is impossible for them to achieve the <Col N="1954" /> task you set them.  In two months you expect them to familiarise themselves with the conditions, climatic engineering, and economic, and everything else over here.  You expect them to familiarise themselves with all these conditions, to go into all the details of a huge scheme of this sort and to present their final report in two months.  That is all you gave them.  Is it reasonable? No matter what kind of men they may be, they could not do it.  Can one wonder if one comes across in their report instances from which it is perfectly obvious that they have been pressed for time?  Can one criticise them because, for example, in the case of Lough Rea, they made only four borings?  Would any engineer guide himself by four borings for an area of that kind?  One does not criticise the experts because they had not the time available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a construction which will not be likely for ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely take that to illustrate it.  There are several other points.  I am quite ready to be convinced on them as I am on the whole matter.  I am quite ready to be convinced, and, if I am satisfied, to give such support as I can to the scheme. I am merely taking up the attitude that I will not agree to the scheme, without further information.  I am open to conviction, if you like to put it that way.  I take both the Minister's remarks in this connection and the report in this connection.  I am not quite satisfied that sufficient attention has been paid to drainage.  The Minister's remarks on this point were very complete from one aspect: that is so far as sudden flooding is concerned, that will be avoided.  That is perfectly right; it is completely satisfactory in that respect.  The effect of any rise in the level by means of these embankments must be to diminish the sudden flooding, provided the embankments are quite strong enough and high enough. You will certainly do one thing by raising the level of the surface of the river&mdash;prevent sudden flooding.  That is not the whole thing.  I ask the members <Col N="1955" /> of the Dáil&mdash;I hope I am not too technical; I have tried not to be&mdash;they can all follow this&mdash;what is the effect of raising the level?  It applies principally, I admit, when you come to the later development.  It is really impossible to consider the partial development without an eye also to later development. Even to partial development it applies also.  What have you got at present?  You have got the lands on each side of the Shannon drained into the Shannon.  They consist very largely of pear: that is prevented from becoming bog by the fact that the lands drain into the Shannon. You propose to raise your level so that instead of the drainage occurring from the land into the Shannon it will occur from the Shannon back into the land. You stop the sudden flooding at the expense of making the land lower than the river level, and instead of the lands draining into the river you have the river draining into the lands.  Now, the report deals with that to a certain extent.  It refers in a vague way to the use of pumps, and says that that will be avoided by pumps.  No doubt wherever a pump is acting it will counteract all that, but then you will have a huge stretch of land affected by rainfall. You will have the gradual effect of the rainfall tending to produce a bog, instead of sudden flooding putting the land out of action altogether.  Can anybody be completely convinced without investigation as to the way that big change in our topographical conditions&mdash;that big change by which you are setting the river to be drained into the land, instead of draining the land into the river&mdash;will not produce a complete change in the topography of that district?  It requires a lot of investigation. At best, it will mean that the pumps, provided for by this scheme, will have to be supplemented, for each farm along the banks, by drains to get rid of the surface water on every farm adjoining the river.  I say it has not been gone sufficiently into in this report. Even the Minister, in his very able speech, paid attention to the subject of sudden flooding, but I do not think he appreciated, when he was making that speech, this very serious <Col N="1956" /> change that is going to take place in the conditions of this district, due to the rainfall having nowhere to be drained, because the level of the Shannon is above what it was before.</P>
      <P>One of the disappointing things, I must confess, about this report that struck me was the way in which it turned down the possibility of the application of this power scheme to electro-chemical industries.  I had bright hopes that if we got the Shannon scheme going it would be likely to give that necessary impetus to the starting of electro-chemical industries which might have a very far-reaching effect on the prosperity of the country, particularly if the production of the power was backed up by the support that might be given by the Government to chemists and other scientists to enable them to carry out researches.</P>
      <P>I must confess that I was disappointed by page 56 of the report:</P>
      <P>The experts are, however, of opinion that the price for an electro-chemical industry laid down in the Siemens-Schuckert scheme of 0.35d. per unit could not at all be borne by that industry.</P>
      <P>That looks very like&mdash;I do not say it is&mdash;saying that this scheme is not going to help the hydro-electric industry, unless the extra units can be more or less thrown in as a gift to that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two or three other remarks made by the Minister to which I would like to draw attention.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture comes in in this connection to a certain extent, because he seemed to be perfectly satisfied with the Minister's figures, in which he tried to show that the supply would be met by the increased demand that would come in a few years on the assumption of normal progress, and also by the figures that the Minister gave of comparison between the Free State and a country like Denmark.  I am afraid that the figures given by the Minister were not so satisfactory as the Minister for Lands and Agriculture thought.  There is always a risk in dealing with figures from a mathematical point of view, particularly in averages, lest when you come to take the average of averages you get into a <Col N="1957" /> fallacy.  I am rather disposed to think that the Minister's way of putting his calculation, namely, taking the number of units per head of the population, was rather leading him wrong.  The proper way for him to put his calculation was on the basis of the total number of units used at present in the Free State, and the total number which might be expected in 1932, if normal progress took place.  I think it would be a much safer basis of calculation. The Minister gave us figures of forty-one units per head of the population for ordinary purposes, and forty-two per head of the population for tramways. He applied to the forty-one fifteen per cent, increase, as mentioned by Mr. Kettle, and he left the tramways stationary.  If you take fifteen per cent. for seven years at compound interest on the forty-one you more then double it.  You bring it up to 100, and if you add the forty-two you get 142 per head of the population.  He said what he wanted was something like 115 units per head of the population. Therefore, he said, we are perfectly safe, because 143 is far and away above the experts' estimate of 115.  I am afraid that is very liable to be misleading.</P>
    <P>I choose to take the total number of units at present.  The total number is under fifty million units.  I will take it in a less favourable way to myself. I will take thirty million for ordinary purposes and twenty million as applied to tramways.  I apply to the thirty million the same increase as the Minister&mdash;fifteen per cent.&mdash;in which case it will more than double itself by 1932, and it will give you seventy million instead of thirty million.  I add twenty million which is kept stationary for power, and I get ninety million units as the total, whereas there is wanted to be sold 153 million, I take it, at the power station, or 115 at the busbar, so that instead of that calculation putting you on the safe side, it leaves you rather under.  It leaves you with only a demand for ninety million, whereas you have got 115 to sell.  I think the difference arises from this, which, I say, also requires further investigation.</P>
    <P>What does this scheme propose to do as regards population?  At present in <Col N="1958" /> the three cities you have about half a million people more or less supplied. The scheme proposes to supply, if it can beat its competitors, that half million and also about another half million. That is, the total number of people in the Free State who will be able to draw on the electrical power, will be about one million people out of three and three-quarter millions in the Free State.  That is all the scheme proposes in its widest extent.  It will leave the power available to about one million people out of three and three-quarter millions.  I say that is why this calculation on per head of the population is misleading.</P>
    <P>I also fear it misleads the Minister when he comes to apply to the Free State any comparison with places like Denmark.  I say we ought to know more before we can take Denmark as something with which to compare the Free State.  We would want to know, what is the number of people in Denmark similarly situated with regard to, electrical supply that this million people will be in the Free State; whether the proportion who can draw on the electrical power in Denmark is like that which will be able to draw on it in the Free State if this scheme comes into being.  If you can show that the conditions in that respect are really similar it will be a fair thing to say that you would actually have 55 per head of the population taking it in Denmark and 33 per head of the population in the Free State, if the whole 115 million units were distributed over the 3¾ millions.  As a matter of fact, taking the people who are situate, so that they can draw on the supply if, they wanted it, you would have to divide 115 by one million, and not by three and three-quarter millions.  That would mean you would want 115 units per head of the available population. That is really the figure required in making a comparison of this kind.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I am tedious, but I do not want to do anything more than urge that there are details in this scheme which require real technical knowledge and technical investigation. The Minister seems to complain of being hampered.  Let us remove that by all means and let us give the Executive <Col N="1959" /> Council a full and free hand to make every inquiry possible into the engineering details.  Let them not say when we ask for that that we are really putting back the clock or trying to stop it.  We are not.  I contend strongly that we are only asking for what is a very small thing in connection with a very big scheme, a full and open public inquiry.  When I say that I say it in a very general way.  I am not asking for any public inquiry.  I leave it to the Government to say how. Let us have a complete examination in some way of every point on which there is any doubt.  I suggest there are points on which there is great doubt and that want further inquiry and investigation.  Make use of the experts again if you like, but let us be satisfied about this fact, that it is going to be complete about this, that and the other.  I think it is not going to increase the public confidence in the scheme if, after the Siemens-Schuckert Company's Report and the Experts' Report&mdash;even without any access to plans and maps&mdash;have been in the hands of some of us for about a fortnight, you should ask us definitely to commit ourselves to the scheme detailed in these reports.</P>

      <P>In the few words that I have to say in support of Deputy Connor Hogan's amendment, I want to make it perfectly clear that not a Deputy on these benches who has said anything in favour of the amendment has any thought of taking from the credit that is really due to the Executive Council for the work they have done in putting before the Dáil the scheme now under discussion.  We have in mind also what we feel is the magnificent work of the Minister for Industry and Commerce both on this occasion and when he spoke of the scheme in the Dáil in December last.  As far as possible, we want to remove the idea that some who are not now present tried to impress upon the Dáil, and probably the country, that Deputies on the Farmers' Benches were against the carrying of this scheme into effect.  We are not.  We are in sympathy with it, and I hope no body of men representing the farmers of this <Col N="1961" /> country in the Dáil at any time will ever stand up and, by act or word, say that they are against any scheme being carried into effect that will make for progress in this country.  Accordingly what I have to say, while it may be accepted in one sense as being a criticism of the scheme and the policy, will not, I hope&mdash;and I have no desire that it should&mdash;be ever interpreted as opposition to the scheme.  Whatever we may have said about this matter so far, or whatever action we have taken, we have no desire to be associated with certain people and certain criticism that is being applied to the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the point I wish to make, we have to consider, and I think at least it is our duty&mdash;whatever Deputy Egan's opinion may be about us as leader of the Farmers' Party on his side of the Dáil&mdash;to consider and express our point of view as to what the effect of the carrying out of the scheme will be on agriculture in Ireland I think we would not be discharging our duty to that industry if we did not take cognisance of the possible effect of the scheme on that industry.  We must accept it, if the Shannon scheme is to be the declared policy of the Government, that the credit of this agricultural State will have to be pledged so that it may be put into operation. Very naturally the farmers of this country, in their present unfortunate condition, must ask what benefits will come to them through the operation of the Shannon scheme.  They will ask also if the credit of the State at this period is to be pledged, and money obtained on the strength of it, can that money be used in any other way that will be more beneficial to the main industry of the State other than utilising it on the water-power of the Shannon? I would have liked to have had an opportunity of speaking before the Minister for Agriculture had his say, but I hope someone else on the Government benches will, if it is possible, make clear their policy with regard to agriculture and the possible effect of this scheme on our industry.  I think we must expect it from reading the report and listening to the very able statement of the Minister that the <Col N="1962" /> power will be utilised in the principal towns, and our two or three cities. But the Minister at this stage holds out no hope, and rightly so, that the power obtained from the Shannon will be utilised, or can be utilised, by the farmers. I am sure we will be all in agreement with the Minister when he says that he hopes it will not be so for all time.  But as far as we can see for the present, and for a good many years to come, it will not be possible for agriculture to avail of this power, except to a very limited degree, indeed.  There is another point.  We will be far away from the distributing stations.  The cost of taking the power to our homes would, in almost every case, be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson made the point that he rather chose to look on this scheme, or on the administration of this service, as he looks on the administration of the telegraph service.  Exactly so. From my point of view, the Government managing this scheme, as it will be managed as a State administered concern, will manage it exactly as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs runs the telegraph service.  It is our complaint that this service, if it is not paying its way, calls upon us in common with the other taxpayers of the State, to bear the loss.  We bear our proportion, perhaps an unfair proportion. Along with bearing what we consider an unfair proportion of the loss, if there is a loss in the running of this service, we have, if we utilise the service, and if we live a mile outside the town, to pay again, for the use of the service that is placed at the doors of the people in the towns and cities.  It is our unfortunate fate to have to pay extra.  I am inclined to the view that we would be perhaps in the same position when the time comes in this country that the farmer would desire to have the power of the Shannon made use of at his home.  It is true that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture touched the very fringe of this.  But all he was able to say was that he did not want to quote concrete examples of what use agriculture might make of it.  Exactly.  I am afraid he could not. I would like to have heard him make answers to the points I have made.  We <Col N="1963" /> cannot forget, and I repeat it, if this resolution were passed and if the scheme operates, and the service is administered by the State, that beyond question it will be in the interests of the town and cities.  I candidly admit that I cannot see at the moment what use or benefit may come to the farmers because of the fact that the waters of the Shannon have been harnessed.  I do not want to make a point of that. But it seems to me to be the truth.</P>
    <P>There is just another point.  If it is to be a State administered service there must be the ambition that it shall pay its way.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs tries to cut down the postal service and to curtail it in order that it will pay running expenses.  So it will be in the administration of this scheme.  One way to ensure that the service will pay will be to extend it in directions where the power can be sold in bulk, where the cost of distribution will be small, and where there will be an encouragement to people to take it in.  I can see that the administration of this service will, in the future, to a very considerable extent, dominate Government policy.  I am inclined to think that it will drive the Government, perhaps, farther on the road towards protection.  I am inclined to the view that in their ambition to make the service a success, commercially and otherwise, they will be inclined to see springing up here industries that will take their power in bulk in order that the service may pay.  There is just one way of encouraging industries to spring up.  That is being pursued to some extent at the moment, and that is a thing that we do not regard with any considerable pleasure.  I mean those of us who sit on these benches do not regard with pleasure the methods that have to be adopted.  The methods are to put on protective tariffs to enable these industries to be run here in a way that will make it possible for them to live and pay their way.</P>
    <P>Is it not very likely that the administration of the service, to a certain extent, dominating Government policy here, will urge the Government further on the road to protection, and to protect certain industries that are not the <Col N="1964" /> main industries of the State?  I know the Minister may argue that that will only come at the time when full development will be the accepted policy, when we will have power for sale that can be practically given away.  It is something that we cannot shut out from our minds, recognising what the Government policy with regard to industries is at the moment.  We have to take cognisance of it as to what may happen in the future.  I would like to have some statement from the Minister on these two points that I have made. I have no desire to detain the Dáil, but the amendment that has been moved has given opportunities for debate and discussion that might not be otherwise afforded.  I think, too, that there is a reason, and a very good reason, why the Government ought accede to the demand for a further inquiry.  I said at the beginning that I, personally, and my colleagues, are not either in sympathy with or in agreement with the many critics, or with the criticism that has been offered on this scheme.  Yet it is absolutely essential that you shall have the confidence of the country in your efforts to carry it through.  The enthusiasm and the energy of the Ministry and the Executive Council are necessary.  But where the credit of the State is to be called into operation as well, I feel that it is right that everyone who has anything to say to this scheme ought to be given an opportunity.</P>
    <P>There is this report of the experts, and the statement has been made that there has been no opportunity of cross-examining the experts on the report they made.  I am inclined to say to the Executive Council: &ldquo;Throw open the doors.  Let us bring the experts again, leave them to the people who have criticism to make, ask the people who are critics, and who have criticised this scheme in the Press and outside to put up a precis of the criticism that they have to offer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Executive Council think that there is good reason and good ground for re-examination of the men who have made this report, it will not be misspent time.  On the other hand, if there is not good weight and argument and reason in the points that these <Col N="1965" /> people make, as Deputy Connor Hogan has said, they will be confounded by the statements they make themselves. That is one way, from my point of view, to silence all this adverse criticism. Beyond doubt, rightly or wrongly, if an opportunity is not afforded those who are not satisfied with the project in many ways action can be taken that will be detrimental to the success of this scheme.</P>
    <P>I do not think that in a project of such stupendous size as this any chances ought to be taken, and whatever the Government might be inclined to do we feel that as far as we could we have discharged our obligations.  We have impressed on them the point of view that for the success of the scheme we are as desirous as any man on the Government benches.  Give those who are not satisfied every opportunity to prove that the report is not sound, that the experts' conclusions have not been well founded.  Give the country and all of us an opportunity to hear the pros and cons and to learn whether there is reason and sense in the statements that have been made.  If we got an opportunity of coming to our own conclusions on the evidence that would be put before us we would be satisfied that everything possible had been done, that every possible precaution had been taken, and we could all stand behind the Ministry in the projection and carrying through of the scheme with confidence and faith, and could believe that it would be certain to be a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisMcCullough" hpid="Mr. McCULLOUGH Mr. McCULLOUGH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCULLOUGH</NameTxt>
      <P>So much has been said in favour of this scheme that really I feel rather ashamed to rise in its support; it is like painting the lilyBut I do take the opportunity of saying something in support of it because I feel that it is such a wonderful gesture of faith on the part of the Government in the country's future that I think it should be made evident to the public that the Minister and the Ministry have the enthusiastic backing of this House for the scheme.  Consequently I would like to add my voice to that volume of support which has made itself heard here for the Shannon scheme.  I really am quite unable to <Col N="1966" /> understand the genesis of the opposition that has been shown and that is rising to a great volume outside this House, opposition which has manifested itself within the last few days.  I cannot see why any men of goodwill, men whose only interest is the progress and the greatness of this country, can offer opposition to the scheme.  The opposition in the House has been fading away as the debate went on.  The Farmers' Deputies have been watering down their opposition until I think that Deputy Connor Hogan will soon be a general without an army.  The opposition from other parts of the House has been timid, has not been strong, has being trying to damn the scheme with faint praise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Professor O'Sullivan referred to what he very aptly termed the colonial mind in this country, the mind which has no faith in the future of Ireland, has no faith in her people, and in the strength and vision of our Government to see a scheme of this kind through, the mind which feels that we are not big enough to tackle big schemes, and that we are too lately out of leading-strings to mark out our own course in these matters.  I do not think that to-day the country will give any backing to that type of mind in its opposition to this scheme, and I think it is unworthy at this hour of the day that men should be found to organise, as they evidently are organising, in the Press and outside this House a body of opinion to oppose what I consider the first step in the upward rise of the country to economic strength and greatness. I can understand the opposition that is represented by Deputy Figgis; they have in a measure a certain interest in this affair, and their opposition is quite understandable.  They see the scheme only from one point of view, the point of view that is warped by the interests of the opposing scheme.  But we cannot afford to allow any interests to stand in the way of national progress and consequently, though there may be a certain amount of hardship involved for the interests which are behind the other schemes, I think that we will have to disregard it and give the Minister a backing to go ahead with the greater scheme that will, in my opinion, revolutionise <Col N="1967" /> the whole face of the country.</P>
    <P>Some suggestion has been made&mdash;I think it came from Deputy Egan&mdash;that these interests should be considered in the way of compensation.  This must be looked at from a business point of view, and, while I admire the initiative and the courage of these people who are prepared to put money into the schemes that have been projected, I venture to think that they were not doing it altogether for their health sake, that they had, as all commercial concerns have, an eye to profits.  All three of them cannot succeed; one only can succeed.  If one succeeds it will be at the expense of the other two, so that in any event two-thirds of them were bound to lose whatever money they have put into the investigation or the undertaking.  Consequently I do not see how any onus will lie on the Government to give consideration or compensation to these interests.  If, as has been stated here&mdash;though I am far from convinced as to the truth of the statement&mdash;that encouragement was given to these people to proceed, it might be for the generosity of the Government to consider what might be done in the way of some set-off to those who might have gone ahead at a time when they misunderstood, from the correspondence that passed between the Government and themselves, the Government's future attitude.  But I, for one, would say that it should be approached in a very limited way with regard to compensation.</P>
    <P>The opposition, as I have heard it inside and outside the House, seems divided into two heads.  A case is made against the capital expenditure.  Surely a country like ours, where a section of the community could afford to amuse itself by the dissipation of millions' worth of property, and where the Government got backing and strength to deal with that destruction, that country will not now hesitate to back the Government in what I consider a very mild capital expenditure.  That expenditure is really a gesture on the part of the Government, as I said in the beginning, of good faith in the country's future. <Col N="1968" /> It is a gesture which shows that the Government are taking the long view and the big view and that they have large and big ideas for the future of Ireland.  It is a gesture which in another way is an indication of their appreciation of the measure of economic freedom which this country has secured under the Treaty.  That capital expenditure is going to do something more than set the wheels of industry going in Ireland again.  It is an expenditure which, by the very employment it would give and the activity it, would develop, would do a great deal to take the country out of the slough into which it has fallen.  It will tend to the distribution of money and it will encourage others to follow the lead of the Government to invest their money in Irish undertakings.</P>
    <P>I am not going to deal with the technical side of the scheme, because the Minister, in stating the case, has dealt ably and completely with the technical details, and it would be impossible for me to add anything to what he has said.  I would like to deal with the side of it which appeals to those of us who are looking to see a revival of that hope and faith in the country which were shaken by the actions of those opposed to the Government. For years we thought and said that Ireland would do great things when she got her feedom.  Now, at the very first step which our Government are taking we find organised opposition. I do not mind criticisms that are honest, decent and fair, but we find an organised and sinister opposition to this scheme making itself apparent in the Press, and apparent amongst the public in conversations which are heard in the streets and marts around the city.  In this step the Government are doing something to start the country on the upward path.  Yet we have this criticism which I call unfair, and which has been engineered and organised from some source or another, and I venture to think it has emanated from the colonial mind of which Deputy Professor O'Sullivan has spoken.</P>
    <P>Deputy Figgis made a number of points, some of which were covered again in a very hesitating way by Deputy <Col N="1969" /> Professor Thrift.  Deputy Figgis seemed to have his brief very well prepared. He spoke from it, and another Deputy read from the same text.  He talked about the danger of the embankments from a spade thrust.  I think of all the stupid criticism offered to the scheme that which appeared in the Press, and to which Deputy Figgis referred as a spade thrust destroying the embankments, was the most foolish and futile.  A great deal has been said about the embankments.  I think it has been pointed out here that these embankments, as projected, are the work of expert engineers, and that the formula to be used in their construction is one of more than twice the strength of that used in Switzerland, where the erection of such embankments is a matter of common practice.</P>
    <P>The German formula, which is almost twice as strong as the Swiss, has been strengthened again.  That is the strength of the embankments to be put up here.  These embankments will fail if all modern technical experience fail, but if it stands these embankments here will also stand.  I think that the attempt made to offer criticism of this scheme on the question of embankments is not honest or straight. Another point has been made about the danger of sabotage.  I do not believe that we will have any sabotage in this country again for a very long time.  Deputy Professor O'Sullivan dealt with that, and disposed of it completely, and I will say nothing further about it except that if we are to be assured about everything we do and have to get guarantees against such things as sabotage, and if every individual embarking on a commercial undertaking has to protect himself by having guarantees about such matters further than what ordinary wisdom and justice would indicate, I do not think there would be any progress and no big schemes would be undertaken in this or in any other country.  It seems to me. from the type of opposition we have heard here in this House and outside it, that some men seem to have been missing their political kruschen and to have lost pep.  They seem to be getting into a state of pessimism about the future.  They talk about the <Col N="1970" /> poverty of this country, and it makes me feel almost anæmic to hear such talk.  It is not a poor country.  It is undeveloped, and its resources and riches are untapped.  This is the first big step towards tapping them.  To such pessimists I would say, let them take some tonic to give them hope in the future, and not to hold up their hands when schemes of this kind are projected which might commit the Government to an expenditure of more than a pound.  Recently I came across a cutting from the &ldquo;Philadelphia Public Ledger,&rdquo; and I find that Philadelphia is undertaking a scheme some&mdash; what similar to ours, and it will involve an expenditure of 52,000,000 dollars.  It brings electric current right across the whole State of Pennsylvania, yet we hear dismal suggestions here about bringing power from the Shannon.  It is no wonder that I speak about men missing their political kruschen. Another objection towards the scheme is based on the grounds of consumption. Surely no one thinks that there is a normal consumption of electricity in this country.  Anybody who knows anything about the use of electricity in other countries knows that this country is abnormally low in its consumption, because in the small towns in the country there are not men of initiative and courage or of sufficient financial strength to put up the capital required for electrical schemes.</P>

      <P>If we had those throughout the country we would have electricity used where to day we have oil lamps and the penny dips.  If electricity were available for the small towns and villages the consumption normally would be at least three times what it is.  I have no patience whatever with the criticism delivered here of the calculations which the experts have made on the evidence of very expert people of the consumption for the current under this partial scheme. I believe we will be running the full peak load of this scheme long before <Col N="1971" /> the Minister anticipates, and that the demand on it will march concurrently with the carrying out of the lines to the various areas.  We are not a backward people, and if we place at the disposal of the people anything in the way of modern development they will at once make use of the opportunity placed at their doors.  I have figures here; they have been quoted perhaps in the Dáil before, to show the advance in the use of electricity that has taken place in other countries where opportunities have been offered to the people to take it.  The calculations of the Minister are based entirely on domestic consumption, and he has taken no cognisance of, and does not include in his calculations, the possible demand that will be made from industry.  I am not one of those who think that we should first have industries before we create a supply of power.  I do not believe in that.  I consider the criticism dishonest that has appeared in the Press recently as to the small percentage of power charges compared to overhead costs in any other undertaking. I believe that if the current is made available in the country you will find the small industries, at present unable to keep themselves going from lack of power, getting strength and extending, and new industries springing up, and that the demand will be not only from the domestic side, but advancing in proportion to the estimate made by the skilled engineers bringing the consumption up to the 110,000,000 units required, but that it will be doubled before 1932.  I have not the faintest doubt of that, and I venture to prophesy that before that time. through the facilities that will be given to the people for the use of electricity, we will have more than doubled the demand that the Minister estimates as a minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not to be assumed for a moment that the Government are going to wait on the mere natural increase.  They will have to take steps to see that the advantages of the use of electricity are brought to the people's minds, and that by propaganda, personal canvass, and other means known to commerce of a progressive kind, the people will <Col N="1972" /> be induced to take advantage of the use of electricity, and that demand will be created, as it can be created, for all useful products of that kind.  Drainage has been spoken of, and Deputy Professor Thrift made some point about the raising of the level of the river causing reverse action to take place, and that instead of the bog lands on the Shannon banks draining into the river the river will drain back on to the land.  He suggests that this scheme requires more consideration because of this possible effect.  I think if he refers to the experts' report he will find that it is they who have brought this possibility to light.  They have taken cognisance, and have taken steps to secure against its occurrence; consequently it is only delaying action to hold up the scheme for examination on that point. It was raised by the experts and provided for by them in their report.  When we consider the number of thousands of acres of land now flooded periodically or permanently that would be made available for cultivation by this scheme, I wonder that the Farmers' Party should offer any opposition to it. For this scheme provides a remedy for that flooding, and it will be automatically brought into effect through the carrying out of the scheme.  Land would be drained and made available for agriculture.  Deputy Egan referred to the saving that will be effected by getting power from the Shannon, by the reduction that will take place in the purchase of coal, and the effect that will have on our trade balance, for instead of sending money out of the country for coal we generate power from our waters, and that will be to the advantage of the whole commercial life of the country.  I hope the opposition to this scheme will disappear, and that the Dáil will show its appreciation of the courage and the high purpose of the Executive Council in undertaking such a scheme; its appreciation of the very exhaustive way in which the Minister has gone into the details of the scheme, its possibilities and probabilities; and the extraordinary way he has kept together the whole threads of this vast undertaking, and in preparing the way for putting it into operation, immediately the House has given, as I know it <Col N="1973" /> will give, its endorsement of the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this great Shannon scheme. I think it is a very great conception. It seems to me that it may realise what I have had as a sort of vision before me all my life, that is to say, a great number of industries re-established and established in Ireland, in addition to the staple industry of farming.  &ldquo;It is obvious, and always has been, that many industries could not be established here hitherto from the want of suitable coal.  The development of electricity throughout the Free State will, to a great extent, free us from that incubus, and put us on a fair level with the great industrial countries of the world, so that we may deal on even terms with our neighbours.</P>
      <P>As I know nothing whatever about the technical side of electricity, it really would be almost impertinent for me to talk on this subject at all, and I should not have thought of doing so but for the fact that in October, 1923, availing myself of an opportunity, I urged upon the Government to take up the Liffey scheme that was then being brought forward by three or four companies. I urged on the Government to take it out of their hands and make it a national scheme and to work it with a view to giving employment which was then much needed.  I thought, too, that the Government would be more careful to preserve beauty spots, which are an asset to the country, than any private company would be which had nothing but private gain to consider. As between that scheme and this, there is no comparison.  This is undoubtedly a great conception, and I am sure all the world are looking out to see what we shall do about it.  I think we shall either rise to the highest point or fall to the lowest depths according as we act by this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that there has been no enthusiasm about the Shannon scheme in the country.  I think that, considering its vastness, the criticism that has appeared is not at all unfavourable. Moreover, there have been resolutions passed by very important bodies approving of it.  For instance, I <Col N="1974" /> read a resolution from Limerick the other day that expressed the most hearty approval of it in every way.  As regards the other scheme that has been before the country, I do not think a single voice has been raised in its favour.  The boards in the country have torn it to pieces.  The riparian owners, with the exception, I think, of myself, did likewise.  Of course, you must consider what may be the opinion of the people behind all these things.  I said everyone was against it.  But a man&mdash; I think he was a constituent of Deputy Wilson&mdash;came up to me at the fair at Naas and said: &ldquo;When is the Government going to take up the Liffey scheme?&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;I do not think the Government are going to take up the Liffey scheme.  There has been no enthusiasm shown by the country and no meetings have been held in favour of it.  If they favour it, they should hold meetings and send resolutions to that effect to the Government.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I attended meetings; I am strongly in favour of it, and I voted against anything being done.&rdquo;  This man and many others voted against the scheme, and yet they were in favour of it.  Such a mentality is difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>There are several points of view which make me favour this scheme tremendously, and I am sure it appeals in the same way to the people of the country.  When even the partial scheme is developed, it ought to give a vast amount of employment to the youths of the country who have no taste for farming. When these industries, which we hope will be re-established and established, come about, there will be a place for the restless spirits of the country who are not content with the monotony of farming.  A lot of farmers' sons abominate farming, and those who hate farming emigrate or go about doing nothing.  I hope in those industries there will be a place for such young men.  For the farming industry I think there are vast vistas opened up by this scheme.  I think even with partial development a vast improvement ought to be possible in the carrying out of farming work.  Take, for instance, one thing&mdash;the drying of hay.  What we suffer in a wet season everybody knows <Col N="1975" /> and the difficulty of getting one's hay in proper order at any time most farmers understand.  If this electricity comes within a reasonable distance of any farmer who really takes an interest in his work, I think he will not be long in making use of it for this purpose and also for dairy work and other things.  If we become to some extent an industrial country&mdash;I hope we will not become that altogether and that we will not kill our primary industry&mdash;I hope and believe that by the energy we show in taking up and working these additional industries and by the energy we show in establishing those works, we may offer an inducement to our hard-headed brethren in the North, who respect hard work and successful work, to come in.  I think that is a thing worthy of being considered, and I am sure that the advantages that will accrue to us will weigh with those hard-headed people.</P>
    <P>In the Shannon district itself there ought to be a great improvement brought about by this scheme.  Drainage, which has been a very vexed question for many years, ought to be improved vastly even by the partial scheme.  Shipping, as far as I can understand, will be facilitated considerably by the scheme, too.  The only thing I see which has not been dealt with very fully so far is the fishing industry, and even that may not be so much affected by the scheme as one might imagine at the first glance.  Even if it were, so great will be the advantage to the country of this scheme that the fishing industry, great as it is, will be as nothing in comparison with it. With respect to the dangers of the scheme, the bursting of embankments has been mentioned.  It seems to me that the dangers in connection with the Shannon scheme are far less than the dangers in connection with the Liffey scheme.  I know something about Poulaphouca, and I know pretty well that a dam there would want to be of very strong construction.  Suppose a dam did burst&mdash;as happened in Italy&mdash; it would be a serious matter for Ballymore-Eustace, Newbridge, Kilcullen and Celbridge, as it would practically sweep them away.  If the dam at <Col N="1976" /> Lough Derg burst, I do not think damage to that degree could be caused, since it is not proposed to raise the reservoir very much higher than the highest level it can presently reach.</P>
    <P>I think, taking all those things into consideration, that the advantages to the country will be so great that there ought to be no delay in pushing forward with the utmost speed this scheme. I do not believe in the proposal to get together another committee of experts. We should be no further advanced after we got their report.  We would be only more mixed up, and it would be a useless waste of money.  I think the scheme ought to go forward at once. The Government have got the opinion of the best experts in the world&mdash;all from outside Germany&mdash;and I do not think, even if they did get more opinions, that there would be any great advantage derived from it.  I hope the work will proceed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connor Hogan has an amendment on the Paper.  That amendment has only got behind it the desire, as far as I can see, to delay the scheme.  To take a phrase out of Deputy Connor Hogan's dictionary, I refuse to be the vocal medium of the policy of procrastination. I desire that this scheme go forward without any further delay.  I think that at last we have got to the time when there is some hope that the day long looked for is breaking for Ireland, and that before long a spirit of contentment will be shared by everybody in this old land of ours, so that we may settle down to work, and work energetically.</P>

      <P>I am one of the few Deputies here who do not believe in speech-making.  I believe more in work than I do in talk.  But I do not wish to give a silent vote on this matter.  The Minister, in his opening statement, referred to criticism of this scheme by people from Portumna. As the place mentioned happens to be in my constituency, I know the people to whom he referred.  I can assure him that he need not be in the least annoyed by such critics, because they represent nobody in that district except the few remaining links of landlords and graziers in East Galway and North <Col N="1977" /> Tipperary.  The poor people in East Galway, whom I have the honour to represent here, and whose lands are flooded for six months of the year, welcome this scheme.  Why should they not?  It will do away with floods, in my opinion, for all time.  The Callow lands from Whitegate, in Country Clare, to Banagher, in King's County, and from Banagher to Ballinasloe, in East Galway, have been all flooded for the past twelve months, the result being that 99 per cent. of the hay crop was completely lost.  Worse still, the green crops of the poor people were lost and forty families were routed out of their homes by floods.  The people to whom I refer are to-day in miserable poverty. I reported this state of affairs to the Government, but nothing has been done up to the present.  Now that something is about to be done, is the Government going to be prevented from putting the Shannon scheme into operation?  In my humble opinion, it is the best scheme, so far as the poor people are concerned, that has ever been introduced in this country.  It will drain the land, it will open up employment, and, by giving the people employment, it will take them from poverty and misery to prosperity and happiness.  My advice to the Minister and to the Government is to hammer away at this scheme might and main, and to give no heed to the critics.</P>

      <P>Even at the risk of being charged with possessing a &ldquo;colonial mind,&rdquo; and various other things, I venture to take part in this debate, because it seems to be the fashion for everybody to speak on this subject.  I would like to assure the Minister that I am not coming forward in any critical or obstructive mood.  I want to put certain questions to him, to which I hope he will supply answers when he is winding up the debate.  I would like to know who selected these experts and what information was available about their international reputation.  I would take the case of a man who is about to have an operation performed. which may mean life or death.  That man will naturally want the best surgeon available&mdash;a specialist in his job. Does he go to Tom, Dick or Harry and ask him for the surgeon's name, or <Col N="1978" /> does he go for information to a medical man who, he knows, ought to know? How did we come to put all our dependence upon these experts?  We must assume that there were some engineers behind the Minister in this matter, but we have had no evidence of that so far.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister is to be congratulated on the way he brought this scheme forward.  At the same time, that is more a tribute to the Minister's ability in debate than it is to the merits of the scheme.  I venture to say that if the Minister came here to-morrow to prove that black was white, he would pretty well succeed in doing so. One of the things mentioned about these experts was that they were over and above &ldquo;the commercial mind,&rdquo; that they were men who had spent their lives in the pursuit of knowledge. I do not think that is the type of man whose advice we want.  We want the man who has spent his life in the pursuit of money to advise us as to whether our scheme is going to be a financial success or not.  Deputy Heffernan raised a point about the cross-examination of experts, and I thoroughly agree with him.  You have had this scheme put before these experts.  They were put in the position of judges.  But they only heard one side of the case. Can their judgment be sound?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Practically no Deputy touched, to any extent, on the fishery question.  I am not in a position to do so, and I regret very much that the Minister for Fisheries is not here, because his help on this occasion would be extremely useful.  It is to be assumed that if the fisheries on the Shannon&mdash;a very valuable asset&mdash;are destroyed, that compensation will have to be paid to several parties.  I do not for a moment suggest that the fishery question should hold up the development of the country. But we must take into account, amongst other things, the money that will have to be paid to people who have rights in these fisheries.  The question of drainage has been largely discussed, and I only desire to point out that this arrangement of pumps and syphons and side-drains would require a tremendous amount of examination&mdash; much more than it has got from any Deputy who has spoken.  As regards <Col N="1979" /> the experts' view on these fisheries, I would refer you to Page 46 of the report. I think that to anyone who knows even a little about fisheries, that is not a very good criterion of the experts' ability in this matter.</P>
    <P>Another point I would like the Minister to deal with is the question of existing stations.  How is it proposed that these stations should be dealt with?  The Minister must be aware that there is a great deal of uncertainty all over the country, and that for the period of eight or ten years ahead there will be a tremendous amount of uncertainty. Numbers of small towns will be without light, because of uncertainty as to the methods to be adopted and uncertainty as to the effect of the Shannon scheme.  On account of that uncertainty, it will be impossible to induce people to put their money into these undertakings.  I think it would be well if the Minister cleared that point up.</P>
    <P>Another point that struck me during the early portion of the debate was that there were certain prices to consumers which the Minister, in reply to Deputy Figgis, admitted were held back.  He did not give, to my mind, a very satisfactory reason for holding them back. I would like to know whether there are any other figures in that large report held back also, and if they are material to the issue.</P>
    <P>There was another thing in the arguments used about this enormous amount of current to be sold, and that was the limitation on the hours of use. That is a thing that should be very thoroughly explained, because I think it was the continental practice that was taken into account in the working out of these figures, and that is that at certain hours of the day current would not be available and that at certain hours of the day current would be available at a low figure.  That was not to my mind brought out fully and clearly.  That would, of course, enormously cheapen the general average all over and would give misleading figures. You could offer a man current on Sunday when everyone is at church at .001d., because then you have it going to waste, and it pays you to get anything <Col N="1980" /> for it.  Arguments of that kind should not be brought in to lower the general average all round as to what current could be given for all the year round.  I now come to a point which Deputy Good dealt with as to world prices for machinery.  I hope the Minister will give us further information on that point.  There is one thing that I would like to impress on the House, and it is this: the plant that would be employed, presuming that Messrs. Siemens take this job in hands, will be entirely of German manufacture.  That places this country lock, stock and barrel in the hands of German engineers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major MYLES Major MYLES">
      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold no brief for any country's manufacturers, but I do know this much from my own experience and from the experience of a large number of people, that German manufacturers, on the whole, in the electrical industry are not on a par with those in a great many other countries.  It is a well known fact, and I think it can be borne out by any engineer, that the factor of safety&mdash;for example, the factor of safety in German dynamoes and German motors&mdash;is very far short of what it is in American or English machines.  Then you put yourselves in the hands practically of one firm, and the question of replacement arises.  I came across the other day the case of a man who was foolish enough to send an order to Germany for some electrical fittings.  He sent the order in June and did not get delivery until the following March.  If that is a sample of the way this country is to be treated in the matter of trade, I do not think it is a good advertisement for Germany.  There was one point that some Deputy mentioned about the Minister having a card up his sleeve, and I take it he had railways in mind.  Somewhere in the report I have seen that the cost of coal in Switzerland, which was taken as a comparison, was £3 per ton, and that even then it was found cheaper to run the railways by coal than by electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have it from a very eminent engineer who has studied the subject, that if you had your electricity for nothing <Col N="1981" /> in a country where coal is sold at a reasonable figure, you would not be able to make it pay.  There is one point that I would like to draw the Minister's attention to.  When speaking yesterday he stated that Mr. Kettle had given an estimate of 15 per cent.  per annum as a probable increase in the consumption of electricity for the Dublin Corporation supply.  Now, Mr. Kettle informs me that that is not correct.  Mr. Kettle, in his evidence in connection with the Liffey scheme, stated that the development to be expected in the Corporation supply over the next ten years is about 10 per cent., and for the tramways about 2 per cent.  The figures given by the Minister, as Mr. Kettle's figures, are, therefore, 50 per cent. higher than the increase given by Mr. Kettle himself. As Mr. Kettle has been taken as an authority, and, I think, rightly so, and following out further Messrs. Siemens' report, the figure of consumption for Dublin, including the tramways, under the partial development scheme, at the end of six years, is given as 63½ million units. Messrs. Siemens' figure, under the full development scheme for Dublin, including the tramways, is 85¼ million units, while Mr. Kettle's figure is 58½ million units.  These are corrections which, I think, it is only due to Mr. Kettle to bring to the Minister's notice, and I hope that when he comes to wind up the debate that as many of these points as possible will be cleared up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few points that I would refer to.  The ground in connection with this scheme has been travelled over very carefully, not only by supporters of it, but by critics in the House and outside of it. Deputy Major Myles has stated that the scheme requires more examination than has been given to it by the four experts.  He wants to know also why these experts were chosen, and stated that they were men who devoted themselves more to the pursuit of knowledge than to the pursuit of commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major MYLES Major MYLES">
      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I desire to say that I did not say that.  I was following the Minister's statement.</P>

    <Col N="1982" />
    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the Deputy did not quite follow the Minister in his statement.  The Minister made it quite plain that these experts were chosen because they had given this particular work a life study, and the Deputy's argument bears out the fact that the Government were absolutely right in selecting men with a worldwide reputation&mdash;men who would not be likely to propound or bring forward a scheme that would be faulty.  There is no danger that they would risk their reputation in doing a thing like that. By way of example, Deputy Myles said that if someone had to undergo a serious operation he would not, as he said, go to Tom, Dick or Harry, and ask for advice as to the surgeon he would select to perform the operation. The patient, he said, would go to his medical adviser for advice on that matter.  That is precisely what the Government have done in this case; they have gone to experts with a worldwide reputation for this class of work for advice.  None of the critics of the scheme has told us where men more eminent than these experts could have been found.  Some Deputies, I forget who, asked why not have the subscribers or the users of the power first before you introduced it.  The suggestion they made was that the scheme should not be introduced until there was a sufficient number of subscribers to utilise the power made available. If you have your electrical scheme developed in this country, then you will have the possibility of promoting industry in it.  In the average country town you have no power but gas or coal.  The price of coal, I am afraid, is far higher than what Deputy Myles suggests.  I think he said the price in this country was £3 a ton.  In many districts that I know the price ranges from £3 to £5 per ton, and it is the high cost of coal that is preventing many people, who are anxious to develop new industries in the country and to re-open old ones, from doing so. The cost of coal is so prohibitive that they could not hope to carry on an industry with any hope of profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards creameries, the cost of coal for their engines and also the cost of cartage is so very great that the <Col N="1983" /> development of the existing industries &mdash;and the creameries are existing industries connected with our main agricultural industry is really prohibitive. The price of coal is a very serious factor. I believe that with the development of this scheme you will have an industrial revival in this country.  It will, as Deputy Wolfe says, help the people in every part of the country.  It will help those people who are doubtful as regards production, and as to the possibility of the people of Ireland competing with the people of other countries to see that capital available in different areas will be used, and will be an impetus to get the people of Ireland to do what they should do in developing the resources of the country quite as much in the towns as in the cities.  The Minister has dealt with the technical points.  The advantages of this scheme for the whole country are so great that any Deputy will see them.  Even if there was no profit on the money invested on a scheme over a number of years, indirectly it will help the people of the country both now and in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House has very fully dealt with this matter, and I do not propose to take up the time of the House to any great extent in connection with it.  There has been great enthusiasm for the scheme from all parts of the House.  As far as I know there is no opposition to the Shannon as a source of power for the Free State being developed.  All that has been asked is that the House should not be definitely committed to the particular scheme before us until there has been a further examination into the basis on which the calculations are made.  I think Deputy Thrift was very fair in his suggestion that the matter need not be delayed in any way by giving the Minister all the power he requires to spend any money that is necessary.  I emphasise in support of that that this scheme is the product of Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert through the medium of the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper has met with a good deal of criticism.  Messrs Siemens-Schuckert are a very eminent firm, and <Col N="1984" />they were empowered to produce a scheme.  They did so in due course, and it was submitted to the experts. When it came to the experts it was materially altered.  I think it is recognised that the experts have gone into the matter very fully, and given a very elaborate and complete report, as far as the scheme is concerned.  Surely under the circumstances it is not too much to ask that the putting into operation of this scheme should, before it is proceeded with, get every possible consideration.  In connection with electricity it is a well-known fact that the cost of generating at the power station is not the largest cost in connection with the supply to the consumer.  The distribution costs are, of course, very heavy, and are governed largely by the question of load factor and the conditions under which the power station is operating in supplying the current. This report that we have before us in no way deals with the question of the cost of distribution.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the statement that, taking the high tension transmission on its own, and leaving aside altogether the question of distribution from the high tension cables, it would pay its way on the basis of supplying current in bulk to Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  I think he mentioned the cost of that operation&mdash;I think also it is mentioned in the books&mdash;would be £315,000.  That is on the basis of Dublin being the principal consumer.  Of course, the whole scheme is based on Dublin.  It is very hard to anticipate a greater increase in consumption over a period of six years than to bring it up to 60 million units for Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  At a halfpenny a unit on 60 million units you would have £125,000, as against that cost of £315,000.  If those figures are right, based on that calculation, the cost of supplying Dublin would be more than a penny a unit.  The cost of generating electricity in Dublin&mdash;I refer to the statement of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture&mdash;is not two, decimal something of a penny.  At the Corporation works it is, I think, in or about one penny.  When transmitted to the transformer station in Fleet Street, I think it is somewhere about <Col N="1985" /> 1.5 of a penny, including the cost of capital on the connection between the Pigeon House and Fleet Street.  The cost to the consumer is, of course, largely dependent on the conditions under which the current is being used.</P>
    <P>Speaking on behalf of a body of men who have been very much abused in connection with the criticisms they have made on this question of the economical distribution of power in Dublin, through the medium of this high tension cable from Limerick, I think it is unanimously their opinion that as far as the larger area of distribution is concerned, governed by a net-work of communicating poles throughout the Free State, it will require a very considerable development and use of current to make the whole system work out on the lines of a very cheap electricity supply to the various parts of the country.  They are not less enthusiastic on the question of utilising the Shannon for the development of power than any member of this House.  All they ask, as far as I know, is that reasonable time and reasonable consideration should be given to the whole proposition before committing the country to the actual expenditure of the large sum of money estimated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will excuse me, and would allow me to ask whether we can clear up the point about the cost of production of electricity by the Dublin Corporation?  I think if we did it might save some trouble afterwards.  Different statements on the subject have certainly caused some confusion.  As regards the Corporation, in the report of the Electricity Committee, dated March 31st, 1924.  I read that the cost per unit sold was for coal .69 of a penny; other expenses, including generation, distribution and management, 1.66 of a penny; total, 2.35 of a penny.  Then for interest there was 1.11 of a penny. The total cost per unit, exclusive of renewals and reserve, was 3.46.  Now, that may be quite familiar to Deputy Hewat, and there may be some other points that he will be dealing with; but I think it would be important if we got that point cleared up at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not very conversant <Col N="1986" /> with the figures of the Corporation, but I will give them to you as far as I know them.  First, the current is generated at the busbars of the Pigeon House Fort.  That operation is a works cost, and it does not represent more than one penny a unit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point. That current is then conveyed to the transformer station at Fleet Street.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is another point.  I think the figure given in the expert's report is for the year ending March, 1923.  We have some later returns which are more favourable to the Corporation by reason of the fact that they are almost exhausting <Col N="1987" /> the kilowatt capacity.  In addition, they have got customers from the townships.  There has been a remarkable increase in the number of units sold this year over last year.  It is something like 2,000,000 units, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, that is a point which must be considered in connection with the increased consumption. The Corporation have, I believe, given a supplementary supply to Pembroke and a supplementary supply to Rathmines.  The Port and Docks Board have shut down their station and are taking current from the Corporation. The Great Northern Railway Company have also shut down their power station and are now taking their power from the Corporation.  The question of how far development in the production of electricity can be counted on, is a very important factor in connection with the whole scheme based on the development of the Shannon.  This is a question which can be looked at from two points.  I think that the members of this House largely take the view, the very enthusiastic view&mdash;and I do not say it is a wrong view&mdash;that the development of the Shannon on the lines of the report will be of national importance and that on that basis, even if the thing worked out that current in some cases might be generated more cheaply than it could be provided by the national scheme, still the national scheme would be of advantage to the country.  I do not dispute that, but let us be clear on the issue as between the two.  Either you deal with the matter purely as an economic proposition or you bring into view the bigger issue of how far this development of the central station can supply current all over the country to the benefit of the country as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very few points at the present time, within the area of the Free State, where there is likely to be, within a period of six years, a development that would mean an economic working of the extension <Col N="1988" /> to that district.  If that is so, the whole basis of the calculations that are laid down for this scheme must be revised. If it is not so, the figures given are reliable and can be counted on.  On that point who are the best judges?  Men who have been engaged in the distribution and the manufacture of electricity all their lives, know local conditions perfectly well, and if they have expressed the opinion that it would take a great deal longer time to develop the consumption of electricity on these lines to make it a paying proposition, I think their opinion, at all events, ought to carry some weight with us.  The first step according to the Minister is going to be a high tension cable to Cork from Limerick or to Cork and Dublin, and the radiating lines are to follow in due course.</P>
      <P>As an economic proposition, leaving out everything else, does any Deputy in this House imagine that to generate current in Limerick, solely for the consumption of Dublin, is a proposition that any person would be likely to put a lot of money in, if it were his own money?  I imagine not, any more than I would imagine that it would enter into anybody's mind to send current from Dublin to Limerick.  It is a long line.  It is a long way to Limerick, and the experts themselves say that if it were confined to Dublin alone, the Liffey scheme would be the one to go on with.  I do not express any opinion between the two, one way or another, but clearly at the present stage, when I think the country is suffering from over-taxation an expenditure of five millions in capital money with the possibility of that four or five million carrying with it a charge on the country, at all events calls for the fullest possible investigation of the whole question.  That is I think all that is asked for.  That is what I stand as asking for.  I also stand as asking that the opinions of the men who have given an opinion on this matter, and who, I think, are capable of giving an unbiassed opinion, should not be treated as if they were of no account at all.  In our enthusiasm we seem likely to consider it as a small matter to enter into this expenditure, a very large expenditure at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1989" /> I imagine that it will not be quite as easy to raise £5,000,000 in the country at present as we would wish.  True, the expenditure will not be immediate; a proportion of it will only be required immediately.  True, one great benefit that will arise from the expenditure will be the minimising of the suffering caused by unemployment.  If the money spent relieves unemployment nobody is going to object.  But is it unfair to ask that a scheme of this magnitude, submitted so recently as a fortnight ago, should get every opportunity to be examined in the light of the economic position and of the development that it is going to attain?  Will it not have greater force behind it after that has been done than if it were pushed forward in a hurried way, without even giving the consideration to it that one would give to a private undertaking of a similar nature?</P>
    <P>It is difficult to speak on this subject. I recognise the enthusiasm all round for the development of this scheme. The claim that is made for a full examination is not unreasonable.  It has been put forward by several bodies, not to retard the scheme, but to make sure that the calculations are reasonably likely to materialise when the scheme is in operation.</P>

      <P>I must confess that I approach this subject, even at this late stage of the debate, with a considerable amount of trepidation, almost, I might say, bordering on bewilderment. This, indeed, is a great and gigantic proposal.  It is one that if properly executed might revolutionise the whole economic state of our country, and, more than that, it might even impart an uplifting to the general body of our people in more than a material or economic sense.  It is great both from a national, economic and financial point of view, and I desire at the very outset to congratulate the Government, and especially their spokesman, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, upon the courage that both they and he have displayed in the step that they have taken in the direction <Col N="1990" /> of progress, instead of having, as well they might, rested upon their oars. The Government have thought fit to bring forward a proposal of such magnitude and such vast potentialities that they deserve credit for the risk they have taken even in bringing it forward.</P>
      <P>Speaking as one who is interested in this proposal from an entirely disinterested point of view, if I might say so, I desire to say that I am in favour of the proposal.  I am in favour of a scheme for the utilisation of the waters of the Shannon for the purpose of providing power for the lighting, heating and industry of the country.  To my mind, the Liffey scheme is out of the question.  Even though it does concern Dublin, it is a mere local matter.  As was said by Deputy O'Sullivan last night, the Liffey scheme could never have been expanded so as to be of any use to the rest of the country.  The Shannon scheme may not, at the outset, provide for all parts of the country, but it must be, according to the reports presented to us, in future available for all the requirements of the country.  I think that is greatly in its favour. Therefore, my position is this: I am in favour of a Shannon scheme.  From what I can gather, this scheme seems to have been carefully considered and thought out, and undoubtedly it has been drawn up by one of, if not the greatest, electrical firms in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour, on the report we have received, of putting this scheme into effect, and the only complaint that I have is, not as to this magnificent conception, but rather as to the means and methods of its execution.  It would have been far better, when this great German firm approached us, and when we had arranged with them to draw up the scheme, if we had further arranged, the scheme having been settled, that we should be in a position to say to them: &ldquo;Very well; thanks very much for your scheme, we are sure that it will succeed and that it is sound, now we will allow you, along with all the other great firms of the world, to enter into open competition to put that scheme into effect.&rdquo;  I am sorry that that has not been done.  It would have been better, from our own business point of view, if that were done, and it <Col N="1991" /> would have been better also from the point of view of our political relations throughout the world.  However that may be, perhaps it is rather an <i>ex post facto</i> argument now, because, from what I understand, this resolution commits us to Siemens-Schuckert and this scheme.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out, if it has not occurred to Deputies already, what is the effect of this resolution that we are now discussing.  The effect of the resolution itself is nil.  It has no legal effect.  It will be necessary to introduce a Bill and that Bill will have to go through all stages the same as any other Bill.  I must confess that I cannot see what the necessity was for the introduction of this resolution at all, except perhaps this.  The Minister said that previous to proposing this resolution he had given a pledge that he would incur&mdash;I think this is a paraphrase of his words at any rate&mdash;no expense in regard to this matter.  He then went on to say that when this resolution has been passed he would consider himself absolved from that pledge.  I think it only right to ask the Minister, and I am sure he will do me the courtesy of replying when his time comes, what exactly he means by that?  Does he mean after the passage of this resolution that he will be at liberty to enter into any contractual obligations with this firm?  Does he mean that he will be able to say to this firm that now they have the contract, because if that is so he certainly will be acting without the authority of the Dáil?  This contract with this firm will require legislation passed through this House and the Seanad.  I think before that Bill is produced, and certainly before it is passed, the Minister, or the Executive Council, should not take it upon themselves to enter into any contractual relations with this firm in this matter.</P>
    <P>The course that the debate has taken has been one rather of detailed criticism than of general objection to the scheme as a whole.  I, for one, am not going to venture into the realm of criticism on a subject which I do not profess to know anything about, and, indeed, with all <Col N="1992" /> respect to most of the Deputies.  I do not think they would be in a very much better position themselves if anyone of expert knowledge were to speak to them on the subject.  That being so, I must confess I cannot see what great use there would be in referring this question to a committee composed of members of this House.  I do not see what very much more could be discussed, or what more information could be obtained by individual Deputies sitting upon a committee, with the knowledge then at their disposal, which, I presume, would not be very much in advance of the knowledge they possess to-day.</P>
    <P>This is largely a matter of trust, and indeed a matter of speculation.  I admire the Government for their speculation, but I am rather chary of their trust.  I think it would have been wiser if they could have had at their disposal, along with the four experts whose qualifications I am not going to question, someone from these countries &mdash;if possible someone from Ireland&mdash; some competent engineer whom they could have turned to, who, with knowledge of the country and its conditions as well as professional knowledge, would be able to help and assist them in coming to conclusions, or indeed in understanding the propositions put up to them by the experts and by Siemens-Schuckert. I am sorry they did not see their way to adopt that course.  The proposal that the contract should be given of necessity to this firm is, I think, an unbusinesslike one.  Those are the two principal grounds of complaint I have against the Government in their conduct of this subject.</P>
    <P>I must say that for my part, at any rate, I am as optimistic as any member of the Government about the question of demand in the future.  I am confident that when the supply is there there will be demand.  The whole success of this project depends upon whether the demand shall be forthcoming, when we have brought into being the necessary supply.  It is true, it may be said, that cheap power is not everything, and cheap power, to a certain extent, means very little in the conduct of certain industries.  But, at any rate, cheap power will do one <Col N="1993" /> thing.  It will remove one of the most cogent arguments against the setting up in this country of industries by people from across the water or elsewhere. It will not be able to be said, &ldquo;We cannot go here and we cannot go there in Ireland because of the lack of power or of the cheapness of power.&rdquo; I think that this is a great step.  I think it is a most progressive step.  I think it is a step most highly commendable for a young Government in what we now call a young State.  I think it is a step that is taken with considerable risk.  There must be risk about it.  There can be nothing in the way of certainty, but what we must be certain about is that the scheme which we are debating, according to the experts, at any rate, is a sound one, and that that sound scheme can be set up in a sound way, upon sound, economic lines.</P>
    <P>I regret, therefore, that more care was not taken and more opportunity not given to others than the actual firm who are about to be engaged upon the work.  Perhaps even at this stage it would not be too late for the Government to take into their counsels those experts, and there are some, on this matter, who know the conditions, and the state of the country in which this great experiment is going to be made. I am not, as I said before, going to take up the time of the Dail at this stage. But I do think that this debate has been a profitable one.  I think it has been good from the point of view of the public and from the point of the Government itself.  It has shown the deep interest that is taken in all quarters in this scheme.  It has shown that the criticism of the scheme is mainly constructive and helpful.  It has shown that there is no hostility to the scheme <i>per se</i>; it has shown that the Deputies, from all quarters, are anxious that the scheme should go forward, but they are also anxious that it should go forward on proper lines, and under proper care and proper control.  That being so, if I may be permitted to do so, with all due respect to the members of the Farmers' Party, might I suggest to them that having done this much good by bringing forward this amendment, it would be a gracious act upon their part if they were to withdraw <Col N="1994" /> the amendment now, having elicited opinions from the various parts of the Dáil, and that they would allow the resolution now to pass.</P>

      <P>As one of the Deputies from the constituency of Limerick, I wish to give my thanks to, and to express my appreciation of, the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the noble stand he has taken in producing this enormous scheme.  Since I was a boy I have always been taught that there was as much power in the Shannon as would supply Ireland for all her industries.  When I first heard this I never thought that I should see it realised or that I should see it accomplished. I hope it is going to be accomplished now.  The first place I ever heard that was in the Christian Brothers' Schools in Limerick.  The only people I ever knew to object to the promotion of a Shannon scheme were people who had vested interests in foreign countries.  Those were the people who individually wanted to keep close to their own interests, and to neglect the interests of our country. We all know that industry is a thing that must be promoted, cherished and nursed.  It must be nursed very carefully. The Minister says that he is quite satisfied that the power will be there for those outside of industry.  I was glad to hear that, but the Shannon scheme in the future will develop industries. It will nurse industries.  Industries that are in existence will be put on their feet, and the possibilities are that the scheme will enable new industries to start, industries that can go into competition with any in Europe. In the River Shannon from Limerick city down to Loop Head I know that there is as much material as would supply Europe with cement, and the possibilities are that in the very near future, and I daresay in the building of these canals, dams, and everything else, some company will be formed to take up this project.  There were experts examining that matter twenty-five years ago, and they pronounced that the material was equal to any cement material that could be got in any part of Europe.  All Limerick city and county are looking forward to the scheme going through, and not alone <Col N="1995" /> Limerick, but Clare and Tipperary.  It will relieve unemployment; that is the first thing; and the industries that will spring up in the near future will be able to extend and to keep employment going.  That is the main object of the project.  I have great pleasure, on my own behalf and on behalf of other Limerick Deputies, in expressing these views, and the hope that the Dáil will pass the motion.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long, but I do not wish to give a silent vote on this matter.  This debate has had a fascination for me, and I thank God that I have lived to see the day when our own Government can make a gesture that has such promise for our country.  I was born within earshot of a water-wheel, and ever since then I have not been far removed from one. I have been engaged in Irish industries all my life, and I was sent here to represent Irish industry.  Someone might say that I have not cut much ice or made much noise in the Dáil since I came.  One of the reasons why I have not done so so far is, that, in my opinion, up to this the Government had the protection of the tinker's wife. Now that a change has taken place and the first phase of the situation is over, I think the time has come when we are right into the second, which is the economic phase.  In the first place I think it right to say that, in my opinion, no men could have done better, and I welcome this gesture in the hope that the Government has taken its courage in both hands, and that it means to prosecute this endeavour to a successful issue.  There are great possibilities in this scheme in the encouragement and the stimulus it will give to our people, and it was never more needed than now.  I have an intimate knowledge of many industries in this country, and to-day they are at a very low ebb.  They are decaying. Something is wanted.  If Ministers, having now broken the ice in this matter, put their shoulders to the wheel and encourage and protect the industries that we have got, they will have my support, and, I believe, the support of the bulk of the people.  But if they <Col N="1996" /> show any weakness and heed the croaking pessimists who are sometimes to be heard here, and very often outside, the country will see to it that they will do their duty by the country.</P>

      <P>We are jaded members of a jaded House.  The conclusion is a foregone conclusion. Deputy Redmond, with prophetic foresight, has already indicated it.  The amendment will be withdrawn and victory is ready with her laurels to crown the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I feel that were it not for the encouragement of Deputy Johnson's remarks yesterday evening to intervene now would be indefensible, as merely delaying the final stage.  But Deputy Johnson said that there had been so much propaganda against this scheme that it is highly desirable that something by way of propaganda in its favour should be inaugurated, and the great value of this debate, as has already been said by our colleague here, is that it has begun that great work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday evening I was seething with excitement, dreading the hour of ordeal when it should be my turn to speak, and in the tension of that hour of strain I made a verbatim note of all the speeches that were delivered.  Do not be alarmed, sir, I do not propose to read them all.  On studying to-day the speech of the proposer of the amendment to the resolution, I became convinced that sufficient justice had not been done to him.  There is a story told of a man of letters, that he claimed he had written the best comedies that had ever been conceived, and when it was pointed out to him as rather an extraordinary thing that they had not been acted, he retorted that that was the very proof of their success; they were so exceedingly witty and humorous that the actors themselves could not restrain their laughter, so that it was impossible to have them played.  Deputy Connor Hogan's speech had so much of humour, so much of subtle charm, that we attended rather to the language he employed than to the ideas that the language expressed. Consequently the full weight of his speech was not felt.  It was not a speech in support of the amendment as formulated, <Col N="1997" /> but a speech which summarised practically all the points that had been made, whether in newspaper articles or in letters to the editors, for quite a long time past.  I would like the Deputy to believe me that I do not accuse him of plagiarising these; on the contrary, I believe that those letters indicate a frame of mind and a line of thought that are natural to those for whom the Deputy has been able to speak here.</P>
    <P>He has put his case more dexterously than they.  He asks us to be wise in time, to display caution, not to go too fast.  I was tempted to translate the Latin equivalent of his caution, <i>Festina Lente</i>, as an encouragement to the Minister, if-differently interpreted, &ldquo;Make haste in Lent.&rdquo;  With caution incarnate Deputy Hogan warned the Minister and the Executive Council to go slowly.  That is not exactly how the newspaper articles put it.  They say that there is a decided intention on the part of the Government to stampede the country.  I have an article here from a very weighty organ of very weighty opinions, in every sense of the word.  &ldquo;The Government is suspected, not unjustly, of an effort to rush the Siemens-Schuckert scheme over the nation's head.  We shall oppose any such tactics of hustle.&rdquo;  Deputy Hogan and the party of which he is the spokesman have opposed these alleged tactics of hustle.  What does the amendment propose?  &ldquo;That the proposals should be further examined by other experts of international reputation.&rdquo;  It was said of a very distinguished Irishman that his mind was like a clock&mdash;the works functioned only when the pendulum wagged.  Deputy Hogan has the habit, the possession of which I envy him, of thinking while he talks and because he is talking.  The rest of us are unfortunately subject to the limitation of having to think first and talk afterwards.  Deputy Hogan modified his proposal into, &ldquo;We accept a Commission of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  He is afraid, incidentally, that without such further inquiry we shall have, as he said, a white elephant on our hands.  It is to save the nation from that awkward predicament that a further inquiry has to be instituted.  That is not unlike one of the processes of the British law <Col N="1998" /> courts which suffers a man indicted for murder to be tried three times in a case where there has been a disagreement of the jury, but, suppose the disagreement was on the first trial and the second jury agreed to find him guilty, the matter is at an end and there is no further prosecution.  Similarly, I dare say, if the Farmers' Party could get a committee not necessarily of experts, to decide unfavourably on these proposals, then the matter would be declared ended and the nation would be exhorted not to go on with this tomfoolery. Yet the Deputy who recommended this further inquiry realises that, in effect, there should be no end to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan has pointed out very clearly what was the precise relation of those experts employed by the Government.  The experts, or rather, the inexperts, whom the Farmers' Party would recommend, whom, on second thoughts, the Deputy recommends&mdash; what have they to inquire into?  To what end is this cross-examination that the Farmers' Party desires?  The problem is a three-fold one.  As pointed out in the report, it is first of all, technically a problem for engineers; secondly, it is an economic problem. It is essentially an economic problem, but what the experts have not pointed out, it is likewise a problem of public policy, and that is a matter that concerns us quite as much as the economic aspect of it.  Is the Government trying to rush the country, to stampede the country into a policy that is wrong? With your permission I will read a little further from the article.  &ldquo;Finally Parliament must not overlook the effect of its decision on the great neighbour who buys 95 per cent. of the Free State exports.  It is true that English shipping companies have given contracts to German yards, but only after they failed to get equal terms at home.  Now, the Free State Government propose to give a monopoly to Germany at the expense of the Irish farmers' essential customer.  Will this be good business? The Oireachtas will be lacking in its duty to the people if it refuses to probe all the momentous issues which are involved in the Government plan.&rdquo;  The casual reader might be foolish enough <Col N="1999" /> to interpret that as a threat and look on those as menacing words, but, knowing the organ in which it appears, I realise it is merely a warning of the same type as appears in a pamphlet circulated to most, if not all, of the Deputies some time ago with the name of a very distinguished engineer on the cover, Sir John Griffith.  The hand is the hand of Esau, but the voice is the voice of Jacob.  Now, I am not dealing for the moment with the inaccuracy of the statement that a monopoly is being given to Germany.  I am dealing rather with the suggested history.  We have had such a lot of these histories in connection with the suggestion of stampede that even at the risk of being more than usually tedious I would like to dwell on them.  This is a letter from a well-known Irish engineer, Mr. Arthur E. Porte.  It is written as if to illustrate the wisdom of the proverb, &ldquo;Let the cobbler stick to his last.&rdquo; When an engineer becomes a historian he loses a great deal of his authority. &ldquo;We are forced,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;therefore, to inquire why Dublin is offered current by Siemens at one halfpenny per unit.  The answer surely is simple.  Siemens arrived in the field too late to propose a monopoly of the Liffey.  Other groups had already developed Liffey schemes in great detail and at great expense.  No Liffey amendment, with large propagandist possibilities, could be moved.  Consequently we are now offered a scheme the financial essence of which is that Dublin&mdash;because the Liffey schemes were available to supply it with current at three-farthings a unit, while the rest of the country makes up the loss in paying excessive prices.  I challenge any competent person who is familiar with the history and financial details of the Siemens' scheme to gainsay this general conclusion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I accept that challenge.  I happen to know the precise date at which this distinguished Irish graduate in the employment of Messrs.  Siemens first approached the President of the Dáil.  It was not because that it was too late an hour to make approaches for a Liffey scheme, but it was because that engineer, <Col N="2000" /> as patriotic Irishman, had his interests centred upon the economic development of his own country, and, finding himself in the employment of a firm whose operations were world-wide, he set himself to interest his employers in the exploitation of the Shannon water power, and, instead of their going out to give their experience and ability to China, they were, very happily for us, persuaded by him to turn their attention to Ireland.  The fact that Messrs. Siemens came to Ireland at all, and were willing to divert their energies from other centres of operation, was due to the case that Dr. McLaughlin was able to make for the possibilities of the Shannon.  Now we are asked to believe that Messrs. Siemens and these employed to scrutinise with vigilance every detail of Messrs. Siemens' plan, did this thing hurriedly.  Why, if it were only <i>a priori</i>, would not one come to the conclusion that a firm accustomed to the operations of the magnitude that Messrs.  Siemens engage in would not undertake a project of the kind in a hurry?  Every single record of the height of the Shannon at every period of the year in the last 100 years was carefully studied in Germany.  Every ordnance survey map, and the reports of all the Commissions that ever sat under the British regime to investigate water power in Ireland, were carefully studied before they came on the ground to inspect the actual territory.  That is not a case of hurry.  It is not a case of superficial investigation.  Everyone knows, to take a small example, how anyone expert in a particular department can with extreme and almost incredible rapidity form a decision which would occupy the inexperienced man for months, and leave him still in vacillating doubt.  That is the difference between acquired dexterity and the ordinary amateur mind.</P>
    <P>Now, who are those experts whom we employed?  Are they men who are accustomed to slur business, to do things in a half-hearted way, and in incomplete measures?  The Government had the advantage of being lent the greatest men in the electrical world in Sweden.  Everyone knows, as regards civil engineering applied to water <Col N="2001" /> power, that Switzerland stands foremost. There are great men in Germany, and there are great men in America, but Switzerland is the pioneer in this, and was the pioneer in all those almost magical undertakings in the making of roads, the construction of mounbridges, and the construction of mountain railways.  Switzerland has the same pre-eminence in those affairs as Ireland has in linen, whiskey, or shipbuilding. We have a careful report of these experts, two of them from Switzerland, who have devoted themselves to the civil engineering elements of the problem, and two others, Swedish and Norwegian, to the aspects of the case in which Ireland more resembled their own country.  We have had an extraordinary number of geographical discoveries in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Darrell Figgis, who has some distinction as a novelist, for example, has exercised his imagination with regard to the comparison of other countries. I took a note of his speech, and I find that a great deal of it was devoted to unnecessary repudiation of a charge of interestedness financially, but a great deal of what he had to say I had already read in that pamphlet which was published under the name of Sir John Griffith.  With regard to the repudiation I thought at the time of the famous epitaph on Craggs, which one may read in Westminster Abbey from the pen of Pope:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Statesman, yet friend of truth, of soul sincere;</P>
    <P>In action faithful, and in honour clear;</P>
    <P>Who broke no promise, served no private end,</P>
    <P>Who gained no title, and who lost no friend.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He has pointed out, and some of the members of the Farmers' Party likewise, that you have local centres of electrical production in Switzerland. Anyone who will compare the map of the two countries, not to speak of comparing the countries actually as regards their physical contours, will realise that we have a tremendous advantage over Switzerland, and in fact over <Col N="2002" /> those other countries, in the possession of the Shannon.  That is a paradoxical remark, no doubt, to make, because it is notorious always that while Ireland has plenty of water she has very little water power, and when I made that remark to two of the chief men of Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert their answer to me was that that was perfectly true until 1920, since when things had altered in the way of capacity for engineering to develop energy, even in the absence of a natural head of water, or fall.  It is very interesting in that connection to notice what the experts have said, and I dwell upon it because there is a natural assumption that on account of the flatness of the land energy is not forthcoming from our water sources. Someone said about the Irish rivers that they were like the Irish people, so lazy that they refused to flow out of the country.  That, of course, is not true of the Liffey.  The remark I wanted to dwell on is at page 4:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The exploitation of water power depends on two factors&mdash;(1) The relation, in time and quantity, of the flow of water to the demand for energy, and (2) the available fall or head.  In the case of the first factor, the conditions in Ireland are very favourable as compared with most continental countries&mdash;the greatest flow occurs in winter, when the demand for energy is greatest.  Excess winter energy can possibly be used for seasonal industries for which labour employed in summer on the farms should be available.  On the other hand, the conditions as regards head of water are unfavourable in this country, being in the main a flat country, and consequently capable of developing only a limited amount of water power.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is important, I think, in connection with the criticisms of Deputy Figgis.  The alternative would be to have a number of local stations as in Switzerland, each a centre of power development, or to have the one central station.  Now that brings me immediately by an easy step to the questions who are Messrs.  Siemens-Schuckert and why the date 1920?  Anyone who will look at an industrial map of <Col N="2003" /> Bavaria will see that in comparatively recent years there were various centres of production, some by water power, some by coal and steam.  All those have been utilised as transforming stations in connection with one big central energy producer.  Messrs. Siemens executed that work.  They executed a similar work in Pomeroy. Therefore they are no ordinary contracting firm looking for business and such in their character and operations that no firm can be got to tender against them in profitable competition. There has been a great deal of criticism here this afternoon and yesterday evening.  I must not forget my friend, Deputy Gorey, who was so keen about the chastity of his honour and the honour of his country that he felt if he voted for the Minister's resolution that he would have done something for which he would be punished here and hereafter.  A great deal was spoken of giving this contract to be tendered for by others in open competition.  Let us not forget the history.  Generation after generation it had been reported that there was plenty of water and no water power.  Even Mr. Challoner Smith, whose excellent data were utilised by Messrs. Siemens, and to whom a great tribute has been paid by them, was quoted, and rightly quoted, by Deputy Figgis yesterday evening as speaking as a result of all his investigation of &ldquo;the Shannon myth.&rdquo; When our Irish engineers, who according to the measure of their opportunity, are, no doubt, as great as any other land produces, turned their minds in consonance with the movement everywhere to be witnessed of seeking to develop water power into electrical energy, it was to the Liffey they devoted their time and attention. You had at one and the same moment three different competing schemes for the utilisation of the Liffey, and it was generally accepted that the Shannon was no use in comparison.  This firm, prompted by an Irish engineer's brain and patriotism, was able to show to the satisfaction of four of the greatest experts in the world in those particular matters that the Shannon power could be exploited advantageously. <Col N="2004" /> Then, what are we asked to do?  Give their plans, give their brains, give their results to anyone who comes along to tender.  That is really what this demand for competition reduces itself to when put into plain language&mdash;give a free present, gratis, of all the detailed plans of Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert to any other firm that comes along.  Is that national equity?  I ask is it good business?  I said we had to consider this in its three-fold aspect as an engineering problem, an economic question and public policy.  Is this going to be a land that will attract the brains and enterprise and long experience of men in other countries to help us in the development of our natural resources? Is this to be our history that the first time that a marvellous possibility opened itself out to the men who had the genius to perceive it, we utilised all that they could give us, and then in the name of the supposed&mdash;it is purely supposition&mdash;saving of some pounds in the matter we turned them down.</P>
    <P>We have been told that German machinery is inferior.  If it is, it is a very extraordinary thing that Great Britain, as the &ldquo;Daily Mail&rdquo; articles are continually showing, is sending its orders to Germany.  Japan sends its orders to Germany.  I suppose that is because the products of the German factories are notoriously inferior.  The article that I quoted from, after telling us to think of the effect upon our great neighbour, the farmer's best customer, goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is true that English shipping companies have given contracts to German yards, but only after they failed to get equal terms at home.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely if that is a defence for English firms giving their orders to German contractors, it is good enough for us.  They could not get equal terms at home.  Could we have got equal terms at home?  If we had waited for terms at home we should have a Liffey scheme and no Shannon scheme.</P>
    <P>There is more misrepresentation current. The critics of the Government's position are very much like the star performers of a certain type in English music-halls, described as quick-change artists.  The Minister for Industry and <Col N="2005" /> Commerce yesterday, in recommending this proposal on the economic side, and in showing that consumption will probably be forthcoming to meet all the requirements of the case, repeated what is dwelt upon in the experts' report at page 56:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To the experts it appears to be a self-evident matter that the quantity of energy produced on the Shannon scheme, in the first place, must be assumed to find its application in the general electric supply services, i.e., lighting, household and industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister laid great stress upon the fact that for the consumption of the energy to be supplied, he was not counting upon any new extensions of industrial enterprises; that he was really building upon domestic consumption. Observe how that can be tortured into something quite other:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. McGilligan has, both in the Seanad and in the Dáil, emphasised that he is not relying upon the starting of new industries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is quite true.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Therefore, while we may have no new industries in any one of the twenty-six counties, as a result of the proposed electrification, we incur risk to one important existing industry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, I take it, is a reference to the substitution of electric eels for salmon&mdash;</P>
    <P>and by his admission that no new industries can be reckoned, Mr. McGilligan takes from his scheme the strongest argument that would have commended it to the country&mdash;in fact, the one argument that made the Siemens' plan welcome to many when it was first outlined.</P>
    <P>Everything that the Minister said is within the recollection of the House.  He never declared that no new industries can be reckoned on.  He simply said that he was not reckoning on new industries as a factor in his calculations. I was rather surprised to find so accurate and so scholarly a critic as my friend, Deputy Thrift, falling into a mistake similar to that which the journalist whom I have just quoted fell into.  Deputy Thrift boasted, in an <Col N="2006" /> aside, that he had &ldquo;got one in for education.&rdquo; I think those were his words.  And the &ldquo;one&rdquo; that he &ldquo;got in&rdquo; was: &ldquo;It is disappointing to find that the electric current will not be used for the electro-chemical industry.&rdquo; That was due, I dare say, to reading a paragraph at the top of page 56 by itself, instead of reading it as a continuation of something at the bottom of page 55:</P>
    <P>For heating purposes, the Siemens-Schuckert scheme assumes a consumption at the partial development of 40 and at the full development of 60 million k.w.h. per year.  For electro-chemistry it is suggested that 135 million k.w.h. in the partial development and 188 in the further development might be used.  The experts consider a reduction necessary in the estimated consumption of heating current but think that about half the amount mentioned in the project will be used if available at low prices.</P>
    <P>This is the remark at the top of the succeeding page:</P>
    <P>As for the electro-chemistry, the experts find it doubtful whether the power resources available should really be used for that purpose.</P>
    <P>This is criticism on partial development and that is not a declaration that there is no current available.  It is an expression of opinion that, under the partial development scheme, it is doubtful whether the power resources available should really be used for that purpose.</P>
    <P>In order to form an opinion on this question it is necessary to examine in its whole extent the production capacity of the Shannon scheme, relative to the requirements in the district in which its energy is intended to be sold, i.e., in the entire Irish Free State.  To the experts it appears to be a self-evident matter that the quantity of energy produced under the Shannon scheme, in the first place, must be assumed to find its application in the general electric supply services....</P>
    <P>There was another respect in which those experts anticipated the verdict of the Farmers' Party.  Deputy Hogan and Deputy Baxter were both very emphatic <Col N="2007" /> in their statement that the farmers would not utilise electricity.  The experts make a somewhat similar statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The experts are aware that in Ireland it is thought that the rural population would be unwilling to introduce the use of electricity to an extent worth mentioning....  The experts are not inclined to the opinion, however, that this condition, which, no doubt, represents the present situation, will continue to exist for any great length of time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the passage in connection with which Deputy Figgis&mdash;I am sorry he is not here&mdash;attempted to mislead the House&mdash;I say that deliberately&mdash;by misreading.  I drew his attention at the time he was reading it to the omission of commas:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In Ireland the amount (of dairying) is four times greater...  Where electricity is availed of in the dairies of Norway now&rdquo;&mdash;there is a comma there, introducing the parenthesis&mdash;&ldquo;practically everywhere refrigerators are also used.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I draw attention to that because it is stated in some of those articles and letters to the editors that there is no use in the dairy industry for electrical energy, but that what is wanted there is steam.  That is one of the contributions to this subject refuted by the statistics mentioned here in the report that I have quoted.  Deputy Connor Hogan finds himself supported by one of these engineers in another particular. This time I do not refer to the experts.  The Deputy said that probably very few in the House are able to understand these documents.  His words were: &ldquo;No individual could enter into the stupendous calculations,&rdquo; and he made a plea to have them condensed. I know that when I was a law student and obliged to learn equity, the great difficulty I had was that I could not get hold of a book big enough.  Students generally began their study of that complex and intricate subject with a compendium, and the result was that it was a case of getting off by heart without understanding, or going without altogether, and the bigger the book <Col N="2008" /> the better the chance was of understanding. However, different people have different tastes.  Deputy Connor Hogan does not think that this is of very great value.  Here is what an engineer writing to the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; says: &ldquo;Both documents&rdquo;&mdash;that is the Siemens' document and the experts' report&mdash;&ldquo;may be useful for propaganda purposes.  They are of small technical value.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They are of small technical value?&rdquo; The product of the finest brains and the richest experience in this special department have no technical value. They are useful for propaganda, yet they are unintelligible to so highly intelligent a Deputy as Deputy Connor Hogan, so that the Deputy's colleague, Deputy Heffernan, does not require to go to special committees on Private Bills in order to hear the experts contradict each other.  One thing, however, that emerges and is hopeful from all the debate is, that the Farmers' Party are not opposing.  Deputy Gorey, Deputy Heffernan, Deputy Baxter and Deputy Connor Hogan have all assured us that the Farmers' Party are not opposing.  True, Deputy Baxter's non-opposition was of a somewhat fierce character.  He struck me as willing to wound, but yet afraid to strike.  Yet the Farmers' Party will hardly adopt Deputy Baxter's criticism in the main, and try to make it appear that this is a measure that was intended for the benefit of cities and towns, and that the credit of the country, which is an agricultural country, will be pledged therefor.  I hope I am not doing an injustice to his statement. What is in the minds of all these Deputies is what is in the mind of Deputy Thrift&mdash;Can the Government give us an assurance that this is going to turn out profitable?&mdash;Deputy Thrift asks can we be absolutely certain that it will be a commercial success.  I ask myself, is that the test that is applied by a great nation going to war?  Countries have taken the great risk of declaring war without knowing that they were going to win; they had courage in themselves, in their own capacity and their own resources, and they counted upon winning through. This policy of caution that is recommended <Col N="2009" /> to us is very good in small commercial enterprises, but as the experts have warned us, this is not to be viewed as merely a commercial enterprise.</P>
    <P>The electrification of Ireland must not be regarded as a purely business affair, but as a great national economic question.  When the question of financing the national electrification scheme arises, the State will naturally find the greatest measure of economic independence involved therein a factor of vital importance to itself.</P>
    <P>The people who used to assure us that we had plenty of water, but no water power, were the people who have coal to sell to us.  A few years ago an Irish-Canadian friend of mine wrote me a long memo which he asked me to submit to President de Valera and his Cabinet.  It was to the effect that what six millions of British coal was able to do for Ireland, he and his associates in Mexican oil could do for two million pounds' worth of oil.  I pointed out to him that if all the industrial resources of Ireland were dependent on power produced by oil arriving in tanks the moment that England engaged in her next great war, these would be paralysed, and therefore it was essential that we should have the source of our power inside our own area.</P>
    <P>Now, even if coal became cheap, as cheap almost as dirt, it would still be worth while for us to develop our water power for the sake of our national independence, to be self-supporting and not dependent upon some other country. Deputy Hogan invited those of us who believe in that, and believe in the scheme, to show the measure of our belief by financing it ourselves, and he added, without interest.  Surely that is not a proper test to apply: to finance it without interest.  It would be a fair test of one's sincerity, of one's convictions, and of one's faith in the future to say: &ldquo;Will you finance it yourself?&rdquo; That is precisely what we are proposing to do.  Now, Messrs. Siemens want to finance this.  They not only want the contract, but they want to carry out all the work, and they want also to supply the capital and control it.  If we had advocated that what answer could we make to those who <Col N="2010" /> spoke about peaceful penetration, and spoke of putting ourselves in the economic grasp of foreigners.  Why, obviously, as a question of public policy there should be either no Shannon scheme or it should be worked by our own capital.  Messrs. Siemens could get at any moment millions to finance this from capitalists in America. I have no doubt that the very fact that Messrs. Siemens are to carry out this contract will secure for us a loan for the purpose at a most favourable rate. That is another of the excellencies of the scheme.  There is where the world-wide reputation of these people counts as an asset in our interest.  How long have we been waiting with caution for our independence to govern ourselves? No one ever said: &ldquo;Be cautious about risking the friendly feeling of the great neighbour that rules you by asking for power and liberty to rule yourself.&rdquo; Well, now that we have achieved our independence we are to become delicate and careful about the sensitiveness of some firms in England lest they should be hurt in their delicate susceptibilities so that we are to be under a worse thraldom in the name of achieved liberty than we were in when, obviously and in fact, we were under alien rule.  That is the most extraordinary proposition that I have ever heard of, and that is called wisdom. I call that timidity and pusillanimity, as it was called by other Deputies.  I want to show confidence in ourselves and in our own capacity to make good.  This, I take, as a real testing of the capacity of Irishmen.</P>

      <P>As the Ceann Comhairle stated earlier in the evening, it is only by leave of the House that I am permitted to speak a second time on this amendment of mine.  I am perfectly willing to withdraw the amendment, for I think it has achieved its purpose.  It has achieved its objective, and that was to get the Shannon scheme thoroughly and very well debated. It has done so.  I put down this amendment not in hostility to the measure, but to show that while not prepared to go all the way, not to swing into the flood of enthusiasm aroused through the country, at the same time I felt that the good points <Col N="2011" /> of the scheme should be brought out and debated.  And I feel that the debate has served, in that respect, a very useful purpose.  Personally I was not prepared to embrace the scheme whole heartedly.  Neither was I prepared to take the risk of standing up and voting against it.  I wanted to find another outlet, and I put down this amendment to refer it to a Committee of experts or, alternately, to a Committee of the House.</P>
      <P>There are some few points now that have arisen in the discussion that I would like to deal with.  Of course, the House is fatigued, and the Minister has to make his summing up, which will necessarily take him, if he is to answer all the points raised, quite a considerable time.  There are a few points that I would like to deal with as directed to myself.  Deputy Egan said that the Farmers' Party were simply holding up the proposals.  Yes, possibly.  But not perhaps quite in the sense that the Deputy conveyed.  We were deferring the question, not holding up the proposal, and I submit that there is an essential difference between the two.  We take up this stand on the side of business. I put a query to Deputy Egan whether on a question involving privately a large sum of money he would not think twice about it, or whether he would go at once and make an immediate acceptance.  Of course, the Deputy would not do so.  But Deputy Egan was prepared, on this great public question, not to adopt the same rule as he would apply in his private affairs. It was to go forward without consideration, to be rushed and moved forward without regard to those elementary business principles that he would advocate in other walks of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Professor O'Sullivan made some points with which I should like to deal.  He spoke of the timidity of mind that would not come forward on this matter, that was prepared to dillydally, revolving it in every aspect. After all, is that not just?  Is there anything improper in it?  Must not every great question be debated for a season before a final decision is taken? The Deputy in his speech wanted to cast an aspersion on me, if I may say <Col N="2012" /> so, by saying that I had no right to refer to the credit of the nation, and that I voted against the Land Bonds Bill.  It is quite true I voted against the Land Bonds Bill.  But the Deputy inferentially gave his own case away. He was prepared to stand by the independence of Ireland, but he was prepared to accept a guarantee of Great Britain for his Land Bonds Bill.  That is an extraordinary thing to me; it is an anomaly.  I cannot understand such unique inconsistency.  However, the thing is only a minor detail.</P>
    <P>There was a document put into my hands this afternoon to which, I think, some attention should be given.  The Minister yesterday spoke of Mr. Kettle's estimates of an increase of 15 per cent. per annum in the consumption of electricity in Dublin.  This document deals with some evidence Mr. Kettle gave before the Committee of the Oireachtas inquiring into the Liffey Bills, and Mr. Kettle definitely stated that &ldquo;The average development to be expected for the Dublin Corporation supply over the next 10 years is 10 per cent., and for the tramways about 2 per cent.  The figure given by the Minister as Mr. Kettle's figure is, therefore, 50 per cent. higher than the increase as given by Mr. Kettle.&rdquo;  And the document goes on to state: &ldquo;The actual average increase for Dublin Corporation over the last twenty years was about 700,000 units per annum, so that Mr. Kettle's figure of 10 per cent., which would now mean about 2,000,000 units per annum at the transformer sub-station, seems to be a quite optimistic figure.  It is quite true that last year the increase in the number of units was greater than this 2,000,000, but this was not on account of ordinary development work, portion of the increase being merely a transfer of units from one generating station to another. Messrs. Siemens report figure as the consumption for Dublin, including the tramways partial development say at the end of six years was 63½ millions, whereas Mr. Kettle's figure for the same time is 59½ million units.  Messrs. Siemens figure for the full development of Dublin is 85¼ million units as against Mr. Kettle's figure of 58½ million units. The figures in question are of importance <Col N="2013" /> in as much as the Minister stated that the Shannon scheme partial development would pay its way even if only the 100,000 volt line was run, supplying only Dublin, Cork and Limerick. Evidently the consumption for these cities at the end of the partial development would not exceed 60 million units which at ½d. per unit would mean only £125,000.  To obtain the £315,000 required it would be necessary to charge Dublin, Cork and Limerick 1¼d. per unit, which is considerably higher than the present unit cost of generating by steam.&rdquo;</P>

In this statement from Mr. Kettle, he denies giving any such estimate.  He says it is only 10 per cent.  I would ask the Minister to deal with that point, and perhaps the Minister might, in some respects, pray for some of his friends, with the solitary exception of Deputy Magennis, who put the question, in a most excellent manner, on the transcendental question of national policy.

He has given food to them to reflect, and I appreciate the very fine speech indeed that he delivered. I am willing, as I say, to withdraw my amendment, and perhaps under the influence of his speech I am not quite so much opposed to the Shannon scheme.  I am even perhaps beginning <Col N="2015" /> to feel a little of the glow of enthusiasm burning for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday two statements were made by Deputy Figgis, one to the effect that he had an interview with me in May, 1923.  He goes on to state that a minute was kept of these conferences.  As the report runs, it states:&mdash;&ldquo;A minute was made that day and checked over by all the persons on our side who were present at this conference.&rdquo;  Those were the exact words.  I kept no minute of that conference and no minute of the conference was given to me, but it transpired that Deputy Figgis inferred that he was invited to go on with the scheme.  At the time it was within the knowledge of the Government that there were two companies promoting Liffey schemes, and it was more than possible that the Corporation might enter the list.  So it is unlikely then, most unlikely, and I challenge it, that we invited any particular person to go on with a scheme, knowing that only one could succeed.  Apparently somebody has got the idea that some compensation is due to them by reason of their activities on that particular occasion and from the date of initiation of the schemes.  The second statement made by Deputy Figgis&mdash;I think it was on the first occasion he alleged a lack of good faith&mdash;was to the effect that he had a letter from the Government dated the 12th December, and he wanted to make out that negotiations were in progress with Siemens-Schuckert at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the records of my office looked up, and I find on the 27th December, 1923, that I had an interview with Professor Magennis.  I kept no minute of that interview, and I presume from the entry on the next day that it was with a view to asking me to receive Dr. McLaughlin and himself, because on the next day, the 28th December, there also appears on the diary &ldquo;Professor Magennis and Dr. McLaughlin.&rdquo;  On that day I turned down, on my own responsibility, a proposal for the development of the Shannon put up by Dr. McLaughlin.  I find that the next entry that appears of Dr. McLaughlin's name in the diary, is on the 26th January, <Col N="2016" /> 1924.  There appears &ldquo;Dr. McLaughlin, Mr. J. McGrath, Mr. Blythe, and Mr. Kennedy, Attorney-General.&rdquo; The next entry appears on the 8th February, 1924: &ldquo;Dr. McLaughlin, Messrs. McGrath, Blythe, and Kennedy.&rdquo;  The item of the 8th February is referred to in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from these entries that there were no negotiations going on at the time Deputy Figgis alleged, although he appeared to be satisfied that the statement I made that there were no negotiations was quite right. However, I thought it was due to the House that I should disclose these particulars. There is only one other comment I would make.  In his report or his statement of the interview of the 3rd May he mixed up the President of the Executive Council and the Government. If a Minister gives an expression of opinion in his office that is not an expression of view from the Executive Council.  Deputy Figgis knew quite sufficient about the Constitution to know that if he wanted an expression of view from the Executive Council he should approach the Secretary of the Executive Council in that connection.</P>
    <P>I should have prefaced my remarks by saying that in common with everybody else who has spoken, I feel very great pleasure in congratulating the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the very able statement he has made in connection with the Shannon scheme.</P>

      <P>The Deputy takes credit to himself for having initiated a debate which has thrown considerable light on the Shannon proposals, and he apparently believes that debate would not have taken place on the simple terms of the resolution which I proposed.  He can take that credit to himself if he pleases.  He has introduced a letter which, at the end of his reading, he reveals as having come from the City Engineer.  In that, the City Engineer states that my statement <Col N="2017" /> regarding his estimate of 15 per cent. of increased consumption is inaccurate, and that his estimate would now be somewhere in the region of 10 per cent.  My estimates on which I based an opinion yesterday are, therefore, out to the extent of 50 per cent., and any conclusions founded upon them must be false.  I have, in my possession, a letter from Mr. Kettle, dated the 31st July, 1924.  It was written to me personally.  In it he replied to questions which I had sent to him through the medium of the Ministry of Local Government and Commissioner Hernon. The answer to one of the questions is that he estimates the normal increase of consumption at 15 per cent. per annum. If that is not sufficient, Mr. Kettle was examined before a Private Bill Committee on December 3rd, 1924, in connection with Liffey schemes.  He was asked there with regard to mass units consumed, and his estimate as to the future.  He states this: &ldquo;That would give a total for the year of 35 million units.  That is as regards present requirements.  For future requirements I estimate that the Corporation, Rathmines and Pembroke would, in about seven years' time, need 35½ million units, and the Tramway Company 16 million units, making a total of 51½ million units&rdquo;.  Now, somebody else can do the calculation to check this.  I assert that the increase estimated by him on that number of years &mdash;from 35 millions to 51½ millions&mdash; represents an increase of 15 per cent. at compound interest.  I know that Mr. Kettle wrote me a letter in which he definitely states 15 per cent.  I have had that corroborated by the evidence he gave, when he was promoting a Private Bill for the harnessing of the Liffey.  Apparently you can count on 15 per cent. at compound interest when you want a load factor for Liffey development, but when it is a question of Shannon development you reduce the figure to 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I looked for certain results from the setting down of this resolution, and while I believe I have some, I am disappointed in regard to others.  Deputy Magennis has alluded to a quotation from one of the two daily papers in this country.  It passes my comprehension <Col N="2018" /> how, after what I said yesterday, I should be misinterpreted into saying that there is no hope for new industries under this scheme.  I made a clear and positive statement that we do not count on new industry for the consumption that is necessary to make this scheme economic, and that is turned into: &ldquo;There is no hope for new industries,&rdquo; and one of the things that would have fascinated most people about this scheme has now been taken away by me.  Later on, in the ordinary account in the same newspaper&mdash; the ordinary account of the debate&mdash; a statement of mine is given the honour of leaded type.  It is where I was speaking about drainage, and I made use of this remark: &ldquo;that under the regulation of the lake necessary in the partial development, no possible flooding could occur by reason of the protection of embankments.&rdquo;  That phrase is given the honour of leaded type, and the &ldquo;no&rdquo; was omitted.  I am made to say that flooding could possibly occur by reason of the regulation of the river.</P>

      <P>I had hoped that in the course of the debate that has arisen on this resolution, we might have cleared away any doubt with regard to navigation and with regard to drainage, and that by the implications of this proposal of mine, implications which, I hope, to make explicit to you shortly, we would have cleared away all the interested criticism and all the criticism which depends upon the furtherance of British contracting firms in this country, and that having cleared away that by a certain vote, we would have a period of from four to six weeks, before legislation comes to be discussed, in which we might have had decent criticism, criticism intended for the betterment of the scheme, and that would help us to have the scheme made as sound as it would be possible to make it from the engineering point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the general tenor of Deputy Hogan's amendment, I feel to a certain degree sorry for him, because, I think, Deputy Gorey let him <Col N="2019" /> down badly last night.  We have the amendment of Deputy Hogan to the effect: &ldquo;that the aforesaid proposals should be further examined by other experts of international reputation with reference to the feasibility of the commercial hydro-electric exploitation of the River Shannon, with further reference to drainage, utilisation of existing roads and bridges, navigation and fisheries.&rdquo;  Deputy Gorey categorically stated that he was satisfied about navigation, about drainage, that the roads and bridges were such a small item they did not matter, and that as for fisheries, his final judgment was they should not be allowed to interfere with power requirements.  That leaves the amendment at this point: that we have to get other experts of international reputation to advise on the feasibility of the scheme.  That is to say, I presume, the economics of the scheme, a thing which, I think, this House is as competent to decide as any experts, or any international experts. Deputy Gorey, as the leader of the party which has put down what I was going to describe as a dilatory amendment, has expressed himself satisfied with regard to drainage and navigation; the question of fisheries must await further investigation.  It must await examination that will not be concluded until after the scheme is built up.</P>
    <P>There are two other points that arise from the comments in to-day's Press in connection with the debate here yesterday.  A meeting of the Irish Electrical Engineers was held last night, and a gentleman, who was not an electrical engineer, delivered himself of a prophecy that the scheme was going to cost £20,000,000.  We may have that £20,000,000 sooner or later, with the Shannon fully developed, and the Erne and the Liffey linked to it; but the only scheme that is under consideration at the moment is the scheme entailing a cost of £5,200,000.  Nobody can question that is the amount which we are considering, because for that we have binding estimates, if we care to accept tenders here and now, with the exception of the item referred to by Deputy Thrift, on page 80, limited to <Col N="2020" /> civil constructional costs.  The prices are absolutely fixed and binding.  They are maximum prices from Siemens-Schuckert point of view.  They are not the minimum from our point of view. We have checks and controls by which, if we find a reputable firm in any other part of the world that would do any part of this work at less than Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert, then we can beat them down to that, or give the contracts on those parts to other firms.</P>
    <P>The Irish Electrical Engineers think that we should go slowly with this. Now, Irish engineers in general, and their relation to this scheme, must be touched upon in brief.  It seems to me that the engineers have suffered through those who pretend to represent them in their letter-writing to the Press on this matter.  If I thought that those people who have written letters to the newspapers in connection with this Shannon Scheme really represented the engineering profession in this country, then I would despair of the engineering profession in the country.  But I have talked to members of the engineering profession, and I know well they are not properly represented by what has been said.  I think it is an unwholesome thing that certain people, by their speed in rushing into print, should have almost got the engineering profession here into the state in which this scheme must either be broken or the engineers in Ireland think that their dignity has suffered.  That is quite unwholesome. It is not fair to the engineers of this country that that should be the state, and I do not believe it represents any considerable fraction of the engineering opinion in the country.</P>
    <P>Certain arguments have been advanced here clarifying details of the scheme, and certain criticism passed against some details.  I do not intend to deal with Deputy Figgis and his relation to Liffey projects, and to what extent he, thinking there was a guarantee, invested the savings of his lifetime in a certain project.  That is no matter for this debate.  If Deputy Figgis even had a guarantee, if any Liffey Bill project had a guarantee, that is no reason why an inferior Liffey project <Col N="2021" /> should be given superiority over a very much better Shannon project.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;binding contract&rdquo; has been used, and Deputy Figgis produced a minute made by him of what he alleged to be my words on a certain occasion.  That very point was raised on the 19th December by Deputy Johnson, and I made it quite clear that, as far as the Dáil was concerned, the White Paper did not represent a contract between the Dáil and the German firm.  The Deputy also used the term &ldquo;binding contract&rdquo; as signifying the relations between the Executive Council and the promoters of the Liffey project.  If that is to be examined in detail, some other occasion can be taken for doing it.  In the absence of Deputy Figgis, I do not intend to go into it.  Deputy Figgis stressed one remark of mine, and no doubt we shall see it stressed in some of the English Sunday newspapers.  I said that if electricity was not going to be sold through the country, then there would not be any necessity to complete the 35 and 10 K.V. lines.  I am sure there is going to be founded on that the conclusion that I do not believe there is going to be any sale for electricity in the country.  Now, I was merely taking a pessimistic view-point, and pointing out that if, after embarking on the construction, one discovered that no sale of electricity was possible in the country, then you would be thrown back on the consumption in the three main cities.  I drew a certain conclusion from that and went into certain figures.  I want to reiterate, as it is likely to be taken up wrongly, that that was merely looking at the thing in the light of the almost impossible contingency of no electricity being sold, after the scheme was built out, to any place in the country except Dublin, Limerick, and Cork.</P>
    <P>Deputy Figgis challenged contradiction on one point.  He said that the actual consumption in the Free State at the moment had been over-estimated and he challenged contradiction when he said that the consumption was not more than 40 millions for the whole Free State.  The actual figures published, which Deputy Figgis can get <Col N="2022" /> as well as any Deputy, for Dublin, Cork, and Limerick, including in Dublin, Rathmines and Pembroke, show that in these three places alone in 1923 41½ millions were consumed.  So that when Deputy Figgis says that the consumption is only 40 millions, he can be immediately proved wrong by the figures of these three cities.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also spoke of his friend in Leeson street who would not engage in an expenditure of £35 to instal electricity in his house, and he used that in connection with the estimate of costs to consumers around Mallow, and said that, to the price to consumers around Mallow of almost 7d. quoted in the Siemens' report, you would have to add the cost of installation.  Presumably the inference was, that as £35 was prohibitive in Dublin, farmers down the country would find it prohibitive to instal electricity in their houses, even when the wire was passing alongside the door.  Dun Laoghaire is at present being equipped with electrical plant and connections are being made daily at a not higher rate than £2 10s.  If anybody were to estimate what would be the cost, say, in this district of Mallow, which we have taken for the sake of an example, of actually bringing electricity into the houses from the wires laid, at the cost of 6.8d. finally to the consumer, I do not believe that any likely consumer would incur a greater charge than £2.</P>
    <P>Deputy Figgis was amusing in one point.  He asked if this great firm of Siemens-Schuckert could finance this scheme which they brought forward. This is a question that has been urged in the newspapers, and the answer is, yes.  The firm are prepared to finance it.  It is amusing to have the question put by Deputy Figgis who wrote, when the scheme first appeared, that it meant that the scheme was definitely going to go into the hands of the Germans, and that it meant German grip and German control of all the industrial development in this country.  Deputy Figgis now asks why they cannot finance it, and he also said it would be no good for industry, although previously the argument was: &ldquo;Do not let them get it, and do not let them finance it, as otherwise they will get <Col N="2023" /> control of industrial development in the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson wished that the public should be reassured with regard to the strength of embankments and of the constructional work that is to be undertaken.  As far as I can foresee, the likely course of events, once this resolution is passed, the Government will have to employ engineers to go in detail into the Siemens' scheme, as modified by the experts' report, or to put it the other way, into the experts' report having the Siemens' scheme as reference to it.  All these questions as to whether extra borings have to be taken out, whether impermeable matter is to be found at a certain spot, or how far one must go to get it, and how far material dredged will be sufficient to withstand the pressure of water&mdash;all that remains for the engineers employed by the Government under the scheme to test, and to assure themselves and the public that any constructional work undertaken will be definitely safe.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson asked for certain information to be given to the Dáil in that regard.  We can examine into these things.  We can have engineers to see that all these matters are looked to.  I cannot, however, give a promise to the Deputy, for instance, with regard to the matter dealt with in page 20&mdash;the mixture of sand and clay.  I do not suppose the Deputy wants any. Nor can I pledge myself to give him, at different dates, what the Government engineers have decided as to, say, a proper mixture of sand and clay in the embankments.  The Deputy, I believe, wishes to be satisfied that that matter will be taken in hands and that where the experts have pointed out that further borings are necessary, or that borings have revealed a certain state of affairs which requires great caution and care, then further borings will be made and caution and care will be given.</P>
    <P>The suggestion which Deputy Johnson also made as to State policy in connection with this scheme, namely, that we should simply charge to the consumer a price which would cover the cost of the construction and the <Col N="2024" /> cost of the maintenance and repair of that constructional work, leaving out all charges for interest and amortisa tion, leaving these to be borne by the State, is a matter that can be raised when we come to the Shannon Organisation Bill.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's warning that having got this resolution the Government should proceed to do the same for the scheme as the opponents of the scheme are doing against it, is one which we certainly shall keep in mind.  I had not power to employ anybody on account of the pledge I gave here in December. With this resolution through, certain administrative expenses can be incurred by my Department, and we shall certainly see that the public gets as much information as possible with regard to the details of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gorey raised for the first time the question why not make this Bill go through the same procedure as Private Bill procedure, and let its terms be submitted to the searching examination which Private Bill procedure entails? That is a comparison that should be taken.  The Shannon scheme has so far gone on different lines from the procedure set down for the promoters of Private Bills.  I think there are three points in which comparison can be made.  The Shannon scheme has been presented, not merely presented by Siemens-Schuckert and the experts, but has been presented in the abridged document before the Dáil in greater detail than any Private Bill is ever presented. Actually, as presented to the Government, it takes the form of a tender with binding estimates.  What has Private Bill procedure entailed?  Summaries of costs, general and vague statements, as to what this may cost, and as to what something else might cost, but no actual tenders, no contractors' tenders as this has.  Without disrespect to members of this or the other House, who have been appointed to examine the various Liffey projects, I say that this scheme has stood the test of four international experts brought over to act as judges, while on a Private Bill Committee you have a certain number of laymen who are assisted or rather confused by expert witnesses.  It seems to me peculiar that An Dáil, <Col N="2025" /> which would have no hesitation in passing a Bill to take away the rights of private property for the benefit of other private promoters, after it has passed through a certain type of procedure, should grudge the State, represented by the Government, the passage of a scheme after it has been presented in great detail, with binding estimates and checked and examined by four expert judges.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gorey also raised, and was the first to do so, the question of how prices here would be controlled.  This question was raised in the Seanad, and to the Senator who raised it I put a question as to whether he was so innocent of engineering practice as to imagine that there was only one way of checking the prices, and that that was by the form of open tenders.  He gave a negative reply to that.  Deputy Gorey seems to imagine, and I think Deputy Good agrees with him, that possibly, if not the only form, the best form and the most usual form for checking prices is by way of competitive tenders.</P>

      <P>That is what I mean by checking prices.  I make bold to assert that very few great engineering schemes in the last five years have gone by the method of open tenders. There is a hydro-electric project in North Wales.  I take three examples from a number on which I have information. There is the Kenya Colony railway extension and the Anglo-Spanish railway construction schemes. These are three examples from a great number&mdash;I can give the House these in detail at a later stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite usual. We have in paragraphs 11 and 12 all the possible checks that any Government could desire in order to check prices.  I put it again in that simple form that Siemens-Schuckert have intimated that with the exception of what was referred to in page 80 of the experts' report the costs are absolutely fixed.  They are maximum.  They are the maximum prices Siemens-Schuckert can get, but they are not the minimum they may be forced to take. We can make them lessen their charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has been appointed by the country, and the Government chose four experts and is going to put in other engineers to check every detail of the costings. Deputy Gorey raised one point about islands in the Shannon.  I do not know if he was serious, but I think the statement I made about the actual regulation of the river will answer him.  If the river height is not to be increased from what it is at the moment, obviously islands not submerged at the moment will not in future be submerged. When we come to the fuller development, islands may have to suffer.  Deputy Hogan hoped there would be sufficient checks to prevent the control of power by outside firms. There cannot possibly be any control of power by outside firms, and the Deputy may rest quite assured that such would not be allowed.  Once Siemens-Schuckert have built out this plant and it is in working order, the contract, whatever contract there be with Messrs.  Siemens-Schuckert, must then lapse.  What other hold there could be by Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert over future production of power in the country I cannot see.  But since the Deputy asked for an assurance, I can only take it from what is my own intention, or what I forecast and foresee in regard to the following out of the scheme, and in that I cannot see how there is any possibility of any outside country controlling the price of power here.  Deputy Hogan further asked: &ldquo;Why should we stop at small villages?&rdquo;  And here I bring forward the example of Mallow.  This question <Col N="2028" /> of Mallow and the price to be charged there has been very much canvassed, and it is supposed to reveal one of the many weaknesses of the scheme.  It is estimated that current can be delivered to consumers in the area of the rural district around Mallow at a price which is about 6.8d.  Let it be understood what that means; it means that for the sake of giving a clear example of the results of the scheme Siemens-Schuckert went into certain further particulars; they took the transforming station at Mallow and they estimated the cost of running wires to every house, farm-house and every other type of house, in an area of about four hundred square miles, an area that is, roughly, bounded by the towns of Drumcollogher and Charleville on the north, and Banteer and Mallow on the south.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it might be of interest to the Minister if I pointed out that the network plan provides current feeders to 1,350 out of 3,000 houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I over-stated it in saying every house.  If you could give a supply to every house in the district the cost for that particular 3,000 would be less than to the 1,300.  What I should have said, and that tells more against the cost, was that they took a certain number over that area.  They took certainly those furthest removed from the transformer station, and they estimated what would be the cost of bringing further lines, radiating out from the transformer station, and they so that a certain number of houses could be supplied with power.  They estimated that the wiring to that number of houses would cost £50,000 to £60,000, and they took the cost at the 2.1d. rate, on page 104 of the report, and to that they added the division over all this number of people of the extra money required for the wiring, and they made out that that would cost to each of these people 3.8d.  If you take that with the 2.1d. with certain additions for the loss in transforming, making it up to 3d., you get a price of 6.8d.  If you take the table given on page 103, where you have a figure of .8d. for current, that is to say, if you go <Col N="2029" /> on the system of a flat rate all over the country for the sale of all your units, then the individual farmhouse in the area around Mallow can get supplies at a price of 3.8d., plus .8d.&mdash;4½d., that is to say, a farmer at Mallow can have it delivered outside his door, requiring an additional expenditure of about £2 or £2 5s. for bringing it inside his house, at 4½d., while in Dublin up to two days ago, consumers were paying 8d., and at the moment they are paying 7d.  We do not stop at the small village.  We estimate that the £5,200,000 will provide money sufficient to bring current along the 100, 35 and 10 k.v. lines, the result being that places of 500 inhabitants and upwards will have current supplied to them.  We go further, and say that if the demand be there, if that area spoken of, bounded by these four towns, desires power the additional costings have been made out, and if the one flat rate price is to be charged for current they can have it at 4½d.  In the other event, they can have current at almost 7d.</P>
      <P>Deputy Egan raised one point in connection with which I must enter a slight warning.  I have said that not one penny is being asked from riparian owners for the amelioration of their land.  That was indicating an intention which has yet to be accepted by this House.  What I should have said was this, that on the income side of the scheme no reliance is put upon getting any money from riparian owners for the amelioration of their land.  But when certain Bills come before this House it may seem good to the Oireachtas to decide that these people should pay something, and if they do there will be an additional income to the scheme.  But the scheme can be made economic without a single penny being charged to riparian owners. Deputy Egan also raised the point with regard to providing loans to farmers for the cost of installation.  That cost of installation is a matter that ought to be worked out, and on which I would like to see some of the critics, in newspapers and elsewhere, giving us the benefit of their advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Figgis talks about a £35 installation, and apparently wants that to be taken as a sort of flat rate all over <Col N="2030" /> the country.  I told the House definitely of £2 10s. for connections in Dun Laoghaire, and I say that it will be possible to get connected up, as in the Mallow district, for about £2.  But even on that small sum the House may again see fit, when the Bill comes before it, to make provision for loans to farmers, so as to cover the cost of installation where farmers like to instal. Deputy Egan also raised the point, and it was afterwards raised by Deputy Myles, as to what would be the position of existing undertakings and as to what would be the procedure as to sale, and one or other of the two Deputies mentioned the question of compensation to existing undertakings.  Certain Electricity Orders have been passed since the Shannon scheme made its appearance, even as a White Paper, and a clause in these has always been insisted upon by my Department. That clause has received the sanction of the Oireachtas in at least four Orders, and in the Seanad on one occasion when a Senator believed that the clause was left out he made an attempt to have it inserted.  This was the clause:</P>
    <P>In the event of a central power station being established and that the supply of electricity in bulk is thereby made available to the undertakers at a rate of charge equal to or less than the cost of generation in the generating station of the undertakers, the undertakers shall take such supply from the central power station.</P>
    <P>That seems to me entirely reasonable, and it has received the approval of the Oireachtas in several cases already. If we can supply to an existing undertaking current at the same as, or at a less price than, they can themselves generate and to which they can themselves add their own overhead charges they are not prejudiced in any respect. I think that is a reasonable thing to ask, that where you have set out to provide a national supply, existing undertakings should take current from you on the condition that you provide it at the same cost as, or at a lesser cost than, that at which they can generate themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan drew attention <Col N="2031" /> to a point to which I referred earlier, that we want to-night from An Dáil a clear expression of opinion on one thing.  And that is if the Shannon scheme in the main, as put forward by Siemens-Schuckert, be approved of, then Siemens-Schuckert are to be the contractors under the Government. That is really the big point that is to be decided to-night.  If the Shannon scheme of Siemens-Schuckert is not approved of, if it fails for some technical detail from some defect which emerges later before we proceed to the actual contract with them, then the matter is clear.  But if Siemens-Schuckert are not employed as contractors, remember the Government has no Shannon scheme.  The only Shannon scheme which the Government has to offer to this country is, at the moment, the Siemens-Schuckert scheme.  Tonight's resolution, as far as I am concerned, means mainly this&mdash;that subject to the checks and controls which we have in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the White Paper, there is an indication given here to-night that if the scheme be accepted Siemens-Schuckert are to be the contractors for it.  That expression of opinion is required to-night.  It is required as early as possible, and, if it be given, and if the conflicting interests, English and others, who are seeking to make inroads on this scheme, see that they have no chance of doing that, I believe we will emerge from what I have called the region of interested criticism to the better region of criticism intended to be helpful and to build up a sound scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan also called attention to one very important point, and that is this&mdash;criticism has been passed as to the setting out of the Shannon scheme on top of the Liffey schemes.  To a certain extent this contention depends on what Deputy Figgis had raised earlier as to how far the Liffey promoters were encouraged. My only feeling, looking back on it, is a feeling of relief that the Siemens-Schuckert proposals came along early enough to prevent this country making the gross blunder of committing itself to the Liffey project, which would, for a generation, have precluded all possibility <Col N="2032" /> of a decent national supply. Deputy Heffernan agrees with Deputy Figgis that the passing of this resolution to-night binds us to the full development, and as Deputy Heffernan is not prepared to ask the riparian owners to pay the £200,000 set down as an item of income under the full development, he is not prepared to accept the resolution to-night.</P>
    <P>The resolution is carefully drafted to cover only partial development, as recommended by the experts, and as somewhat modified by them.  Deputy Good spoke of three types of contract &mdash;a lump sum contract; a contract based on the schedule of prices; and a contract based on a percentage of the costs.  This is a contract based on the schedule of prices.</P>

      <P>It falls within clauses 11 and 12, and it is based on the schedule of prices; and these prices are fixed and binding, except in one respect, and in that respect not even Deputy Good can get an engineering contractor to make an absolutely fixed and binding estimate.  Certain items depend upon quantity.  The unit price is fixed there.  But nobody can tell, until the quantity of material is removed, how much the amount of material actually is.  To that extent there is a variation, subject to this, that as far as you can judge for the length and breadth of the canal how much material is to be removed, it is not possible to estimate beyond a shadow of doubt how much of that material is earth and how much is rock.</P>

      <P>If we bring in a good Shannon scheme, I would be satisfied, but if, in addition to that, we get brought in to this country a somewhat better method of business than has hitherto been adopted, that would be an additional reason for encouraging this scheme.  It has been asked why did we not bring in these experts beforehand&mdash; why should experts not have been asked to see whether there was a Shannon scheme possible, and then call for tenders and ask the Siemens-Schuckert firm to tender with the rest?  That is what it would mean.  This dates back to the end of 1923 or the beginning of 1924, at the time when this was described as the great Shannon myth.  Six months later, a Deputy interested in a Liffey Bill promotion and assisted by engineers, wrote in to say that the scheme was demonstrably impracticable. Yet the Government, faced with the great Shannon myth, were to call in engineering experts, and ask them to pass their judgment upon the possibilities of a scheme.  They could not have called in Irish experts, because Irish experts, in so far as they were vocal, had condemned it beforehand. If they went elsewhere there would be an ordinary charge of 2½ per cent. to be paid for work of this type, and the Government would have to embark upon a 2½ per cent. commission on an unknown amount before they could have got any scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Actually, if the scheme did appear, and if it were the same scheme as this, amounting to about £5,000,000, there would have to be a preliminary payment of £125,000.  I can imagine Deputy Good's indignation with the unfortunate Minister when he came to this House and asked leave to spend the sum of £125,000 for that purpose. The Deputy also holds that the districts should be canvassed to see what demand there is before you provide the supply.  Leaving out of account the fact that Siemens-Schuckert's representative in Ireland did go round nearly <Col N="2035" /> every town and large village in the country, and that the experts later visited a considerable number of them, is that, I wonder, the way in which brave captains of industry in this country operate when they engage in some new enterprise?  My idea of bravery with regard to industry was that a man embarking on private enterprise was like a man casting himself on an uncharted sea and taking risks.  Apparently that is not so in this country, and production here must be based on the orders received before there is anything ready to supply such orders, and, on the consideration of the orders received, they will build the plant afterwards.  That does not operate anywhere else.  I spent a certain amount of money on myself in a certain period in order to enter a certain profession.  Was I to delay my progress to the Bar until such time as I was assured that a certain number of clients were ready to fee me when I got there?  Would the medical student ever become qualified if he had to wait until the patients were there ready for him?  There is one big advantage to be looked to in proceeding immediately with the national supply scheme, and that is to secure, at the earliest possible date, a uniform system of supply. There are, at least, five towns which have been anxious to have electricity undertakings, but which have been held up or have restrained themselves, until they saw whether a national supply was possible.  If we adopted what is recommended by some critics outside, that we should allow the country to develop its small power plants until the full demand presents itself before proceeding with the Shannon scheme, we might find ourselves on a relatively similar scale to the position in which England is at present.  There are so many points of difference in the systems of supply in England that the British Parliament has almost passed a grant of £10,000,000 not to centralise supply, but as the first step to doing so, i.e., to secure uniformity of supply.  If we are to allow ourselves to develop by means of small power plants with all their divergencies we should almost <Col N="2036" /> certainly preclude any chance of having an early development nationally.  Deputy Good also dealt with the figures in Dublin, and he has adopted here a casual line of argument which, again, is not fitted to a business man.  He said that in Dublin, current was produced at less than one penny.  The evidence of Mr. Kettle before the Private Bill Committee was that it was produced at 1.13d., minus capital charges, and if you take a moderate estimate from the accounts of the Dublin Corporation last year you come to a minimum of 1.6d.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Current can be produced at less than one penny in Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of the Shannon scheme it can be produced in Limerick and brought to Dublin at .52d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, that is how current can be produced in Dublin for less than one penny.  The Deputy argued that it could be produced here at less than one penny, and by taking advantage of the Shannon scheme it would be .52d., and he said it would be something between one halfpenny and one penny.  I worked out the figure to be compared with .52d., and I found that it was 1.6d. in Dublin. Instead of from one halfpenny to one penny, I could say from three halfpence to threepence, if we were to argue in that way.  The .52d. is set out in detail in the schedule and can be examined, and the 1.6d. can be examined according to Mr. Kettle's published accounts. Mr. Kettle mentioned 1.3d., exclusive of capital costs and distribution, yet Deputy Good says, even if you add the capital costs, you can produce at less than one penny.  Mr. Kettle, the City Engineer, says 1.3d., exclusive of capital costs.  The Deputy also says that our method of going about this was definitely putting the cart before the horse.  He gave his system and outlined his method of procedure, that is <Col N="2037" /> the calling in of the experts first, and he asked why was this not done, and why was the horse not put before the cart.  Sinn Fein tried to back many horses into the cart of the Shannon scheme, and no Irish engineer could be found to say that it was likely to be a success, but now, when we have got this scheme properly put forward and properly established by a German firm, Irish engineers are anxious to engage in it, and Irish engineers are rather wondering why they had not previously been called into consultation, so that they could have got the scheme in motion.  If I may proceed further with the metaphor of the horse and cart&mdash;I shall not go to a lesser species of animal for the Irish engineers than a pony&mdash;it seems to me that we are being asked to back a pony into a motor car when the motor car is already cranked up and ready to start.  The Deputy wants to know why this material was not in the hands of Deputies earlier.  He said: &ldquo;We have been pressing for months to get the report.&rdquo; Does he make any allegation that the report was not published at the earliest possible date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the report was in the hands of Deputies only for a fortnight, and we are asked to approve of it now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that later.  The Deputy went on to speak, almost in the same breath, of a second matter, and I think it was the backwash of the second phrase that made me think there was an imputation in the first.  He said that if we proceeded in a certain way the whole scheme would be above suspicion. What suspicion has the Deputy about this scheme?  This is the atmosphere <Col N="2038" /> which Deputy Good and Deputy Heffernan have managed to generate around the scheme.  What does it mean?  There is certainly unusual procedure, but does the Deputy allege that there is anything else?  He says that there are no plans and no estimates. There are plans and there are estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not been disclosed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to it again.  Are we to disclose the contractors' estimates, and then ask for tenders in open competition? Deputy Professor Thrift made what, I think, was the best adverse criticism of the scheme.  His criticism is a type that we hope to get increasingly in the next four or six weeks.  He gave certain calculations which he had made himself, and he asked that these be reconciled with certain calculations I had either made, or hinted at, yesterday. He raised the question of what energy you would be sure of getting in a dry year.  I do not know if this will sufficiently satisfy the Deputy: if you take that estimate of 153 million units generated&mdash;I am speaking merely of what can be got constantly in a particular year, so that I am for the moment neglecting losses in transmission which will occur relatively in any transmission&mdash;if the Deputy's question means 153 million units produced in a dry year, and 1905 was the driest year of the period, and if he asks me in any month of that year would you have one-twelfth of 153 million units, the answer is, of course, you would not. Neither would you have a demand of one-twelfth of 153 million units, and the advantage this country has, as opposed to the disadvantages in Norway, Switzerland, and Sweden, is that your requirement curve varies pretty well as your flow of current curve varies, so that to that extent we are in favourably placed circumstances, having our greatest volume of water, and greatest number of generated units in the months in which you have your greatest demand for power.  The Deputy has made certain calculations, and I do not intend to follow them just <Col N="2039" /> to the full, but it did emerge at the end that the Deputy thought, speaking of the full development, that there could be produced only 260 million units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>For certain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>But you could count on that only in a particular year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy Professor Thrift is the only person in the Dáil who has calculated on his own account.  I am sure he will admit that his calculations could not have been carried out to the same degree of accuracy with regard to storage conditions and so forth, as the experts have done. If Deputy Thrift turns to page 26 he will find that he is pretty much in agreement with the experts.  There it is said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Final development.  Storage space, 827 million cubic metres. Without the aid of steam-power on the basis of a proportional increase in the experts' requirement curves there can be produced 275 million k.w.h.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So that actually in his calculation, which is not so accurate, as the Deputy admits, as that of the experts, he is pretty much in agreement with them. The Deputy took this question of my 15 per cent. increase, and he used the figure in another way.  He gets a different result to what I got, but one equally satisfying to me.  I use the 15 per cent. increased consumption mainly for this purpose&mdash;I take the chapter dealing with the estimate of consumption at a certain time for the three main cities, and Herr Borgquist has estimated that it must be something around a named figure to make the scheme economical.  He estimated that in about 1931 or 1932 a consumption could be counted on in Dublin, Limerick and Cork of 115 units per head of the population.  That argument, I still hold, is good, and it is still good for the three cities, and that is all I used it for at the time.  It is further corroborated by the extract I have read from Mr. Kettle's evidence before the Liffey Bill Committee.  If <Col N="2040" /> you take that estimate and get it to the year 1932 you will find that this figure is not 115 units per head of the population, but it is about 136.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister did he turn that 115 per head of the population into the total number of units per year?  It will obviously only be about 57 million, whereas about 115 million units is what he wants to sell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That, I think, is where the Deputy and I are at variance. The Deputy has taken 115 all over the country.  He took it on the basis of 50 million units, which he works out to be the consumption at present in the whole country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it you want to sell 115 million units in the year as a total?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As I understand the Deputy's argument, it runs this way.  He took 50 million units, and 15 per cent. of that for a certain number of years, and in 1932 arrived at 90 million, when I said I must get 115 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>There is confusion about the 115.  The 115 number turns up twice; once per head of the population, and it comes up again as 115 millions required every year.  My argument was that there were 50 million at present in demand.  I divided that into 30 million for ordinary purposes, and 20 million for travel and power purposes.  I applied the 15 per cent. increase to the 30, and it produced about 70, which I added to the 20 as constant for the Tramway Company, giving me 90.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I must have confused the Deputy on this 115 million units.  My use of the 15 per cent. was confined to the three cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major MYLES Major MYLES">
      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Mr. Kettle denies the 15 per cent., and says that should be 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I had a letter from Mr. Kettle, dated the 31st July, 1924, in reply to questions which <Col N="2041" /> I sent him through the medium of the Local Government Ministry, and Commissioner Hernon.  That letter said that his estimated increased consumption was 15 per cent.  In addition, I take the evidence given by him before the Private Bill Committee in December, 1924.  He there said that in 1923 the total for the year was 35 millions, and the Deputy can read it for himself. He estimates that in 1931 there will be a total of 51½ million units.  If the Deputy works that out he will find that it is an increase at the rate of 15 per cent. compound interest.  We have Mr. Kettle's repudiation of the 15 per cent. given twice, and I want twice to repudiate his repudiations, by his own plain statement to me in the letter of July, 1924, and the evidence given by Mr. Kettle when under examination in connection with the Liffey scheme.</P>
      <P>To come back to Deputy Professor Thrift's argument, I used the 15 per cent. only for the purpose of the three cities.  I took it at that, and said on the basis of Herr Borgquist's calculation, that the consumption per head of the inhabitants of these three cities of 115 was moderate.  Mr. Kettle would actually make it to be somewhere between 136 and 140 units per head. Deputy Thrift takes it the other way, and I want to follow him.  He takes the 50, and he divides it into 30 and 20. Twenty for tramways and power, and 30 for ordinary consumption.  If he recollects that there are only two cities with tramways, I think he will admit that it is a rather unfair proportion to take.  Even if he takes his 50, and estimates at the 15 per cent., he arrives at the mass unit consumption in 1931 of 90 millions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in 1932, to make the scheme economic, on the basis which Deputy Thrift has taken, we must arrive at a sale of 115 millions.  Therefore, at the same date we are 25 short.  Deputy Thrift forgets that our 115 are divided this way: 90 million at the .5d., or whatever the rate may be all over the country, and 20 million units which we have given over for heating at a cost of about .25.  Even on the Deputy's argument, following out that rate over the whole country, which I believe to be unfair, we arrive at the year in which <Col N="2042" /> we should make ends meet on the scheme, short about the 20 millions which we said we had for heating at a certain amount.  Even that basis&mdash;a much more conservative basis than Mr. Kettle's, and a somewhat more conservative basis than the experts'&mdash;I hold, is founded on two great fallacies&mdash;one, that you are only to have the same rate of consumption in cities and towns which are entering for the first time on the use of electricity as you have in Dublin, already partially supplied, and, secondly, that the division of thirty and twenty over the whole amount is fair.  Those are items which will form the subject of discussion for days to come.  They will probably lead to elucidation of the good and bad points of the scheme, and, as such, they are welcome.  The Deputy says, however, that we are bound to the engineering details of the scheme, and he quoted certain pages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>What I wished to convey to the Minister was that it seemed to me the effect of this resolution would be, if you pass it, that you would be giving adherence to this scheme in its engineering details, that you would be agreeing to support that scheme, and that the Government would be bound to bring in a Bill on the lines of that scheme.  I am anxious that the Minister should make that point clear.</P>

Page 17 says: &ldquo;The choice of the spot for dredging is one for particular care and will require further borings.&rdquo;  Let the Deputy have no further apprehension. I am not going to carry out the scheme. I am completely inexpert in the matter, and I have no trust in myself for that purpose.  There is no use in my looking at the matter and saying that dredging entails a great deal of trouble, that I have not the time to give to it, and, consequently, that I will not bother about the dredging, but that I will proceed as things are. This scheme has to be handed over to competent engineers, and they will have before them the warnings the experts have given as to things that have to be further inquired into.  Those <Col N="2043" /> engineers will have to do their work thoroughly.  If we got incompetent engineers, even with that very good scheme and that very good report, the scheme could prove a failure.</P>

In page 80, it is stated: &ldquo;it permits of a judgment of the probable costs within a margin of about 10 per cent.&rdquo;  That appears on page 80, after the experts themselves have warned us that certain things will require to be done. Having done that, and bearing in mind this question of quantities, which might vary, they say that undoubtedly there may be room there for variation in costs, and they sit down to estimate what is the probable variation.  Their expert view is that ten per cent. variation in the cost of the civil engineering construction side is sufficient.  They themselves&mdash;the men who gave the warnings&mdash;were surely not likely to forget those warnings when they came to estimate the costs.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Minister has not answered my point. This resolution mentions in the &ldquo;whereas&rdquo; part:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The experts appointed by the Government to examine the proposals <Col N="2044" /> of Siemens-Schuckert for the hydro-electric exploitation of the River Shannon have reported in favour of the adoption, with modifications, of the partial development scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is to say, we are really asked to approve to-night of the partial development scheme with the modifications mentioned by the experts.  Suppose that further engineering investigation reveals other points which may require modification and which may be quite important points, we would have approved of the scheme as it stands. Would it be possible then for us to make those necessary alterations?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to say that that will be in the Bill, because there may be too much founded on the Bill and people may be disappointed when they see the actual terms of the measure.  Obviously, if something else cropped up through the course of the construction work, and if the engineers we had appointed decided that a change they thought of was necessary, and recommended that change, that change would be effected. If it were a question of money and that money would go beyond the ten per cent., the Bill would provide for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of money: it is a question of procedure.  We shall have sanctioned, by this resolution, the introduction of a Bill to carry into effect this scheme, with its present modifications.  Supposing further modifications become necessary, would it be in the power of the Executive Council, without permission from the Dáil, to bring in a Bill to provide for the modified scheme? If you like, it is a technical point of procedure, but I think it is an important point of procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is an important and technical point of procedure, it can be met by a difference in the wording of the legislation. When we bring in the Bill, we can attend to it.  The Deputy has not been committed to the Siemens-Schuckert scheme with only the modifications recommended by the experts.  He is committed to a sound partial development <Col N="2045" /> scheme.  Siemens believe the scheme to be sound and the experts have recommended that scheme with modifications.  If other modifications are necessary, we are not going to have an unsound scheme merely because of a point of procedure.</P>
      <P>The Deputy was the only one who raised a point about drainage.  I feel this is an important point and, although the hour be late, I want to clear away any further difficulty about drainage.  He raised the point that up to date you have the land draining into the river.  In actual practice, if he visits Portumna, he will find that the position is the reverse.  But this was his idea&mdash; that the land drains into the river and that if we erect embankments we will prevent draining into the river and bring about a new condition in which, the level being raised at some points, the river will drain into the land.  He wants to know how that is to be met. There are side drains and, if there are side drains there of a certain type, then the present condition is preserved.  If those drains are on a certain level and if the levels can be regulated by electric pumps, surely the same position is preserved&mdash;that of the land being drained into something.  From that &ldquo;something&rdquo; the water will be brought back into the river by a certain process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy seems surprised and disappointed that the electro-chemical industry was &ldquo;turned down.&rdquo;  This point was, I think, dealt with by Deputy Magennis.  The electro-chemical industry was not turned down.  It was turned down at a price of .35d. If the Deputy would read the part of the experts' report to which Deputy Magennis referred him, he would find that the experts believe that even on their modest estimate of consumption in 1932, there will be in the ordinary year about 100,000,000 units that you can give away at next to nothing. They put in a price of .15d., and an electro-chemical industry at that price should certainly pay.  Taking both things&mdash;that it would not pay at .35d. and that there would be units to give away at .15d., which would seem to indicate that an electro-chemical industry would be a success&mdash;they, notwithstanding <Col N="2046" /> that, turned the proposal down for this reason: that they believe the consumption will be such in 1932 that there will be no surplus units of energy to be given away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the point I made.  I did not say they turned it down.  I said their report was unfavourable to the electro-chemical industry, as it suggested this further development in other directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy not see the further chance the electro-chemical industry has?  If the estimates of consumption are exceeded, and if these surplus units are not there to give away, surely the next step is to proceed to the second stage of partial development set out in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Either we can have an electro-chemical industry if the experts' conservative estimate is just met, or we cannot have an electro-chemical industry if their estimate is exceeded.  But if their estimate is exceeded, we can have no possible doubt with regard to the scheme, as a whole, being a success.  We are in the happy position of having either a second partial development scheme or an electro-chemical industry under this partial development scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to stress the point, but the paragraph I quoted referred to the full development scheme, and is to be found on page 56.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true, but if the Deputy will turn to page 111 he will find there an estimate of surplus energy which, it is assumed, we will be able to sell at a very low price&mdash;say, .15d. per unit&mdash;for electro-chemical industries or others.  Deputy Baxter advanced a peculiar argument &mdash;that if this scheme went through, we would be involved in further protective measures, because Protection would be necessary for the industries which themselves would be necessary to make the scheme economic.  I think the argument cuts the other way.  If you do not have a scheme of this kind, you are going to have imposed upon <Col N="2047" /> you further measures to protect industries in this country, as against industries in other countries which are benefited by electricity.  Deputy Baxter asked if a precis of arguments were made out could we get the experts submitted to cross-examination on them.  If we get definite arguments, which seem to have substance in them, these arguments will be submitted to the engineers whom we will appoint to make the necessary preparations in connection with the scheme.  If they are found to be of greater substance than these engineers can deal with, we will certainly refer them to the experts for their opinion.  The Deputy ended his query with the phrase &ldquo;and in this way stop all criticism.&rdquo;  I have no hope that the particular type of criticism which I quoted is going to be stopped by merely referring points to experts.</P>
      <P>Deputy Myles was the first to raise the question of the experts and their qualifications.  He asked how did we come to select them.  He wanted to know if there was any engineer advising me.  If I were to go into the details of the various suggestions which I put before the Executive Council from time to time with regard to experts, and into the history of the entire dealings&mdash;how we decided from what countries experts were to be drawn, and then decided further who were the experts required for the scheme from these countries&mdash;it would be a long story.  There was no special engineering advice tendered to me. But we had very good advice on the whole question, and inasmuch as there was a World Power Conference taking place at that time, which an official of my Department attended, it was very easy to discover what were the countries from which experts should be chosen.  Once the countries were chosen, the four men almost chose themselves.  I have already given to the newspapers the qualifications of those experts, and I do not intend to go into that matter here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already replied to another Deputy as to how it is proposed to deal with existing electricity undertakings. Deputy Myles put two further questions <Col N="2048" /> to me.  He asked: are there any figures in the larger report, which are material to the issue, held back?  I have dealt pretty fully with that matter in reply to Deputy Good, but I can answer Deputy Myles that, as far as I believe, there are no figures material to the issue at present before the House held back.  The second question is: is the basic price to consumers dependent upon the limitation of power used?  The answer to that again is, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  There is no limitation as to use with regard to the partial scheme.  The Deputy also spoke of German machines, and seemed to decry German machinery.  He asked how were new parts to be supplied.  If you do get one German firm to instal machinery, it does not follow that you have always to go to the same firm for your repairs.  But if it is asserted that it is unsound to get foreign machinery brought in here, because the getting of spare parts may cause delay, I can only refer again to the City Engineer.  The Pigeon House has had for the last 15 years mainly Swiss plant installed, and why there should be any objection to doing on a national scheme what has already been done in the Pigeon House, without any great inconvenience being caused, I do not understand.  The Deputy also said that the arrangement of pumps, syphons and side-drains required more examination.  That examination, of course, they are going to get. Again, I must refer to the engineers likely to be appointed, if this resolution is passed.  The engineers appointed to supervise the carrying out of this scheme will look into all these points. The whole question will be considered, at their leisure, by competent engineers appointed to carry out this scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Redmond got back to the question of open competition.  If, as seems to be the case, Deputy Redmond and Deputy Good want open competition for open competition's sake, then they are not going to get it in this case. If what is sought is open competition for the country's good and for the purpose of getting the best out of the scheme for the country, then I refer again to Clauses 11 and 12, which provide every possible check that anybody can want in order to secure the greatest advantage for the country.  The Deputy referred to the redemption of a <Col N="2049" /> pledge I gave here on the 19th December, and asked does the resolution mean that I can enter into contractual relations with this firm.  What I want mainly is leave to incur certain administrative expenses in connection with getting the scheme better known to the public and getting engineers appointed, so that the preliminaries may be worked up to the point of the making of the contract.</P>
    <P>The Deputy himself, I am sure, knows that a contract for £5,200,000 cannot be entered into on the basis of a resolution of this sort.  There is no money resolution with it, and there is no Governor-General's message, and those people who have been so critical of the rush and of the hurry about this debate might have recollected that there was no binding in that sense&mdash; binding us to any great expenditure of money without a money resolution and without the Governor-General's message. In what has happened here my main purpose has been served.  The reports have been handed out.  There was not much time to have them read, but I had the feeling that if I came before the House six weeks hence and initiated a debate, I would have been met by the same objection that nobody had time to read the reports, and that there had been no chance given for a consideration of them.</P>
    <P>I think that we have stirred people up now to a realisation of certain details and certain virtues of the scheme. The resolution means two things, as far as I am concerned, and I want to repeat this before we go to a vote.  It means a redemption of the pledge that I gave here on the 19th December that no expenditure would be incurred.  I have now come forward and stated that if this resolution is passed, certain administrative expenses will be incurred, and, further, I want this to be understood: that a vote for this motion to-night does mean&mdash;it is very necessary that this should be clearly known, so that interested criticism should be swept away&mdash;that we are going to accept at a later stage, unless some defect occurs, the Siemens-Schuckert scheme, and if we accept that it is definitely going to be with Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert as the contractors.</P>
