      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The manufacture and bottling of mineral waters is an industry which is of a very scattered nature, and a considerable number of small firms exist throughout the country and in the small towns.  The industry is also of a seasonal nature, with the result that employment fluctuates considerably. For these reasons I am unable to give a precise reply to the Deputy's question. It is estimated, however, that there are some 120 firms engaged in the industry, many of these being on a very small scale, and that the numbers employed are approximately 1,000.  This latter figure increases considerably during the busy season.</P>

      <NameTxt>LIAM O DAIMHÍN</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has received complaints from Daniel Lowry, Owen Brennan and Frank Conway, who were employed as mine workers in the Wolfhill Colliery, Leix, regarding non-payment of unemployment insurance benefit, and if he can state what steps he has taken or intends to take in order to see that these and other miners concerned are paid the amounts which they are entitled to under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Daniel Lowry, of Skehna, Ballylinan, Athy, lodged a claim for unemployment benefit on the 25th November, 1924, on which he was paid benefit for 42 days.  As only 42 contributions had been paid for him the amount of benefit paid exhausted his credit in the Unemployment Fund, and there is no legal power to pay him further benefit until further contributions have been paid for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a claim made on the 9th December, 1924, Owen Brennan was paid benefit in respect of every day for which he furnished evidence of unemployment. A further claim made by him on the 26th January, 1925, was disallowed for six weeks on the statutory ground that he had left his employment voluntarily.  Mr. Brennan furnished evidence of unemployment for only two days after expiration of <Col N="798" /> the period of disqualification, and he was not, therefore, entitled to receive any benefit on that claim.</P>
    <P>Frank Conway was paid benefit for 15 days on a claim which he made on the 24th November, 1924.  In making that claim he was unable to lodge an unemployment book, and benefit could only be paid after contributions due in respect of his claim by the Wolfhill Collieries had been collected.  He lodged a further claim on the 28th February last, but as he appeared to have exhausted all his rights in the Unemployment Fund by benefit drawn on the previous claim, his last claim could not be allowed.  He represented, however, that contributions had been paid for him in respect of an earlier period of employment, but was unable to give any reference to the number of his unemployment book.  The Department, however, took action with a view to tracing his previous account, which was eventually located in the Ministry of Labour in London, and has now been transferred to Dublin.  On this account it was possible to allow further benefit to the maximum amount of benefit that can be made in the 5th benefit year, and all benefit due to date was paid Mr. Conway last Saturday.</P>
    <P>With regard to the claim to benefit of persons employed at the Wolfhill Collieries, benefit will, of course, be allowed as in other cases on the contributions to their credit in the Unemployment Fund in the proportion of benefit to contributions fixed by the Act.  It appears, however, that the Wolfhill Collieries, Ltd,. have not paid, and have not been asked by their employees to pay contributions for the full periods of employment in some cases.  Efforts have been made to collect the arrears, and as the undertaking is now in the hands of the Official Receiver a claim is being addressed to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, in the case of Daniel Lowry, as in the case of several other men employed but likely to be unemployed in the course of a day or two, deductions have been made from their wages over a very long period, and that their cards have not been stamped?  Will the <Col N="799" /> Minister undertake to make representations to the proper authorities in regard to complaints of that kind, and will he see that the men when they do become unemployed are credited from the fund with the amount of contributions that have been deducted from their wages by the owners of the collieries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy speaks of representations.  If he confines himself to representations I can accede to his request: that is to say, I can make representations to whoever is in charge of the Wolfhill Colliery. With regard to this matter, it goes further back than the present, that is this question of arrears, and as the employees were not particular about their claims and were not particular about their own contributions, as they have the right in their own hands of enforcing the payment of benefit by getting the arrears paid up by the employers, I do not see that it is for me to take action.  I can make representations, but that is all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain whether the right is in the hands of the employees who have carried out their part as far as the Act is concerned, and does he not admit that there is a responsibility on him to see that credit is given from the fund to the employees concerned in this, as well as in every other industry, for the money that has been deducted from their wages&mdash;money that has not been applied to the stamping of their cards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 24 of the Act of 1920 the employees can take proceedings to recover any money due to them, on the basis of it being a civil debt, by ordinary proceedings.  I am speaking now of the Wolfhill Colliery case and not of any other.  In that case I say these men were definitely negligent about their own interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>By not insisting that the employers contribution was paid.  They have the remedy in their own hands, and if they do not use that remedy I cannot see at the moment that <Col N="800" /> it is for me to take action which they can take themselves, and which they have a better right to take than I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the Minister aware that it is the duty of the Insurance Inspectors to see that the cards are stamped, and not the duty of the men?  A man might be in employment for 12 months and money for the stamps might be regularly deducted from his wages, and he may not be aware whether his employer is stamping the card or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have files here stretching over a considerable period from which it appears that the insurance officials made repeated representations to the colliery people and to the employees concerned that the stamps were not being put on, and time and again the phrase occurs in the reports that &ldquo;the men do not seem to want to have the contributions paid.&rdquo;  Now, where such an allegation is made, if there was no legal remedy in the hands of the men, obviously I would have to take action, but where the men have the remedy in their own hands and where they have not moved, I do not see that I should be more careful of their interests than they are themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the British Government prosecuted me because my employees did not wish me to stamp their cards, and that I was fined one penny with no costs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The prosecution was doubtless good, but the fine was absurd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>As there is an Official Receiver acting now in this case to whom representations have been made, and as, according to the Minister, this Official Receiver is acting on behalf of the National Land Bank, which is now a Government Department, will the Minister whisper into the ears of the Minister for Finance to see that the money is paid, and the matter is put right?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

Limerick, were commandeered by a detachment of the National Army under Colonel William Hayes, on the 21st February, 1923, and occupied by them until July 6th, 1923; whether Mr. Collins and his family were obliged to live in a smoky cabin during portion of the period; whether they were evicted from that cabin on October 28th, 1924; whether they have since been living in a disused schoolhouse, a one-roomed building; whether Mr. Collins has made several applications for the return of his original residence and for compensation for the loss entailed by him as a result of the commandeering of it by the military; whether any notice has been taken of these applications, and whether he will state how soon these premises will be restored and compensation paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to 1892 fees at varying rates were chargeable in ordinary and Model National Schools.  Under the Irish Education Act of 1892 provision was made for the abolition of school fees in all schools in which the average annual fee collected was less than 6/- per pupil.  Where the sum collected was in excess of 6/- per pupil per annum the amount chargeable in these schools was limited to an average annual amount per pupil (3 to 15 years of age) represented by the excess over 6/- per pupil.</P>
      <P>Where fees are charged the teachers in the schools get the benefit of the money collected.  The number of schools, however, in which fees are now chargeable is very small.  It is open to the principal teacher of such a school to admit a number of the pupils free.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether it is with the sanction or approval of his Department or at his direction that the Urban District Council of Dun Laoghaire have served notices to quit on 483 of their tenants of dwellings; if he is aware that the Council have already obtained ejectment decrees from the District Court against some of their tenants; if he is further aware that the Council are seeking both to increase the tenants' rents and transfer the entire liability of rates to the tenants, and whether he will cause a sworn inquiry to be held into the management by the Urban District Council of Dun Laoghaire <Col N="807" /> of the working class dwellings provided by them under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, 1899-1921.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the Dun Laoghaire Urban District Council have taken legal proceedings against the tenants of the houses provided by the Council under the Housing of the Working Classes (Ireland) Acts, 1890 to 1921, in connection with the Council's proposal to revise the rents of the houses, and the proceedings form the subject of an appeal to the Circuit Court.  My approval is not required in the matter of these proceedings, as the management of houses provided under those Acts is vested in the local authority concerned.  It appears from a report made by the Council's accountant in respect of the financial year ended 31st March, 1925, that the rents collected during that year in respect of the 483 houses in question amounted to £4,600, while the loan charges, administration and maintenance costs and rates not collectable totalled over £6,800, involving a loss to the ratepayers in the district of over £2,200 for that year.  It would seem unjust for the Council to permit the ratepayers to be saddled with this annual loss of over £2,200 in respect of the artisans' dwellings, while the tenants of the houses enjoy an unrated tenancy at, in some instances, so low a rent as 1/9 per week.</P>
      <P>In regard to the latter part of the question, I do not consider there is any necessity for a sworn inquiry.  It is understood that the Council made every effort to reach an amicable settlement with the tenants before having recourse to legal action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Part 1 of the Weeds and Agricultural Seeds (Ireland) Act, 1909, is an adoptive measure, and cannot be enforced without the consent of the county council.  This consent has not been given in a number of counties. The enforcement of the Act was necessarily somewhat in abeyance during during recent years, but regular inspection was resumed in certain counties in 1923 and 1924.  I am not aware that there is any foundation for the statement in the concluding portion of the question.  That is to say, fields near roads are attended to, and others are not.  During the present year the Act will be administered in all counties where it has been adopted, and there is every reason to anticipate general compliance with its provisions, especially as the cutting of weeds has now <Col N="810" /> become a normal seasonal operation with the majority of good farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative; that is to say, no income tax has been received from the British Treasury in respect of the dividends paid by Messrs. Arthur Guinness, Son &amp; Co., Ltd., to their shareholders.  The company is assessed direct to Saorstát income tax (subject to double taxation relief) in accordance with the provisions of Section 12, sub-section (4) of the Finance Act, 1923.  It is registered and controlled in Great Britain, and I am advised that it is not entitled to deduct Saorstát Eireann income from its dividends.  In fact, no such deduction is made by the company.  In these circumstances the shareholders are not entitled to claim repayment of any portion of the Saorstát income tax paid by the company.</P>

As a result of the evidence presented to them at the hearing of the case and otherwise, the Committee found that the applicant and the other members of the family were not dependent upon the deceased, who was not the eldest member of the family as the Deputy states; and having regard to their terms of reference the Committee were unable to make a recommendation for the payment of compensation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the Deputy's questions about the forthcoming clerical examination together.</P>
      <P>No statement has at any time been made that the fee for this examination would be 5/-.  A fee of this amount was charged in the last clerical examination, but the competition was for ex-Army men, most of whom were out of employment, whereas the candidates for the forthcoming examination are nearly all in Government employment. The fee of £1 is the appropriate fee having regard to the charges fixed for other examinations, and it is not proposed now to amend the regulations already made on the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to the amount of temporary and fluctuating work necessary at present in many departments, it is not <Col N="819" /> possible to state the number of permanent posts vacant for clerical officers or the numbers of such posts at present held by temporary officers.</P>
    <P>Temporary clerks failing for any reason to qualify at the forthcoming examination will be retained on a temporary footing as long as there is work for which their services are required, but they will be liable to replacement by successful candidates in such open competitions for permanent clerical posts as may be held in the future.</P>
    <P>The examination referred to is not limited to persons engaged on purely clerical duties and may be entered for by persons engaged in a temporary capacity who possess the necessary qualifications as to length of temporary service, age, etc.  Permanent writing assistants recruited by open competition will not be eligible to compete, but members of this class who were originally temporary clerks for six months or more and became writing assistants by limited competition will be eligible.</P>
    <P>Vacancies will be assigned according to the order in which the candidates appear on the successful list irrespective of sex of the candidates.  The intention is to fill permanently the number of places announced, if so many candidates qualify.</P>
    <P>The syllabus for the examination has been drawn up by the Civil Service Commission, who have full knowledge of the type of candidate who will compete, and I have no reason to think that the syllabus prescribed is not in keeping with the announced intentions referred to in the question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that is so, but I know what fees were given for similar examinations.  As a matter of fact, there were fees of 10/- before 1916 for a class of posts lower in grade than the clerical post, that is, the assistant clerk pre-war was an officer of lower grade than the clerical officer, <Col N="820" /> and the fee at that time was 10/-, so I think the fee of £1 now is moderate.</P>

    <P>The necessary Message has been received from the Governor-General. The passage of this Bill will entail expenses arising from the payment of six Assistant Under Sheriffs at the rate of £500 a year, and the wages of 80 bailiffs, the amount running to about £100 a week, some being paid at £2 and others at £1.  Half the salaries of the Assistant Under Sheriffs will be recovered from the Counties, and a certain percentage of sums leviable by warrant or decree will also be recovered.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the essential section in the Bill, and I want to repeat my opposition.  The case was made in 1923 for such a Bill that it was necessary at the time in view of the extraordinary condition of the country and the inability to enforce the ordinary law and enforce decrees by the ordinary processes.  The second Bill of 1924 was passed after six months' experience of the previous Bill.  It, again, was a temporary Bill, dealing with temporary circumstances, which gave the Minister and the officers of the courts extraordinary powers, which, in my opinion, could not be justified except in extraordinary circumstances during abnormal times.  The figures presented to Deputies by the Minister last week do not, to my mind, prove the value of this Act or, in fact, the purpose which was claimed for it.  A year ago it was reported that there were 7,000 judgments in hands, representing £170,000.  After twelve months' quietude, when the powers that the Act gave were in operation for the greater part of the time, we have still 5,712 decrees unexecuted, representing £107,000.  The difference is considerable, no doubt, but it does not seem to me that special legislation has secured what was intended, so that there is no justification for the continuance of these exceptional powers. The amounts that are owing are generally owing by small debtors, and the powers in the Act are being enforced to a disproportionate extent against small debtors.  I think the powers are too great to place in the hands of any officer of the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to go into an examination of the sections of the Bill, but, in my opinion, there is no justification for them, and the Minister has not made any case.  He gave certain <Col N="839" /> figures which show that there has been a decrease, and that there is a certain large number of judgments awaiting execution.  He has not shown us that the extraordinary powers have assisted to any great degree in executing these judgments.  The extraordinary circumstances and the abnormal state of the country, pleaded as a justification for the Bill last year, and for the Bill the previous year, cannot now be said to exist.  On these grounds I think the Act should be allowed to expire and that no further temporary legislation of this kind should be enacted.  I therefore oppose this section of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's case seems to be that because there are still a large number of decrees in the offices of the under-sheriffs the Act has failed in its purpose and we ought not to continue it.  It seems to me scarcely sound to say that because, even with all the powers which the Act gives, there remains something of an arrear problem, therefore the Act has failed and the powers should be dispensed with. The figures which I circulated to <Col N="840" /> Deputies on the Second Reading of the Bill must be read in light of the fact that five Commissioners have been functioning through the country hearing a very large number of appeals from the old County Courts and that their judgments and decisions would be passing into the hands of the under-sheriffs for execution.  I stated on the Second Reading, and I repeat now, that this matter of the execution of court judgments was never on a satisfactory basis and was never a smooth or efficient part of the machinery of administration even in the most peaceful times of British administration.</P>
      <P>The permanent proposals under this head cannot be brought forward until after the rules of court of the new judiciary system have been introduced and are in operation for some time. Therefore, I am not in a position to put before the Dáil the permanent proposals. Pending the arrival of the stage at which I can formulate such proposals, I ask for the continuance of this Act.  My own view is that the case for the continuance of the Act is abundantly demonstrated by the statistics which I circulated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:</P>
      <P>To add after sub-section (3) (h) a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A captain of a ship or boat entering any port or harbour of Saorstát Eireann carrying on board firearms, ammunition, or explosives as part of the equipment of such vessel, shall, immediately on entering such port or harbour notify the Gárda Síochána and the Customs Authorities of the presence on board of such firearms, ammunition, etc., and must satisfy these authorities that such firearms, ammunition and explosives, etc., are ordinarily part of the vessel's equipment and will be under proper control while the vessel is in harbour.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the Bill is sufficiently watertight to prevent smuggling of arms and ammunition into the Saorstát.  I think more responsibility should be thrown on the masters and owners of ships to prevent such illegal traffic.  I am satisfied that a good deal of smuggling has taken place into the Saorstát during the past two years, and is likely to continue until such time as those engaged in such traffic are made aware that it is unprofitable. The penalties also should be more drastic.  The whole responsibility as to discovering whether there are smuggled arms on a ship should not be thrown altogether on the Gárda Síochána and the Customs authorities. I have made some little study in searching a ship and I know how difficult it is.  If people in collusion with others inside the Saorstát have arms concealed in a ship it is very difficult for the Customs authorities or the Gárda Síochána to locate them.  I think that we should throw the responsibility over on the <Col N="842" /> owners of the vessels, or the master of the ship, to notify the authorities when he enters the port of his having a certain quantity of such arms or ammunition as equipment, and he should also satisfy the authorities that this equipment is under proper control while it is in the harbour.  Consequently I beg to move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the amendment is necessary, and I am not quite clear as to the Deputy's intention in moving it.  If the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the arms carried on a vessel as part of the equipment should not be brought ashore, I think that the Bill as it stands and as drafted, covers that. But the Deputy's amendment would apply to a vessel which anchored in a harbour owing to stress of weather and which would proceed to sea without discharging anything.  The amendment does not provide that failure to take the steps set out therein would constitute an offence under the Act. It is not considered desirable, and I have looked rather carefully into the matter, to add at all to the formalities to be complied with by ships' masters using the ports of the State, and the Deputy's amendment would appear to impose an unnecessary formality.  Section 2, sub-section (3), paragraph (e) exempts from the provisions of the Bill the possession of a firearm or ammunition on board a ship as part of the equipment of the ship.  That would appear to make it clear that the exemption ceases once the firearm is removed from aboard.  But to put that matter beyond any doubt I can and will give consideration to the adding to the sub-section mentioned the words &ldquo;so long as the firearm or ammunition is not brought ashore at any place in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  I would undertake to make an addition of that kind to the Bill on the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the intention to ensure that firearms be not smuggled in the guise of having them on board as merely part of the equipment of the ship, the powers vested by law in officers of Customs and Excise, if exercised to the full, ought to be adequate to effect that purpose, and having considered the matter carefully and having considered <Col N="843" /> the Deputy's amendment carefully, I do not feel that we ought to attempt to add to those by any provision in this Bill.  Smuggling is primarily a Customs and Excise matter, and if the Customs and Excise officials consider their existing powers inadequate they can make representations to that effect.  My general view of the amendment is that it is inadvisable and undesirable to add harassing formalities to the duties of a ship's master or a ship's captain on touching at any of the ports of the State.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister take into consideration the fact that our coastline is practically unprotected?  During the British regime there were about 1,000 coastguards to protect the coastline against smuggling.  Now we have only the Gárda Síochána.  And no matter how desirous they may be to prevent smuggling I think it is a rather difficult duty to perform.</P>

      <P>I know the Deputy's views on smuggling, and I am not unaware of that aspect of the matter. But I think that the smuggling aspect will not be met by a section in a Bill or in an Act.  I mean that people who set out with a definite intention of smuggling arms into the State will not be deterred by anything you write into a Bill.  I believe the result of the acceptance of the Deputy's amendment, or some modification of it, would be merely to add a harassing formality to the duties of people who have no intention of defeating the law.  We have had some examples of people getting into trouble without any such intention.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he could give us a little more information about this term, &ldquo;who is subject to the supervision of the police.&rdquo;  Formerly that was a strictly technical term, but it occurs to me that a little more definition would be required for fear that some judge would say that it was not a technical term in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that there is scarcely any prospect of misunderstanding with regard to the wording of that.  It is really a well-recognised description of persons released on licence before the expiration of the term of imprisonment to which they have been sentenced.  They are under a certain duty to report periodically to the police, and the police keep a general supervision over their conduct during the unexpired term of their sentence.  If the Deputy wishes I will look further into it to see whether any substitute wording would be an improvement. But that is the description which the parliamentary draughtsman considered the correct one for persons released on licence before the expiry of the term of imprisonment.</P>

      <P>Of course, there are cases where persons have been discharged subject to coming up for judgment when called upon, and it might well be that that class of person might be considered to be under the supervision of the police unless there is a more clear definition than this.  However, having called attention to it, I am not able to say whether it is strictly <Col N="846" /> watertight or not, and I ask the Minister to give special consideration to the point.</P>

We have seen good shots at 15 or 16 years of age.  If our young men do not know anything about taking down a bird before they reach the age of 18 you will have very few game licences.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert before sub-section (8) a new sub-section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A captain of a ship or boat entering any port or harbour of Saorstát Eireann for the purpose of discharge, repairs or other business and having on board either as whole or part cargo firearms, ammunition, or explosives, shall, immediately on entering such port or harbour, report the nature of his cargo to the local Gárda Síochána and Customs Authorities.  Failure to do so will be an offence under this section and shall be punishable accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="847" /> The amendment provides merely that the captain of a ship carrying munitions of war on entering a port of the Saorstát for the purpose of discharge, repairs or other business should, immediately on entering such port or harbour, report the nature of his cargo to the local Gárda Síochána and Customs authorities.  There may be some confusion in his mind as to whether the harbour authorities or the State authorities were the persons to report to.  I think we had such a case some few months ago.  There was some confusion in the captain's mind as to the proper authority to report to.  It is quite possible that according to the captain's regulations he should report to the harbour authorities.  Those authorities may neglect to report to the proper authorities, and it may be some considerable time before such authorities would know of the nature of the cargo.  I think there should be no confusion, and I merely put down this amendment in order to have the Minister's opinion on the matter</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of this amendment, as in the case of the Deputy's other amendment, there has been contact with the Customs and Excise officials as well as with the Department of Industry and Commerce. The position at present is that the officers of Customs and Excise have full powers to prevent the master of a ship from unloading his cargo at any place on the quay or wharf other than that permitted by them and approved by them.  Before an unloading process <Col N="848" /> commences the ship's papers and cargo are carefully inspected by the officers of Customs and Excise to ascertain if it is carrying any goods the importation of which is prohibited or upon which duty must be paid on importation. These powers, already vested in the officers of Customs and Excise, are considered adequate and secure the object which the Deputy seeks to obtain by his amendment, and they are sufficient to guard against any unlawful importation of arms or any unlawful interference with arms on board a ship if they form part of the cargo.  Therefore, I say, after consultation with the Customs and Excise officials and with the Department of Industry and Commerce, I consider the Deputy's amendment unnecessary.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 6 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  In addition to the elected members and <i>ex-officio</i> members of a board of conservators the Minister shall appoint to every such board such number of additional members, not being more than one-fourth of the total number of elected and <i>ex-officio</i> members, as he shall think expedient, who shall have a vote in all matters and shall have all the powers and privileges conferred by law upon members of boards of conservators.</P>
      <P>(2)  In the appointment of additional members of a board of conservators the Minister shall have regard to the necessity for securing representation of persons dependent wholly or to a considerable degree upon fishing as a means of livelihood and representation of the public interest in the preservation and development of fisheries.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to secure that the Minister shall have the right to nominate a certain proportion of the members who constitute these boards of conservators.  Under the proposals in the Bill as it stands, the boards of conservators will be constituted, in the first case, of a number of people who own private fisheries up to a certain valuation.  In the Bill it is proposed that that valuation shall be £50.  Heretofore people who had fisheries valued at £100 or over were entitled to representation.  The second class of people who will be on the boards are those to be elected under the provisions of Rule 8.  As I see it, the constitution of these boards will be made up almost entirely, indeed I think I should say entirely, of people having an interest of a private nature in the preservation of fisheries.  I think it is advisable and essential that the Minister, representing the public interest rather than the purely private interest, should have the right to nominate a certain proportion of the members who constitute these boards.  There was a certain right which, I understand, did not work very satisfactorily, a right which it is now proposed to abolish, whereby a public board had, under certain circumstances, the power to nominate certain representatives on these boards of conservators.  The boards in future will be constituted of people who own fisheries and of members elected in accordance with Rule 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My proposal, in brief, is that the Minister should have the right to nominate up to a certain proportion, and that in exercising that nomination he should have regard to the necessity for securing the representation of people who are wholly or largely dependent for a livelihood on the fishing industry. There is no provision whereby the people who earn their living by fishing, as against those who own fisheries, would be able to get adequate representation on these boards of conservators. I ask the Minister to have regard to those people in the public interest&mdash;the people who make their living out of the fishing industry.  My amendment, too, would give the Minister an opportunity of giving representation <Col N="851" /> to voluntary associations set up for the preservation of our fisheries.  I do not see any other way except by this amendment in which they would be able to get representation on those boards of conservators.  I think the acceptance of my amendment would make for the more efficient working of those boards, and that it would tend to secure for them a greater sense of authority in their own districts.  In that way, it would lead to what I might call the development of a civic sense and a realisation of the importance of preserving the fish in the different districts.  We know the opinions which were held amongst the general public with regard to these boards of conservators in the past.  We know, too, of the difficulty they had in exercising authority and in preventing poaching.  That was largely due to the fact that the boards themselves did not possess the confidence of the public. Now, in this matter the Minister is the keeper of the public interest, and it will be his duty to see that there are people on these boards who will have an interest in the fisheries from the public point of view.  I think if he accepts the amendment he will be helping to create boards which will enjoy the confidence of the public to a far greater degree than did the old boards.  I see no reason why the Minister should not accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of nominating a certain proportion of those who will constitute the new boards is one that deserves to be fully inquired into.  It is true that under the Bill a certain section of the people interested in the fisheries will have representation. It is true, also, that fishermen holding licences will have the right to elect men to represent themselves on these boards.  If the rights of the fishermen to secure representation were interfered with in any way, the amendment, of course, would be a very good one, but that is not the case. Those who make their living out of fishing, and who hold a licence, already possess the right to elect representatives on these boards.  It is an extraordinary thing, as regards the abuses <Col N="852" /> which are committed in connection with the fishery laws, that the largest number of poachers has always been supplied from the ranks of those who are known as the people who make their living from fishing.  That is the class, more than any other class in the community, that supplies the poachers. I think the Minister knows that, too, and really it is a very extraordinary thing.  These people poach, not only in the close season, but also in the open season as much as they can.  One would imagine that they would take an active interest in helping to protect the industry, and that they would, as it were, act as river police.  They have not done that, and as far as their representatives on the boards of conservators are concerned they, too, have done very little.  A case has come to my knowledge where a conservator, a man who makes his living out of fishing, is one of the most practised and best-known poachers that there is on a certain river.</P>
      <P>I think when the Bill provides that those who make their living out of fishing will have representation on the boards of conservators, in proportion to their strength, that the Bill goes far enough, except perhaps that some useful purpose might be served by putting men on these boards such as the representatives of clubs who would be animated by a genuine desire to preserve and develop the fishing industry. That is the only object that I see the amendment could serve, namely, that the representatives of anglers' clubs and associations of that kind should be afforded an opportunity of getting representation on these boards.  As regards those who make their living out of fishing they have the right already, and as far as they are concerned I do not see any need for this amendment.</P>

The Bill provides already for the election of those boards; first of all by persons interested in the fisheries, including persons who earn their living by fishing and, secondly, it provides for certain representation for the owners of the fisheries.  There are in the Saorstát altogether 230 <Col N="853" /> elected conservators.  Under the provisions of the Bill we will have sixty-three of these who will represent the owners of private fishery rights.  That is to say, that the elected conservators will be four to one, to the ex-officios. I do not see that any useful purpose would be served by my reserving to myself the right of nomination to the boards.  The Bill gives me sufficient authority which has not been held before by my predecessor or myself or by the Department of Agriculture or by the inspectors of fisheries, and more powers and authority over these boards than heretofore.  If, as I anticipate, it is a question of seeing that a fair show was given to the preservation of trout in certain districts, I have sufficient powers under the Bill to see to that, and it is my intention to see to it.  I am providing, under the Bill, more money for those boards so that they can exercise their functions more efficiently.  It will be my duty to see that the increased money is well spent and it is my duty to see that they will conserve all the fisheries that come under their control in the districts, whether trout or salmon.  I am, therefore, opposed to this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister inform us not merely what the number of elected persons and representative owners are, but who are the electors of the elected persons?  Is it not a fact that a very considerable proportion of the elected are people who are more or less hand and glove with, and are subject in some way to, the owners of the private fisheries and, therefore, they are not merely representative boards?  It occurred to me, while Deputy Gorey was speaking, that the evil he was deploring is caused by lack of confidence in the ruling body.  And it is a case of cause and effect that appears right through history, as regards all laws dealing with the preservation of fisheries and game and the like.  If you have a body, on the one hand, that seems to be the preserve of a small section, governed and controlled by a small section, and also people living by the exercise of certain <Col N="854" /> fishery rights or game rights, as the case may be, in such a case you will have the governing authority, and the public generally at loggerheads, one with the other.  It is the absence of any sense of confidence in the governing authority, on the part of the interested public outside, that leads to the conflict of interest and an apparent antagonism.</P>
      <P>I would urge that it is very important that conservators should be recognised as the authority exercising their jurisdiction in the interest of those people who are earning their living by the industry, as well as those people who are controlling the industry in the interest of sport, and it is the apparent conflict of interest, whether there is a real conflict or not I do not know, between the board of conservators and the people earning their living that leads to the breaches of law that Deputy Gorey and others deplore.</P>
      <P>I daresay that further discussion of further amendments will raise the question in more definite form, but it seems to me that a comparison between the figures of those elected and those on the board by virtue of the ownership of the fisheries does not represent the facts of the case, and unless there is a change made in the electorate you are going to have a continuance of the same system, and the persons elected will rather represent a particular class of interest, and will not obtain the confidence of the remainder of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister has taken up the attitude of opposing the principle embodied in the amendment, because it is quite obviously desirable that all the interests affected by the fisheries laws shall have confidence in the board of conservators, and that we should not perpetuate what has been, and what is up to now the system&mdash;the system which rather suggests the old landlord and tenant idea.  The fight and the struggle that took place as regards the land has its parallel in the basis of the ownership and control of the fisheries.  And unless people generally have confidence in the administration, as they have not up to now, the depredations and the poaching, <Col N="855" /> and the like of which Deputy Gorey spoke, are not likely to be removed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised that the Minister cannot see his way to accept this amendment, because to my mind it is the right sort of amendment, which would secure for him and the nation what we are all so desirous of bringing about, that is the development of the fisheries proper. As Deputy Johnson has said, the boards of conservators that have been elected for the various areas for some time past have not the confidence of the people because of their personnel. At least a great majority of the people represented on them are regarded by the ordinary people depending upon fishing for a livelihood in various areas of the country in the same way as landlords were as regards the land.  So far as I know, all over the country in regard to the board of conservators, there is a vicious circle at work.  On the one side you have the representatives of the net-fishing and on the other side you have the representatives of the rod-fishing. They are antagonistic to one another. No one can deny that.  The Minister is aware of it, and his Department is aware of it as well, and unless you can get somebody who is not so deeply interested and so deeply affected as these two elements on the board of conservators, that vicious circle will be continued. If the fisheries are to be developed properly it is absolutely essential that the Minister should accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>I ask him to reconsider his recent statement made in this connection.  He said he is placing more money at the disposal of those boards, but he is doing it at the expense of the ratepayers, to some extent, at all events, not to the full extent perhaps.  To my mind, people other than those engaged in fishing, either in the rod or the net fisheries, are entitled to representation on the board, if the Minister finds that there is a greater interest taken in fisheries in various parts of the country, with the result that you will have greater developments.</P>

      <P>I hope that the Minister will not take Deputy Corish's description of a board of conservators as being divided between rod and net interests as a description applying to boards all over the country.  It may be a description of the Wexford boards, but it is not a true description of the board of which I have been a member for fifteen years.  In all these boards, so far as I know, there are a considerable number of members who are not identified closely with other interests. They have sense enough to see that the development of the net interests helps to support the board, and that they could not carry on otherwise. As regards the substantive matter of the amendment, I do not object to it very strongly.  I have been approached by various representatives of boards of conservators and others, and asked to put down amendments, but I take the view that in the first two sections the Minister has done his best to hold the balance evenly.  I believe that we should take the Bill as it stands.  I believe that the Minister is trying to be fair to every interest, and I refuse to put down amendments on these two sections, but I shall put down amendments later on in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think that there is something to be said in favour of the amendment.  If we wish to get away from the old system, if we wish to encourage the industry, I agree with Deputy Johnson that we must get away from the old system of landlord and tenant.  We must have boards of conservators in which the fishermen would have confidence and on which they would be represented.  I know that in the South and in the port of Cork we have not a system which we would like to see in operation.  I hope, however, that it will come about now as a result of this Bill and the coming elections, and that we will have a better system.  We have had war between fisherman and the conservators, and we had fisherman shot a few years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had an antagonistic feeling against the conservators and their system.  The men are in open rebellion against the conservators, and I think that they take every advantage they can to get over the drastic regulations <Col N="857" /> of the conservators.  They have drift and other nets.  Here is one of the regulations.  If a body of fishermen go out to fish outside the mouth of the harbour they are not allowed to carry their net in a boat through the harbour.  They must take it all over the country by a circuitous journey of, perhaps, from fifteen to twenty miles from their homes to get to the mouth of the harbour which they could reach by boat within two miles.  Even if the net is dry when they are proceeding to the harbour, severe penalties are inflicted on these unfortunate men.  There are many other drastic regulations enforced by the conservators, but there is no necessity for them. We know that the fishermen are satisfied to help the conservators provided they feel that they have some interest in the fishermen.  I hope that as a result of this Bill and of the coming elections a better state of affairs will exist between them.</P>

      <P>I am at a loss to understand Deputy Hennessy's argument. The conservators are appointed to enforce the law.  Does Deputy Hennessy suggest that they are not enforcing the law?  They cannot alter the law.  Deputy Hennessy can alter it if there is hardship inflicted, but until the law is amended conservators must carry it out.  The adoption of Deputy O'Connell's amendment would leave the conservators in the same position, except, judging by the arguments I have heard, you would have on every board of conservators a body chosen by the Minister who would, apparently, argue against the enforcement of the code of laws which the Minister would administer.</P>

      <P>I am sorry if I misrepresented Deputy O'Connell, but that would be the logical conclusion of the arguments used by other Deputies. I do not say that it is Deputy O'Connell's argument, but the argument is that the law is wrong, that it should be enforced by other elements or should not be enforced at all.  That is in part the argument which we have heard <Col N="858" /> from Deputy Johnson and Deputy Corish, and I hope I have not misinterpreted Deputy Hennessy.  I do not see if that is the case that the acceptance of this amendment would make for the easier working of the boards of conservators or for the more efficient administration of the law.</P>

      <P>My object, and I take it it would be the object of every Deputy in this House interested in the matter, is to get as good a board of conservators as it is possible to get.  We are all agreed on that.  The way the Minister gets the new board is that you have, first, the <i>ex-officio</i> members who own the fisheries, and then you have those elected by the licence holders.  I am anxious to have another element introduced, not to argue against the enforcement of the law.  I hope that I did not at any time say anything which would lead anyone to think that that was the object in the amendment.  My object is to introduce an element into the boards of conservators which would be mainly interested in the development of the fisheries from a public point of view, rather than from the point of view of the owners or others immediately interested.  As I see it, the board of conservators is supposed to be a board which will conserve, and take steps to conserve, all fisheries in <Col N="859" /> the district, but it gives no representation to that large class of people interested in trout fishing.  The Minister said that he is taking steps in the Bill to give them an interest in the preservation of fisheries, but he did not say exactly where or how.  He did not make that point clear.</P>
      <P>I cannot find that they will have any means of getting representation on this board, which is supposed to be a board responsible for the preservation of all the fisheries, and not salmon fisheries alone.  They are not asked to pay licences for fishing, and therefore, they will have no vote.  They cannot exercise any influence on the election of the board of conservators, and it is that class of people, largely, whom I would be glad the Minister would look to when getting his nominees for the board.  It would create a greater sense of authority and confidence if it were known that the Minister had in the public interest nominated a certain number of people to look after the preservation of fisheries in a board national way, rather than from the point of view of the individual members of the Board.  I can only repeat what Deputy Johnson said in reply to Deputy Gorey, that the very fact that those fishermen turned poachers goes to show how little confidence they had in the Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  They believed that the board was not acting in the public interests, but that its members were acting in their own selfish interests.  I think, although I do not stress that point, further than the necessity of appointing men who would have a public interest in the fisheries, if it were seen that these men who derive their living mainly from fisheries got adequate representation on the board it would be all for the good, and it would be for the Minister to see when the elections are over how the board is constituted and to look at the interests the members represent. It will be for him to choose the class of men he would appoint.  If he considers&mdash;it is for him to say&mdash;that the fishermen had adequate representation <Col N="860" /> on the board, then, he will not put on more of that particular class.  It will be entirely in his own hands.  He certainly has not convinced me that this amendment would not be a good one in the interests of the fisheries as a whole.  I think it would.  He has given no argument to show that it would not. In my opinion, he should reconsider his attitude in the matter, and give himself the power which he agrees is necessary, as he says he is taking larger powers in this Bill to have control over these boards of conservators.  That is true to a limited extent, but it does not seem to be very practicable in some cases. I think if he had the power which this amendment would give&mdash;to put his nominees on the boards of conservators&mdash;it would increase confidence in the members of the board.</P>

Deputy O'Connell referred to the want of confidence on the part of the people in the conservators, and for that reason they do wrong, and Deputy Hennessy talked about some friends of his, fishermen at the mouth of the Lee.

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not, perhaps, as well able to regulate my language as you would wish, but I am trying to do my best.  Every fisherman in the villages along the different stretches of the river wants the law enforced below.  Even among the crews of fishermen there is the utmost jealousy, and rows occur amongst them even in the same village, all because the law is enforced.  None of them wants the law enforced where he is concerned.  The amendment would be ideal if everyone was of a proper frame of mind, but I have yet to meet the fisherman who is out to make a living who has the proper frame of mind.  There is scarcely a fisherman worth his salt who does not know when fish are passing, and it would take the National Army to keep the fishermen out of their boats when a shoal of fish is passing in the river. They will be out whether it is legal or not, whether it is the close weekly season or the open weekly season.  It is all nonsense to talk about want of confidence in the conservators, and a certain state of things in one river and another state of affairs on another river.  I only hope that the reduction from £100 to £50 will not have any disastrous results.  Anyone who knows anything about fishing knows that some of our best fisheries are those controlled by the conservators.  I have as much objection to these conservators as anyone else, and for sufficient reason, which I will not go into now. On the Blackwater, where that class of board might be said to predominate, is one of the most valuable fisheries in Ireland.  Where the ordinary fisherman rules, and there are representatives of the men on the board of conservators, the reverse is the case.  Some of our worst rivers are where the rank <Col N="862" /> and file have representation, or are in the majority on the Board.  That is my experience.</P>

      <P>That is the experience. Fish have been, practically speaking, almost exterminated from some of the rivers under this class of management. If you want an extension of that system of depriving rivers of fish, and if you want our fisheries destroyed, then by all means accept the amendment. If Deputy O'Connell would strike out that portion of his amendment touching on the representation of persons dependent upon fishing as a means of livelihood, and would suggest instead the nomination by the Minister of men who would act fearlessly&mdash;and they would want to act fearlessly in this matter&mdash;it would I think, be more satisfactory.  If the amendment were so framed as to give power to people other than those actually engaged in the trade or earning their living by fishing, I could quite understand it, and I believe the amendment in that form would be acceptable.  There is no use in putting anybody on a board of conservators who will not uphold the law and see that it is strictly enforced. And again, the law should not be enforced for one village or in respect to one class of fisherman, but its application should be general.</P>

There is confidence that the boards of conservators will do nothing to anybody who is caught, and there is confidence that breakers of the law will not be punished under the present boards of conservators.  As a matter of fact, it is too much confidence they <Col N="863" /> have that nothing will happen.  Reference has also been made to the net men being in opposition to the cot men, and <i>vice versa.</i>  That is not true.  The net men are in opposition only to net men, and rod men in the upper reaches are in opposition to the whole lot.  I would ask the Minister, if he is going to consider this amendment, to strike out that portion touching upon representation of interests concerned and people making a living out of fishing.  That should be excluded absolutely.  Let some people who are interested in the national development of fisheries be put on, on condition only that they will recognise the law and strictly enforce it.</P>

      <P>I am placing my case rather impartially before the House.  When I say there has been an open revulsion against conservators in Cork for a number of years, I am saying what is true.  Why is that?  It is simply because the fishermen have no confidence in the conservators, especially on the Lee.  If it is right in Deputy Gorey's country, or if it is right in Dublin Bay or any bay in the Saorstát, to use one particular net having a special mesh, why is that not permitted in Cork?  Why are they in peril-of their lives while engaged at fishing down there?  Why have they been fired upon for using these nets?  The fishermen have no confidence in the conservators, who are using drastic by-laws in their own interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to Deputy Gorey that if he reads this section carefully and takes into account its phraseology, he will be bound to come to the conclusion it is just the sort of proposal he would like to have made law. The question really is as to whether the present boards of conservators, the present system of election and constitution, are satisfactory.  It is also a question whether, as Deputy Gorey <Col N="864" /> rather regrets, there should be a tendency to depart from the time when the only people who had authority over such matters as fish and game were landlords, and they exercised their authority purely in their own private interest, in the interest of sport and not in the communal interest. If that is Deputy Gorey's desire, then he will oppose this amendment.  I think it is recognised in the 1848 Act that there were public rights and public interests apart from the purely private fisherman's interest whether he be a rod fisherman or the owner of a fishery.  The question really is whether public interest ought to be represented on the board of conservators, or whether it must be looked after and safeguarded solely by the Minister. That is really the issue&mdash;whether there are to be elected representatives of the public, interested in fishery conservation as a whole and as a national asset, or whether that function should be exercised by the Minister himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment suggests that the Minister shall have power to appoint additional members.  As regards the nomination of associations, I pointed out, on an amendment to another Bill, that that is hardly feasible under such an enactment as you are dealing with. The suggestion now is that the Minister should have the power to appoint certain additional members and it is sought to impose on him the obligation that, in appointing those additional members, he shall have regard to the constitution of the board and the necessity for securing the representation of fishing interests, people who get their livelihood, if such are not already represented.  The Minister shall also have regard to the representation of public interests in the preservation and development of fisheries.  He shall make the selection as apart from the personal private interests of fishery owners and the interests of sportsmen, and he shall endeavour to work for the general preservation of fish and the development of fisheries.  Surely that is quite a reasonable thing, and surely it is in accord with Deputy Gorey's desire and in accord with the changed relations between the people and the fishery owners?  It is surprising that <Col N="865" /> so simple a proposition as this was not readily accepted and even embodied in the Bill before it came to us.  I think if the Minister had the opportunity of codifying the law as he originally intended, he would have made some change in the constitution of the boards of conservators.  This is not a radical change.  It is simply an attempt to introduce representatives of the public interests into the development of fisheries, as distinct from the representatives of purely private interests.</P>

There is a distinct pointer there as to the class of interests the Minister is asked to give representation to.  &ldquo;In the appointment of additional members ... the Minister shall have regard to the necessity of securing representation of persons dependent wholly or to a considerable degree upon fishing as a means of livelihood. ...&rdquo;  I do object to the words indicating the persons whom the Deputy would like to see the Minister giving representation to.  If it read like this: &ldquo;In the appointment of additional members of a board of conservators the Minister shall have regard to the necessity for the representation of the public interest in the preservation and development of fisheries,&rdquo; I would be quite satisfied, and I am sure the Minister would accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly object to the pointer in the middle of the paragraph.  All my objection is based on that.  When people talk about the development of fisheries, they should know how fisheries have been developed in other countries, and what has happened in the development of the Scotch and the English fisheries.  They were useless a few years ago; they were certainly useless ten years ago in England.  They have been taken up by their owners and clubs, and developed into valuable properties.  At the moment the Scotch fisheries are the most valuable fisheries in these islands, at least, and the reason of that is that they were in the hands of private owners.  Here our fisheries were in everybody's hands, and their <Col N="866" /> development was not attended to at all, except in a few rivers.  For my part, I would be inclined to agree to the amendment if the middle portion were deleted.  That pointer I object to.</P>

      <P>It is quite possible, and it will be seen later if Section 8 is not altered, that this particular class of men will have a very poor chance of getting any representation at all.  Unless Deputy Gorey says that he should have no representation he should not object to this amendment, because this is merely put in to ensure that he shall have representation. In practice it will work out that a number of people will be elected.  The Minister has the right to nominate a certain number of people, if this amendment is carried.  The net effect of the amendment is this, that people who earn their livelihood will have some representation.  If they have it already by election, the Minister is not asked to nominate more people for that interest.  He will then have regard entirely for the representation of the public interests, and I cannot see why Deputy Gorey should have any objection to that particular point. There is no question of giving them over-representation, and I take it that is what Deputy Gorey fears.  The intention only is that they should have some representation on such a board, that they should have adequate representation, adequate in the opinion of <Col N="867" /> the Minister.  If they have adequate representation already the Minister will seek his nominees from some other class of people interested in the public development of fisheries.  The owners, as has been pointed out, are <i>ex-officio</i> members, apart from election altogether. In the election, the class of people who will come forward will be mainly those who have what I might call a private interest in the salmon fishing.</P>

      <P>In spite of all that has been said, I am not yet convinced that there is any necessity for this amendment, and I am certainly not convinced that it is desirable.  Deputy Corish attempted to put me in the position of being opposed to fishery development if I were opposed to this amendment, and Deputy O'Connell in a lesser degree attempted to do the same.  It is because I believe that it is in the best interests of fishery protection that I am opposed to this amendment.  Great play has been made about a lack of confidence in the boards of conservators.  There may have been a lack of confidence, but I believe that this Bill, as it stands, is going to dissipate that lack of confidence and tend towards creating boards in which there will be confidence in the future.  At any rate, if the board is not doing its work under this Bill, I have power to dissolve that board if it is unsatisfactory.  The analogy between them and the landlord and the tenant is absolutely absurd.</P>

It may be very flattering to me&mdash;it was possibly intended as such&mdash;to say that my nominees would have more confidence than the elected members and the <i>ex-officio</i> members.  I do not feel that it would create more confidence in the members if I were to plank in something like 25 per cent. of the number of members on the existing board.  I am still opposed to this.</P>

      <P>Then there are differences, I take it, in the interests between <i>ex-officio</i> members who are the owners of the fisheries and the elected members.  They apparently meet on the boards, and are really either harmonious or they create a dog-fight at every meeting.  The very fact that there are divergent interests or that they are appointed by a different method does not, I take it, necessarily involve a dog-fight at every meeting.  The Minister thinks that if a third section came in, somebody representing neither of these two private and peculiar interests but the public, that they would inevitably create dog-fights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose under certain circumstances even the present boards might constitute themselves into a dog-fight, so that that portion of the argument on which the Minister seems to rely, does not hold very much water.  It may, and no doubt it has been held, whenever there has been a devolution of authority from the man at the top&mdash;in the old days it was the landlords who had the power through the Grand Juries, and the argument was used in the same way&mdash;if you popularise in any way these public authorities that you are going to degrade and generally make them vulgar and of no popular value.  The Minister's arguments, though he dissents from the conclusion, leads me to the conclusion that he thinks the single interest would be best, only that he dare not nominate it in this Bill&mdash;that the owner's interest should be the real board of conservators.  If we are going to depart from that single interest, then surely we should have some representatives of the wider public interest on those boards.  If the districts had been co-terminous with the county councils, or any local governing authority, I would have preferred <Col N="870" /> that these authorities should nominate the representatives on these boards, assuming, as a matter of fact, that they had an interest in the preservation of fisheries as a public benefit.  But the districts are not co-terminous, and this, in my opinion, is probably the best way to secure that public representation. I hope the Minister is adhering to his assurance that throughout the discussion of this Bill he will not bring any pressure to bear on any section of the House, and I take it that every other section of the House is in the same position&mdash;is going to vote on the merits of the particular amendments put forward.  I think the issue raised by the amendment is one of prime importance and affects the question of whether we are to recede from the introduction of a public authority over such interests as fisheries&mdash;whether we are to go back or maintain the view that the private and personal interests are to have control of a public service.</P>

    <P>Section 6 of the Fisheries (Ireland) Act, 1848, shall be construed and have effect as if the words &ldquo;fifty pounds yearly or upwards&rdquo; were substituted therein for the words &ldquo;one hundred pounds yearly or upwards.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;&ldquo;To delete the section.&rdquo;  I think justification is required before the Dáil be asked to alter the qualification, which allows an owner to become an <i>ex-officio</i> member of a board of conservators, from £100 to £50.  At present an owner or occupier of a fishery rated at £100 is entitled to be an <i>ex-officio</i> member of a board of conservators.  The purpose of the section is to reduce that qualification to £50, which will, of course, have the effect of increasing the number of <i>ex-officio</i> members of these boards, so that the ideal which I hinted at as being the Minister's ideal, is a little nearer accomplishment.  There is bigger chance of a majority of the boards being <i>ex-officio</i> members&mdash;that is owners&mdash;than hitherto prevailed.  The Dáil has decided not to allow the Minister to appoint additional members.  As I understood from the Minister's statement some time ago, there will be 230 elected members and 63 representative owners <i>ex-officio</i> members.  Under this Bill I am not able to compute what the change may be in the numbers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to say, the <i>ex-officio</i> members will be more than doubled under the new provision.  Of course, that is quite retrogressive.  I do not think we should begin now to put men in responsible representative positions merely by virtue of their possession of property, and without any other factor or qualification whatever. Merely because of their possession of property we are going to give them responsible positions on an administrative authority.  One would have thought that we had got away from all that in this year of grace, and that it would not have been proposed by the Minister <Col N="872" /> for Fisheries, with his record as a democrat, to increase by more than one hundred per cent. the number of persons on a representative authority, merely by virtue of the fact that they own fisheries.  That would require a great deal of justification, and I will be interested in the kind of justification that the Minister is going to put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I should thank Deputy Johnson for his very nice reference to my record as a democrat.  I do not hold that this section is retrogressive. It is not because of their possession of property merely.  The real cause is that these people will be obviously more interested in fishery preservation.  I hold that it is really only doing the barest justice to persons who are paying the greatest amount of money for fishery preservation that they should have that representation on these boards.  As Deputy Johnson said, the qualification heretofore for becoming an <i>ex-officio</i> member of a board was to own a private fishery valued at £100 or over. The number of persons so qualified was 29.  There used to be a rather large number of these <i>ex-officio</i> members of these boards, when certain Justices of the Peace, who were riparian owners and licence owners, were <i>ex-officio</i> members. These have disappeared through the operation of the Saorstát, and I do not believe that the increased number of <i>ex-officios</i>, who own private fisheries, will amount in all to the number of <i>ex-officios</i> there were before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand from the Minister that he thinks it is advisable to replace J.P.'s, who at least had some kind of claim to popular representation, by adding to the number of fishery owners?  That appears to be the Minister's view.  I do not think it is sufficient.  I think that the reduction of the qualification is retrograde, because it is, in fact, placing power in the hands of owners merely by virtue of ownership.  The Minister says it is because they pay a greater sum&mdash; I take it to be in rates&mdash;than those who are not owners of fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There again, I ask is it to be the <Col N="873" /> policy of the Dáil to revert to the time when ownership alone secured representation on public authoritative boards?  The assumption that that ownership creates an interest in the preservation of fisheries may be a fair assumption, but it may create an interest without creating any judgment, and without creating any ability. It is merely power by virtue of ownership. The same argument was always used by the landlords, that they were the people to look after the best interests of agriculture, because they had the greatest interest in the country. Of course the country turned that idea down completely, and the tendency of the times has been rather to dissent from the feudal notion that ownership of property, whether of fisheries or of lands, is better kept in very few hands and leave these few people to control and direct it.</P>
    <P>This proposition, then, to increase the number of people who by virtue, purely, of ownership, are entitled to representation, is, I think, a retrograde move, and I was hoping that the Minister would be able to make a case for the reduction, but he has not yet made a case.  I think that Deputy Gorey, for other reasons altogether, doubted the wisdom of reducing the qualifications. I suppose on this occasion at any rate, we shall be able to secure Deputy Gorey's support in the deletion of the section which makes a change from £100 to £50 as a qualification for <i>ex-officio</i> representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only to repeat that it is not a case of ownership; it is because of the fact that it is obvious that they will be more interested than the ordinary person in fishery preservation. Even if it is from their own selfish interests they will at least have considerable interest in the enforcement of the law.  Deputy Johnson referred to the J.P. having some claims to popular support.  That may be.  In fact they were not a satisfactory type of conservator.  That was the experience of the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fact.  The position was that a man holding the Commission of the Peace and owning property abutting on the river took out a salmon licence and was entitled to be an <i>ex-officio</i> member.  In order to illustrate what the Minister says about jobs, I wish to say that I knew at one time of an election for the secretary to a board of conservators, and the candidates, or somebody on their behalf, found money to license, I think, about forty men to qualify on one side and about thirty on the other side. This was the class of <i>ex-officio</i> conservator we had under the old system, and it is time to do away with it.  All that can be said in favour of this original clause&mdash;and there is a good deal to be said for it&mdash;is that the people who will be on that board will have a real interest in the fisheries.  After all, it is not a question of who is the conservator.  It simply is, is he interested in enforcing the law?  Is the law good enough in the first instance? The whole thing hinges on that.  Is the law likely to be enforced?  The people likely to enforce it, in my opinion, are the people who have a direct interest in the fishery.  This whole question hinges on the law.  Is the law sound and sufficient to develop the fisheries and to protect the fishery interests?  If it is not, get better law, and if it is good law, get people on the board who will enforce it.  Again. I say it is entirely a question of enforcing the law, and if they have not the law to enforce, they cannot enforce it.  I object on principle to have any private ownership of fisheries.  I said before that the State should own the fisheries, and the fisheries should be developed as a national asset.  I put up that as a proposition at a conference composed of conservators, but it was not accepted.  I was in a minority. But I am trying to make the best of what we have got, and I say it is the people directly interested who are the best to enforce the law.</P>

      <P>I am quite sure he did not.  As a matter of fact, we would be anxious to wipe out the <i>ex-officio</i> element altogether, because the principle is not a sound one, and the chief reason that this amendment is put down is that the Bill, as it stands, increases the <i>ex-officio</i> representation. Now, as I say, I think the principle of appointing <i>ex-officio</i> members, purely on the assumption that because they own property they are therefore more interested in the public development of fisheries than others would be, is not a sound one.  It has been said that they would take more interest than the ordinary person in the development of fisheries.  If that is so, they are the class of person who will come up for election, and if they are the right persons in the eyes of the voters, they are the persons who would be elected.  But it is not open to the Minister, I think, to say of necessity that the man who holds property is the person who is most interested in the public development of fisheries, or that he is a person who has the ability and knowledge and experience to devote to the work which the conservator will have to perform.  I think that increasing the <i>ex-officio</i> members in this way and the reduction of the valuation of the fishery in order to bring in more of this class of person, is not sound in principle, and that it should not be accepted by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I think that in all fairness, fishery owners should get representation. They pay rates on their fisheries as distinct from their ordinary rates&mdash;from the rates on their ordinary holdings, or any other property they might have.  The salmon-rod licence payer, and the drift-net licence payer, have representation because they pay their licence duty.  Why, then, distinguish between these payers and the owners who pay rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister surely is astray.  The licence holder has representation <Col N="876" /> because he pays a licence duty&mdash;that is to say, you are making the holding of a licence a qualification to be a voter.  Surely that is a very different thing from saying because I hold a licence I am <i>ex-officio</i> a conservator. The owner may not live in the country at all, he may not live in the district at all, he may be an absentee landlord, but he is entitled, <i>ex-officio</i>, under this proposal to be a conservator. That is the proposal, and you are proposing to increase the number of possible absentee landlords by 100 per cent. or rather more&mdash;from 29 to 63. There were possibilities, under the old qualification, of having 29 such persons. Now the Minister proposes to make that possibility 63.  I noticed Deputy Good looking very earnestly and very seriously at the Minister when he was saying &ldquo;Because these people pay rates they are entitled, <i>ex-officio</i>, to be members of these boards.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is.  They are representing all the fishery owners; that is the idea.  The original idea was that the provision was for persons of £100 valuation and over, and this number would represent all fishery owners, the lesser men as well as themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we are getting along nicely.  Any such people who have property of a valuation less than £50 are not to have any representation as owners of fisheries; they are not even allowed to vote for a representative on a board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>But that is what is embodied in this proposal.  If a person happens to be an owner of a fishery of a valuation of £50, he is to be deemed to be a representative of owners who have valuations less than £50, not because he has more intelligence, not because he has a keener interest, not because he has greater experience of the fisheries and their needs, but because he owns a fishery of a valuation <Col N="877" /> of more than £50.  The whole principle is utterly retrograde.  To remove the £100 valuation as a qualification for membership would be bad enough, but when we are asked to grant double the number by reducing the valuation by £50, surely we are stepping a long way to the rear.  Then, to call it representation of the fishery owners is more amusing still.</P>
      <P>As I said, Deputy Good was looking very earnestly and seriously and I am sure he took a mental note of the Minister's argument.  He thought that when any question of representation on public bodies comes forward, on the basis of property ownership and rateable value, he would be able to claim the Minister's support if he ever says that because a man pays £100 in rates or £200 in rates, or any sum you like to fix, it should give him the right to be an <i>ex-officio</i> member of a public authority, to represent the smaller people, the common herd, the people who have a smaller rateable value.  The argument of the Minister, in justification of this proposal, will land him in a very difficult position some day, I am sure.  He will have to turn his back upon his present attitude and realise that his earlier love was much more deserving of support and continued affection.  I ask the Dáil to delete this section and not to increase the number of <i>ex-officio</i> members of boards of conservators merely because they own property to the value of £50 a year.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson, in this connection, must have lost sight of the things that have been happening. He must have lost sight of the operations of the recent Land Act, which purposes to buy up or redeem the landlords' interest in fishery rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Create new ones, quite right.  New interests will be created. These properties coming on their hands can be let or sold to the people who actually own the land&mdash;farmers and people of the district&mdash;and run as a business.  It is altogether wrong to say that the number of <i>ex-officio</i><Col N="878" /> members has been increased.  The fact is it has been reduced to probably one-fifth of what it was when the class of people we have been referring to as Justices of the Peace held certain qualifications.  These have been dispensed with and the number who claimed to be conservators under the previous Act was far in excess of the number contemplated under this Bill.  After all, it is not a question of representation at all.  That is not the thing that ought to animate us, so much as to make proper fishery laws and then hand them over to people who will enforce them.  If they are going to be enforced at all it will be by the people who have permanent fishing rights.  I do not see what fear there is of having this law abused.  You have secretaries of boards of conservators who are responsible to the Minister and who have to advise him in every particular. I do not see how there can be any abuse of the law.  It is a question of your making the law and of getting the best people to enforce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether the function of conservators is merely to enforce the law.  If that is so, perhaps it would be better to leave the job to the police. I think the Deputy will find if he reads this Bill that the boards of conservators have other duties; they have duties not merely to preserve the fisheries against poachers, but to encourage and improve the fisheries by every means.  They have positive functions, as well as merely police functions.  I am not quite sure whether Deputy Gorey is arguing that the prospective owners of fisheries are going to be more keenly interested in the development of fisheries, or as keenly interested, as the old owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought the earlier argument was that it was the old sporting landlord who had an interest in the owner's rights to the fisheries, such as is the case in Scotland, that was the most keen and careful preserver, and that as you devolve duties upon other orders and sections, such as farmers, you lost some of that care and attention in the preservation of the fisheries.  If that view is right, then the new owners are <Col N="879" /> going to be less capable and less qualified to be appointed as <i>ex-officio</i> members of these boards than the old people. Therefore, the case for <i>ex-officio</i> representation, by virtue of ownership on such a board, whether as a policing authority or as a building up authority, is one which cuts at the root, as I think, of all responsible and democratic <Col N="880" /> Government, and I hope the House will not agree to this second limitation of authority, and handing over of public rights to <i>ex-officio</i> persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the third time on which I have had to address the House with regard to the question of the Shannon, and in contra-distinction to the other two occasions, I propose on this occasion, to confine myself to the Bill.  The scheme has been already dealt with, and the Bill which I am bringing before you is that Bill which this House, by an unanimous vote some weeks ago, recommended me to introduce.  I am leaving the question of the scheme altogether out of any remarks I may make at this moment.  If points in the scheme are still considered by Deputies to be a subject for debate and the subject of inquiry to me, I will give whatever answers seem to be required when the points are put.  This time also, in contra-distinction to the two previous occasions, I propose to be very brief.  The House did, as I say, by a unanimous vote decide that it was expedient to introduce legislation so as to carry into effect the report and the scheme of Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert, as modified by the experts, and on the lines laid down in the White Paper.  It was a more detailed resolution than <Col N="881" /> that, but that was the general effect of it.</P>
      <P>Now when consideration was given to the legislation required to carry into effect the Siemens-Schuckert scheme we really found ourselves faced with four or five matters which would have to be dealt with under legislation. There was the question of the compulsory acquisition of land, and the question of the ascertainment of the equitable amount to be paid for such land when acquired.  Incidental to that was the question of interference with easements, rights of way, way leaves, fishing rights, and other rights.  There was also the question of how compensation was to be paid, and what was to be the procedure for arriving at an equitable amount.  There was, further, the question of the improvement of the navigation of rivers.  When I spoke last upon this I referred to certain alternatives offered in the Siemens-Schuckert report with regard to navigation, and I indicated that in no event was navigation in any worse position than at the moment, and that various alternatives were offered which, requiring certain additional sums, would considerably improve navigation.  To carry out whichever of these alternatives was the one finally selected, it was necessary to take certain powers and that was looked after under a certain clause of this Bill.  There was a question, further, of drainage, and of certain interference with land, for the purpose of effectually draining those lands that was looked upon as possible, and powers for entering upon those lands and interfering with lands for certain purposes, to put up embankments and do anything else necessary so as to effect a certain amount of drainage have all been looked after in a particular clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, there is a small point arising out of drainage that I will refer to in a moment.  I am segregating it from this general statement because I made a certain statement here the last time, and I want to call attention to the particular clause in relation to that statement. The other general points were interference with fisheries, a possible interference with property belonging to, or under the control of the Minister <Col N="882" /> for Posts and Telegraphs, and a possible diversion of roads, or interference with roads and bridges.</P>
    <P>The clause regarding posts and telegraphs has been arranged in conjunction with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and it will be found that while general in character, it sufficiently protects the interests both of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the whole question of the electricity undertaking.  The question of fisheries was not so easily settled, and the clause here is general.  It provides that, so far as possible, steps shall be taken, precautions and provisions shall be taken, for the protection of, and avoidance of, injury to fisheries during, or in consequence of the construction of any work under this Act; but then there is a limitation to that which is in accordance with the term of the White Paper and in accordance with what I announced the last time:&mdash;&ldquo;Unless after such consultation, as aforesaid, the Minister is satisfied that such protection cannot be afforded or such injury cannot be avoided without substantial detriment to the works, or substantial hindrance to their construction.&rdquo; That very definitely means that in the carrying out of this scheme, although all reasonable precaution will be taken to prevent injury, we do not preclude the possibility of injury being done to the fisheries, and if in a case of conflict between fishery and electricity interests, then electricity is going to have the superiority.  The protection of roads and bridges is a small matter, and is dealt with in a general clause.</P>
    <P>The finance clause is also, as it necessarily must be, general.  It is a clause drafted in conjunction with the Minister for Finance and approved of by the Executive Council. It gives leave to raise money in a variety of ways, and until such money may be raised by loan, payments may be made in a certain way.</P>
    <P>As this Bill appears, it will no doubt be criticised as being very general.  In so far as it is general, it is necessarily so.  It was impossible to set down every detail that any Deputy might think out and suggest for incorporation in the Bill with regard to our possible <Col N="883" /> attitude towards any of the interests that may be involved.  It was impossible, for instance, with regard to the acquisition of land, to do more than say that we would set up a certain kind of tribunal, to arrange for the appointment by that tribunal of certain assessors, and that we will give those assessors or arbitrators a certain act in which to find a basis on which they can proceed to assess compensation. Similarly it would be possible to put in tremendous detail, and it would be possible to fix a period of years to discuss the details in this House, if everything had to be so worked out so that when the Bill left the Oireachtas on its way to the Statute Book, everyone concerned would know to the remotest fraction of a penny what his interests when sacrificed were going to bring him in by way of compensation.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to do that.  It is impossible to do anything else than arrange in general terms that a tribunal of a judicial character shall appoint an arbitrator, and that that arbitrator, on the basis of a particular Act&mdash;the Compulsory Acquisition of Lands Act&mdash;shall assess and order the amount of compensation to be given.  The second and third clauses of this Bill indicate the general powers which are to be accorded to him.  It is for the purpose of granting these powers that the latter clauses are necessarily included.  If any Minister is to have the power set out in paragraphs 2 and 3, then it follows that on the basis of the Siemens-Schuckert scheme there must be interference with property, acquisition of land, interference with the property of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and possible injury to fishing interests.  These matters are all provided for in the general terms, but the general terms are equitable and meet the necessity that the case demands.  There is one clause which I have reserved for special comment&mdash;namely, Clause 14.  I refer to that simply because I made certain statements with regard to it on the resolution moved on the 2nd April.  I spoke of certain criticisms made with regard to the payments to be demanded from riparian owners.  I said, &ldquo;The suggestion is made that a sum of <Col N="884" /> £200,000 is to be taken from the inhabitants along the banks of the Shannon for land which is improved under whatever pumping process there will be.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not at the moment concerned with further developments, their cost and economies, but not one penny piece will be charged to any inhabitant along the banks of the Shannon for what happens in the partial development scheme.  There is a sum of £200,000 set down in the further development scheme, but not a single penny piece will have to be paid by anybody, as far as the prevention of flooding and the drainage is concerned, that I have described in the partial development scheme.&rdquo;  I amended that when replying on the 3rd April.  I then said: &ldquo;Deputy Egan raised one point in connection with which I must enter a slight warning.  I have said that not one penny is being asked from riparian owners for the amelioration of their land.  That was indicating an intention which has yet to be accepted by this House.  What I should have said was this, that on the income side of the scheme no reliance is put upon getting any money from riparian owners for the amelioration of their land.  But when certain Bills come before this House it may seem good to the Oireachtas to decide that these people should pay something, and, if they do, there will be an additional income to the scheme.&rdquo;  Clause 14 is brought forward in order to secure the views of the House as to whether or not the farmers are again to be put in a privileged position of getting something for nothing.  The terms of that paragraph will, no doubt, be raised with vehemence by the Farmers' Party.  The indication of it is that lands benefited by drainage are to be charged with certain payments.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to the words in lines 25 and 26 of subsection (1) of section 14.  The clause opens with the words &ldquo;if and whenever the Minister is of opinion&rdquo; and continues &ldquo;the Minister may by notice in writing ... requires that such lands or premises to be charged.&rdquo;  Now people who say, and the newspapers who quote that phrase do so as if it were incumbent on me and that if that <Col N="885" /> clause were passed payment would be required from the riparian owners of the land benefited.  They have not, however, noticed that the word is &ldquo;may.&rdquo;  It is not peremptory.  There is a certain discretion left.  Apart from the fact that I would like to have the opinion of the House as to whether these people are to benefit and pay nothing for it, I would like to regard this clause in a certain way as really giving me a weapon which I may have to use in certain unlooked-for contingencies.  I may almost call this the Portumna clause, because people in that neighbourhood who have been so agitated over the possibility of lands being flooded, when they discovered that lands were not to be flooded, proceeded to get agitated in another direction&mdash;was this a prevention of flooding?  Up to that point, flooding had been looked upon as the worst calamity that could happen to the inhabitants of Portumna, but when they discovered that flooding might be stopped there arose another agitation to the effect that this also was a calamity. Flooding was something bearable and if they were to be charged anything towards its removal you would have another reaction.  I have been told that there is a likelihood of great charges being put upon the scheme from that area.</P>
    <P>The matter developed in this way.  It was admitted that the land was flooded, and that, therefore, the prevention of that flooding would require considerable embankment to be made, and that that considerable embankment would require the taking away of land now owned by certain people, but useless for all practical purposes, and that would also involve the passing of heavy machinery over that land, even though the eventual purpose was the betterment of that land.  Therefore the scheme would have to pay for that and for any land required for the embankment to protect the rest of the land. This clause is a safeguard to me.  So far as the economies of the scheme are concerned, I wish to emphasise the fact that no money need be derived under that clause.  I regard the clause as a safeguard and as a help to me in withstanding exorbitant or unusual claims <Col N="886" /> for anything I may have to do, even though it be for the eventual betterment of the lands around.</P>
    <P>I have taken the case of Portumna, but these claims have come from many other districts.  They have arisen mainly however in Portumna through one gentleman, who was previously a land agent, but who is now fiercely agitated over the betterment of the unfortunate tenants around that area.  I put that clause forward, not because the scheme depends on it, but because I wish to gather the opinion of the House as to whether people who have certain benefits conferred on them should not be asked to pay for those benefits. Consequently, that clause would, I consider, be a weapon which I could, but would only, use in the event of extravagant claims being put on me in the case of drainage works carried out.</P>
    <P>I have drawn attention to my own words used previously because it has been represented to me that the introduction of the clause is contradictory to the view I expressed on the 2nd April.  While it is contradictory to what I said on that occasion, it is definitely in accord with what I said on the following day.  A certain amount of trouble is likely to be caused, I am informed, owing to the clause regarding the acquisition of lands and the ascertainment of the price of compensation. I am afraid this matter has got rather out of perspective.  One would imagine that the Shannon scheme meant the acquisition of hundreds of thousands of acres which were to be taken to enable the water to flow to the power-house.  The excavation of the canal will mean that something in the region of 300 acres is to be taken and, when there is any talk in regard to the machinery to be set up with regard to damage done and fixing the price of compensation, I would like Deputies to bear in mind that they are dealing with a comparatively small matter of 300 acres.</P>
    <P>I am speaking now with regard to the canal.  Other excavations may be necessary under the Bill, and land will be required for embankments and other purposes.  We will acquire the land on which embankments are to be built, but so far the biggest block of <Col N="887" /> land that will be acquired is that for the canal excavations.  That is about 300 acres.  That should be borne in mind when Deputies come to consider the clauses with regard to compensation for injury done, and the price to be paid for it.  That is what I have to say on the Bill generally.  I have deliberately avoided anything dealing with the scheme for this reason, that certain motions have been tabled which run rather counter to the Second Reading, and as these motions deal completely with the scheme, I presume there will be some debate on the scheme.  If the House is inclined to tolerate any further debate on the scheme, if any points are raised that deal with it, I propose to answer them when raised. I move the Second Reading.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> I desire to take as brief a period as possible in dealing with this amendment. It is definitely an amendment preliminary to the passage of the Second Reading, calling for somewhat fuller information than is before the Dáil.  When I spoke here on the previous debate, I spent some time, perhaps too much time, in bringing facts before the Dáil which showed I could make a claim for disinterestedness in this matter in connection with what is called the rival proposal.  Time has since made that claim much more fully for me.  I only want now to put before the Dáil one or two financial and economic considerations which, I think, ought to be put before the Dáil comes to any decision as to the Second Reading, or on the general principles of this scheme, for I believe that these financial and economic considerations are fundamental, not only to the scheme, but in a very great measure to the future stability of this State.  Before I do so I should like to deal briefly with the Bill on the lines that the Minister himself has dealt with it.  He has claimed for it, and very accurately claimed for it, that it is a general purposes Bill; that it is very general in its terms and claims.  It is a Bill, I suggest, almost without precedent in the entire history of legislation in any legislative assembly in that particular.  Supposing, for example, other legislative proposals were to be brought before the Dáil framed on the lines that this Bill has been framed&mdash;supposing, for example, the Bill we had recently before us, called the Treasonable and Seditious Offences Bill, had been framed on the lines of this Bill, in which certain general powers unspecified were sought, one would imagine we would hear Deputy Johnson speaking with considerable indignation in regard to a legislative proposal of that kind.  I suggest that this proposal regarding the Shannon could have been, and I urge, should have been, dealt with just exactly with that detail and specification required in all other legislative proposals.</P>
    <P>In Private Bill procedure, if a Bill of this kind had been brought forward in regard to any proposal of this nature, and were brought into the <Col N="889" /> Private Bill Office, it would be rejected at once by the Examiner as not having given the details required in legislation. I think it is an amazing Bill from that point of view.  We have been told by the Minister that subsequent Bills will be introduced dealing with other parts of this scheme, but it is a fact that no subsequent Bill will be necessary, for this Bill will give the Minister all the powers he might require with regard to the erection of engineering works, powers with regard to the sale of electricity, powers with regard to the distribution of electricity, and in regard to the works.  This is a more important matter still.  I urge the Dáil to consider that we are not merely considering now our legislative proposals&mdash;all that I have said would be equally to the point if it were all that we were asked to consider, but in effect we are asked to consider what is a very great deal more.  We are not only being asked to pass the principle, and confer large powers on the Minister in respect of legislation, but what we are asked to do, without precedent, is to seal and confirm a contract without specification.</P>
    <P>The Minister left on one side all the engineering parts of the Bill.  They have been dealt with very fully before, and I do not propose to touch upon them now.  I propose to direct myself particularly to the larger financial and economic aspects to which I have referred, but I would like to deal, and I put this forward for the Dáil's consideration, with one aspect of the engineering side that has been emphasised, and that I think cannot be too often emphasised.  That is not in respect of civil engineering, but in respect of that other branch that used to be, in the old bad differentiation, distinguished as military engineering.</P>
    <P>I think on that head we incur very grave risks for the future.  Since the previous debate in this House I remember meeting across the water a certain gentleman who was a military engineer of some name, and he only made one comment in regard to this scheme, and it certainly caused one to think very earnestly.  He said: &ldquo;I wish this scheme had existed in Ireland in working order ten years ago, and if it had, <Col N="890" /> you would never have had the Free State established to-day.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I just put that point forward.  It is an important consideration for us to bear in mind.  I just touch on that and pass from it.  I want to deal particularly and deliberately with a certain contrast that has been made here, and in the country, by Deputies, that I think is not an unreal one.  It is in regard particularly to the suggestion made by Deputy Thrift in his very able analysis of the engineering side of this scheme.  As a preliminary to that analysis, when he spoke in the Dáil before, he said he accepted the contrast as between the Liffey Bill and the Shannon Bill. Deputy Johnson, speaking in the country, was asked by some persons in the crowd why it was that he, representing a Dublin constituency, was supporting the Shannon scheme as distinct from the Liffey scheme, which was the scheme in his own locality, made the right and proper reply, that he was supporting the Shannon scheme because he believed it to be a national scheme and in the national interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with that because I want to put before the Dáil the consideration that it is not the Shannon that is the true national scheme, and it is not the Liffey that is the true national scheme.  There is no one water-power of Ireland of which it can be said that it embodies a national scheme as distinguished from a local scheme. The proposition I am now asking the Dáil to consider, is that the true national scheme is such a financial and economic lay-out of all the water-power resources of the country, that they will be developed in relation to the economic and financial needs and resources of the country, and when the development has been carried to its ultimate conclusion, there will be no wastage of any one of these water-power resources. That is the true national scheme.  That is the scheme that has received very careful attention by bodies, over long periods of time, who have sat to consider this matter.  So far from it being true to say that the opposition is <Col N="891" /> between the Liffey and the Shannon, I would ask the Dáil to substitute for the Liffey what would be equally true, say, the opposition as between the Corrib and the Shannon or the Slaney and the Shannon.  What has to be considered is whether this country ought to make itself, at the very outset of development, dependent upon a central scheme, or whether it should not work up towards the Shannon by the development of the local water-powers, which are at the present moment quite sufficient to meet the existing demand, and yet leave a sufficient margin for development.  That would leave the Shannon for a later stage in accordance with the plans that have been put forward by the two bodies that have had this matter already entrusted to them, and that have considered this proposal from their different points of view, coming fundamentally to the same conclusion, one body being set up by the Republican Dáil in 1919, and the other being set up by the British Government in 1918, or thereabouts, if I remember the date correctly.</P>
    <P>The difference I am indicating is practically this: if we undertake the Shannon now it is admitted that there will be, when the works are completed &mdash;between the moment when the works have been completed and the moment when the scheme can be said to begin to pay for itself&mdash;a margin of time in which the scheme will lie out of its profits.  What that margin of time will be is a matter that has been subject to a certain amount of question.  It has been put at a very low figure by the Experts and by Messrs. Siemens-Schuckert. There are others who think it will take possibly seven and eight times as long as the time laid out by them.  I am not going to enter on that at the moment, although I will touch on it quite briefly in a short time.  All I will say is this: it is at least admitted that if the Shannon be developed at once, there will be a margin between the conclusion of the scheme and the moment when the scheme will begin to pay for itself and will be able to stand its own expenses&mdash;when the revenue will be equal to the charges on the debt which is incurred.  By <Col N="892" /> proceeding from the other point of view, from the development of the smaller powers that exist in various parts of the country and that are sufficient to meet the present economic needs and yet leave a margin for development, it will be possible to obviate that financial burden over that indefinite period of time.  In other words, by proceeding in that way, the country will be able to go forward on its road and find solid ground for every step of the journey.  The preliminary stage of this scheme has been worked out at £5,200,000.  I laid considerations before the Dáil on a previous occasion showing why I and others believe that the cost of £5,200,000 may ultimately prove to be very greatly exceeded indeed.  I will not go into this matter at the moment.  I will draw the attention of the Dáil to the fact that time will prove that this estimate for the initial stage of development&mdash;five and a quarter millions&mdash;may prove to be a very great deal short of what will ultimately be necessary if there be any percolation either through the banks that will be made or, what is more likely, underneath those banks, requiring a puddled trench around a great part of those banks.</P>
    <P>Let me take that figure of £5,200,000 as being the amount of money that will be required.  It is easy for the Dáil to work out what that will cost&mdash;what a loan raised at that figure will cost in annual charges.  If we take the interest at 5 ½ per cent., and if we take the amortisation at somewhere round the region of 1 per cent., you will get an annual charge of £300,000.  The annual charge that this Exchequer will have to meet will be £300,000.  How much of that can the revenue of the Shannon at once provide?  The scheme, such as has been put forward, answers that question. The £5,200,000 has been computed on an output of 110 million units per annum.  The present consumption is about one-third of this.  Roughly, therefore, two-thirds of £300,000&mdash;that is to say, £200,000&mdash;will remain an annual charge until consumption has increased to the point when it can make good that deficiency.  In other words, that margin will have to be made good until the consumption has been increased <Col N="893" /> out of taxation.  Then it becomes a very important consideration for the Dáil to take into reckoning how long will be the period until the losses in the scheme can be met out of taxation.</P>

      <P>I saw that. I shall quote it if the Minister gives me the reference to the page which I have not at the moment.  The important question then for the Dáil to consider is how long it will take this State to build up the consumption of the country to the point at which it can be said to sustain the charges of the scheme, all the initial capital required, whether for engineering works on the site or for the transmission lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Money will be required.  How much? How long will it be before the charges on the debt will be met out of the increased consumption that the State will have to build up?  Deputy Johnson, in speaking to this matter on an earlier occasion, said that he would have gathered from remarks of mine in that debate, that I did not believe in the development of the consumption of electricity in this country.  I do very strongly believe in it.  I believe that <Col N="894" /> ultimately we will require every unit of electricity that will be produced, but what I do not believe in is that we are going to see a rate of development, a rate of progress unlike anything that has been experienced in any country. I think that it is unwise to embark upon expensive legislation that proceeds upon that assumption.  That is the important point.  The Experts themselves are fully aware, as they would be from their experience, of the considerations that are proper to this matter.  I would ask the Dáil to turn to page 58 of the Experts' Report, which I propose to quote from now.  The experts, at the foot of that page, give words which are very humorous and very much to the point: &ldquo;The electrical engineering department of the Iowa State College at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines, has shown that a family of average size spends annually £20 on tobacco, £14 on gasoline, £10 3s. 0d. on ice-cream, £10 on candy, and £5 2s. 0d. on electricity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They make this comment on these figures &ldquo;As a family of average size contains about five persons, the annual electrical requirements in Iowa in the United States is estimated at about £1 per inhabitant, per year.&rdquo;  I shall, in reading the next sentence, ask the Dáil to attend to these words carefully, because they are very material to the immediate consideration before us. &ldquo;This comparison also indicates that an increase in the use of electricity is not obstructed so much by the actual cost of the electricity as by the ignorance which still rules as to the economic advantages of the use of electricity.  Although it is so often stated that the population cannot pay the price for electricity, that is not true in most cases.  When the knowledge of the advantages of a high consumption of electricity has penetrated into the consciousness of the people, then the use of electricity increases systematically and rapidly.  Such knowledge can be spread by instruction and development but also the tariff policy undoubtedly plays an important part in the rate of consumption.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Experts themselves lay the greater part of their stress upon the educational development of the people <Col N="895" /> in the use of electricity rather than upon the matter of costs.  I will quote again from pages 91 and 92.  In the last paragraph but one on page 91, the experts say: &ldquo;The electrification is to take place to a great extent in quite verdant soil.  The larger and medium sized towns will, of course, themselves arrange for their power distribution, and will be wholesale consumers from the point of view of the State supply.&rdquo; Over the page they say: &ldquo;The local net works should be planned not only for the present but also for the future demand.  Suitable rates of charges should be worked out.  The activities of the middle-men, who undertake the local distribution, must also be supervised. It is frequently necessary to teach every newly formed distribution company, not merely how it should build its net work and what prices it should take, but also to arrange its book-keeping, and to give the company practical instruction as to the connection between book-keeping, production costs, rates, receipts and profits. According to all experience a considerable organisation is required for all this, otherwise the development will go wrong and split up.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the light of these two quotations I ask the Dáil whether it is likely that development in the use and consumption of electricity in Ireland is going to be quite so rapid as has been frequently suggested here.  What are the facts? I was speaking to the engineer of works at Killarney, who informed me that he had offered farmers in that locality electricity at 1d. per unit. They, of course, had to instal their own plant and connect up.  He did not get one single customer at that price. That, nevertheless, is a lower price than the Shannon will be able to supply at Killarney, if the price at Mallow is any indication of the price at Killarney, which is not available, and which, so far, I have not been able to discover from the information put before us. The map that has been published in Siemens' scheme shows that power is going to be carried to very great distances, and is going to be brought to places such as Ballyshannon and Killarney, where electricity is already <Col N="896" /> available, and is not proving the success that I believe it will yet prove.  I am not in any doubt as to the eventual absorption of all the electricity this country can produce.  What I am now asking the Dáil to consider is whether the rate of development is going to be so fast as to justify this country in undertaking, for an indefinite period of years, the very heavy debt charge. That will cost this country a certain sum of money in expenditure for which there will be no adequate revenue, and therefore it will have to be made good out of taxation.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the last argument that I want to deal with in speaking here to-day.  That is in regard to the economic lay-out of the power resources of the country.  I urge it is necessary now when we are starting upon development that we should take the long view.  It is obvious that the Shannon or whatever river would be taken&mdash;the Corrib, the Liffey, or anywhere else, whichever of these be done first&mdash;that it is only the beginning of hydro-electrical development in the Free State.  It is necessary, therefore, beginning at the outset with the mistakes of other countries before us to learn from, that we ought so to plan our development that there will be no wastage in the meantime and no wastage in the end.</P>
    <P>The Shannon is the first step in the development of the whole country, and must be part of a complete plan if the whole scheme is to be economically laid out and give the best possible advantage.</P>
    <P>I ask the Dáil to give consideration to certain figures that I wish to place before it, figures that have not been ordinarily available before and which have been given me on the highest authority.  It must be borne in mind that the total hydro-electric power economically available in the Free State, while good, is limited in comparison with the resources of other countries. Thus, the Free State has economically available some 350,000 continuous electrical horse-power, while Switzerland, a country about half the area of Ireland, is estimated to possess some 2,000,000 continuous electrical horse-power.  Norway and Sweden together possess some <Col N="897" /> 10,000,000 continuous electrical horse-power. The United States has some 28,000,000, and up to 10 years ago had already harnessed seven millions of them.  In the light of these figures, I suggest that the conclusion is obvious to everyone that the power resources of this country will have to be carefully and economically conserved if the country is to take its place ultimately and rightly, as it should, amongst modern industrial nations.</P>
    <P>Immediately that consideration is seen, it follows that hydro-electric development in Ireland should proceed by way of development as near as possible to the sources of power.  The sources of water-power in Ireland are so evenly distributed throughout the entire country in relation to its present conditions and demands that in no case should a transmission line of more than a limited length be developed.  The reason for that is that transmission losses are part of the heaviest wastage of any water-power hydro-electric scheme, whether it be the Shannon or anywhere else.  In the scheme we have before us now the transmission losses&mdash;and I ask the Dáil to consider this fact attentively&mdash; amount to something like 30 per cent. of the whole.  Something like two millions have to be sunk in a main transmission system as a result of which 30 per cent. of the whole power generated is wasted, and the annual expenditure is brought up from £280,000 for the cost of generation to £489,000 as generated and transmitted.</P>
    <P>What happens?  I have already referred to the fact, as seen in the Siemens' scheme, and in the Experts' Report, that electricity is taken in the scheme now before the Dáil to places where local powers already exist that could be put into operation at once and be made economic paying propositions from the outset.  For example, there is Galway.  Electricity is going to be taken under the Shannon scheme all the way to Galway although water power exists on the Corrib which might almost be said to have been naturally framed for the use of the city of Galway.  Electricity is being taken to Wexford where the Slaney is available. Electricity is also being taken to Ballyshannon&mdash;</P>

      <P>Dealt with by them, but not the proposal put to them.  If I may put it this way, the Shannon scheme is virtually the answer to this question: Can you prepare a hydro-electric scheme for the Shannon and arrange that it shall supply the majority of the towns in the Free State with electric power?  The real question that was put to the experts was: Is the Shannon scheme as worked out in answer to that question a workable scheme?  I suggest some question on these lines: What is the best and most economic way of developing the water-power resources of the Free State and, with a complete economic scheme in view, what is the best way to begin such development?  I think if that question had been put to the experts they would have replied that the answer would have required not two or three months' consideration&mdash;three months at the outside&mdash;but that it would have required a much longer time and much more detailed attention than they could have possibly given it in the time and with the means at their disposal.</P>

      <P>I am putting it forward now that that consideration is the major consideration in the entire matter.  I urge both in regard to economics and in regard to the economic lay-out that the long view is the one that would give a sound financial method, such as is not being taken in the scheme now before the Dáil in the present Bill, and that the present Bill will commit us to a method of development, when the water-power resources of Ireland have been fully developed in future years, to very considerable waste.  It is evident that waste will occur, because the documents that have already been given us are quite sufficient on their face to show that the wastage in transmission amounts to one-third of the whole.  I suggest that that is a wastage of the resources of this country, such as we, with our limited resources in this regard, ought not and need not, incur.  I am putting it before the Dáil that the finance and the economics of the question of water-power development in Ireland would suggest a beginning with local powers and a procedure to larger central powers at a later stage for the linking-up of the whole scheme&mdash;not to start with the large central scheme that compels you to go in for long transmission lines, heavy wastage, and, at a later stage to find it will be necessary to develop the local powers and to cut down very considerably the transmissions system that was started in the initial stages of a wrong beginning.</P>
      <P>It is for that reason I suggest that on these particular matters, which are fundamental matters, because they involve the principle of the Bill, the Dáil ought to have fuller information than is available in the Experts' Report or in the Siemens' scheme, and that it ought to call for documents and information in order to come to a conclusion on those questions.  It cannot do so under the Standing Orders without appointing a specific committee for that purpose, and that is why I am suggesting that a committee be appointed to do these things.</P>

He has, for shortness and convenience, adopted the initial form of words of Deputy Figgis's amendment, but he follows on with a totally different succession of words.  It is only in form that it is really an amendment to Deputy Figgis's amendment.  It can only be done by agreement, but if Deputies were content to discuss the general principle&mdash;and it is really the general principle that we have to discuss&mdash;were content to say what they have to say on that general principle in one speech, then I think the proper form of procedure would be that Deputy Figgis, if he persists in moving his amendment, should move it and we should vote on it; that Deputy Heffernan should then be allowed to move his amendment, beginning with the initial words of Deputy Figgis's, and following with Deputy Heffernan's words, and that that should be immediately voted upon without further speeches from the Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In proposing the amendment which stands in my name, I would like to say that I am not opposing the Shannon scheme.  We, on the Farmers' Benches, have never taken up the line of opposition to the Shannon scheme.  We believe that a comprehensive electric scheme is necessary and advisable for this country.  We believe, also, contrary to Deputy Figgis's ideas, that the Shannon scheme is the best scheme.  We believe that instead of having many electric schemes in the State, that by far the better idea is to deal with one large comprehensive scheme, covering the whole country, and that instead of being wasteful it would have the effect, eventually, of saving a considerable amount of money to the State.  But the line that I take is, that at no stage since the introduction of this scheme, have we had a proper opportunity of examining into the details of the scheme.  At no time have we had the chance to recognise whether the scheme is sound or whether it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are simply told that a scheme has been promulgated by a famous firm of German engineers, that that scheme has been submitted to four famous European experts, and then we are asked to accept the finding of the experts blindly, and to vote in favour of that scheme, and to give, as this Bill does give, a general commission to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to go ahead with that scheme.  I am not satisfied that I should vote in favour of a scheme which I do not understand and which I believe by far the greater number of the Deputies do not understand, and which the people of the country do not understand.  The scheme may be sound &mdash;I sincerely hope it is&mdash;but there are possibilities that it is not.  The mode of procedure adopted in regard to this Bill and in regard to the whole matter is one which I believe there never has been a precedent for in any other State <Col N="905" /> or Parliament.  Our contention is, and my amendment, as originally drafted, covered that contention, that the scheme should have been placed before a committee, based on the committees which sit on Private Bills, and that some opportunity should be given to everybody interested to employ counsel, to bring forward witnesses, to cross-examine experts, and to endeavour to thrash out this scheme, from all points of view, to endeavour to find out the weak points, if there are any weak points in the scheme, and to endeavour to bring forward the strong points, as there are, I am sure, some very strong points in the scheme.  That has not been done.  We have to accept the scheme as it is placed before us, and as placed before us it is not the full scheme, as submitted to the Minister by the Siemens-Schuckert firm, nor do I know that it is the complete report of the Experts&mdash;I presume it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Great as the reputation of Siemens-Schuckert may be, I maintain that the time they spent in examination of this project was not sufficiently long to take cognisance of all the facts and all the matters connected with it, which would be necessary in order to say finally and definitely that the scheme that they were putting forward was absolutely the best, was absolutely water-tight and without any loopholes of any kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many complicated matters connected with the geology and the water-power of a country which cannot be, in my opinion, discovered within six months.  I do know that certain enquiries were made and that the results of certain studies that had taken place previously were placed at their disposal.  But it is my belief that the time which they spent in the examination of the country, the examination of the rivers, the water-shed and other matters which are connected with such a scheme, was not sufficiently long, and, on that account, I believe that their report cannot be regarded as thoroughly and absolutely reliable. We have had a financial statement before us.  The whole scheme is based on that financial statement.  The cost <Col N="906" /> to the country is based on that financial statement.  The estimate of the cost to the consumer is based on that financial statement.  It may happen that there has been some flaw which may not be discovered until the scheme is well under way, and when that flaw is discovered the cost of the scheme may increase enormously, with the result that the cost to the State becomes greatly increased and the cost to the consumer of electricity is also increased. Needless to say, if the cost to the consumer is so increased that it is no longer economic&mdash;that is, that he could get power from the present power stations at the same, or a lower price, or that he could get power, of any kind, at the same or a lower price he will not use the power supplied by the Shannon scheme, with the result that it would become bankrupt or have to be supported from State funds.</P>
    <P>I maintain that we are asking nothing unusual or anything that is not reasonable in asking that this scheme be examined in all its detail, and I cannot see how it can possibly be examined in detail, unless it is placed before a committee.  I would suggest, and I have suggested in my amendment, that that committee should have power to bring forward witnesses and to examine, if necessary, these experts who have already passed their opinion on this scheme, if they can be induced to come back to the country again to give their evidence, and to go through the whole thing from every aspect, from the financial, the engineering and the economic side, and that when they have examined it from all points of view, that they should place their report before the Dáil, and that the Dáil should then, and not now, give the power to the Minister to go ahead.  I think it is not right and it is not fair to the intelligence of the Dáil, that it should be asked to accept blindly the reports of certain experts, no matter how eminent these men might be.</P>
    <P>Now, I have had some experience on the Private Bill Committee that dealt with the Liffey schemes.  We had many experts of European fame examined there, and I might say many experts of Irish fame also, and one of <Col N="907" /> the things that struck me with regard to their examination was the fact, that many times they contradicted each other on what would seem to be essential points.  That may seem to the Minister to be a point against my argument, that if you carry on with this Committee you will have the experts coming forward and contradicting each other, and that you will be no wiser in the end than at the beginning. But I maintain that the Committee are in the position of judges, they hear these men giving their evidence, they pay attention to the demeanour of the experts, to their manner of giving their evidence, they listen to the cross-examination, they notice whether these experts give way on points and become weak on others or not, and eventually they find themselves placed in the position of judges, and they have to decide on the bulk of the evidence which they have heard, which of the experts were correct and which scheme, if followed, would be the proper one to pass.  They would have to decide on this occasion if the present scheme as put forward was such as would meet with the approval of the ordinary man when he gets a chance of examining it, and judging it in every detail and from every point of view.</P>
    <P>I cannot pretend to deal with this either from an engineering or from a financial aspect, but I suggest to the Dáil and to the Minister that there are certain very obvious things which may easily be wrong.  There are certain very obvious estimates which may easily not work out as they are given.  We have, I believe, in this partial scheme up to 100 miles of embankments to the River Shannon from O'Brien's Bridge to Killaloe, the embankment at Lough Derg, and we will have the embankments of the canal, which are to be made the head-race, which carries the water to the power station.  These embankments, as I gather, are largely to be composed of material dredged from the bottom of the river, and from the canals made to take away the water. The experts state that they believe the substance to be taken from the bottom of the river and from these canals will be suitable to make these embankments. <Col N="908" /> But I notice that they only &ldquo;believe,&rdquo; they cannot be absolutely sure, that the substance will be suitable for that use. I do not believe that with the limited number of borings made by the experts that it is possible for them to see what type of material will be brought forward. They said in certain cases that that material was sand, gravel and clay. That was the material that was found, and they acknowledge that the sand in itself is too fine to make an embankment, and they said it must be mixed with clay before it would prove successful. Take it that in this dredging the amount of sand exceeds the quantity of clay&mdash;what does that mean?  It means that the embankments are made largely of sand without a sufficient mixture of clay, and that they will be inferior and will be likely to break away.</P>

      <P>I am not talking of a surplus of brains, but of a surplus of sand.  I am only saying that it is one of the possible problems.  I say it is one of the problems that must be examined.  Before we can favourably vote on this scheme we should be satisfied that these problems have been thoroughly examined into, and that not the slightest possible doubt exists as to the possibility of the scheme both from a financial and from its engineering aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="909" /> Another point which I am myself not doubtful about, but which I am uncertain about, is the question of the demand&mdash;that is the energy demand which is calculated will arise.  I believe that the calculation of the possible demand has been altogether excessive. We are told that the demand will be for 150,000,000 units by the time the scheme is carried through.  I believe that that demand is necessary in order that the scheme may be financially sound.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I will put it in another way.  The present partial scheme will produce 150,000,000 units, and the calculation is that the demand for 110,000,000 units will make it financially possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Even taking it at that smaller figure, the actual production of electricity in the State at the present moment is, I believe, something like 46,000,000 units, and I am rather inclined to think, and I think the general opinion of the people who have considered the matter, is that the possibility of that demand rising to 110,000,000 units in three years, is altogether beyond reasonable consideration.  It has been stated by the Minister that the increase in Dublin has been calculated at the rate of 15 per cent. per annum, and it has been stated that that is the evidence of the Dublin Electrical Engineer.  He denies that he made such a statement, I believe.  I think it is very unlikely that such an increase will take place in the Dublin demand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the possibilities of a demand for electricity, the people of this country are unfortunately very conservative with regard to new ideas.  They do not take to them as the people in other countries do.  I suggest that there is very little use in making a comparison with countries such as America and Canada. The people in these countries are usually the very first to grasp new ideas and to carry them into effect, but we are an essentially conservative people and are slow to avail of opportunities of that kind.  It appears to me that it will take a considerable amount of education, and I should say of propaganda, to prove to the people of this country that a saving is likely to come to them from the use of electricity as well as an improvement in their present living conditions.  I think, too, that it would take a much longer time than the time allowed by the experts in order to build up the demand which they estimate will take place if this scheme is carried out.  I do not maintain that the demand may not arise if the scheme is accepted.  I hope it will, but what I do say is that it is doubtful, and while the doubt remains the matter should be subjected to further examination by Irishmen who are cognisant of Irish conditions, and who are in a better position than experts from foreign countries to form an opinion on such a matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="911" /> There is another point I wish to deal with.  From what I have been able to find out, the experts who reported on this are, I understand, electrical engineers rather than civil engineers. They were all, I understand, more or less connected with electrical undertakings. Therefore, I say on the question of drainage, which is really a matter for civil engineers, these experts, from their previous training, could not be expected to know a great deal about it.  It appears from their report that this question of drainage came on them rather as a surprise, and that they were not aware that it was a question of such importance to the country as they found subsequently it was.  They found, too, that an electrical scheme could not be dealt with apart from the question of drainage.</P>
    <P>Before I would be willing to give my support to this Bill I would like to be sure that the question of drainage would be dealt with by Irish engineers who have studied it in all its aspects. They should be asked to give their opinion as to whether, in their view, the scheme embodied in the experts' report is a feasible one for this country. It would be important to ascertain from them whether the scheme outlined in the experts' report is a workable one, whether the system of canals suggested, the syphoning of water from the land and the pumping of water into these canals can be relied on and whether it may not fail at some essential time.  This system of draining land by pumping large quantities of water out of it is a new one to us.  I know that it can be done and that, as a matter of fact, it has been done in other countries, but it is new to us and the question is&mdash;can it be made a success here?</P>
    <P>There was a point dealt with by Deputy Figgis which I wish to refer to.  He was dealing with the financial aspects of the scheme, and suggested that if the scheme were established it would still not be in a position to pay interest on the capital outlay and that the returns from it would not be sufficient to pay the working expenses. He said that for several years, until the energy demand rose sufficiently to <Col N="912" /> pay the ordinary working expenses, as well as the interest on the capital outlay, that certain allowances should be made for interest on capital and for the amount required to produce a sinking fund.  In conclusion, I desire to say that I am not opposed to the Bill, and the Farmers' Party is not opposed to it.  They want to see the electrical possibilities of the country exploited to the fullest extent, and I believe that the Shannon scheme as a basis for the electrical development of Ireland is the right one.  But I am not satisfied that the Dáil has yet had a sufficient opportunity for examining the scheme, nor am I fully satisfied that Deputies can be fully satisfied that the scheme is a sound one from every aspect, and that there is no possible loop-hole which may lead the country into a quagmire of serious financial or economic losses.  Unless it is proved to me that such possibilities do not exist, that the scheme is feasible, economically and financially, and is sound as an engineering project, I am not prepared to vote for the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to give, in a few words, my reasons for seconding the amendment moved by Deputy Heffernan. I take it that the question before us is whether we are satisfied to support, in principle, the Bill, the Second Reading of which has been moved by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and that we are satisfied that we know enough about the whole project to agree with the Minister; or whether, on the other hand, that we do not know enough and are not satisfied with the knowledge we have, and therefore ask that further consideration be given to the problem. I think it would be fairly stating the position with regard to the whole project for the electrification of the Shannon to say that no matter what could come up before this House to be the subject of legislation could be less understood by the country and by Deputies than the problem we are debating.  It is a new problem for the country, and it is new, with very few exceptions, to every Deputy in this House.  The exceptions perhaps might be Deputy Figgis and two or three of <Col N="913" /> the intellectuals on the Government back benches, but to the great majority of Deputies it is true that their knowledge of electrical development is very new.  If we have doubts about giving enthusiastic support to the Minister in his motion, it is not because we stand against electrical development in the country, but rather because we feel that it is not sound, in the interests of the State at the present time, to give what I might call a blind vote in support of the Minister's motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, to put it fairly, that is exactly the position that so many Deputies on every side of this House stand in. There is no use pretending that we know and understand the Siemens-Schuckert report or that we understand the report of the experts.  We do not, and I want to hear some of the people who declare it is not right for Deputy Heffernan to move this amendment, saying they thoroughly understand the reports and are satisfied with them. The Minister's question is: &ldquo;What is to be gained by submitting this report to a Committee?  Is anything to be gained?  What will be the abilities of the men who will be appointed or nominated to this committee to receive evidence and consider it, and pass judgement upon it?&rdquo;  It is true that no body of men nominated from this House or from the two Houses, could at once pretend that they understood the whole problem of electricity at their first sitting.  It would be true, also, to say that after a time, after the evidence for and against is submitted to them, after a series of cross-examinations, after the submission by the other side of their case, and after hearing all these things a committee of commonsense men would be able to pass judgment, and, I would say, learned judgment, upon these reports and upon the points of view that may be expressed by others in this country who are not satisfied with the reports before us, or that the scheme before us is as sound as it might be.  That is really, I think, the main point we have to decide in this amendment.  The Minister, I have no doubt, will be able to secure sufficient backing to declare that he has a right to go on with the <Col N="914" /> scheme on the reports that we have before us.</P>

      <P>If the scheme had been decided upon I would not be in order now, and the Minister should have raised that matter before the amendment was moved.  The suggestion in Deputy Heffernan's amendment, that a committee might sit and bring in a report before the 28th July, is not an unreasonable one.  It would be quite sufficient time for the pros. and cons. of the problem to be debated, and under conditions not afforded to Deputies here and to the people in the country so far.  The Minister, with his technical advisers, I have no doubt, is perfectly well satisfied, and I will go further and say that he has very good reason to be satisfied.  He, in turn, is capable of satisfying his colleagues, but we have not all these technical advisers that the Minister has.  Now, if Deputies and the House accept the Minister's Bill, the position we will be in is that we will accept the Bill with a certain amount of knowledge that we may say is rather a dangerous thing.  I believe and feel the Minister will not lose anything, or the scheme lose anything of its worth by the setting up of a committee, or by giving opportunities to other people who say that these reports in certain important details are not sound, to endeavour to support their reasons for saying they are not sound, and giving the experts an opportunity of proving to those people the falsity of the points of view that they hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People feel it is incumbent upon them to demand this, because, on the other hand, we have taken upon ourselves to support the Minister in his action upon this very important matter of policy that is involving the State financially for a number of years to come.  If, as Deputy Heffernan points <Col N="915" /> out, certain things did not materialise in the manner that the promoters of the scheme and the experts suggest, we would all be equally guilty if the precautions that might have been taken were not taken, and if we did not urge that they should be taken. I say the Minister will have more support than ever, in pushing forward the scheme, if he sets up an impartial committee to weigh the arguments that can be advanced upon the other side. Not alone that, but he would satisfy every Deputy in this House that the scheme is as sound as he says it is and he would satisfy the country, as a whole, and whatever the consequences might be after a committee like that had gone into the matter, he would have the country behind him.  I doubt if he will satisfy the taxpayers and many Deputies in this House by any other course of action.</P>

      <P>Deputy Heffernan's speech consisted practically of a prologue and an epilogue, and generally a poem.  The prologue and the epilogue were the same: &ldquo;We are in favour of the Shannon scheme,&rdquo; but the Deputy's speech was, so far as it went, a root-and-branch attack upon the Shannon scheme in every detail of it.  Deputy Baxter pointed out that the Second Reading is to decide&mdash;and he is right in that&mdash;the question of accepting the principle of the scheme or not.  If, as Deputy Heffernan said, the Farmers' Party are convinced that the Shannon scheme is the scheme, I think that would commit them to the principle of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Then the mover of the first amendment, and the mover of the substitute amendment, were both very strong upon the point that the four very well-qualified experts of European fame had not enough time to examine this scheme.  Deputy Heffernan says six months is not enough for them, and Deputy Figgis says two months is not enough for them.</P>

      <P>But matters which the experts did not consider and could not have considered in two months, this House is to do within six days or practically six days, according to Deputy Figgis in his amendment.  In the case of Deputy Heffernan things are not so bad; he expects a Committee of this House first to do in a couple of months what the experts could not do in the six months at their disposal.</P>
      <P>That is the value which these two Deputies set on the amendment they have put down and the arguments they have put forward.  Deputy Heffernan also made great play with the conservative character of the Irish people.  Again and again he stressed the position of the people of this country in comparison with other countries, Canada and elsewhere&mdash;that they were opposed to anything that was new.  I could understand that attitude if he had not put in the word &ldquo;unfortunately.&rdquo;  What does he do to help them out of that conservatism? He plays into the hands of that conservatism by pandering to it in asking us to delay the scheme.  He will not consent to any scheme unless every detail of it is examined and unless everything about it is investigated by a committee of laymen.  Personally I should not like to be committed to a policy of that kind, that we cannot adopt a hydro-electrical scheme of this kind until we, as laymen, are capable of examining it, pronouncing on every point in it, and of discovering whether it has any flaw.  If that is to be the work of such a committee, I may say that I do not possess sufficient knowledge or training to come to any verdict on such a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only apparently is that to be done, though not in any way opposed to this scheme, nor probably desirous of holding it up, but the committee is also to decide on the important question as to the materials of which the embankments are to be made, and to say whether or not these materials are <Col N="917" /> proper.  The experts point out that in some places there may be sand, that sand alone would not be sufficient, and they give warning that not sand but proper material shall be used.</P>
    <P>That will be the business of the engineers appointed by the Government to look into.  All this is proposed, as if there was not sufficient time to go into it in the months that have elapsed, and it is to be gone into by the Committee before the 28th July, when, incidentally, the report will be given.  Whether the House will be sitting, or forced to sit, all that time I do not know, but the general hope of Deputies who attend the House regularly is that we shall not be sitting at that time.  It is therefore proposed to shelve the action of this House on this Bill until the winter. That, in itself, might not be an objectionable thing if any sound reason had been brought forward for a policy of postponement of that kind, but when we are told that a body of laymen of this House can examine this scheme in detail, a scheme to which the best experts in Europe have given their best attention, I say, as I have said before, that this scheme was examined as no other scheme was examined.</P>
    <P>The experts appointed by the Government were not appointed to back up the scheme, but to test it, to approach it with distrust, and to see where it was weak.  That was their function, and that function they performed. They were not experts chosen and told to say what they could in favour of the scheme, and to give what is known in the courts as expert evidence on its behalf.  That is not what they were asked to do.  They were asked to do what Deputy Heffernan wants this committee to do, namely, to examine its details.  I cannot see how there could be any prospect of a committee of laymen of this House arriving at a more satisfactory decision upon it than these experts have arrived at.  According to Deputy Heffernan, the experts appointed were unfortunately all electrical experts.  I do not know where he got his information from.</P>
    <P>Herr Meyer-Peter is an expert in hydraulic and not electrical engineering, <Col N="918" /> and because he was an expert in that branch of engineering he was appointed. There were electrical engineering experts appointed, experts in the economy of electrical distribution, but there was also the hydraulic engineer whom I have just mentioned. Deputy Figgis, I think, made the suggestion that the Dáil is being asked to sanction a contract without getting any specifications.  The Dáil is being asked to do nothing of the kind.  It is not the Dáil that is entering into the contract, and it is not the Dáil that is to get the specifications.  It is the Government. Less than a week ago the Dáil passed a vote of £400,000 for new works.  Does that mean that the Dáil passed these contracts without specifications?</P>
    <P>Does it mean that the contracts would be carried out without specifications? Nothing of the kind.  There is a department of the Government to receive the contracts and to get the specifications and to see that they are carried out.  It is the same so far as this is concerned.  The details of this contract are not put before the Dáil, as the Dáil does not enter into the contract. The Dáil will give permission to the Government to do it if this Bill is carried through.  It is not the business of the Dáil to carry out or enter into contracts.  I never yet heard of the Dáil entering into a contract even, for instance, as regards the seating accommodation of the Dáil itself.</P>

      <P>Does not the Parliamentary Secretary admit that in regard to Private Bill legislation where the allocation of national resources is concerned these particulars are required as being necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, as Deputy Johnson pointed out in what I may call the first Second Reading debate, this is not at all on a par with Private Bill legislation, nor with a private company or individual interfering with the property of another company or individual or commandeering the resources of the country for private purposes.  It is a proposal by the Government to utilise the national resources for national purposes.  We have passed drainage legislation of this kind.  Deputy Figgis says that it is unprecedented.  Let him look up the <Col N="919" /> ordinary legislation which gives rights to interfere with the property of private individuals, not for the benefit of the whole nation, as in the case of this scheme, but for the benefit of private individuals living along the same river. Still, general legislation of that kind was passed.  Another point to which I would like to draw attention is a point made by Deputy Figgis in referring to what he called the true national development. If, after his speech, he does not get the votes of Deputy O'Connell and the various other Galway Deputies, and the votes of Deputies from Kerry as well, that schemes should be started practically in every county, then they have no proper political sense.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's suggestion amounts to this: First you start the Liffey scheme. It can supply Dublin and the neighbourhood. Then start the Flesk scheme and it can supply Killarney.  Then start the Corrib scheme to supply Galway. Get a small river in Limerick, if you can, and that would supply Limerick. So on with every other portion of the country.  Then take the Slaney for the benefit of Deputy Corish, and for the benefit of Deputy Gorey start the Barrow electrical scheme in Graigue-na-managh, where you have the only real fall in the River Barrow.  It is the only place where you get what is called a head, I mean a head of water for electrical purposes.  That is to be the situation, and then, perhaps, you may go on to the Shannon; that is, you can go on to the Shannon, having carefully shut out every market which it can supply.  One half of the speeches against this Bill was to the effect that this scheme cannot possibly pay, that there would not be a demand in the whole country, even taking Dublin in.  The other half of the speeches was to the effect that we should first develop local resources and afterwards come to the Shannon.  If you first develop the Liffey, do you think that you will ever get to the Shannon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be ten times as much argument against the Shannon scheme on the economic side if you take out the principal customer, which is Dublin, <Col N="920" /> and if you take out not only Dublin but all the other districts, you can never get to the Shannon, for there will be nothing left for it.  As Deputy Figgis pointed out, the total amount of hydraulic power for electrical purposes in this country is limited.  That is what the experts have insisted on, and that is why they pointed out that you must be careful and not queer the whole pitch by starting small schemes. You can go from the big scheme to the small schemes, but if you start with the small schemes you create chaos, and would never get to the big scheme, and would throw away half the electrical energy you have at your disposal in in that way.  That is the whole burden of their report, where they come to deal with the necessity of the proper economising of the very limited resources that this country possesses.  That is why, in places like Switzerland, where you have many rivers with heads of water, that each can supply a big amount of electrical power, and you can safely go and develop each of them separately.  That is what you cannot do in this country, and it is the Swiss experts who pointed that out, men who have examined our scheme, and are acquainted with the conditions in Switzerland, that the real development, if people are satisfied that hydraulic power must be developed, must be through the Shannon, to the small schemes and not in the opposite direction. Deputy Figgis also mentioned that there would be a loss of 30 per cent. on transmission.</P>
    <P>I do not know where he got the figure; and there was a certain amount of innuendo that there would not be the same loss, or any loss practically, if you had those local schemes working.  It was the Shannon that was to provide us with a loss of 30 per cent. I suggest that idea of a loss of 30 per cent. at the beginning is deceptive. What we have to consider at the beginning is the price of electricity per unit.  There is the economic consideration at the start.  Afterwards, when all the Shannon electric supply is taken up, and there is a demand for more, then is the time to start your local supply to supplement the local needs. I did not intend to detain the House so <Col N="921" /> long, but I wished to deal with some of the arguments in favour of what, to my mind, is a merely postponing motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I shall be in order in saying that I am in favour of the Shannon as against the Liffey, and in favour of a big scheme as against a little scheme.  I agree with the Minister that in the resolution passed about a month ago the Dáil expressed its approval of the Shannon scheme, but it did not express approval of the methods by which the Shannon scheme was to be carried out.  That is what we are considering and discussing now. I do not propose to discuss the financial and engineering details.  I am anticipating Deputy Magennis's criticism by admitting that I am quite incompetent to do so.  What I want to discuss is the methods by which this Bill proposes to deal with the private individual. I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that this is a public Bill, but in some respects it resembles a Private Bill, in that it proposes to deal arbitrarily with the property of private individuals, and not with all private individuals, but a select number of them.  It leaves my water power in Loch Arron untouched, but the Minister takes from my neighbour, in a lough five miles away, extensive powers.  Therefore, it does not follow the precedent of the Land Act, which deals with all land owners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>To the best of my recollection it did.  It laid down rules for all publichouses.  The clause for the acquisition of the lands of a private individual is a general clause in a public Bill.  Section 3, giving the Minister power over riparian owners, is similar to a clause in a Private Bill. My view is that persons affected by this Bill have a right to be heard by some tribunal of this House or of the Oireachtas, and it is for that reason I am supporting Deputy Heffernan's amendment.  I do not know whether we shall gain much light or leading from the committee he proposes.  Probably the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance was justified <Col N="922" /> in some of his criticisms, but one thing to be remembered is, that although his experts were experts in hydraulic and electric engineering, they were not experts in local conditions.  In some passages of their report they betrayed a certain ignorance of local conditions. That is my impression.  At any rate they were not fully acquainted with the conditions in this country, and were dependent on such information as they could pick up here.  A committee of the Dáil would not be ignorant of local conditions.</P>
      <P>The amendment would give people the right to apply and have the scheme modified to meet their objections&mdash; when I say &ldquo;people&rdquo; I include corporations and other bodies who are the people likely to come before a Committee if set up.  In the first place, there are existing electricity companies, and they appear to be very much overlooked.  It is assumed they would be content to get their current at a cheaper rate, but what is to happen if any electricity company in Cork or Dublin hoist the Sinn Fein flag and say: &ldquo;We will make our own electricity, we do not want the Shannon electricity?&rdquo; The effect of this Bill is to set up a competitor to existing interests subsidised by the State.  That is not an unfair way of putting it.  It is only a hypothetical contingency.  Other bodies may wish to appear to make objections, such as trade unions.  This Bill is not going to create unemployment, but it will create the displacement of labour.  Less labour, for instance, may be required at the Pigeon House and more at O'Brien's Bridge.  The claim might be made on the Minister that persons displaced in consequence of this scheme should have first claim for employment under the scheme.  They may do so because they are well represented in this House, but assuming that they were not, and that the Labour Party had gone under, and that Labour was not represented here, I think it would be only fair to have a committee to whom they might present their case. That applies also to the riparian owners.  I would like to call attention to the absence in this scheme of the usual safeguards given in Private Bill legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> I think it would be generally accepted that any property owner from whom the State propose to take property, or from whom the State, the municipality, the private owner, or the company propose to take property, or propose to affect his property in one way or another, has the right to know what is going to be done.  In the case of Private Bills that is achieved by the Promoters of the Bill having to deposit copies of that portion of their Bill which affects the area with the clerk of the county council or, as in the past, with the clerk of the rural district council.  What is the Minister's procedure?  For all that part of the area south of Portumna plans shall be deposited at Limerick, and for all that part of the Shannon and its tributaries north of Portumna plans will be deposited at Portumna.  When he is depositing plans at Portumna, I suppose he wants to deal with Portumna by creating a possible tourist traffic there.  Just imagine the position of the Leitrim man at Lough Allen, or the Roscommon man at Lough Ree, who might probably have to travel to Dublin in connection with all the maps, plans and books of reference.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might explain that.  The Deputy was not here on 3rd April.  It was then stated, and the House understood, that no portion of the Shannon north of Portumna was being affected by any part of the partial development scheme.

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I apologise to the Minister.  At the same time, I think it would be much better if that were specifically stated in the Bill.  I withdraw that argument.  At the same time, as the Minister probably knows, and as the Parliamentary Secretary for the Board of Works certainly knows, people on the river may be very much affected by things that will happen lower down or higher up on the river from their location.  Therefore, I think information should be more readily available.  I turn from individuals to the public as a whole, and to the Dáil as a whole.  If this Bill were considered by a Private Bill Committee, that Committee would have before it reports from the various public Departments affected.  We have not the advantage of any such reports to-day.  That Committee would have a report from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health as to the effect of the proposals in the Bill on his Department; and would have a report from the Minister for Fisheries as to the effect on his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have clauses in the Bill dealing with local government, dealing with the Post Office and dealing with fisheries.  My impression is that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs made a good bargain with the Minister: that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health made a bad bargain, and that the Minister for Fisheries made no bargain at all.  None of those Ministers is an Executive Minister. <Col N="925" /> Those Ministers are not responsible for the Bill, and we have no guidance from them.</P>
    <P>The Bill affects local government to a certain extent by the demolition or the diversion of bridges; it affects fisheries very seriously indeed.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Finance was, some months ago, speaking in regard to Deputies from Kerry.  The Deputy from Kerry that I want to hear on this scheme is the Minister for Fisheries.  He was here when the Minister for Industry and Commerce began his statement, and when the Minister for Industry and Commerce said he did not intend to subordinate electrical power to fisheries, the Minister for Fisheries went out, I presume, in despair.  We have no guidance on these matters whatever; we have not the guidance that a Private Bill Committee would have.  The Ministers to whom I have referred are not Executive Ministers. We do not know how far they have been consulted, or whether they are in agreement with the Bill.</P>
    <P>Seriously, I ask the Dáil to consider the desirability of setting up some Committee which will go into this question of fisheries.  It is admitted that fisheries will be affected, and, doubtless, there will be some scheme of compensation. It is desirable that we should limit injury as far as we possibly can.  Presently we may find ourselves in the position of destroying one of the industries that we have in order to create another.  Before I conclude I would like to deal with a possible argument that may be put forward by the Minister. I know very well how dangerous it is to anticipate the Minister.  He may deprecate delay in this matter. What I want to know is what is the great urgency in regard to the scheme. As far as I know&mdash;I have read the Minister's speeches with some care, including those he delivered when I was absent from the Dáil&mdash;he has never made, up to the present, any case on the ground of urgency.  The scheme is only a little more than a year old.  It will take at least three years to complete it.</P>
    <P>I venture to think that unless there is some reason that we have not yet <Col N="926" /> heard, we shall be doing no harm in delaying the scheme somewhat in order to educate better the public mind and remove apprehensions that are now felt.  There may be some reason that we have not heard of.  It may be possible that money will be available now that will not be available later.  That is the only reason I can think of at the moment.  The work contemplated is bound to take three years to complete, and that refers only to part of the scheme.  It may not be completed in that time; it may take longer.  I think it would be advisable that we should have a more detailed examination than we have had up to the present.  I do not accept Deputy O'Sullivan's contention that the State has the right to over-rule the rights of private individuals, whenever it thinks it expedient to do so, without allowing them to be heard.  I think we are in danger of aggrandising and magnifying the functions of the State too much.  It is because this amendment of Deputy Figgis and Deputy Heffernan will give the private individual some power of putting his case against the State&mdash;that great leviathan, the State, which Hobbes foresaw will swallow all private rights&mdash;that I support them.  I congratulate the Labour Party on their silence.  They are having a most admirable model for a future measure of State Socialism.</P>

The argument he has used, of course, is not an argument for the amendment.  It is an argument that might well follow the passing <Col N="927" /> of the Second Reading of the Bill. It certainly is not an argument for refusing to give a Second Reading to the Bill until you have the Committee Stage of the Bill.  Deputy Cooper suggests that the Second Reading should be acceded to and then that you should call a committee together and allow all the private interests that would, or that might think they would, be affected, to come and give evidence before that Committee of the House.  I think the argument was carried entirely too far. I hope it will not be made a precedent that in respect to public Bills, individuals who believe themselves to be aggrieved, are to have the right of audience of the Dáil or a Committee of the Dáil which is discussing public Bills.  If you make that precedent on this occasion, I can foresee the abolition of the Dáil and the setting up by the Ministry for the time being of a tribunal which will hear citizens directly on every subject that is put forward and representative Government will, of course, by that fact be abolished.  Deputy Cooper would deny that he was a Bolshevick, but he is going in that way rapidly.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary when he insisted that we have not got to consider this general question on a parallel with Private Bill legislation.  I rather think we should deal with this matter as Parliaments have done almost universally when dealing with matters of public concern.  They had the general principles approved, and then accepted responsibility for executive action.  I think it was Deputy Heffernan who said that there was never a precedent for this kind of procedure.  I have not any information regarding the action of governments in respect to electrical supply, but I rather anticipated that he would have produced evidence to show, in the various countries where the State had taken up the business of providing electrical supplies from water power, what their procedure was.  I think I would be right in saying <Col N="928" /> that in such businesses as the Assouan Dam, or the Panama Canal, or even what was Kingstown Harbour, the State did not submit the details or the plans, or the method of construction, or the material of which they were to be constructed, for the consideration of the Parliament which approved of the spending of the money.  I do not think that when the British Government, for instance, decided to construct a base at Singapore, they submitted the detailed plan, not from points of secrecy, but from the point of view of practical working.  They got approval in a general way of the principle, and when the public had discussed that principle the Government accepted responsibility for the proper working out of that principle and the carrying through of it to an economic and social success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A suggestion was made by Deputy Heffernan that there was a parallel between the discussion of the Liffey Power Scheme and what he would like in respect to this scheme.  I would venture to say that, notwithstanding the fact that the Joint Committee sat for many weeks hearing evidence on both sides, in coming to their conclusion they were guided rather by the general principles than by the technical merits of one or other of the schemes, whether the thickness of the wall, the depth of the fall, or the quality of the material. I do not think for a moment that these factors weighed with the committee to any degree at all.  As a matter of fact, the decision was on the general principle, the merits in a general way of the rival schemes.  That is all that a committee that might be set up by the House could do.  It might be possible that a committee of that kind would hear evidence from rival engineers. Is it suggested that the supporters and the opponents of a particular scheme would have counsel to crossexamine the various witnesses.  Is it intended that there should be expert cross-examining expert, or is it intended that the several witnesses to be called would make their statements and be examined by the laymen who would constitute the committee?  In such a case I am inclined to think that the only result would be that the committee <Col N="929" /> would have to decide as between expert and expert.  I do not think we will be any nearer satisfaction by such a method than we are to-day.</P>
    <P>I have tried to imagine the position that would have arisen had this scheme been proposed by a committee of Irish engineers, the details worked out and presented to the public as this scheme has been presented, and that the Government had said: &ldquo;Well, Irish engineers have proposed this scheme, have worked it out in detail, but we are not satisfied to take that as sufficient evidence of its practicability or its soundness.  We will call in European experts, who will examine the scheme and pronounce upon it.&rdquo;  When they have proven that, then the Dáil would require to bring in Continental experts. I cannot imagine that, and yet it is a fair parallel to what has happened in this case.  If we could dissociate the nationality, or the external origin of Siemens-Schuckert, in proposing the scheme, I think we would agree that the publicity and the examination that the scheme has had is more than would normally be given to work of the kind.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Baxter rather hinted at the truth, that it is because this scheme is novel, because it is the exercise of a new power, a new authority, that we should be very cautious; we must not do anything until we are absolutely satisfied that it is going to be a perfect success and we cannot accept the testimony of any firm such as Siemens-Schuckert, even though it is backed by unprejudiced experts.  Until all the engineers in Ireland, or the great majority of them, the great majority of business men, the great majority of farmers, are all satisfied that it is a perfectly competent scheme, we should not touch it!  I think that that is a sign of faithlessness and unwillingness to accept responsibilities that we ought not to exhibit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Figgis touched upon a point which has been frequently referred to in public, or at least similar points have been raised in opposition in public&mdash; that is, the risk from a military and engineering point of view.  For fear there may be some notice taken of that, I would remind the Dáil that so far as Dublin is concerned the risk would <Col N="930" /> have been equally great in respect to the Liffey scheme; it would be equally great for Ballyshannon and district from a Ballyshannon scheme; it would be equally ominous and horrible to Wexford, Waterford, or Kilkenny, if there were local schemes applicable to those areas.  We are not to be frightened by suggestions that there are military risks in having a centralised scheme.  The Parliamentary Secretary has dealt effectively and satisfactorily with the arguments in favour of centralisation&mdash;centralisation from the beginning, rather than a combination of local schemes which may eventually be co-ordinated and brought under one management.  There may be losses in transmission, but from what I can read and understand of the report, those are more than compensated for by the saving in capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Figgis's strongest point, I think, was the argument of cost&mdash;the delay that would be entailed between the finishing of the scheme and the consumption of the whole produce of electrical energy&mdash;and that there would be a possible charge of £300,000 a year. Supposing there were!  It is a large sum, but if Deputy Figgis's faith in the utilisation of electrical energy for the country is justified, if it is to be of value, 2/- per head of the population per annum is not a big price to pay for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not that rather neglecting my argument?  My point was that the development will come, but such development has always proved in other countries to be very slow and, therefore, the method to be chosen should be one that would not place that financial burden.  It is not that there will not be development; it is the rate at which that development will come.</P>

      <P>I understand the argument, but I am taking it as proved that the rate of development will be faster with the lower price of power. The bigger and the more national in its character this scheme is, the greater the impulse for the utilisation of electricity. The fashion, if I may say so, the habit, of using electricity will grow <Col N="931" /> very much more rapidly under a big national scheme than it will by a number of smaller local schemes&mdash;a succession of local schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point of view&mdash;it is a question of faith, perhaps a question of experience.  We are surely going to take some benefit from the experience of other people.  Utilisation of electrical power in domestic affairs, even in industrial affairs, is very modern&mdash;comparatively new.  I think that we are justified in saying that the rate of increase is not going to be as slow in future anywhere as it has been in the past.  The demand for electrical power in Dublin to-day is growing faster than it did ten years ago, and with every increase in the number of users for a long time to come there will be a still greater proportionate increase.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The desire even for electricity to-day is greater in Ireland than the desire for sugar candy. While it may be true that people are still more desirous of luxuries of a personal character than luxuries of a wider and social character, I nevertheless believe that we ought to set our minds upon the development of the use of electrical energy for as many purposes as possible; to strain our efforts to bring electrical energy to the people at as low a price as possible, and that it is easily worth the £300,000 that Deputy Figgis speaks of as a sum that the country cannot afford.  I maintain that it would be very well worth while for the country to take that upon itself even as a perpetual charge, for the social benefit as well as the industrial benefit that would be derived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect to the Bill, the proposal is in a general way to authorise the Minister to acquire such property, to do such things as he deems to be necessary within certain conditions, to generate electrical power and to supply <Col N="932" /> that electrical power to the public.  I am prepared to support that proposition. Having had before me in much more detail than I ever expect to get again in any other scheme of the kind, the methods whereby the Minister proposes to carry on this work which he asks for authorisation to do, I think the Bill should have a Second Reading.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested some question regarding Section 14, and defended the section as one that he wanted to have as a stand-by in case he were overcharged&mdash;in case there were excessive demands made upon him.  But I want to support that section specifically and heartily, because it does clearly introduce what is an essential clause in any such Bill.  That is to say, that where by State action, by communal action, by the action of the Government or the people in their corporate capacity&mdash; where the State or a municipality improves the value of lands or property, then there is something due by the owners of these lands and property to the community.  That is to say, the principle of betterment is rightly embodied in this Bill.  I do not think the Minister has any occasion to apologise, or to deal gingerly, shall I say, in justifying the introduction of this section. It is an essential section in any such measure.  I think the Acquisition of Land Act, which is at present the law of this State, embodies such a general clause in respect to lands taken by public bodies.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Dáil to agree to the Second Reading of the Bill.  Any question such as that Deputy Cooper raised as to representation from interests that feel themselves aggrieved will naturally come forward on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I do not know what the Minister proposes in regard to the Committee Stage, whether he intends that the Bill should be discussed in Committee of the whole House, or submitted to a Special Committee. I have no doubt that all the interests Deputy Cooper mentioned as possibly feeling aggrieved will be able to find spokesmen amongst the various Deputies.  I have no doubt that when these spokesmen are heard, and when a case is made, it will receive proper attention, <Col N="933" /> and that no injustice will be done.  I hope the House will pass the Bill, and that it will become law long before, if possible, the Dáil adjourns, and that the 28th July will not find us waiting to report a Bill of this kind, which has then to go to the Seanad, and then, perhaps, be referred back to the Dáil, only to become law some time next year.  I would hope that the public interests would be served so well that interest in the electrification of the country would be rapidly generated long before this time next year; that the work will be set on foot, and that we shall see before this summer is through something in the way of the beginnings of the work preparatory to the electrification of the Irish Free State.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to detain the House very long, because I agree very much with the view taken by the Minister, that, on the general principle of the Shannon scheme, we had our Second Reading debate on the 2nd and 3rd April.  That, perhaps, might be put a little further&mdash;that, on the general principle of the Siemens-Schuckert scheme, the Minister might be justified in saying we had our Second Reading debate on those dates. But I think if that were said it would be true on the understanding that the House then believed it would have its Committee Stage of debate on that scheme.  I do not propose at all to go over the same ground, or even similar ground, which I tried to cover on the 3rd April, but I wish to spend a few moments in pleading for more time in the consideration of this measure.  I tried then to show that I did not think all the difficulties in the Siemens-Schuckert scheme had been fully considered. I am of the same opinion still. I think I am correctly quoting the Minister when, after he was good enough to express appreciation of remarks I had made, he said he hoped that such criticism would receive the fullest attention of the best engineering experts that he could get during the next month.  I had hoped that he would have prefaced his remarks to-night by giving the result of that investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of that I drew the attention of the Dáil to the fact that he made his <Col N="934" /> speech in introducing the Second Reading of the Bill this evening practically without any reference whatever to the Siemens-Schuckert scheme.  I ask the Dáil to consider, in viewing this Bill, that that was more or less inevitable from his point of view.</P>
    <P>It is, no doubt, true&mdash;I am sure the Minister would say so&mdash;that the Bill is based on the assumption that the Government are going to put into operation the Siemens-Schuckert scheme. But all that the Bill does&mdash;and this is what the Dáil ought to consider&mdash;is to empower the Government to put into operation a scheme, or schemes if you like, for operating the power of the Shannon.  It does not say so in so many words that it is the Siemens-Schuckert scheme.  They might, when this Bill is passed, it seems to me, enter into a contract with Siemens-Schuckert the next day, they might decide to have further inquiry into it if they thought the responsibilities on their shoulders were too much to proceed immediately, or they might proceed to get other schemes.  But the Bill simply empowers them to use the Shannon scheme, and I suggest to the Dáil, in going through that Bill in Committee, it will hardly be possible at any stage to go into details of the Siemens-Schuckert scheme itself. We will simply have to consider section after section, the question as to whether we should or should not empower the Minister to carry out certain works, not a particular scheme at all.  If we give this Bill a Second Reading immediately we shall not have any time or opportunity of giving, on the Committee Stage, that consideration to the Siemens-Schuckert scheme that I think we were looking forward to on the 2nd and 3rd April, and in the expectation of which some of us simply held our hands.</P>
    <P>I find myself rather in a difficult position to explain, and I am not sure that I shall explain my exact position. I do not follow Deputy Figgis in his attempt to raise again the question of a partial scheme <i>versus</i> a national scheme.  I think that was settled by the decision on the 3rd of April.  I do not even follow Deputy Heffernan to the full in his claim to have this scheme considered by a committee, because I <Col N="935" /> recognise the truth of what has been urged, that none of us is really capable of going into the details of this scheme in a proper way.</P>
    <P>I do not to that extent go with the other Deputies, but I do feel that in many ways, in discussions outside and in the Press by engineers, difficulties and even dangers in this scheme have been pointed to which require investigation on our part as the Dáil before we can give our assent to this scheme. We should not be doing our duty to the nation as a Dáil if we were to hand over this responsibility to the Government saying &ldquo;Let the blood be on your own heads; you are to take responsibility.&rdquo; I do not think we have given sufficient time to the consideration of those difficulties and dangers to pass this scheme in all its completeness without a little further debate, because, as I have said, we shall really not be considering this matter when we come to go into this Bill in Committee.  I do not think the stage is yet reached when we should go so far. I do not go completely with Deputy Heffernan, because I do not claim that we can satisfy ourselves on all the details. I think Deputy O'Sullivan was perfectly right in that.  But still we cannot lose sight of the perspective; we have responsibilities and duties, and the question to my mind is, have we done so far our full part?  I cannot persuade myself at this stage that we have inquired into this scheme sufficiently from the point of view of a representative assembly of the nation.  I cannot satisfy myself of that.  I feel if we agree to-night to this Second Reading we shall be putting too much responsibility upon the shoulders of the Government in this matter.  Difficulties have been put forward, urged and argued; I do not know yet that these difficulties have ever been put up to the experts for their answer.  No doubt the Government may say &ldquo;We will do that before we actually put this scheme in hands.&rdquo;  But after this Bill passes, the Minister for Industry and Commerce may sign the contract with Siemens-Schuckert and then it will be too late.  I hope he will correct me if I am wrong in that assumption.  That <Col N="936" /> is what the Bill actually empowers him to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The assumption is perfectly sound, but I am afraid that there is an implication that is perfectly unsound, that is that I would sign a contract leaving amateurs to carry out this scheme, which really must be carried out by engineers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not wish to insinuate in any way the question of amateurs, or that they would be brought in.  My point was this, that when the contract came to be carried out, the fullest inquiry must be made on special points as they arise. Then it may turn out that there were many real engineering dificulties which had been merely foreshadowed in the discussion that has taken place up to the present, and that these might turn out to be real difficulties which might make the scheme impossible, and that then it would be too late after the contract had been signed to make such additional enquiries as might be made at the present time.  As I said, I do not think that personally I have got to the stage at which I could vote for the Second Reading.  I want to make my position clear.  I think more time ought to be given, and that the time given now into a full inquiry into the scheme from its engineering point of view and its economic point of view will be well spent time, and will tend in the end to the real success of the scheme. I am not opposing it; I am asking for a fuller inquiry of some kind and a fuller investigation.  I leave it to the Government to settle in what way they will have that investigation carried out. I will leave it to them to satisfy the engineers in the difficulties they have raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not content myself to brush aside those difficulties and to say that they are difficulties they have been raised from interested or other motives. I do not think many of them are.  I think many of them are put forward in perfect good faith and I ask the Government to have those difficulties considered and answered, and even submitted to the experts who have made their report and get their reply, and <Col N="937" /> have a discussion of those difficulties before they really ask us to pledge ourselves to this scheme, and to give them carte blanche to go ahead.</P>

      <P>We have now, as I believe.  a composite amendment, phrased either as Deputy Figgis phrased it, or, in the alternative, as Deputy Heffernan slightly amended it. Deputy Figgis was wise enough not to attempt to advance any argument as to why his special type of committee should be considered; he simply went on the  which he afterwards admitted, that this whole thing is a question of delay.  &ldquo;Let us have delay.&rdquo; Deputy Baxter put a further addition which Deputy Figgis was sincere enough not to put in&mdash;an appeal for further consideration. Deputy Figgis left out &ldquo;for further consideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I asked Deputy Figgis a question, in interruption, about one matter about which I am specially concerned.  He alluded to the sum of £5,200,000, and to the amount of the annual charge the State might have to meet by reason of the deficiency in the revenue-producing power of the plant after a certain period.  I asked him did he realise that the £5,200,000 included the amount estimated by the experts to cover the loss during the period in which it would not be revenue producing.  He made an evasive answer to that.</P>
      <P>As far back as the 19th December last I made a preliminary statement on the Shannon scheme.  That night I circulated to Deputies, and Deputies had in their possession, a certain typescript. Deputy Figgis had that.  One phrase in that typescript is this: &ldquo;At the end of about five years a profit will be obtainable after full interest has been paid on the capital.  Fifteen per cent. addition to the cost is included in the above-mentioned capital of £5,200,000 and £7,870,000 respectively to cover the interest during the period of construction, as also the insufficiency in interest in the first four working years.&rdquo;  I emphasise the words &ldquo;fifteen per cent. addition to the cost is included.&rdquo; for on the 28th of the month the following appeared in a letter to the &ldquo;Sunday Times&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="938" /> Let us come down to the simple issue of practicability&mdash;in other words, to the very mundane consideration of finance.  The Siemens proposal, one learns, is to begin with a development costing, with transmission lines over the whole country, some £5,200,000...  In addition, a matter of fifteen per cent. is to be added to these prime costs to cover the period during which the demand is being built up to sustain the available supply.</P>
    <P>Nine days after Deputy Figgis, as Deputy of the Dáil, received that typescript saying that this fifteen per cent. to which he refers is included in the £5,200,000, he writes anonymously, as Special Correspondent, to the &ldquo;Sunday Times,&rdquo; in which he makes that glaring error.  He now for the first time comes into the full light of day with something that approaches very nearly to that.  I allude to that article in the &ldquo;Sunday Times&rdquo; for that reason.  It was written anonymously, and it was written in England, and even if Deputy Figgis signed the article in England, where he is not so well known as he is here, there might be some reliance placed on what he says.</P>
    <P>He said here to-night, however&mdash;and he has the disadvantage of saying it here as from himself&mdash;much the same thing, showing a complete disregard of what the experts have definitely stated, that there is an admission that through three years' building period and some years afterwards, the plant could not be estimated to be fully productive so as to pay its way, and to the sum they had estimated as the proper cost of building they added fifteen per cent. to cover the loss.  The conclusion that anybody must draw from reading their account, if one accepts their figures as to consumption as reliable, is that this when built out will effect the great change that the whole Shannon Supply scheme must effect in this country without the cost of a single penny to the Exchequer.  Instead of that we have Deputy Figgis and his statement, as I said, made personally here in the House, and as coming from Deputy Figgis openly it is of less harm than made anonymously through the columns of the English Press.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not going to change his ground; the Deputy had in his hand on the 19th December a typescript which stated that in the sum of £5,200,000 was included the fifteen per cent.  On the 28th of that month he wrote to the English Press that, in addition to the £5,200,000, a matter of fifteen per cent. would be added.  That shows the reliability of the Deputy.  Note that that statement of his, which he now confesses to be erroneous, has remained uncontradicted in the Sunday Press.  I wonder has he just discovered this evening that the £5,200,000 includes that, and that there has not to be added to that fifteen per cent.?  I think I can leave that matter there. The Deputy refers to an anonymous military engineer who said something to him in London.  I do not know what <Col N="940" /> the Deputy poses as in London.  He may be the military engineer himself for all we know.  He read out a further anonymous statement, and I am going to suggest to him where that statement came from.  I made a suggestion, and I lead up to it in this way, that people who have observed the Deputy in this House will know his ordinary method of debate&mdash;that he has the habit of re-issuing in the garb of a personal philosophic discovery or with some sort of exegetical gloss the most casual remark that a Deputy will have made before him; and this is very much on the same lines.  The experts have stated all that he read out of that document.</P>
      <P>They were asked to report on the Siemens-Schuckert scheme as compared with any alternative of providing power in the Free State.  The experts were asked to examine the proposals in the light of the White Paper, and they did so, and they say&mdash;and I would like this to be compared with the recollection of what Deputies may have of what Deputy Figgis read out&mdash;&ldquo;The experts are aware that the Free State has not a very large quantity of water power which can be developed. Accordingly, in setting out a plan for energy, a pre-eminently suitable line of power development must be followed. Above all, no partial exploitation of a water power ought to be carried out which makes a full development later impossible from an economic viewpoint. On the other hand, for the start, no plant should be built which cannot be adapted to growing demands.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another portion of the report states: &ldquo;The experts have already emphasised the fact that the Irish Free State does not contain any considerable quantity of water power, as the fall conditions in the country are comparatively unfavourable. Accordingly, it is necessary to work out the plan for the supply of energy in the most conscientious manner, so that it will be possible to exploit, to the full, the economic water power available in proportion as the demand for it develops.&rdquo;  I could read further; that shows the judgment by the experts, a judgment passed upon certain things which was very much in <Col N="941" /> line with what Deputy Figgis read out from his anonymous statement.  I said here that I would suggest who wrote it.  I am going to suggest a composite name that will represent the ambition of one of the authors&mdash;with the engineering experience of the other.  I would suggest that it was written by &mdash;I will put it in this way&mdash;Deputy Sir John Purser Figgis.</P>

      <P>I am answered on that point.  Let me continue on this matter of the further alternative of providing power.  Even so long ago as the 19th December, I definitely read out a second statement in addition to the statement which was put in typescript into the Deputy's hands.  That was to the effect that the experts had examined the proposals put before them for the exploitation of the water power of the country, and that they had definitely and positively come down in favour of the Shannon scheme which is now to be developed.  The Deputy hints, as a counter to that, that they had not time to examine this question. They should have been the best judges as to the time they required for the solution of any problem put before them, and I heard no complaint from them with regard to time.  Perhaps there may have been one thing, and that was the question of the time that was occupied in the translation of the document.  In deference to their wishes, I brought before this Dáil on the 19th December merely a fragment of their report.  I had the report in full in my hands at the time, but it was not revised to the last item.</P>

I really suggested no period to them, and, as a matter of fact, the period they had arranged to produce their document in the first instance was lengthened owing to the proceedings of the Private Bill Committee, so that they had ample time at their disposal, if I am to judge by the absence of any complaint from them.  Deputy Heffernan thinks this report is not thoroughly reliable.  That is the statement from a Deputy who said at the beginning that he did not thoroughly understand the report.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The first intimation my Department has had that Thomas Collins, of Ballyglass, Kilsallagh, Castlerea, was unemployed and desired to claim benefit was a letter dated the 28th October last, in which he enquired why he was not in receipt of benefit.  There was no record at the Employment Exchange of any claim to benefit having been lodged by Mr. Collins, or of any communication from him expressing a desire to claim benefit and he was so informed in a communication addressed to him by the Manager of the Athlone Employment Exchange on the 29th October, to which he replied that he had applied for benefit about the 25th of August, but was unable to state the date on which he had forwarded his Unemployment Book or the number thereof.  He was informed on the 3rd November that no communication in connection with a claim to benefit had been received from him prior to the 28th October, and that his claim would be dated from that date.  The necessary forms to enable him to make a claim were duly despatched to him accordingly. These forms were returned improperly completed and had to be sent back to the applicant several times for amendment.  It transpired later that Collins was actually in permanent employment on the 28th October, and that the period for which he was claiming benefit was that running from the 25th August to the 20th September.  As it is a statutory condition for the receipt of benefit that a period of unemployment shall not have been deemed to have commenced until a claim has been made in the prescribed manner it is regretted that there is no legal power to pay benefit to Mr. Collins for the period in question.</P>
