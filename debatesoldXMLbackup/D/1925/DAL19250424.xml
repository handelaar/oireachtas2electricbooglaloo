      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that much inconvenience and dissatisfaction are caused by the failure to reply to or acknowledge letters sent to his Department by Deputies and members of the public, and if he will take steps to remedy this state of affairs.</P>

      <P>The general practice is to acknowledge letters immediately on their receipt in the Department, and replies are sent as soon as practicable.  If the Deputy will furnish me with particulars of any case in which there has been cause for complaint through the absence of acknowledgment or reply, I shall have inquiry made.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister take it that this is a general complaint? I am quite sure that five-sevenths of the Deputies would confirm the complaint that the Deputy makes in that question.  It has been a complaint both from the Deputies and from the public in respect of his Department, that they cannot get answers, or even acknowledgments, to their letters.</P>

      <P>I could deal with the matter much better if I had specific cases.  Deputies should know that sometimes there is an enormous mass of correspondence.  I know that on several days recently when I made inquiry <Col N="248" /> there were letters to the extent of 2,500 per day coming into my Department. Naturally, a certain amount of delay will take place, and I really would have to have a specific instance to know if there was unreasonable delay. You cannot put in a permanent staff to deal with an occasional spate of correspondence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Four firms are authorised by me to trade in industrial explosives.  Their stocks are stored in military custody at the Magazine in the Phoenix Park.  Quarrymen and road contractors requiring supplies must obtain a certificate from the local Superintendent of the Gárda Síochána authorising issues.  They then apply to one of the licensed dealers, who in turn arranges with the Chief Ordnance Officer at the Magazine for the transfer of the required quantity to the military barracks nearest the place of explosion. Ordinarily a mixed escort of troops and Gárdaí take the explosives to the quarry and wait until it has been used. Changes in the existing procedure are under immediate consideration with a view to obviating delays which have been occurring in meeting the needs of quarrymen and others in certain districts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that that method which he has just described puts enormous expense on the ordinary small road contractor &mdash;to the extent, in one case which came under my notice recently, of about 10/- per shot fired?  He has to supply a motor car to bring the troops out a few miles, and he has to supply a motor car to bring the troops back?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he will state the cause of the delay in having the County Home at Trim, Co.

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my answer to Deputy Mulvaney on this subject on the 10th ultimo.  The inspection made subsequently showed that the number in the county home was not abnormal and did not result in undue congestion, but steps were taken to have a spare room provided in case of necessity.  The delay in carrying out the work referred to by the Deputy seems to be due to the action of the Board of Health in the choice of a clerk of works.  I understand, however, that the Board have now given notice that they will appoint a clerk of works at their meeting this month.</P>

If that were done they would find that most of the increases in salaries have been proposed not by the small farmers but by the representatives of the Farmers' Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>A loan of £10,000 was originally sanctioned for improvements at the County Hospital, Navan.  Application for tenders was invited, and the lowest tender received by the Board of Health was £20,900.  An expenditure of this amount was considered excessive. The Board of Health decided upon certain omissions from the estimate, which reduced the cost of the improvements to be undertaken on the basis of the lowest tender received to a sum of £12,179 17s. 6d.  I was satisfied that the efficiency of the hospital would not be interfered with to any great extent by the reduction in the estimate, and approval was given to the carrying out of the work, for which a further supplemental loan of £3,000 was sanctioned&mdash;a total expenditure of £13,000.</P>
      <P>The Board of Health now propose to revert to the original proposal.  In view of the heavy expenditure already incurred, I am not prepared to sanction a further loan of £8,000 for works that are not really essential to the efficiency of the institution, but consideration will be given to expenditure upon the proper lighting of the hospital if not covered by the loans already sanctioned.</P>

Will the Minister state, having regard to this answer, what became of the books?

This programme contemplates adjournment on the 26th June, and it is proposed to take stock of the position at the end of three or four weeks with a view to seeing what legislation we must push to a conclusion and what measures may remain over in one stage or another until the Autumn Session.</P>

      <P>I am afraid we could not very well agree to taking private members' time next week on Wednesday and Friday.  Deputy Baxter has a motion down of very great import and consequence to large sections of the agricultural community.  Inasmuch as it is essentially a question of relief, we <Col N="259" /> want the question debated.

      <P>Apart from the question of Deputy Baxter's motion, the arrangement made with the Committee on Privileges was that Estimates be taken every Wednesday and Thursday.  The Minister for Finance now points out that it will be necessary to take the Report Stage of the Financial Resolutions on Wednesday week. These Resolutions must be reported within a certain time.  He proposes, if the Committee finishes to-day, to take the Report Stage on next Wednesday week, so that for that particular week the Financial Resolutions will take the place of the Estimates.  That is inevitable. With regard to Resolution 13, the Minister desires to know whether it is agreed that the question be put before four o'clock.  If that is not agreed, he will, he states, move to sit late.  Is there any objection to the question being put before four o'clock?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Dáil reported progress last night I was putting the case that, in the changed circumstances, farmers would have to put forward a demand for protection. I put forward the argument that we had to sell the greater bulk of our produce in a free trade country, but when we are purchasing we have to buy in a restricted market.  In addition, the home market for our produce, which turns in a considerable sum to the agricultural community, is also subject to this disability, and we are oppressed in that case by free trade, with the result that the dice and the balance have been loaded against us, <Col N="262" /> and it is impossible to carry on on those conditions.  We have, therefore, to face an altered situation, and demand tariffs for our products.  In putting tariffs on any agricultural commodity, the great consideration must be to benefit the majority of those engaged in the production of the commodity.  Therefore, I submit that a tariff on the articles I have suggested, such as barley, malt, butter, bacon, and oats will, of necessity, benefit in some degree&mdash;I am speaking in a relative sense&mdash;the greater portion of the agricultural community. I want to reiterate this point. We are not departing from the principle of free trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We realise that the disability abroad remains, but in justice to ourselves we cannot continue to sell in a free foreign market and purchase in a protected and restricted market at home.  That cannot be done.  We take strong exception to the duty on clothes.  It is no exaggeration to say that we are entitled, if other people are protected in a home market, to the same protection, and perhaps with greater reason.  We represent the undoubted majority of the people.  The position, so far as I see it, is this, that a relatively small industrial population have secured by the imposition of tariffs, both this year and last year, an appreciable advantage, because they compel the bulk of the community to purchase from them, relatively speaking, at their own price. They are protected up to 15 per cent. on the sale price, and that is a very large protection.  I submit that the least that farmers are entitled to in these altered conditions is equal privileges and rights.  I am prepared to say, in this instance, that while protection will not of necessity, even if the Minister for Finance were to adopt my suggestion and put on a reasonable tariff, say 15 per cent., on the commodities I have mentioned&mdash;I put that forward as a tentative figure&mdash;mean that full advantage of protection will accrue to us.  I maintain that there will be rather a levelling up of prices to us, that perhaps profiteers and those engaged in the distribution and handling of our commodities rather than those engaged in the rearing, say, of pigs, will <Col N="263" /> obtain an unfair advantage.  The position necessarily must be that certain benefits must accrue to us.  We do not, as I repeat, get 100 per cent. out of the value of the proposed tariffs.</P>
    <P>The position would at least be like this.  There would be a certain levelling up of prices in the country and we would certainly obtain our share of the home market.  Perhaps it would be well to give some comparative figures as regards the home market.  Take, for instance, bacon.  The amount of bacon, in value, imported last year was £1,806,000.  Our exports of live pigs was in value £1,177,000, cured bacon £3,139,000, fresh pork £961,000, roughly giving £5,200,000 as the value of the export pig trade.  It is difficult in the absence of reliable figures to determine what percentage of pigs are killed for home consumption.  This fact must stand out, namely, that especially in the West of Ireland the practice has been to sell fat pigs and buy American bacon.  In other words, the farmer, by adopting a lower standard of living, sells his home-grown article, buys American bacon at a cheaper rate, and endeavours to subsist on the difference. That is one of the items which help to balance the farmers' budget in the West.  Therefore, if we obtain control of the home market in bacon a lot of this foreign stuff will be eliminated.  It may be contended that this American bacon would, to a large extent, be dumped in Great Britain, but I am not inclined to take that view, as, in the first place, a lot of that stuff would not be sold anywhere out of Ireland.  The English market has no use for it, and it would probably be sold to soap manufacturers if they could convert bacon into soap.  It is possible that they could use the fat in bacon for soap, but in any case American bacon would make very poor soap.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies with regard to butter.  Large imports, amounting to over £700,000, I think, come from Denmark and the British Colonies yearly.  In view of the altered position, inasmuch as the Government has embarked on tariffs, we have a right to demand an equal share of whatever spoil is going around.  One great difficulty, <Col N="264" /> as far as I can see, is that we cannot, of course, influence to any extent the foreign market, but there is a possibility that by the increased demand which should be created at home, exports would be diminished, and as a consequence of the scarcity that would follow abroad, prices might tend to rise.  That, however, is a question on which we cannot be dogmatic.  Some Deputies last night were inclined to think that we were doctrinaire free traders, as it were.  We are no such thing.  We worship nothing in the cold abstract.  It is a question of expediency, in the widest and most generous sense, with us every time.  Deputy O'Sullivan expressed surprise, and the Deputy is a philosopher whose calm it is difficult to disturb, that Deputy Wilson should have advocated tariffs.  Deputy Wilson is a business man, and he must adapt himself to business conditions and circumstances.  He does not hold on to theories and dogmas, and rightly so.  There is one point Deputy Johnson raised on this question, and that is whether the tax should be on tea, which was not a natural product of the country, or whether it was better to put the tax on certain articles imported which could be readily manufactured at home.  I think that is taking a rather narrow view of the situation. I never heard that the tax on tea was put on as a protective tax.  I am unaware that the tax on apparel is anything other than a protective tax. I have not heard that it is a revenue tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an accident, and it is not the primary consideration of the Minister for Finance. Deputy Johnson put it this way: disregarding the radical differentiation of function between the two taxes, that the tea tax is a revenue tax pure and simple, and that represents its limitation, and that the tax on apparel and those other commodities represent the idea not so much of obtaining revenue as of fostering home industry.  The Deputy did not put that forward seriously. The Deputy has perspicacity, and if he did put it forward seriously it would be an ominous sign, and I <Col N="265" /> should be sorry, as it might represent perhaps a decline in his intellect, but in putting it forward he was only pulling the leg of the House.  I concede that he was not serious in putting the two taxes on the same plane.  I am wondering in some respects what this tax on apparel means.  I protested against it last night in common with my colleagues.  The bulk of the community may receive advantage from the lower tax on tea and sugar, but it is a question to be determined to what extent the benefits accruing from the reduction of the tax on tea and sugar will be counterbalanced by the increased cost of living.  That is a question for an actuary, and I cannot go into it at the moment.  It is well worth studying.  As far as I can see, the immediate effect will be an advance in price, and that on a population who are put to great difficulties in order to live.  You segregate a section of the cloth-dealing trade.  You ignore altogether the spinners and weavers, the people who turn the wool into the finished cloth, and concentrate your attention on those who convert the cloth into apparel; in other words, the tailoring section.  I am afraid that is a proposition that would not be favourably entertained in many parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister did not take the opinion of the people on this great question.  Before embarking on tariffs a mandate should be got from the people.  We certainly had no mandate in 1923 for tariffs, and the elections subsequent to 1923 did not indicate, as far as tariffs go, the state of public opinion.  The elections have been fought more or less on the question of the stability of the Constitution, rather than on concrete economic propositions, and it would be well perhaps that the State should, within a year or so, appeal to the people on the question of tariffs.  We who oppose tariffs can have no cause of complaint if the people endorse by a majority the policy of tariffs.  An aspect to be borne in mind is the effect on the distributive trade as regards the industries concerned. It is a well-known fact to many Deputies that the large stores in Dublin are carrying on under exceptional <Col N="266" /> difficulties, and that unemployment amongst shop assistants is rife. Does the Minister believe that by enforcing tariffs he will in the immediate future increase employment?  As far as I can see, the effect would be to diminish the prospects of employment, because for some time to come people will buy less clothes.  Remember, every article of apparel is included, whether it is being produced in Ireland, or whether at any future time it is possible to manufacture it here.  Silk, and other things of which there is no immediate prospect of manufacture here, come under these taxes.  That will be the effect of restriction certainly on sales in the great distributive houses.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly that must happen, and what it will lead to is diminished employment for the hands engaged.  It must necessarily mean, also, an increase in prices, seeing that there are certain overhead charges which these establishments will have to bear.  The establishments, of course, will have to earn at least living profits to enable them to exist.  This tariff must mean that their percentage of profits will have to go up, and one effect of that will be to diminish sales.  It is a well-known fact that, as a result of the tax imposed by the Minister last year, the distributive houses engaged in the boot trade had to calculate in advance the profits which came to them through the operation of the tariff.  In other words, a pair of boots invoiced at 20/- became, under the tariff, 23/-.  They did not calculate their profits on the old price of 20/-, but started to calculate them on the 23/-.  That is a notorious fact. The question remains: to what extent and how long can this country carry on a system of tariffs?  Deputy Davin last night raised a question about the taxation on motor vehicles.  I understand, though I may be misinformed, that a committee of the Road Advisory Board is dealing with this question, and as the matter is <i>sub judice</i> it is scarcely fair, perhaps, to debate it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not an import duty; it is the road tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that a committee has been appointed to consider the duty imposed for the ordinary running of cars.  Deputy Davin surely <Col N="267" /> knows the views of the farmers on that. They have often found expression here. There has been no radical departure from their policy to get the tax off motor lorries and put it on petrol. There is another matter I wish to deal with, and it is that an excise duty of five shillings is to be paid on every dog. It seems to me that we are progressing in this instance.  Four or five years ago the duty was 2/-, plus 6d. for the stamp.  Then the duty was doubled, making it four shillings, with the cost of the stamp at 6d. extra.  About two years ago or so the Government, without any legislative authority as far as I can discover, put a tax of five shillings on dogs.  It was scarcely fair, I think, to the Oireachtas, to do a thing like that.  It represented an attempt on the part of the Executive to arrogate to themselves functions that had not been conferred on them by statute, and they are now endeavouring to legalise this thing.  As regards this new duty of five shillings, I want to know if the document given as a receipt will still require, in addition, a sixpenny stamp. It is well known, of course, that farmers require to keep dogs for the protection of their flocks.  Therefore, they are opposed to the idea that the dog tax should be increased over what it was two years ago.</P>

      <P>This Budget is one which is to provide for the coming year.  We have here a statement of the expenditure for the past year, and an estimate of the expenditure for the year that is to come.  I do not know if ever there was a Chancellor of the Exchequer who received more universal approbration than our Minister for Finance has received on this occasion. If I may say so, it is indeed a fair Budget.  I only trust that it is not going to be a fair-weather one.  The Minister for Finance has succeeded in helping most classes in the country, but I fear he has also hit them.  I find here, on this White Paper, that our estimated expenditure for the coming year is £30,000,000, and, minus what are termed non-recurrent and abnormal items, the total amount you get is £24,000,000.  In the few remarks I have to make, I desire to focus attention <Col N="268" /> upon those figures.  The sum of £24,000,000 is to be our expenditure for next year.  With our population of about three millions, that will mean that the cost per head of the population for the Government of this country will be £8.  Perhaps it is no harm to direct the attention of the Dáil to the fact that in Denmark, a State which is often brought up here for comparison with ours, the cost per head of its Government at this moment is £4.  I am not saying that we should be able, or that the present Minister for Finance should be able, to bring the cost of the Free State Government down to that of Denmark, but I think it is well to draw public attention to this gigantic figure, and in doing so to show the urgent necessity for economy in the future; also in showing that necessity to support the proposal made yesterday by Deputy Cooper and made by myself and several other Deputies during the course of the last year, namely, the setting up of a Committee of financial experts to go into the Estimates and expenditure of the country. The setting up of that Committee would in no way hinder the Minister for Finance.  On the contrary, it should be of every assistance to him.  It would relieve him of a considerable amount of trouble, if not of responsibility, and I can see no reason why he should not accede to that request.</P>
      <P>Now, in bringing forward a Budget there are two main things that have to be considered: One is whether there is a possibility of remission of taxation, and the other is whether there is any need for fresh taxation.  I am delighted, with other Deputies, and I am sure the country in general, to welcome the remissions, especially upon tea and sugar, which the Minister has been pleased to grant, or to suggest, but the objection I take to the whole framework of this Budget is this: That while these remissions are just, and, while it is expedient that they should be made, I am not in favour of making remissions, and at the same time imposing because these remissions are made, and in order to be able to make them, new and fresh taxation.  These remissions, especially the remission on sugar, will be of great benefit to the general community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> Now there is one little caveat that I would like to put in about these remissions. I would like to have some assurance from the Minister that the benefit of these remissions will reach the consumer because anyone acquainted with taxation and remissions knows that when taxation is imposed the consumer will always have to pay the extra, if not the greater, increase, but when a tax is remitted very often the remission never reaches the consumer at all.  It may be that in the next few weeks, or the next few months, the price of tea will drop in the Free State, but have we got any guarantee, or can we have any assurance, from the Minister for Finance that he will see that after that period the London market, where all tea is bought, will not be so manipulated that the price of tea will not be less in the Free State than elsewhere but will be precisely the same as before?  I am afraid not.  But if the Minister can do anything in that direction I think it would be of great value.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about the new duties being protective duties.  I must confess I do not consider them protective duties for one moment.  The last speaker said that they differed from the tea duty because they were in reality protective duties.  I immediately counter that statement; I say they are not protective duties at all. These duties are put on for one purpose, and one purpose only, and that is to supply the deficit in revenue due to the remissions made.  Only last night Deputy Professor O'Sullivan said that in answer to Deputy Wilson.  First of all he pointed out the similarity of the two sums of £600,000 for the additional agricultural grant, and the sum of £615,000 from added revenue from the new duties.  He pointed out the similarity, and he asked how are we going to get this £600,000 for the increased agricultural grant, and, of course, he pointed to the £615,000 which is to be raised from the new duties.  That let the cat out of the bag.  These duties are for one purpose, and that is for revenue purposes.</P>
    <P>As everyone knows, an import duty imposed for protective purposes cannot <Col N="270" /> be at the same time or for any length of time a revenue-producing duty, because the one destroys the other.  If it continues to be a fruitful revenue-producing duty, it is no use as a protective duty, and if it ceases to be a revenue-producing duty, then it may be of some use as a protective duty.  But here is a case of these new duties placed upon certain articles merely for the reason that I say, of supplementing the deficit due to the extent of the remissions made.</P>
    <P>I welcome the remissions, as I said before, but at the same time personally I would prefer that less remissions were made and no new duties imposed.  The new duties have taken the form of duties upon wearing apparel.  It was very nice of the Minister to give what Deputy Johnson describes as a free breakfast table, but poor people have to wear clothes as well as to eat food and drink tea, and this duty upon wearing apparel will hit the poor as much as, if not more than, they hit the rich, because this is a duty not on clothes made to order but on ready-made clothes.  It is a duty, as somebody said yesterday, I think, upon everything bar the collar stud that is worn upon the person.  The farm labourer and the ordinary artisan will require sufficient clothing equally if not more so as they will require tea, and to remit the duty upon one article which is not altogether a necessity and to impose the duty upon another article which is a necessity is doing something that I do not consider to be sound policy.  The question will yet remain to be seen whether the advantage to be derived from the remission of the old duties will outweigh the disadvantage from the imposition of fresh taxes.  I very much doubt it.  Only last year we remitted the tax upon tea by 4d., and yet the cost of living went up from 90 to 95. What is there to show that during the coming year, having remitted the tax altogether on tea and having imposed fresh taxes upon other articles, that the cost of living will not also go up?  I cannot see anything to prevent it.  As far as the tea duty is concerned, of course it will be very beneficial to everybody, but the benefit is not going <Col N="271" /> to be of such wonderful dimensions as people are inclined to think.</P>
    <P>Only yesterday I was making inquiries from the head of the catering department in one of our principal Dublin hospitals, and I said I supposed that he and his committee would benefit very much from this remission of the tea duties.  &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not so much as you think.&rdquo;  I said &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we consume about £50 worth of tea in the month.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;Will not the remission of the duty be a considerable reduction in your expenditure?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it will.&rdquo;&ldquo;But how much do you think?&rdquo; I asked, and he answered, &ldquo;About £20 per annum.&rdquo;  That is what it will mean to that hospital.  But then, the hospital will have to pay more for other things.  They will have to pay more for their bedding and more for clothing for their patients and their nurses.</P>

      <P>I am not dealing with sugar now.  They will, of course, pay less for sugar undoubtedly. What I object to is not taking off the tea or sugar duty, but imposing fresh taxation at the same time.  It would be better if the Minister in order to balance his Budget, having a surplus of £1,967,622 at his disposal, had used that for the remission of existing taxation and had not imposed any fresh duty.  That would have only meant a difference of £615,000.  It would be all right if these duties were protective duties.  What are they?  They are duties in regard to the manufacture of certain articles in the Saorstát.  The furniture industry, as we know, is a very small one here.  There may be a chance that it will revive after some time.  But does anybody suggest that we are going to manufacture collars and shirts here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly the furniture business will not benefit the women workers much.  I think that applies to a good many others.  However it may be, the immediate object of these duties is to get revenue, and it would have been better if we had been satisfied to have taken the surplus that we have and dealt with it, instead of using up all the surplus, and more, and having to impose fresh taxes.  Mention has been made of the various taxes which have been continued, such as the motor and other taxes.  Of course, it is a good thing that the road tax is being inquired into by a committee.  As a previous speaker said, it is <i>sub judice.</i> I only wish that the motor import tax was <i>sub judice</i> also, and I would suggest to the Minister that he should form a committee to deal with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of taking what is known as the non-recurrent and abnormal items out of the estimated expenditure is a good one.  It is a pity that it was not done before this.  As to the expenditure on the Army, I confess I cannot understand what the Minister means by the normal expenditure on the Army.  The sum that he has arrived at for the purpose is £2,000,000. Does that mean that that sum is to be allocated from this on for evermore for the upkeep of the Army?  I would have preferred that he had remitted all the taxes that he has and taken another <Col N="273" /> million off the expenditure on the Army.  He could have estimated that the normal requirements of our Army in future would not be more than one million.  I do not know why it should be.  I hope we will some day reach the stage when we will not require a greater army than it will take to assist the civil authorities in any way necessary in the conduct of this State.  We do not require an army for invasion purposes.  To my mind we do not require anything but an army, if possible, based upon a territorial system, which would be of some service, if necessary, to the constituted authorities of this State.  That being so, I would have preferred if the Minister could have taken the normal expenditure of the Army at about one million. He would then have one million extra to conjure with by way of surplus, and he need not have introduced these fresh taxation proposals at all.</P>
    <P>Another point of view that strikes me is this: Would it not have been better, instead of proposing these fresh duties, if the Minister had proposed to increase the existing protection duties? We have received a paper in which is set out the number of industries, persons employed, wages, etc., in these industries which were protected by the Budget of last year.  Some of these industries have done quite well.  Would it not be better to have increased the duties on these articles, such as boots for example, rather than to have opened up quite a wide field?  Perhaps the Minister could not have opened a wider field of protection than he has by the duty upon apparel.  It is far better to have a few articles well protected and given a chance to thrive than to have many articles half protected with no chance of thriving.</P>
    <P>These being the few criticisms I desire to make, I also desire to say that I am greatly pleased with the Budget as a whole.  It is a Budget which should do good both inside and outside the Saorstát.  It should show people outside this country that we are able to conduct our affairs properly, and that we have every reason to believe that in future we are not going to be a bankrupt State.  It should have that, if not a greater effect, abroad. <Col N="274" /> Therefore, the Minister is to be congratulated upon his proposals, because undoubtedly he has not gone out of his way to benefit one class at the expense of another.  As I said before, he has, if you like, raised all classes from the ground.  He has given them, as he would describe it, a delightful &ldquo;biff&rdquo; in the eye and sent them back there again.  He has raised them up by reducing the tea and sugar duties, and he has knocked them down again by putting it on their clothes.  At any rate, we cannot be worse than the <i>status quo</i>, and I think possibly that we are better, although he has not reduced the income tax to the extent that he might have.</P>
    <P>While I am on that point I should like to draw attention to the figures as to income tax given in this paper.  I see the income tax reduction is estimated only to amount to £200,000 of a loss.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Mr. REDMOND Mr. REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Mr. REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess I find it hard to understand that figure.  If the loss is only £200,000 on 1/-, I think it is a great pity the Minister did not reduce the income tax to as low a figure as will prevail across the water.  According to his figures the Minister could have done so without a very great loss. These are the only remarks that I intend to contribute to this debate.  I think it must be a great satisfaction to the Minister to know the universal approval his proposals have met with both in the Dáil and in the country.  I hope in the coming stages of the debate, and also during the passage of the Finance Bill, that it may be possible, perhaps, to bend him somewhat, though he does seem rather unyielding at times, in the direction of a remission in other directions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>At this time of the year, the spring, the Minister for Finance presents us regularly with a dose of brimstone and treacle.  Generally speaking, the substance is more brimstone than treacle.  I think the benefits that will ensue from this Budget are very fairly distributed over all classes of the community.  The reduced income tax will be a great relief <Col N="275" /> to a very large number of people.  Income tax brings in a very large revenue and affects a certain class of farmers. The relief of rates to the extent of £600,000 must have an effect upon agriculturalists and should ease matters for them considerably.  We will no longer have such a dread of the White Paper that comes from the income tax offices, and will not look at our morning delivery of letters with such a dread of the White Paper.  In future we know that the White Paper will mean that less taxation will be dragged from our pockets.  We will no longer have such a horror of the tax collector, at any rate, as we will have a considerably less amount to pay in rates.  The remission of duty on tea, coffee, and sugar will be an immense relief to the poor people.  In fact, it will be a relief to everyone, but especially to the workers who use large quantities of tea and sugar.  It will also benefit old age pensioners and people with very limited means.  I hope that the removal of these tea duties will not lead to excessive tea drinking, as Deputy Sir James Craig will agree tea drinking can do a lot of harm if taken to excess.  However, I do not think there is any danger of that happening. I am sure that the benefit will be felt by the people, and I rejoice that the free breakfast table has become almost a reality.</P>
      <P>In going through the Budget, one naturally considers how one's own district will be affected by its proposals. In my constituency, the tax put on blankets and rugs should prove of very great benefit.  Until quite recently a very old mill, established over 100 years ago, was at work in Ballymore&mdash; Eustace.  It managed to keep working, sometimes with very great difficulty, and about 80 or 90 years ago employed 600 people.  Blankets, rugs and frieze suitings which were manufactured in this mill were very extensively used, and wore extremely well.  The tax on blankets and clothing ought to give a fillip to this and other mills, which I hope will soon be re-opened and give employment to the people in the different localities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prospect of the establishment of <Col N="276" /> a beet industry should have great possibilities for County Kildare.  I hope that it may be possible&mdash;I am sure it will be considered&mdash;to have the beet industry established somewhere in South Kildare, where the tillage farmers have been very badly hit by the bad seasons and by the low prices received for their produce.  If the farmers in that district continue to grow barley, I hope that the good barley will still be sold for malting purposes and the inferior stuff for feeding purposes. Deputy Davin alluded to the heavy lorries that are destroying the roads.  I thoroughly agree with every word he said about that.  A little while ago I mooted the question to the Minister, and I am very glad that Deputy Davin again spoke of that subject, for no one knows more about it than he does.  The effect that this is having on the railways is known to everyone who travels.  Everybody knows that these heavy lorries are practically travelling for nothing on the roads, at the expense of the ratepayers of the country, and they know they are doing much to destroy these roads.  Deputy Davin alluded to the fact that in consequence of the loss of this traffic to the railways, many of the people previously employed on the railways are leaving the country for want of employment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply referring to what Deputy Davin has alluded to. At any rate, I hope and I believe that this matter will be gone into now. There is no doubt that, at present, it is useless for the ratepayers to spend money on the roads when no sooner are they repaired than these heavy lorries come along, tear them up and destroy them.  I hope the Minister for Finance, in the Bill No. 2, which he is to bring in, will take this matter into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also an allusion to the dog tax.  I do not know whether the dog tax brings in much money, but I am greatly interested in it.  There is only 1/- additional put on.  Years ago, in the time when Mr. T.W. Russell was Vice-President of the Department of <Col N="277" /> Agriculture, I brought forward this matter.  The tax was then 2/-, and I proposed that it should be raised to 5/-.  The reason I did so was that in my district the slaughter of dogs that went on before the tax was paid was simply terrible.  Poison was laid right through the country, and very valuable dogs were destroyed.  The position was unspeakable, horrible.  I am a great lover of animals, especially of dogs, and I hold that no one should be allowed to keep an animal of the kind who cannot at least give it something to eat.  The habit of turning out dogs at night, having given them nothing to eat, to make a living for themselves, is nothing but barbarity.  These dogs destroy the neighbour's sheep.  It was on account of this that, many years ago, I brought forward this motion to try to have the dog tax raised, and it was raised to four shillings.  There was also another matter at the time which I brought forward, and what I wanted remedied still continues.  It is this: the dog tax was paid before the 31st March.  But for about a fortnight after that the guardians of the public took a considerable amount of trouble to find out the people who should pay this tax and then the activity ceased until next year.  The consequence was that about December, January, and February unlicensed dogs roamed about the country and destroyed the farmers' lambs and sheep. I did my best to press on Mr. Russell to make the tax payable on the 1st December or the 1st January.  But I did not succeed in getting it done.  I hope that the Minister will make some arrangement in regard to the date at which this tax must be paid, and that he will fix it so that this abominable habit of poisoning the country all round and destroying innocent and valuable dogs will be discontinued.  It is a most barbarous and cruel custom, and it can be easily stopped by fixing a suitable date, say, on the 1st January, as the time when the tax ought to be paid.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see that the Government do not propose to raise any more additional taxes before the General Election.  I think that is only right.  As far as any tax on cereals is concerned, I may say that I am out to oppose it.  I am glad that the Minister <Col N="278" /> has told us that nothing will be done until the country has been consulted on that point.  I think the Minister deserves well of the country for the figures and proposals he has put before us.  I hope the proposals in the Budget will work out well and advantageously for all sections of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. CONLAN Mr. CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is anything in this Budget that farmers can enthuse over.  We have a continuance of the policy of protection which, last year, was in its experimental stage. As well, we have a far-reaching expansion of the policy of protection especially under one heading, the proposed tax upon articles of clothing imported into the Saorstát.  This tax will undoubtedly increase the cost of living of numbers of our people, especially the cost of living of the small farmers who cannot, like my friend, Deputy Gorey, resort to Tooley Street, which, I believe, was the habitat of a celebrated trio.  I do not know whether they are in existence still or not.  The small farmer will be faced with the putting on of this tax on every single article of clothing required for the household. I am assured by a Deputy that that impost will even extend to his wife's umbrella.  I do not know if that is so or not.  It is true that there has been compensation offered in the way of abolition of the duty on tea and a very considerable reduction of the duty on sugar.  It must be conceded that that is a great concession.  But the new taxes on articles of clothing will counteract the benefits derived from the reduction in the breakfast table commodities. This is an aspect of the tax which will hit very strongly those households which, as Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll said, have given hostages to fortune, and this is the type of family which is a very considerable proportion of the people of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal has been said about the increase in the Agricultural Grant.  I am afraid, when you take into account the figures to which local taxation has gone, that you will find that this increase of the grant will hardly meet the situation.  In my county, Kildare, we are called upon at present to pay an increase of 1/8 in the £ over last <Col N="279" /> year's figures.  It is computed that the increase in the Agricultural Grant will come to about 1/5 in the £, so that even with the advantage that is to be gained from this increased grant we will be in a worse position in our county, at all events, than we were last year.  I may say that the figure at which our rates stand is mainly due to the fact that we have to expend enormous sums on the upkeep of the main roads of the country, a burden which should never have been placed upon the rural taxpayer. Why should we have to spend those enormous sums upon those roads? These roads should be maintained by the State.  The sub-main roads are in a scandalous state of disrepair.</P>
    <P>A good many allusions have been made to the policy of the farmers with regard to protection, and especially to the proceedings at the Farmers' Congress, and we were told that at that Congress the resolution calling for an import duty on barley was turned down.  I may state that the attitude of the majority in opposing that resolution was clearly stated.  They stated that &ldquo;whilst opposing that resolution they reserved the right to alter their point of view if the Government persisted in a policy of protection and of extending that policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With regard to barley, barley is an important crop in ten or twelve counties in the Saorstát.  Not alone is there a restricted market in the case of barley, but that market has come under the control of a monopoly.  I am very well aware that there is a lion in the path of the Government with regard to barley; I may say a very stout lion, and that they are very chary of confronting it.  Whilst we protect some very minor industries, at the same time we are allowing this monopoly to dictate the price and to force farmers to accept a price that is rapidly driving large areas of land out of cultivation. For that reason I do not put barley on the same plane as the other articles of agricultural produce, because it is in the position of having a restraint, I would say an illegal restraint, put upon its production.  It is in the hands of a gigantic trust.  Other countries have found it necessary to legislate against <Col N="280" /> trusts of this sort.  I think that is a matter that might well occupy the attention of our Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin made an allusion to some remarks that I made in Kildare with regard to this question.  He said that I said that the matter should be forced upon the attention of the Farmers' Union.  I cannot recall that I used the word &ldquo;forced.&rdquo; I do not pose as a very forcible character.  I think he should have substituted the word &ldquo;induced,&rdquo; and if he had done so it would have been more correct.  At any rate, I have tried to induce members of the Farmers' Union to adopt this policy, and I think with a fair amount of success&mdash;coupled always with the action of the Government in driving members of the Farmers' Union and members of the Farmers' Party into the position that they cannot tolerate having every minor industry in the country financed at their expense, and at the same time having no protection whatever given to the articles that the farmers produce themselves.  Before passing from this question of barley, I may say that as far as I can gather from Deputy Wolfe's observations, he favours an imposition of some kind on barley.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">

    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. CONLAN Mr. CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway I say that farmers have a good case for an imposition not alone on barley, but on foreign oats.  I can give a personal experience in the matter: I brought a sample of what I considered very good oats to a Curragh trainer not long ago, and his place was practically full of Canadian oats at the time.  Canadian oats is being imported wholesale into the country, and not alone Canadian oats but what is more absurd, Canadian hay.  Imagine bringing hay to a country like Ireland all the way from Canada.  On account of representations that had been made to me from farmers in Kildare of the great danger of cattle disease being introduced through Canadian hay, I brought the matter to the notice of the Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister, acting, I presume, upon the advice of some doctrinaire economists in the Department of Agriculture, declined to put an <Col N="281" /> embargo on Canadian hay.  If that is not free trade gone mad in one direction I do not know what it is.</P>

Our party are free traders by conviction, but they are being forced to change their policy in that respect, and to demand that when other industries are being protected their industry, which is the most important industry according to the admission of the Minister for Agriculture (and produces 75 per cent. to 80 per cent. of the wealth of the nation) should also be protected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamSears" hpid="Mr. SEARS Mr. SEARS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join the other Deputies in congratulating the Minister for Finance on the Budget he has submitted.  I am particularly well pleased with the direction that his scheme of taxation is taking, but I am not altogether at one with him in the undertaking he has given to limit his activities in that direction.  The only real opposition to this Budget has come from the Farmers' Party, and I can sympathise with them in their attitude towards a formidable scheme of this kind.  But listening to their arguments I have found that a great many of them might really be used as arguments in favour of these tariffs.  They have said over and over again that agriculture bears the heaviest burden of taxation in this State.  The proportion stated before the Commission was 75 per cent. That is quite true.  But industrial Ireland, if it gets its chance, is ready to assist the farmer in bearing its portion of that burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If things were normal the farmer would not be weighted down with 75 per cent. of the taxation of the country.  Fifty per cent. would be a fair proportion, and I think that the policy of the Government should be to aim at a well-balanced industrial State, so that industrial Ireland would bear its fair share of the taxation of the country.  That can only be brought about, I submit, by protection.  Protection for the restoration of industries, such as ours, against a rich country, such as England, is the only possible <Col N="282" /> remedy for promoting industries in the poorer country.  I submit that it is not sensible nowadays to talk about a tariff as being merely an experiment, as it has been tried in nearly every part of the world with success, and it has been shown that, if you give the industries of any country a fair tariff, they will quickly prosper.  The laws of economy are the same in Ireland as in other countries.  Some people think that everything in Ireland is exceptional. We were told in regard to the Shannon scheme that if the Shannon were harnessed it would behave unlike any other river in the world.  In the same way with every Irish industry. Take the case of tobacco.  Look at the remarkable effects which the tariff had on the tobacco industry.  The result will be the same in other directions.  I sympathise with the farmers who say, &ldquo;What are you going to do for us?&rdquo; I see the difficulty of the farmers in settling their policy until they saw the Budget.  They opposed the tariffs as an experiment, but I am sure that if they met around a table with the Minister for Finance and representatives of other parties, a scheme of tariffs, fair to the farming community as well as to the urban community, could be prepared which would have the wealth of the country for the people of the country so that the foreigner would not benefit.  Deputy Gorey asked, &ldquo;How are you going to give us protection when we have to sell our goods in a free trade market like Great Britain?&rdquo; That is the first portion of the difficulty which we have to meet here.  The farmer has to sell his goods in a foreign market and compete there with the products of the other nations.  We should aim at settling that state of affairs and aim, as I think this Budget aims, at giving the farmers a protective market at home instead of an open unprotected market abroad.  Then we will be able to deal fairly between agriculturists and industrialists.  There is a large home market at present for food.  I think if the farmers came forward with a policy that would convince the Government, something would be done in that direction.  They did not come forward with that policy for certain reasons.</P>

      <P>I would be delighted to see Deputy Gorey representing the farmers and consulting with the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture and the representatives of the Labour Party on that question.  I feel in my bones that something should and could be done to enable both the farmers and the industrialists to get a fair chance.  Take the £600,000 which is being given to farmers.  I suggest that that should be put on a tariff on American bacon or New Zealand butter.</P>

      <P>There you are.  The farmer cannot make up his mind.  The question has not been properly discussed yet.  It is a great mistake to have a clash of interests in this way, as <Col N="284" /> all interests should join together. Many people are watching this discussion and this Budget&mdash;people thousands of miles away, and the foreign dumper is hoping that the Farmers' Party will oppose these proposals. The Canadian farmer and dumper of American bacon are hoping that the Labour Party here will not spoil their little game.  We should see that the trade and wealth of this country are preserved for the people of the country.  Up and down England they are making articles for Ireland and there are tens of thousands of British artisans drawing fine salaries out of Irish money which should be spent and circulated in Ireland.  If you talk about what America has done, they will say that America is different. I say &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  If it were necessary for America, three thousand miles from the European market, to put on a tariff wall, it is a thousand times more necessary for us to raise such a wall to protect and revive our industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Good said the other day, and the truth of his point is apparent, that if you are going to aim at reviving industry in the Saorstát, and if you think there is a possibility of doing that by protection, you should go about it in a sensible manner by giving suitable protection to the manufacturer and take drastic steps to keep the foreigner from spoiling the experiment.  Belfast is happy in the fact that its employment is well balanced between the sexes You have women employed as well as men, the men in the shipyards and the women in the linen industry.  There is no country where women are in such a state of slavery as in the Saorstát.  It is pitiable to meet them by scores looking for employment&mdash;decent and well-educated women, and their humiliation is all the more when they are well-educated. There is no employment for them while we are sending a stream of money to England.  I listened to the Minister with great pleasure when he stated that these new tariffs would promote industries.  They are bound to do it, but to a very limited extent. He calculated at a thousand here and there, but the number of unemployed can be calculated in tens of thousands. If you open the ports to-morrow there <Col N="285" /> would be a rush to America that would alarm people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamSears" hpid="Mr. SEARS Mr. SEARS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because Deputy Baxter's whole aim is to make things all right for the eldest son and not care about the others.  Deputy Baxter and other Farmer Deputies approve of what the Minister for Agriculture has done in regard to eggs, butter and livestock, and in regard to the improvement of land tenure because it is good for him and his eldest son, but what about the other sons, who are crowding into shops or who are in competition with other decent farmers' sons to get employment in publichouses, the poorest form of employment except the drapery business?  I say that these tariffs will undoubtedly promote industry in Ireland as they have done everywhere else, but they will do it here only to the extent of a few thousand persons.  I say that the Minister should have increased the tariffs, and we should go into the thing courageously. We made sacrifices for political freedom and we must make sacrifices for industrial freedom.  It is a matter of taste.  A man may want a particular kind of cigarette or a particular kind of boot, but he will have to put up with a secondhand class of cigarette or boot unless we make up the leeway which has been caused by an oppressive foreign Government We have to fight against the slave mind, and the feeling of antagonism and distrust towards the Irish article.  That is most discouraging, but you find it in every house and home.  Such people are not a bit more opposed to the Irish article than they were to Sinn Fein when it began its programme, but they had to swallow that programme eventually.  If the policy in the Budget is followed courageously to the end, they will change their mind on the industrial policy of the State just as they changed it as regards political policy.  There is one particular industry which I am sorry the Minister did not assist, and that is the manufacture of agricultural implements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is an agricultural country in which there is a good deal of tillage, <Col N="286" /> and we all hope there will be more, and we should certainly have an Irish agricultural implement industry.  There is one in Wexford which fought its way to the front under most adverse circumstances, but it has recently been hard hit. I refer to the industry carried on by Messrs. Pierce, Messrs. Doyle, and the Star Engineering Company, and I remember when they gave employment to 1,000 hands.  I used to hear farmers who drove into that town, shrewd men of business, say how satisfactory it was to bring in their produce to a town in which there were 1,000 men drawing a weekly wage every Friday or Saturday. Pierce's factory was hard hit by the dumping of foreign machinery, and I submit that protection should be given there in this Budget.  Yesterday I met one of the best farmers in the South of Ireland, from County Cork, and I asked him whether he knew anything about Pierce's machinery.  I did not ask a Wexford farmer, because I thought he might be disposed to speak too highly of it.  This man said that he had two farms, and that he had given up buying any other machinery, as he thought in the highest way of Pierce's machinery, and so did his men.  There you have in an agricultural county, firms turning out the best class of agricultural implements.  They are appealing to the Minister for assistance, and they gave an undertaking not to increase the price, but I regret to say that they have received no assistance from him.  I regret that the criticism of this Budget, and particularly the policy of protection, should develop into an argument on class distinction. We are all concerned with Ireland.  We have a rich country, with tremendous spending powers, and we have capabilities of developing the country in an industrial way, but it is not by arguments of that kind but by cooperation that we will preserve and develop the wealth of the country for our-ourselves.</P>

      <P>I must say that I do not understand some of the arguments used in this debate.  They seem to be self-contradictory. Some of the farmer Deputies said that, whether these <Col N="287" /> tariffs which have been imposed are right or wrong, because they have been imposed, they want tariffs for certain other products whether they are right or wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The position seems to be that certain tariffs are proposed, which may be right or wrong, but the very fact that they are imposed urges Deputies to demand that they be imposed on other articles, be these tariffs right or wrong.  That is a hopeless position.  Either tariffs are right or they are not right.  They are either sound or unsound.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one point of view, and if the Deputy took up that and tried to justify it we could argue it, but he did not do that.  That is what I complain of&mdash;one argument now and another in five minutes' time.  Deputy Wilson says that all tariffs are unsound.  He may be a great economist, but his <i>obiter dicta</i> is unsound.  I think he stated that all tariffs were unsound, and then he went on to point out, and so did Deputy Connor Hogan, that, whether these tariffs are sound or not, because they are imposed, other tariffs must also be put on whether they are sound or not. Was there ever such an attitude?  This is a serious subject and this is a very big question.  Deputy Heffernan interjected, and rightly interjected, when Deputy Sears suggested that the Farmers' Party should outline their agricultural policy, that that is the business of the Minister for Agriculture. Certainly it is, and we will go into that question later.  The interjection, at least, implied that this is a serious question, which should be examined seriously from an agricultural point of view.  The attitude of the Farmers' Party, however, is this: &ldquo;We do not know whether tariffs on eggs, butter, bacon and other produce are right or wrong, but we must have them because the other child has got on its feet.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> That is not criticism, and it gets us nowhere.  The Farmers' Party and the Farmers' Union, and every other organisation, will have to come down to business on that matter.  I suggest that the attitude of the Farmers' Party on this question of tariffs is not coming down to business, and I believe that every Deputy on the Farmers' benches quite realises that.  Deputy Conlan said that the rates in his country were increased this year by ?, and that the Agricultural Grant would only give them relief to the extent of ?.  Therefore, he says, our rates are more than what they should be.  What is the moral to be drawn from that sort of reasoning?  Is it that they do not want any Agricultural Grant?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConlan" hpid="Mr. CONLAN Mr. CONLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>

      <P>Then I may take it that the Deputy is in favour of the Agricultural Grant.  I listened to the speeches of Deputies from the Farmers' benches on this point, and I must say that in their remarks they were simply damning this proposal with faint praise.  I dwell on the matter because it raises a rather important issue.  We have been told that the rates on land in the County Kildare have been increased by ?, but, I ask, whose fault is that.  It would be interesting to find out how many farmers thought it worth their while to go out and vote at the last elections.  I ask is there not a majority of farmers in that constituency? The local bodies could be in the hands of the people who pay the rates if these people would only take the trouble to organise, but they do not take that trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it. The rates, we are told, are increased by ?.  I do not know whether that is due to inefficient administration on the part of the county council concerned or not, but I take it that that is the suggestion.  The rates are raised by ?, and the Government is blamed for that.  That, I suggest, is a helpless attitude to take up.  Deputy Redmond comes along next, and he tells us that these are purely revenue tariffs.  In the next sentence he says that as a result of these purely revenue tariffs they will do nothing to develop industry, that they will provide employment only for skilled labour.  That is another contribution to the debate. The Deputy said that these tariffs will not develop industry, but that they may provide employment for extra skilled labour.  He goes on after that, and he says, in answer to an interruption of Deputy Johnson: &ldquo;Oh, yes, the tariff on apparel will employ unskilled women labour, but the tariff on furniture will not.  Therefore, you should abolish the tariff on apparel.&rdquo; That is a series of mutually destructive arguments.  On an important issue such as this Budget is, an issue which affects the economy of this country for the next year, we should have serious argument at least Some people seem <Col N="290" /> to profess that they cannot really balance advantages with disadvantages. They say, of course, that we get certain remissions.  Look at the taxes on apparel.  They come to about £750,000. They say, too, we have a free breakfast table, but then against that we have other taxes, and we would prefer to be left in <i>statu quo.</i>  Anyone with a knowledge of addition and subtraction, of multiplication and division could, if they gave the matter a few minutes' examination, find out that they are not.  They know that they are not, and yet these arguments are used.  I am not quite clear yet as to what the attitude of the Farmers' Party is to this Budget.</P>

I have listened to the speeches of Deputies on the Farmers' benches who dealt with item after item in the Budget, but when the discussion was over I was not quite sure as to the attitude of particular Deputies.  They are using the argument now that once you impose a tariff at all additional tariffs should be imposed with a view to protecting agriculture.  Deputy Connor Hogan and Deputy Wilson&mdash;I did not hear Deputy Heffernan speak&mdash;stated that there should be tariffs on imported oats, barley, bacon, butter, eggs and poultry.  That is rather a sweeping programme.  Again, I repeat I do not know at the moment what is the attitude of the Farmers' Party or of the Farmers' Organisation on that.  They have not made their attitude clear.  In fact they seem to have taken extraordinary care not to make it clear.  I would like to know definitely and authoritatively from either the Farmers' Union or the Farmers' Party whether they are clearly in favour of a policy of tariffs on oats, barley, bacon, butter and poultry, or on any one or two of them.</P>

I read carefully a discussion at a recent meeting of the Farmers' Union.  It appeared from the case put forward and agreed to that there should be tariffs on all these things.  Let us examine the case as regards oats.  We produce about £5,000,000 worth of oats, and we import about £300,000 worth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Oatmeal, I suppose. But I am dealing with oats at the moment. A tariff is being asked for oats. If Deputies are not serious in asking for this tariff, then they should not do so.  I am taking Deputies seriously, and I am dealing with the point they have made, that a tariff should be imposed on oats.  As I stated, we produce in the Saorstát oats to the value of over £5,000,000, and we import oats to the value of between £300,000 and £400,000, two-thirds of which, I should say, is seed.  Is there any Deputy on the Farmers' Benches who will ask for a tariff on oats on that basis?  Two-thirds of the oats that we import is, as I say, seed oats.  Trainers in the country do import a little oats of special quality, and I believe a few cabmen in Dublin import a small quantity of oats of cheap quality.  Is there any farmer Deputy in the House&mdash;let us fix one point definitely&mdash;who wants a tariff on oats with these figures, and if not, why ask for it except merely to confuse the issue?  There is an idea in this country that if you impose a tariff on anything <Col N="292" /> everybody will be happy.  You are protecting that particular industry and doing a good turn for everybody, and you can go ahead like a bull in a china shop, imposing tariffs rapidly or at random for the benefit and good of everybody.  A tariff on oats from the point of view of the country would be counter to the views of every responsible farmer.  When you come to the simple figures no one would suggest a tariff on oats, yet the appeal is made to the Dáil and outside as if a tariff on oats was something that was going to make the farmer rich.</P>

Deputy Gorey has made his position clear, but other Deputies of the Farmers' Party, uncontradicted, have insisted that they want a tariff on bacon. Now let me deal with that.  You all <Col N="293" /> know the figures.  I have not the exact figures by me at the moment, but I know the imports were about £2,000,000, and the exports amounted to about £5,000,000, leaving a nett increase of exports over imports of £3,000,000.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, approximately right.  American bacon was sold on an average last year at £5 per cwt.  I challenge contradiction on that figure, and I might say, incidentally, it comes into the country at £3 a cwt., but the cost to the consumer is £5 a cwt., often more, sometimes a little less.  But who are the consumers?  About 80 per cent. of them are farmers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>None whatever, but that that Irish bacon is sold on an average this year by the farmers at about £4 a cwt.  Irish bacon has been sold at a little less.  I say that the farmers for the last year have been selling Irish bacon which, when cured by himself, would not cost more than £4 a cwt., and he has been buying American bacon at £5 a cwt.  I should like to hear if these figures are challenged.  What do they want protection for?  They are protected already to the tune of £1 a cwt. Protection is a necessary evil.  Protection, I should say, when it is imposed, and imposed on absolutely sound principles, is a necessary evil which should be avoided if possible, but when it is imposed it is a stimulant.  But here is a case in which the farmers, though saying they are free traders in the abstract, want protection for an industry that has protection already.  In other words they want to suffer the disadvantages of protection without getting any of the advantages of it.  I would like to hear what Deputy Wilson has to say on that.  He knows it already, but of course in his view any stone is good enough to throw at the Government.</P>

I think I should be allowed to make my statement and there should not be these objections to concrete criticism.  Generalisations get us nowhere.

      <P>I can be contradicted. I say these figures are comparative figures for the last two or three years. What I mean by comparative figures is that the ratio is the same.  It would be four to five, but Irish bacon would be sold at a smaller price by farmers than the price they gave for American.  The figures are comparatively right for last year and for a few years pre-war.  What is the reason of it?  The explanation is there was a time when the figures were the other way, when the ratio was quite different, when American bacon was sold much less, much cheaper than Irish bacon, for about 4d. a lb., I think.  The farmers at that time, like good business men, produced good bacon, sold it, and bought bacon much cheaper, which <Col N="295" /> was a perfectly reasonable business transaction.  But they drifted along and refused to change with the times, and now you have the position that American bacon is far dearer than the bacon the Irish farmer produces himself. If there was any organisation&mdash;I am not speaking of the Farmers' Party &mdash;amongst the farmers, that could not happen.  These figures cannot be challenged. They are correct not only for the period since 1920, but for a good many years pre-war.  In face of these figures, I want to know what do we want protection for?  The only effect of protection would be to hit the very small farmer in the very poor district, or the agricultural labourer, who cannot afford to build accommodation for pigs, or who will take some little time, at all events, to make arrangements for keeping pigs.  There is no doubt, even from the point of view of the small farmer, or agricultural labourer, that in Connemara it would pay to keep pigs.  But his difficulties are very much more than those which confront the ordinary small farmer in getting in the pigs.  In any event, you have to give them a certain amount of time.  It would be a great many months, probably the end of the year, before the small farmer or labourer who does not keep pigs would begin to buy pigs.  Up to that time he would be buying American bacon at a higher price.  You would get no advantages from such a tariff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the man I am thinking of.  I am speaking of the man who cannot keep pigs and produce his own bacon.  Deputy Hewat has missed the point.  I am speaking of the price which a farmer gets for his pigs, which is the wholesale price, as against the retail price which he buys <Col N="296" /> American bacon at.  The retail price of Irish bacon is more than the retail price of American bacon&mdash;considerably more. That does not alter the fact that there are farmers producing pigs at £4 per cwt. and then buying American bacon at £5 per cwt.  They sell the pigs at £4 per cwt. and someone else charges £6 per cwt.  On these figures, there is absolutely no case whatever for a tariff on bacon.  The only result of a tariff on bacon would be to hit the agricultural labourer and small farmer, and, if you like, the big farmer who does not keep pigs at present.  I hope farmers will wake up and realise that the fact that they changed to consuming American bacon thirty years ago is not a good reason for continuing to eat American bacon now when it is dearer. That is the only comment to be made on the protection proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wilson should discuss the matter seriously.  The suggestion of a tariff of 2/- is absolutely absurd.  There is only one thing to be said: no other tariff would be any good. You require very nearly 2/- per lb.  It takes two and a half gallons of milk to produce one pound of butter.  You will have to give the farmer at least 1/1 per gallon for milk; he is getting 8d. That is a difference of 5d.  You would want a tariff of 1/- per lb. on butter to make it worth while for the farmer to produce milk in winter at the moment. In time, when other factors which are at present maturing develop a little bit and when you have the production of butter in winter, for other reasons, developed in the country, then perhaps a tariff would help, but not now.  The only effect of a tariff now would be to tempt creameries to put butter into cold storage in large quantities&mdash;a very dangerous performance.  I doubt very much if farmers in the South, looking at it dispassionately, would view with anything like pleasure the prospect of creameries putting large quantities of butter into cold storage.  That is the only effect it would have at the moment. I take it that no farmer, with the exception of Deputy Wilson, wants a tariff on butter.</P>
      <P>Before I come to barley I want to say that I am absolutely tired of this talk coming from the Farmers' benches about the lion in the path and that in other countries legislation has been enacted to deal with trusts.  Deputies seem to have a grievance against Messrs.  Guinness because they are successful. There is no respect for industry in this country unless it is the sort of industry which comes to the Government looking for doles.  That is a point of view behind that.

      <P>Let us come to the price of barley: 26/- a barrel, and for malting barley, 27/-.

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to know every parish and every district that Deputy Conlan has spoken of, but I am glad to have the assurance that he was only speaking of one district.  I can tell him that statistics show that <Col N="300" /> barley growing is practically constant, and also that the price of barley is, on the whole, better than oats.  There is far more oats produced in the country, and from the point of view of the country it is a more important crop. In price barley has always been better than oats.  Let us compare the price of barley with the price of milk, with barley anything from £1 to 26/- a barrel and 6d. a gallon for milk.  There are two systems of farming.  Certain farmers grow barley as the main crop. It is not sound from that point of view, as they have only one string to their bow.  Taking the position of such farmers and comparing it with that of the farmer in the South who has to send his milk to the creamery and gets 5d. for it in the summer, and perhaps 7d. or 8d. in the winter, which is best off?  I would rather get £1 or 26/- a barrel for barley.  There is no argument whatever for protection for barley which does not apply with equal force to bacon and oats questions of which we have already disposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us assume, however, that there was protection to the extent of 5/- a cwt. on barley.  That would make the price of imported barley dearer.  It is said, and admitting it for argument, Messrs.  Guinness will have to pay 5/- a cwt. more for imported barley, which is only a small proportion of the barley they buy.  How will that compel Messrs. Guinness or any other distiller to give a bigger price to the Irish farmer? I want an answer to that question. I am asking the farmers to deal with that particular point when some of the Deputies in that Party are speaking.  I am quite serious in that. It is not good enough to have this question of a tariff on barley propounded all over the country as something that is going to relieve farmers.  It is stated here and there, and at meetings people get up and talk loosely on the subject.  They constantly repeat, for the unfortunate farmers who are growing barley, that if this brutal Government would only put a tariff on barley they would be all right.  I would like the farmers of the country to think a little and to ask themselves how the imposition of a tariff of 5/- a cwt. on imported barley would compel the <Col N="301" /> breweries to give them a bigger price for their barley?  It is obvious that it would have no effect whatever in getting a bigger price for Irish barley.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>They go further than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to come to that if the Deputy would only let me. The farmers began with a tariff on barley <i>simpliciter</i>, but they next went a step further and said: &ldquo;Put a tariff on barley, and then you can give the results of that tariff back to the farmer.&rdquo; Then a moment's consideration showed that that would not work. Something else was necessary.  They immediately proceeded to that something, and that was, to fix a minimum price.  Does any farmers' organisation wish to have barley dealt with in this way, by tariffs?  The proposal is first a tariff; secondly, a subsidy; and thirdly, a minimum price.  You require the three.  I agree that that, at least, is a logical position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I am in a difficulty, as I do not know if any serious responsible farmers' organisation would stand for a minimum price, or, in other words, for control of industry.  I would like to know definitely whether any farmers' organisation would stand for that.  We must not be taking all the stones and letting the other people do all the soft talk.  Is there any farmers' organisation that will stand for a policy of control and minimum prices&mdash;going back to the war period?  I would like to hear what farmers of the south have to say about controlled prices.  They remember the butter control and other controls.  I am sure farmers have sufficient sense to know that if you once begin control it will not end with barley.  Deputy Johnson will agree with me there.  I heard a lot of people protesting vehemently during the discussions on the Live Stock Breeding Bill against Government control.  When we introduced the Bill farmers' organisations and Deputies who are conservative, such as Deputy Hewatt and Deputy Good, all came forward and suggested persuasion, holding that State control was absolutely wrong. The Farmers' Party also suggested persuasion to a lesser degree.  They did <Col N="302" /> not want control, of which there was too much, and said the Government should wait for the result of persuasion. I heard the same thing from farmers in the Seanad and elsewhere.  These are the farmers who now suggest control of prices.  In other words, State socialism.  That is what it means to control prices.</P>

They did make it clear that they were against State control, except where it was absolutely necessary.  Now you have Deputy Wilson, and everybody who is in favour of this tariff on barley, coming forward to suggest a policy of guaranteed prices and Government control of industry.  I will say no more about barley.  I am not in favour of Government control of industry.  I agree with the particular farmers who put the proposition forward in three phases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is one of those easy questions which really mean nothing.  If the Deputy is asking me my private opinion as to whether it would be possible for the Government to regulate the prices of tea and sugar now, I think myself the disadvantages of attempting to regulate the prices would more than counterbalance the possible advantages.  But that is another question.  It is a very easy thing to hop up in the Dáil and say: &ldquo;Is the Minister in favour of controlling profiteering?&rdquo;  But it really <Col N="303" /> means nothing.  When we would get down to hard facts the Deputy would not, perhaps, be himself so strongly in favour of applying that generalisation. I admit that the later attitude of the Farmer Deputies who are in favour of a tariff on barley is at least logical. They ask for a tariff, a subsidy and guaranteed prices.  I am against that I am against State control of industry. I am against attempting to fix guaranteed prices, and I do not think there is a responsible farmer in the country who is not with me in that.</P>

I have been listening for the last two hours to, and I have been reading in the paper of demands by farmers' associations for taxes on these things.  I suppose by &ldquo;oat products&rdquo; the Deputy means oatmeal.  There is really very little in that.  A tax on oatmeal would help, to some small extent, ten or twelve mills. Some of these mills are attached to farmers' societies, and, indirectly, in that way, there would be some very small advantage to the farmer.  But, on the whole, there is nothing in it.

There is no reason whatever why the mills that deal with £3,000,000 worth of wheat at home could not deal with the balance.  At the same time, what is the advantage from the farmers' point of view?  You would have a little more pollard, but there would be the possibility of raising the price of flour slightly.  I do not believe myself it would raise the price, but there is a doubt about it.  Wheat is too important to take risks at the moment. The only possible advantage would be that there would be a little more pollard.</P>

      <P>I could not say.  The by-products of wheat are only a very small proportion, indeed, of the total quantity of feeding-stuffs for live stock used by farmers.  From that point of view, it would be hardly justifiable to take the risk of imposing a duty on imported flour.  There is then the very big question of a duty on wheat.  We did grow at one time all the wheat, or nearly all the wheat, that we required. Farmers will say that there is some land which will not grow wheat.</P>

      <P>The same climate and the same land.  Farmers will say that there is some land that will not grow wheat satisfactorily.  Most of the land of the country will grow wheat satisfactorily. I say deliberately&mdash;I will go into the figures any time with any farmer&mdash;that, taking the year 1924, wholemeal could be produced at 12/6 per cwt. as against £1 0s. 6d. for flour that was bought.  That is taking the year 1924&mdash;one of the worst years for the last thirty years.  I say that during that year wheat could be grown by most farmers and ground into whole-meal at about 12/6 per cwt., as against £1 0s. 6d. per cwt. for flour purchased in the shops, taking into account cost of production, rent, rates, labour and everything else.  That is undoubtedly the position.  That was the position pre-war, and has been the position since 1920.  Farmers are paying thirty or forty per cent. more for flour than the sum at which they could produce wholemeal.  I hope farmers will waken up to that fact.  But it is not an argument for protection.</P>
      <P>I will, perhaps, ask the Minister for Finance later on, if necessary, to consider some method of compelling people to grow more wheat.  It is a very serious matter.  There should be more wheat grown in the country, but at the present moment I would not stand for a tariff on wheat.  The farmers are not prepared for it.  They could not begin to think of growing wheat until next winter.  Even Deputy Wilson will agree with me on that.  I would like the farmers to co-operate with us and realise that they are paying considerably more&mdash;fifty per cent. more&mdash;for worse flour than the stuff they could themselves produce.  This country could produce sufficient wheat for a population of seven or eight millions.  It could produce sufficient wheat for its population if the crop were sown only on the ground occupied by potatoes at the moment.  The area under potatoes would be sufficient to provide all the wheat required for this country.  That could be done, and it should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan interrupted Deputy Sears and suggested that it was our business to evolve an agricultural policy.  We have examined this question <Col N="306" /> of tariffs inside out, and if the Minister for Finance has no tariffs to help agriculture in his Budget, it is my fault.  I could not suggest a tariff.  I would be very glad to consider concrete suggestions from any Deputy.  Perhaps it is a little late, but I would go into the matter informally, and I would seriously invite any Deputy to make any concrete suggestion for a tariff on any of these agricultural products that would really benefit the farmer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the important point at present&mdash;the principal point the Deputy raised.  I will endeavour to deal with the other points if he allows me.  We have examined, at great length and in great detail, the question of doing something for agriculture by way of tariffs.  The fact of the matter is, that it cannot be done, for obvious reasons.  There are different reasons for different products.  But it cannot be done.  I do suggest that Deputies from the Farmers' Benches should not throw out casually the idea that agriculture can be benefited to any great extent by a policy of tariffs. It cannot.  The farmers of the country are entitled to a lead from their representatives, and they should not be told that tariffs can help them.  They cannot help them.  There is no use, therefore, in concentrating the attention of farmers on this question of tariffs. There is quite sufficient for farmers to concentrate upon if they would only do it.  I mentioned the question of wheat, and I think even Farmer-Deputies agreed with me.  Take the case of <Col N="307" /> barley and maize meal.  We import about £7,000,000 worth of maize meal. Every day we hear people say that we should grow all the food we require in this country, but farmers know that that is impossible.  Every farmer knows that we cannot grow protein foods.  But maize meal is carbo-hydrate, and, for pig-feeding, maize and barley are exactly the same food, though oats and pollard are not.  Yet we import £7,000,000 worth of maize meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>£4,000,000 worth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we import more than that, but that figure is sufficient for my purpose.  There we have an alternative market to Messrs. Guinness or any other brewery.  In fact, farmers could, even last year, have got a bigger price for their barley by turning it into pork than by selling it, and yet they did not do it.  I know the difficulty. I know that the farmers of Leix and Offaly and other counties cannot start pig-feeding right off.  It takes a certain amount of preparation.</P>
      <P>Accommodation has to be provided, and the system of farming has to be altered.  But here you have farmers in beautiful barley land producing pig food which is equal to maize meal, and there is not enough business organisation amongst the farmers to get them to distribute that.  It could be said by a farmer, say in Laoighis, &ldquo;I want this as a catch-crop, and I cannot feed it to pigs; it would not be economic for many reasons.&rdquo;  I heartily sympathise with him, but there should be enough of organisation to see that that meal could be distributed, say, to every farmer in County Cork who buys large quantities of maize meal and who should be able to get barley instead of it at the same price.  That is an alternative market, and an alternative market bigger than all the breweries put together.</P>

      <P>One little organisation in one part of the country is no good.  The farmers, as a whole, must be organised to get anywhere.  In farming, the profits are small even in the best countries, and are only to be got by minding the pence and halfpence, and by a very high degree of efficiency.  They have arrived at that stage by first-class organisation and education in Denmark.  We have to arrive at it here.  It can be done.</P>
      <P>Captain Redmond asked for an assurance that these remissions of duty would reach the consumer.  Again the suggestion is, I suppose, that we should control prices.  If it does not mean that, it means nothing.  He also said, if I remember rightly, that the duty on tea was reduced last year, and that the cost of living went up.  The cost of living is, accordingly, bound to go up now, because there is a reduction of duty on sugar.  Really what we should do is increase the duties all round and get down the cost of living. That is what it comes to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>You can guarantee nothing in this hard world.  The criticisms of these proposals in regard to apparel are, I think, unjustifiable.  It is wrong to say that they will weigh particularly heavily on the poor man. They will not.  I think they will weigh far more heavily on the very rich and far less heavily on the ordinary middle-class and on the poor.  They will weigh most heavily on the people who want to buy fashionable clothes, and who have to go outside the country to buy them.  So far as the ordinary farmer is concerned, while clothes will cost him more, they will not cost him nearly as much more in proportion as the wealthy man who wants to get fashionable clothes.  From that point of view, if there are to be tariffs at all, this is an ideal tariff.  This is an ideal tariff from the point of view of giving employment, and it is ideal inasmuch <Col N="309" /> as it does a minimum amount of harm to the people who should be protected and looked after.  I do not know what the farmers' attitude is in the matter. They sometimes say that there should be no tariffs at all&mdash;no attempt to protect industry at all.  Any attempt to protect industry, if it costs money, is in their view to be deprecated.  I do not agree with that.  Deputy Sears said there was emigration.  &ldquo;Where is it going?&rdquo;  said Deputy Baxter.  The emigration is off the land.  What do you want tariffs for?  To endeavour to develop industry.  What for?  For the farmer's brother, sister, son, and daughter.  It is because the people are going off the land that we want industry in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point I want to refer to.  Deputy Cooper suggested a committee of experts, and Deputy Redmond made a similar suggestion, that there ought to be a committee of experts set up for the purpose of going into all items of expenditure. That is really the Government's business.  That is really the function of each Minister, and he is either doing it or he is not doing it. Deputies will say, &ldquo;We have no way of finding out.&rdquo;  The accounts can be inspected, and they can be examined and criticised, but that means hard work.  It is much easier to make a suggestion that a committee of experts be set up than to take the trouble of examining the accounts and criticising expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister complaining of any lack of criticism of expenditure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another question. I will not either invite or deprecate it.  I merely say that the idea of a committee of experts will not work.  That is the business of the Government and the business of Ministers. Either they are doing their business or they are not.  I can imagine four or five experts coming into the Ministry of Finance, the Department of Agriculture, the Ministry <Col N="310" /> for Home Affairs, or other Departments and finding out exactly what expenditure is uncalled for.  Is not that the business of Ministers?  These particular Commissioners may be supermen, and they may be far more capable than we are.  Assume that they were sitting for six months.  They have to get a real grip of administration in detail in each Department in six months.  It could not be done.  I can imagine four men coming into the Department of Agriculture, possibly the majority of them not agriculturists, and after an examination of one month suggest that some particular item of expenditure should be cut down, while at the same time everyone really interested in agriculture who gave the matter one, two, or three years' thought might agree that that was the one item was necessary.  The point I make is this: No committee of experts, be they supermen or not, can go into all the departments and after four or five months make themselves thoroughly acquainted with the details of each, and then make valuable suggestions to this House.  They cannot do it.  The Minister, who is solely responsible for that Department and who has nothing else to think about, should be doing that, and in the ordinary way should be more competent than they, because it is his particular business, and he has nothing else to do.  I say that that point of view, that we want commissioners, is a point of view which argues that we are all too young, and that we are not as careful as we might be with money when we get it&mdash;that we are a bit young and have not the right tradition of Government, and that what is wanted is older men, business men, people who are wise, prudent, and statesmanlike.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to answer these questions.  I said before that it is the business of Deputies to examine accounts.  That means hard work and trouble, and it is easier to make suggestions about commissions.  I am sorry that Deputy McKenna is not here, as I want to make a point with regard to a statement of his.  He suggested that pensions were too high, and outside this House he made the same suggestion, and I think he went so far as to say that what really was happening was that the Civil Service was being disbanded, and that the relations of Ministers were being put into positions.  That sort of loose talk passes for criticism of the Government in the country, and it is repeated here in the House in a modified form.  Of pensions amounting to £1,700,000, police pensions amount to £1,600,000. I wonder why Deputies do not tell the country that.  I want to know from Deputies who talk like that whether they suggest that the R.I.C. should not have been disbanded?  Of course, they do not say these things.  It is much easier to say that this is a corrupt Government which is throwing money about and which is doing good work for its friends.  Apart from the police pensions, the greater part of the remainder is for resident magistrates, judges, and crown solicitors.  Should they be retained? Deputies should, at least, have the courage of their convictions, and when down the country talking about pensions they should say that they want the R.I.C., the resident magistrates, and the crown solicitors retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say that repudiation of the pensions of the R.I.C. would not mean a repudiation of the Treaty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting a repudiation of pensions.  I am making this point.  I say that this criticism of the Government is absolutely unjustifiable, and when Deputies again talk, either here or elsewhere, of these pensions, they ought at least have the <Col N="312" /> decency to go to the logical conclusion and say that they want the R.I.C., the resident magistrates, and the crown solicitors retained.  Do not let us have these half-truths, do not let us have any suggestion that because of these pensions the Government is corrupt and wants to do turns for its friends. It has been stated here that the Farmers' Party are against the Budget.  I do not know if that is so, but I do say that the farmers of the country are in favour of it.  I am perfectly sure of that.  I think they have sense enough to know that industry must be developed in the country, and that a general policy of protection is not possible. I think they realise that you cannot simply protect everything, and that you cannot protect agricultural produce sold in the British market or at home.  I think they realise that industry is needed in the country.  Practically all the land of the country will be divided before long.  There is practically 70 per cent. divided already. Whatever delays there may be, it is true to say that all the land will be divided before long.  What is going to happen the sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters of farmers?  From that point of view you require industry if it can be developed.  We realise that it is not a sound position to sell practically 98 per cent. of the produce of the country in one market, and we realise that outlets are required other than agriculture for the young men and women of the country.  I think the farmers do realise that we must look ahead.  I agree that you cannot afford to develop industry at the expense of agriculture, as this country lives on agriculture, and, I suggest, that we have not done it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to take up at the present juncture the line taken by the Minister for Agriculture because we cannot deal with this matter of the Budget, particularly this matter of tariffs, by dealing exclusively with the agricultural aspect of it.  One has to take the general aspect of it, because agriculture will be affected, in my opinion, by the, general aspect of it, rather than by any question of the application, or otherwise, of the tariffs.  Personally, I appreciate <Col N="313" /> the explanation which has been given by the Minister, and I am rather flattered to think that although I confess I do not know half, or perhaps a quarter as much about the subject, the conclusions he arrived at were very largely the conclusions I arrived at also.  People have tried to put us into the position of not approving of this Budget.  I think none of the Farmers' Party has said that.  We approve of the Budget to a certain extent, but I, personally, do not approve of the tariff portions of it.  I think it would be ridiculous for anybody to get up here and say that he disapproved of the remission of the duty on tea, sugar or other articles.  I think that would be senseless and I think also it would be a very unpopular thing to say.  The Budget may be a good Budget; practically everybody says it is.  But one thing I say about it is that it is a very clever Budget.  It is a very difficult Budget to criticise and it has been drawn up, in my opinion, with a view to appealing to all classes of the community and in particular to a number of people who think on the surface.  What does the average man in the country say when he hears of the Budget?  He knows he is going to get a remission of the duty on tea, a remission of the duty on sugar and other breakfast articles that we hear about.  He knows he is going to get some immediate gain, some immediate advantage, and he has a kind of indefinite idea about the disadvantages which he is told about&mdash;the tariff which will be put upon ready-made clothing. Anyhow, there is one thing certain: he will feel the effect of the remission of the tea duty immediately, but he will not feel the effect of the tariff on clothes. There will be a definite reduction in the price of tea or sugar; at least we hope there will be, and we hope that the Government will see that there is a definite reduction and that some of the remissions are not divided between the importer and the consumer.</P>

      <P>They have not <Col N="314" /> the power, but they have the power of publicity, which is very useful sometimes. As regards the question of the tariff on clothing, it will take some time before it comes into effect.  When a man goes to buy clothes it will be difficult for him to know how the price or the quality has changed, but after some time he will know, in a very indefinite way, that the cost of living has been very little changed by the provisions of the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson and some others were very anxious to find out exactly how the Farmers' Party stood on the question of protection.  I hope they know now.  There is one thing certain: I know where I stand, anyhow.  I stand practically in the same position as I stood in last year.  When the tariffs were introduced, I said I was not a doctrinaire free trader, or a follower of the Manchester School, if I understood what the Manchester School exactly is.  But I am of opinion that the cost of protection will fall largely on the agricultural community.  I cannot see how it will fall on anybody else, and I know that the agricultural community cannot derive any benefit, directly, or immediately, from protection. We had that very plainly explained by the Minister for Agriculture. We also know that agriculture is in a dire condition at the present moment.  Agriculturists find it awfully difficult to make ends meet.  Some of the poorer of them have been on the verge of destitution, and it is well the Ministry knows that, because they have been giving relief this year, and probably the bulk of that relief went to people on small farms.  I say that the main cost of this protection must fall on agriculturists, and I believe that the agriculturists are not in a position to pay that cost, and while they are not in that position it is not fair to put such an impost on them.  Of course, we will be told that protection will not put up the cost, but I think anybody who knows anything about it will say that there is nothing in that statement.  I think that has been acknowledged by the Government themselves.  It has been acknowledged by Deputy Johnson, and anybody who studies the effect of protection in other countries will find that invariably it sends up the cost of <Col N="315" /> living.  I might say, if I could have any adequate assurance that protection was not going to be extended, if it was going to be confined to a few essential industries which have a real prospect of success in this country, that I would be very seriously inclined to reconsider my attitude towards the question of protection, but I do not expect any assurance of that kind.  I do not believe any Government, or any country, could start on the plane of protection, and that they could go back of it, or limit it to comparatively few industries.</P>
    <P>I think such a condition of affairs is almost unknown.  Where tariffs are imposed they nearly always become a general tariff.  Apart from everything else, it is not fair to the unprotected industry.  Protection, as has been acknowledged, will send up prices.  It will send up the cost of living; if it does not send it up it will maintain prices at a higher level than they ought to be maintained at.  It will make the cost of production for the unprotected industries higher than the cost of production in outside countries. I want to understand how they can exist while that condition of affairs is maintained.  The result will be that you will have applications to the Ministry for protection, and I do not see how, in fairness to the industries left out, any Government can resist those applications.  Then we see that we are drifting practically in the direction of a general tariff; we are drifting in the direction of producing most of the articles we consume in our own country.  What will be the result?  I think the result will be one of two things.  Where we produce the article it must be sold at a higher price than a similar article can be produced in a neighbouring country.  In all probability the prices will go up pretty close to the price of similar articles in an outside country, plus the amount of the tariff.  The other alternative is, that an inferior article will be produced. The consumer in this country will either have to pay the higher price for the imported article or accept the inferior article.  Then the agriculturist organised as he may be and I trust that he will be better organised <Col N="316" /> than he is at present, has to sell his produce in an unprotected market; he has to ship it to the outside market and to accept a price governed by the competition of all other countries.  He has no control whatever over the price he receives.  The only thing that can affect the price, as far as he is concerned, is the quality of his goods. Then he has to buy the necessaries of life and the articles necessary for the production of his products in a protected market.  The agriculturist is not a fool.  He knows the position that that is going to place him in, that he is going to be, to all intents and purposes, the milch cow for the rest of the community, and that there is practically no incentive held out to him to organise and improve his method of production, because, apparently by the extension of tariffs any benefit that he gains from the improved quality of his produce will be taken away from him in the higher prices which he has to pay for his articles of consumption.</P>
    <P>That is the reason why I think we are not in a position at the present time to approve protection.  We hear of the old argument about finding work for the children of the farmers and about stopping emigration.  We are as anxious as any party to see people employed in the country and to stop unnecessary emigration.  We cannot, as representatives of the farmers, take up the attitude of saying that we are going to make ourselves poverty-stricken and put ourselves into the position that we have been in the past in order that an attempt may be made to subsidise, and maintain, industries which have only the same right, but no more, to subsidies that we have, and we get no subsidy.  There are many references to the question of unemployment. We have heard that a great number of extra people are going to be employed as a result of the imposition of these tariffs.  I sincerely hope that is so.  The effect of that employment may be illusory.  There is no use in providing employment in some industries and unemployment in others.  The Government, and the Minister for Agriculture in particular, know that there has been considerable unemployment, increasing, one might say, day by day in the agricultural industries, <Col N="317" /> owing to the effects which the increased cost of living has on the farmer-employer.  At the present time the farmer finds himself very often in the position of not being able to pay even the comparatively small wage demanded by the agricultural labourers. Owing to the increased cost of production, due largely to the high cost of living, farmers all over the country are getting out of tillage, and men who formerly employed four workmen are now only employing three, for the reason that they cannot pay the present rates of wages.  Most of them are honest enough to say that they would not offer a lower wage to their labourers because they know well it is practically impossible for agricultural workers to maintain a family on the small wages that are paid to them. The result is that there is a constant drifting of agricultural labourers into the towns, and that, I think, is one of the reasons why there is so much unemployment in the towns.  A man who has been hanging about the country idle for a considerable time inevitably drifts into the towns where, perhaps, he may get an odd job, and ends up by having to try and exist on casual employment.</P>
    <P>Now we do not say that eventually in the course of time it may not be possible to protect industry, but we say it is not advisable to do it now, and we say the best protection the farming industry and every other industry could get would be by a reduction of taxation. We believe that a general reduction in taxation would have the effect of a general reduction in the cost of living, and a general reduction in the cost of living would certainly aid in production.  If you can get the cost of living figure below the cost of living in the neighbouring countries you certainly ought to be able to produce equally cheaply; it should act as a protection.</P>
    <P>There is no indication in this Budget that the Government have taken any steps to economise.  They are funding the non-recurrent expenditure&mdash;a necessary and a wise thing and a thing I approve of&mdash; but there is nothing to show in the Estimates that any real attempt is being made beyond <Col N="318" /> that made earlier in the year to economise. We in this country are paying approximately £10 per head, including local taxation, for every man, woman and child in the Saorstát.  We are paying that, and the country exports to the value of about £14 per head, so the margin between the value of our exports per head and the amount we are paying in taxation is only about £3, and most of the money that comes into this country comes in as a result of our exports to outside countries. The cost of our Government is higher than the cost of governments in similar countries.  It is higher than that of Denmark and it is higher than that of Switzerland, and while I do not indulge in any of the foolish charges of reckless expenditure that have been made I am still of opinion that considerable reductions could be made.</P>

      <P>It is difficult for the ordinary Deputy to get information, and sufficient information is not put at his disposal.  It seems to me difficult to get the necessary information about expenditure in our own country.  It is all very fine to say we get the books and the Estimates and statement of expenditure and things of that kind.  But they are not easily understood by ordinary individuals. They are very difficult to understand, they are very complicated, and I suggest that a more simplified method of presenting the accounts of the Oireachtas might be evolved, and a system which would enable us to make better comparisons, and to segregate non-recurrent from recurrent expenditure. I strongly approve of the suggestion&mdash;if I did not make it myself I supported it&mdash;that a committee should be appointed to go into these items.  I disagree altogether with the Minister for Agriculture when he says that we could adequately criticise the Estimates put before us.  I say we cannot, and it is not in our power to do so, or criticise these matters without some such help.  And in my case, in order to avoid making broad general statements that I think are not fair to the Government and which I dislike very much, I want a committee of this kind appointed.</P>
      <P>We get tired of hearing constant references to the Governor-General's salary and the Governor-General's establishment.  These are obvious things to speak of.  It is a matter of opinion.  I have an opinion about them, too, but one gets tired of speaking about obvious things.  One wants to know what happens in the various Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="320" /> We hear criticisms in the papers about the bonuses.  My understanding of the bonuses is that the Government has no control over them in the case of old civil servants, and they have to maintain that bonus up to a certain standard, and, therefore, I think criticism of that kind is not right.  But when we see the salaries of new men varying from £1,200 to £1,000 a year, we also find bonuses added.  We do not know whether these men are worth the salaries or whether too many of them are employed, or whether a number of clerks are redundant.  We have no means of finding out, and it can never be found out unless we have a committee of experts giving two or three months to the departments, with power to find out everything and to make recommendations before the Oireachtas.  The Minister for Agriculture said that it is for the Ministers to do that.  I do not admit that any Minister has time to do that.  It is well known that the British Government, when their finances were rather in a tangled condition after the War, did not think it wrong to appoint a committee.  They appointed the Geddes Committee, and everyone knows it resulted in considerable saving to the British Government.  Not only would such a committee, in my opinion, result in savings to the Government, but it would be a justification of the Government in regard to the conditions of the other Departments, and will air before the public things not aired at the present day, and about which a great many ridiculous rumours are being spread.</P>
    <P>Now I will deal with some of the details of the Budget.  I referred to the effect of the motor tax and to the advisability of abolishing the new duties.  I will not enter upon that now except to mention that I think it ought to be considered that motor cars are necessary articles in the economy of the country at the present time and that they should not be regarded as luxuries.  Anybody who knows anything about the condition of the country must know that 90 per cent. of the motor cars are absolutely necessary for the business of the country, <Col N="321" /> and that any tax that adds to the expense of motor cars must eventually add to the difficulties and expense of carrying on business.  In the same Vote are included films.  I have no objection to the ordinary tax on films, but something ought to be done in the way of relieving educational films from the tax.  I have personal experience of that this year.  Acting on behalf of the Farmers' Union, I made arrangements with a gentleman who spent some time in Denmark and was presented by the Danish Government with a set of films dealing with Danish agricultural conditions, to show them. This man, acting under the auspices of some guild, the name of which I have forgotten, was anxious to give lectures in different parts of the country.  He wrote to me, and I made arrangements to have this lecture and these films exhibited. Then I found the whole thing had to be dropped because the films could not come into the country owing to the tax.  That was an attempt to do a kind of work that we wish to do, that is, educational constructive work, and here we found ourselves blocked by the duty upon the films.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to say, but it was sufficient to prevent the lecture being given.  We found that the probable amount of money we would take at the door would not compensate for this man's travelling expenses and the cost of the films.  He did not ask anything for his time, as a matter of fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I would like to refer.  Perhaps it may be rather important, but I am certainly going to have the courage of my convictions in regard to it.  There has been a removal of the tax on entertainments in regard to G.A.A. in this country.  That has never been charged, I understand. I think it is a good thing that the tax on such entertainment from sports of that kind should be removed.  These sports are good for the physique for the young men of the country, but I think the time has arrived now when invidious distinctions of that kind should be abolished and that the entertainment <Col N="322" /> tax on Rugby, Hockey and other games should be removed altogether. It is not right that any Government should take sides in supporting one sort of game as against another.  Another item, on which I support certain other Deputies, is the motor vehicle duty.  I strongly support Deputies who suggest that this tax should be levied on petrol.  I think it is feasible that some system could be devised to put the tax on petrol.  It would be a great relief to many of the motor owners, and would be placing on a fair basis a matter that is very unfair at present, and it would also be a great stimulus to business.  I have very little more to say beyond this: that I appreciate the Budget as brought in.  I think a generous attempt is being made to reduce taxation, but I am rather sorry that the Minister, in my opinion, rather spoils his Budget by imposing extra taxation on the country for the purpose of tariffs, and I would rather have seen him reduce the tax on tea and sugar and other articles up to an extent that he would have been able to do without the tariffs which he has imposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>After what one may call the flood of oratory we have heard upon this Budget, dealing with all aspects of it, I do not intend, at this late hour, to cover ground covered by many of those orators.  But there are one or two aspects of the question that have not been touched upon and that ought to be touched upon.  The Minister has been complimented on his Budget. That has been general from all sections of the House, and as has been said by the business men, while we accept relief by way of remission of income tax, and we are satisfied that the circumstances justified a larger remission of income tax, yet we are thankful for even the small measure we have received. But that thanks is nevertheless tempered with a considerable element of disappointment in the minds of a large number of commercial men. That disappointment is caused by the continued imposition of another tax, not called income tax, but which is really income tax under another name &mdash;the Corporation Profits Tax.  The Dáil may not be aware that that tax <Col N="323" /> was introduced in Great Britain as a war measure.  Immediately after the termination of the war it was pointed out to the then Government that it was a tax that was most unfair in its incidence. It is only borne by limited liability companies, and really falls upon the ordinary shareholder and does not affect the other shareholders at all. Without dealing with any other aspect, that in itself should be sufficient to show that it is an unfair tax in its incidence. While it might be justified as a war measure, it certainly has no justification in times of peace.  So, immediately on the termination of the war, while the British Government could not see its way to do away with the tax, they reduced it by 50 per cent., and in the following year, when circumstances permitted, they eliminated the tax altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is getting involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am the President will put me right&mdash;it would not be the first time for either of us.  This tax, with all its difficulties, is being continued here in the full form in which it was originally introduced.  A reduction of a shilling in the income tax, bringing it down to four shillings, which in all probability is the figure it will be at in Great Britain after the next Budget, would have been fair enough had we been in the same position as Great Britain, and had we not got to carry the burden of the Corporation Profits Tax.  Therefore, I say that the disappointment caused by this is well founded.  If this tax was easy of collection and therefore very attractive to the Minister and his department, why not meet it by a further remission of one shilling in the income tax?  It would have cost him, I presume, a further £200,000.  (&ldquo;Oh, oh.&rdquo;) Then let him tell us exactly what it will cost.  Let us be quite clear.  Presuming that income tax is brought down to the four-shilling level in Great Britain, to state that our income tax is the same and that the taxpayers  will not be penalised more than in Great Britain, is only half the truth.  Let us be candid with ourselves, <Col N="324" /> tell the whole truth, and deal with the whole situation as it presents itself to those engaged in industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister has rightly said that there is no source from which he expects a better return from the remission of taxation than from industry. I am quite satisfied that the large amount of unemployment which we find has been caused by the heavy burden of taxation which industry has been trying to carry in this poor State of ours.  It is only now beginning to dawn on our Government that it is placing on industry a burden that it cannot afford to carry.  I am quite satisfied that if the Minister could have seen his way to lighten that burden of taxation further than he has done, he would have found in industry a response that would have satisfied him as to the success of the experiment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal has been said as to tariffs, but if one might express a businessman's opinion, I would have been inclined to advise the Minister to give a longer period to the experiments that he made last year in tariffs before he decided to give way to what I am sure was considerable pressure brought to bear upon him in connection with many industries.  For many reasons it is impossible to judge of the success or otherwise of the experiments that he tried last year because of the difficulties surrounding them. A case was given to us yesterday by Deputy Egan where he doubted the success of the experiment with regard to the bottle industry.  Let us consider for a moment the circumstances surrounding the duty imposed in that particular case.  The duty did not come into operation for three or four months after the last Budget.  The result was that our quays were all flooded with bottles&mdash;practically sufficient to carry the industry for the year.  Yet we are told, on the one hand, that the experiment was a success and, on the other hand, by a practical businessman, who ought to know the details of the industry, that it was not a success.  The circumstances.  I think, were sufficient to show any lay mind that it would be unfair, by reason of these conditions, to judge of the <Col N="325" /> success, or want of success of tariffs by that particular experiment.  Therefore, I say that the Minister would have been well advised if, before proceeding further along this slippery slope, he had given more time for the development of the particular experiment that he has tried.  I am afraid he has got so far on this slippery slope that, whether he sits down or stands up, he will go down the slope, and have to go the whole way in connection with tariffs. That is fairly obvious from what the farmers have said during the course of this debate.  Farmers possibly, before the Budget was introduced, might be looked upon as disapproving of tariffs.  Now, when they see that tariffs are being applied to all other industries they are changing their outlook, and doubtless they will be clamouring in the near future for tariffs on commodities which they produced and which at present are brought into this country and compete with their industry.</P>
    <P>Of these tariffs, that on apparel has not been wisely chosen as a subject for experiment.  I am satisfied that it will cause an immense amount of irritation. Picture for a moment the condition of affairs that it will create, say, at Dun Laoghaire.  I can imagine people coming across to this country with the object of spending a holiday here.  When their two or three trunks have been turned inside out, to see if they have any of these particular commodities that are subject to a tariff, I can imagine many of those people coming to the conclusion before they leave the Pier that they were sorry they had come that far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>A great effort has been made, particularly in the South of Ireland, to encourage the tourist traffic. People are most anxious that we should have a large number of American tourists during the coming summer. Generally those tourists come provided for a four months' holiday.  Lady tourists travel with a good many trunks in which there will be a great number of articles that would be subject to the duties imposed under this Budget. After one or two of the tourists who <Col N="326" /> have come away for a holiday have had all the items of their trunks thoroughly examined, I think fellow passengers on the same liner would be very much inclined to say: &ldquo;We will not get off at Cork and have all our things turned out and examined and have to re-pack our boxes.  We will go on to Southampton where there will be no such examination, and from that go up to London. We will leave our boxes in London and we will take a dressing case and a couple of things and cross to the Free State.&rdquo;  Probably when they get to London they will find it so attractive that they will never arrive in the Free State.  These are things that ought to be considered.  They are things that matter in proposals of this kind.</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out that many of the proposals seem to be of an irritating character.  In the interests of the State let us try to anticipate and provide against these troubles so that we may reduce the amount of irritation and annoyance to the minimum and not let these people go away from this country saying, &ldquo;From the very day we entered it, we got nothing but annoyance.&rdquo; We want them to leave with quite a different idea.  Notwithstanding this tax, if we can see that it is administered with wisdom it will do away with a considerable amount of irritation. I am satisfied that we can send a number of these people away pleased. It is to that particular aspect of the question that I direct the Minister's attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another important aspect of this question.  We hope that the result of these taxes will not be confined to revenue but that it will be shown in employment. I think, or, at least I hope, that the real intention is to put all these taxes towards providing employment rather than to revenue.  This tax comprises articles that are not manufactured in the Free State, that were never manufactured in the Free State, but that we hope will be manufactured here.  A number of the items to which the tax applies are manufactured in the Free State, but are more largely imported.  They might be more largely manufactured in the Free State.  In order to give this experiment a fair <Col N="327" /> trial I would suggest that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should call together the leading firms engaged in the particular industries that are affected and see how they can be assisted in putting a number of our unemployed to work on these different commodities and produce them in the Free State.  I am sure those engaged in the industries will be only too anxious to assist the Minister in any steps he may take in that direction.</P>
    <P>Might I take one example: the hat industry, and ladies' hats in particular. Though I am not a specialist, from what I know these hats are not manufactured here.  There is no reason why they should not be.  Why should not classes be started in connection with our technical schools at which numbers of young people could be trained to make these hats?  Why should not these classes be started immediately, and the best instructors engaged?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>That would give an opportunity to those who are unemployed to respond to this effort to try to create an industry here that does not now exist.  These are thoughts that might have the attention of the Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other proposal I would like to refer to, that is, the proposal to put a tariff on imported furniture. The word &ldquo;furniture&rdquo; is a most ambiguous one.  I do not know whether the Minister has had many applications within the last few days to know exactly what &ldquo;furniture&rdquo; meant.  I have had a number.  Of these, I will only mention a few.  One person wanted to know if wooden mantelpieces were &ldquo;furniture.&rdquo;  Another wanted to know if ladders were &ldquo;furniture.&rdquo; Another wanted to know if door handles were &ldquo;furniture,&rdquo; and another still if bench fittings were &ldquo;furniture.&rdquo;  The term &ldquo;furniture&rdquo; is a most ambiguous term.  I only mention that to show the Minister and the Committee the difficulty of the situation and to see whether that difficulty can be anticipated and met in <Col N="328" /> connection with the different industries. We should not have, at the inception of the tax, people importing stuff on the understanding that it was not embraced by the term &ldquo;furniture,&rdquo; and then finding on arrival here that it is included in the classification. I am afraid, in order to get a clear understanding of the meaning of &ldquo;furniture,&rdquo; there will have to be a classification. There is no other way out. The President on other occasions seemed to have an objection to enumerating items in a schedule.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I only mention the problem as one that ought to be dealt with. There is one other question I would like to deal with.  It is an important one.  The Minister must recognise that, notwithstanding the fact that a tariff is introduced for the purpose of providing employment, there are still a large number of people who will have the particular commodity that they have been accustomed to using for a great many years.  They will have it irrespective of the tariff.  You may call them &ldquo;old Tories&rdquo; if you like, but since they have been using a certain thing all their lives, they will not use any other.  I am sure that even in the Cumann-na-nGaedheal Party there are people of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>There are such people, and, notwithstanding the introduction of these tariffs, there will continue to be a very considerable volume of trade done in the particular items subject to tariff.  People will want these things, they will be prepared to pay for them, and they will have to get them.  If our firms here will not provide them, they will go elsewhere, and they will get them.  Consequently, if we do not facilitate them, the firms here will lose that particular trade.  These people&mdash; not by any means a small section&mdash;will get into the habit of going elsewhere, and when they do that they will buy other articles as well.  Therefore, unless we facilitate the traders that have to do with these commodities, we are going to do a real injury to the State. When you have to do a trade of that character, it is quite obvious that mistakes <Col N="329" /> will occur, as they occur in every trade.  When traders here order goods subject to this duty, they will find sometimes, when these goods are sent over, that they are not in accordance with instructions.  These goods will nave to be returned.  That is an everyday occurrence in every business.  It may be that sometimes we do not convey our ideas accurately; sometimes we do not get for our orders the amount of attention that is necessary. But, from whatever cause, these mistakes will happen.  That is an item in business&mdash;an important item.  Let me give you one illustration in that respect. It is in connection with boots. I will read a letter I got within the last few days from a very large firm in Dublin.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On the 1st of June, 1924, Nor-which sent us a consignment of children's shoes.  Amongst them was a number that, on being sold, we found were proven unsatisfactory.  We complained to the manufacturers, who instructed us to return any of this number we had.  We returned them seventy-three pairs on the 1st October, 1924, valued at £17 11s. 9d. We claimed a rebate of duty on this amount&mdash;viz., £2 12s. 9d. &mdash;but we were told that there was no provision made by the Government for rebate in this case, and our claim was declined.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <P>Could the Deputy tell us the figure at which those boots were sold?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy the information that was given to me. It is the principle I am talking of and not the price.  If trade is to be carried on, we will have to get facilities.  I put a question to the Minister based on that particular case.  I will ask the leave of the Committee to read the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Finance if he will make provision in the forthcoming Finance Bill to enable the Revenue Commissioners to refund the duty paid on all imported articles where such articles are re-exported unused, in whole or in part, on account of defect or other causes within <Col N="330" /> a period of one month; whether he is aware that the Revenue Commissioners are at present compelled, by reason of this omission, to refuse refund on certain returned articles?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the reply that I obtained:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I regret that I do not see my way to introduce legislation to give effect to the Deputy's suggestion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If these are the lines that we are going to do business on with the assistance of our State, we will never make poor Ireland a successful industrial country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>This subject has been very fully debated and has been regarded by Deputies from every angle. Looking at it as a whole, the Budget is, in Deputy Gorey's words, &ldquo;as good as we could expect under the conditions.&rdquo; We have been accustomed to extravagant expenditure in this country for a few years past.  Perhaps we had become so accustomed to it that we were more or less accepting it as a state that was to continue.  Beyond doubt, the Minister's Budget will bring a measure of relief.  The abolition of the tax on tea and the reduction of the tax on sugar ought, in my view, to have a very satisfactory effect upon the people of Northern Ireland.  Coming from near the Border, I understand what the feelings of the people on our side have been for some time past.  The fact that now the necessaries of life can be procured more cheaply on this side than on the other side, ought, I think, to influence the people of Northern Ireland, many of whom are not very sympathetic or willing to do their share to make Ireland one and indivisible.  It will have a good effect, too, on many of the people in the Saorstát along the Border.  Some of the people were encouraged to engage in what we might term illicit traffic across the Border.  I would suggest to the Minister that it might not be inadvisable to consider the question of amnesty to those who have infringed the law in the past, now that they are going to be put on the same plane as the people across the Border, and the temptations are going to be removed. I think we should permit those people to return to their homes.</P>

He paid in 1898 half the rate of the farmer.  We all know that the grant in recent years has not been half or even one-third or one-fourth of the rate the farmer has had to pay.  This matter could be satisfactorily adjusted, from the farmers' point of view, only if something like an average of the local rate for the last ten years were taken and the share of the Agricultural Grant made proportionate to the share that was given in 1898.  It may seem, because the Agricultural Grant has been doubled, that we are getting double what we were getting in 1898.  That is not so.  The conditions are very different.  The rate then and the rate we have to bear to-day bear no proportion to the grant then and to the grant we are getting to-day.  All the same, it is a good deal and, in the year we are facing, it will mean much to the farmer. We recognise that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does seem, taking the Budget as it stands, that there is a disposition to settle down to an annual charge of something about £25,000,000.  So far as one can see, that is the disposition at the moment.  It would be much better that this State should aim at a Budget of about £20,000,000.  I cannot see that any action that can be taken, whether regarded from the point of view of the protectionist or free trader, will be as helpful or as beneficial to the progress of the State as reducing the national expenditure to a figure that it will be possible for the State to bear with comparative ease.  While it is all right for the Ministry and for those others who are whole hoggers so far as the Budget is concerned, to say that the farmers are getting a good deal, I say that the farmers are giving a good deal.  There is very little of the £25,000,000 that is to be collected under this Budget that will not be contributed by the farmers <Col N="332" /> one way or another.  Outside what will come to us from investments abroad, probably not half a million will find its way into the Exchequer that will not come directly or indirectly from the farmer.  I do not mind whether it is paid in income tax by Deputy O'Connell or Deputy Johnson, or Deputy Good, or any other Deputy, it percolates all down the way, and it is the man on the hill has to dig it all out before any of the others can pay. The farmer definitely and perfectly understands that the great bulk of the taxation levied and collected in this State has to be found by him first.  We have been twitted by the Minister, and by some of the professors&mdash;I do not know which of the many&mdash;on there being no possibility of getting the country out of the rut if our point of view be taken account of.  That is a strange thing.  It is true we are looked upon by some as being rather foolish at times&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should say that we are looked upon as being uninitiated.  It is very peculiar that no man seems to be freer of comment upon and to despise the people who work on the land than the man who is only a short stage removed from the land, and whose living, directly or indirectly, comes from it.  That is not the spirit we ought to try and inculcate in this country, and it is not the spirit that ought to be displayed by the supposedly learned ones.  It is all very fine to say that the Agricultural Grant means much to the farmer, and that the tax on tea and sugar mean a great deal.  I admit that the remission of these taxes means a good deal.  But our complaint is that the farmers' plight to-day is so bad, between local taxation and national taxation, that his life is the poorest and most slavish of any citizen of the State.  Deputy Sears spoke about the farmers' sons leaving the land.  I say that not only are the young people leaving it but that the older people want to leave it, too.  They are doing their best.  I know the country as well as most people, and I know how many farms <Col N="333" /> are for sale to-day and no one to buy them.  I know what price could be got for them a few years ago.  I know what the position is of men who are trying to get off the land.  Let anybody deny that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell Deputy O'Connell the price of a farm if he wants to buy it.  I can get him dozens of farms and no one to buy them.  It is not a jest.  It is true, and if anyone suggests that it is not true I challenge contradiction of it.  It is sometimes said that the State is dependent for its existence on agriculture, and we have to realise how serious is the plight of the State in that case.  I cannot honestly see how we are going to exist and make progress in an industry which is the foundation and mainstay of the State if it has not got the best chance, and if it does not get a chance before any other industry in the State.  I say, further, that action on the Government's part ought not to be a temptation to take people off the land into the towns and cities.  England and her statesmen to-day feel that she is over-industralised, and they are trying to get away from that. That is the situation in every industrial country to-day.  Mass production has brought things to such a pass, and competition is so keen, there is hardly a living for people engaged in industrial work.  That is the position, and yet it seems that we are being drawn along that path, and being drawn from the fields and brought into the towns and cities.  I say that that should not be done.  If there is any living or any ease obtained in Ireland to-day, it is found in the towns or cities.  If you want to see the life of a slave, go out to the small farms and see the farmers, their wives, sons and daughters, and you will find that they are the people who are getting the least return for their work and the least encouragment. I say that you will not have any trouble whatever if you pursue a certain policy in building up a State where people are leaving the land for the towns, and you will get any amount of people from the land to cut down wages in the towns just as <Col N="334" /> happened in the case of the strike in Letterkenny asylum.  We know how easy it was to get thousands of people to take up work there.  It is the same all over the country to-day, as it is almost impossible to get a living out of the land.</P>

      <P>No, I admit that, and the reason it is so hard in the towns is that it is so terribly hard in the country.  I can see there is one way in which the agricultural industry can get a chance.  I do not want to be taken as being against the rising up of industry.  I am not, and I do not stand for the man who, no matter what he may want and who can get Irish manufacture, goes elsewhere for his goods.  A citizen who does that is not doing his duty to his country.  I do not stand for that, but I do stand for this, that if the Ministry has to do its duty to the country it must remember that agriculture is the thing on which the country has to rely.  It must get every chance.  The only chance I see is by such a reduction in taxation as will enable us to produce more and at a less cost.  Then we will be able to get a living and compete with others. When we get the living, other people will get their share, and if we do not get it, how can others get it who are dependent on us?</P>

      <P>I will answer that. My belief is, so far as I can see, the only protection agriculture can get is to reduce the expenses of running this State and so enable us to reduce our cost.  That is the best protection agriculture can get.  There is, I say, a possibility that some slight impetus may be given to some agricultural produce by a tariff for a little time, but would that be wise or sound?  That is the point.  We have taken up the attitude, and, I think, consistently and rightly so, that a demand for protection of agricultural products must bring in its train an acceptance of the principle, and we must admit to others the right which we are claiming for ourselves in our industry.  We know that these others outnumber us by ten to one.  We know that thousands and thousands will claim protection for trivial industries and that they are almost as numerous as the number of our farms.  I say that if we concede the principle of the acceptance of tariffs, while the Ministry at present may decide to put a tariff on two or three articles that may be manufactured in this State to-morrow or the next day, and while we concede so much, what are we to say to the Irish manure manufacturers, what can we say to the people, of whom Deputy Sears spoke, from Wexford, the agricultural machinery manufacturers?  What can we say to any body of men who rise up and say, &ldquo;We are going to establish an industry for the production of a certain article.&rdquo;  What can we say to them if we claim the same for ourselves? What will be the effect on our industries?  The effect will be to raise the cost of living, to raise the cost of production, and where do we stand when it comes to our competing with the foreigner?  I do not see in our lifetime the prospect of Ireland producing all the produce that could be consumed by the community.</P>

I admit it is easy for the Minister to reply and say, &ldquo;It is only a matter of £600,000.&rdquo;  It might easily be £1,000,000, and I say that that is going to come down to us, to be carried by us.

      <P>I admit that there are only so many farmers, but I tell the Minister whether a man is working at the port of Dublin to-day, whether he is working on a railway, or whether he is lecturing in a university to farmers' sons and daughters, or whether he is the secretary of a labour organisation, the money comes almost entirely from the fields.  I stand over that absolutely. If I have to go into details to prove it, I think I will be able to do so.  The Minister for Agriculture has admitted that himself.  There has been a suggestion that the whole question of expenditure in this country should be gone into by a commission of experts. The Minister said that it is the obligation of the Government as a whole to take responsibility for expenditure. He leaves it to us to examine into whether this expenditure is justifiable or not.  My opinion is that it is not possible for any Deputy who is doing the work he was elected to do to go into the Estimates, as they are presented to us, and determine whether expenditure is justifiable or not.  The Minister for Agriculture knows, just as I do, that there are not very many Deputies who can claim to have the ability to go into these Estimates, or to give the time to them that is necessary, if it is to be satisfactorily done.  He may not agree with me, but he knows, as well as I do, that it is the considered opinion of the country that there is a necessity for a reduction in taxation and that there is also room. I think there is a good deal of reason in that.</P>

      <P>I will come to the Minister's point.  If the Ministry are perfectly satisfied that there is no room for a reduction in expenditure, they can satisfy any Commission that the expenditure of every penny is justified. They can prove that, and if they are able to satisfy the Commission I do not think there is any Deputy so terribly keen on being unfair or unjust to the Ministry, that he will accept it at random that the Ministry are not acting <Col N="338" /> fairly or honestly in their administration. If such a Commission is set up, and there is a reason for setting it up, from the Government's point of view as well as from the point of view of the taxpayers, they will be able to satisfy that Commission and they will be able to satisfy the country.  That is what the country wants.  If men have suggestions to make, as to how expenditure can be reduced, they are not going to go to the Ministry or they are not going to bring it up in this House.</P>

      <P>I do not know why. There may be reasons.  They will go to an independent commission and they will point out to that commission where inquiry might be made and whether expenditure in a certain Department, or on certain things, is justifiable or not.  No Minister who is doing his best need be the slightest bit afraid to stand over any action of his before any committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question, finally, of the Budget, as it stands, there is a reduction of taxation.  The position will be somewhat eased, but it will not bring that relief to the country, in its present state, that the country needs.  I agreed with the Minister when he said that very much can be done by the people who are charged with carrying on the work of the main industry.  Very much can be done by them, undoubtedly, in the way of increased production. Increased productivity would make it possible for us to carry a heavier burden of taxation, but I am afraid that that can only be done by the farmers getting a start first, by reducing taxation much lower than it is.  The Minister himself, in making comparisons between the prices of foreign and home bacon, told us that the farmers can go into the markets and sell pork for £4 a cwt., while they pay £5 per cwt. when they go into the shops for foreign bacon.  Does the Minister know why the farmer takes his £4 worth to the market and brings home £5 worth of bacon?  I presume he does.  He knows that there are demands on him for rent and rates, which he has to meet, and that he cannot afford to keep in his house £8 or <Col N="339" /> £9 worth of home bacon.  That is the problem he has to meet.  The Minister may say that it is not a problem for Deputy Wilson, Deputy Gorey, or some other Deputies on these benches, but it is the problem for the great majority of the farmers of Ireland.  The Minister knows that.  The small farmer has to take the produce of his fowl or of his couple of cows to the market, in order to be able to meet rent and rates, and he has got to get something to use in his home in the meantime.  Before the small farmers of this country are in a position to do what the Minister points out they ought to do, I think something else has got to be done. They have to get a start, they have got to get a help some way.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants them to do that, it is his responsibility to take steps to give them that start.  They want it now, and I advise the Minister to take counsel with his colleagues and try to do what we can for them, because if something is not done very soon in that way, the Budget returns for the coming year will be much below the Estimates, and our trade balance will be much more against us at the end of the coming financial year than it was at the end of the last financial year.  When the time comes to discuss the next Budget, I am afraid that the condition of the country will not be as satisfactory as it is at present, unless action is taken, and that very soon.</P>

      <P>I have listened with attention to Deputies in this debate.  While there were several suggestions made to reduce the tax on this article and on that, not a single suggestion was made to the Minister to reduce the tax on tobacco.  When I say tobacco, I mean twist and plug, which are the kinds of tobacco smoked by the poor.  The taking of the tax off tea, and the reduction of the tax on sugar, will certainly be a great boon to the poor people of the country. There are many poor families, to my own knowledge in the West of Ireland, who can very well manage to do with from 5s. to 6s. worth of tea and sugar in the week, while the same family cannot do without 10s. or 12s. worth of tobacco.  I would, therefore, seriously <Col N="340" /> ask the Minister to consider this matter, and to reduce the tax on the tobaccos I have mentioned by at least 3d. in the ounce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDoyle" hpid="Mr. M. DOYLE Mr. M. DOYLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that Deputy Baxter has put the case very fairly before the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture as far as Deputies on these benches are concerned.  The Minister for Agriculture made a very severe case to-day against any protection for the farmers' commodities.  The farmers, as well as the Minister for Agriculture, are nearly agreed on that point, but may I say that the farmers are not the initiators of this protection, which comes from the benches occupied by the Minister.  It started there and continues there to the detriment, I say, of the cost of living and of agriculture. We never initiated this protection question.  The Minister told us what a humbug protection was for our commodities.  He actually told us that it had done us more harm than anything else.  As far as I am concerned, I quite agree with him.  I tell him again that we are not the initiators of this protection.  It came, as I say, from those on the Government benches, and from them alone.  If the incentive for it had not come from the Government benches for certain industries, I can assure the House that there would never have been a question of protecting any of the farmers' commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had to rise to the occasion when we saw this protection forced on us all round.  When we had to bear most of the brunt of the taxation, I think it was up to us to look for some concessions in the way of protection for our commodities.  I may say that we are not in favour of protection of any sort.  The protection that has been put on by the Government will certainly be detrimental to our interests.  It may be said that we are receiving £600,000 under the agricultural grant in the rural districts, but this sum, bearing in mind the present purchasing power of money, is in actual value not half what the Agricultural Grant was when it was first given in 1898.  In that year, too, the rates were less by one-fourth of what they are in the country to-day. Now, because the Agricultural Grant <Col N="341" /> will be double what it was last year, the Minister for Agriculture thinks it is a concession enough for the farmer, and ought to be sufficient to enable him to carry on without any more financial aid.  Probably it is.  We welcome it, and we will do the best we can with it.  I was glad to observe the attitude of Deputy Johnson on this matter.  He thought, and, of course, I agree with him, that we are not getting enough.  He argued very forcibly that something further should be done for the agricultural community, and in taking up that attitude I hold that the Deputy was right.  He asked that some further stimulus should be given to encourage the productivity of the land in the way of more tillage, and he definitely held that we were not getting sufficient.  I am glad that he is in agreement with Deputies on these benches on that question.  The tariff on clothing apparel alone will more than level up the amount of taxation that has been taken off tea and sugar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I say it will as far as our community is concerned.  Take the ordinary family of six, what will be their savings on tea and sugar in the week?  I say it will not be more than 1s. 6d.  Then take the clothing of these six people, and add to the old purchase price of them the tariff of 15 per cent., and I say that your 1s. 6d. per week will not go anyway near balancing the outlay for clothing for these people.  I defy contradiction of that.  Another thing that is taxed severely is furniture. Of course, it does not come very often into the province of the farmer to buy furniture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Finance to remember all the destruction of furniture that has taken place within the last two or three years, and that is not yet replaced.  In the awards that have been given to people whose houses and furniture were destroyed, will he grant an exemption from that tax of 33 1/3rd per cent. to enable them to purchase new furniture?  In justice, I think he ought to do that because, otherwise, we will be penalised at the rate of 33 1/3rd per cent. when we go to purchase our new furniture.  I hope, <Col N="342" /> therefore, that people who are given awards for the destruction of their furniture will get an exemption from the Minister from the payment of this tariff when making new purchases of furniture.  In conclusion, I hold that the Budget is not favourable to agriculture. I do not care what the Minister for Agriculture says, but that is my opinion.  I heard no Deputy who ridiculed the farmers to-day more than did the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. MURPHY Mr. T. MURPHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to be very brief in the remarks I have to make.  There are a few matters to which I would direct attention.  In connection with the new taxes, and perhaps the omission of some other taxes, I would like to re-echo what has been said by Deputy O'Doherty and other Deputies in connection with the need for duties on woollens and tweeds. We, in Cork, are particularly concerned with the difficulties under which a number of mills are working.  Deputy O'Shaughnessy could bear me out in the statement that a number of mills which I happen to know are running on short time.  At one time there was a flourishing woollen mills in the part of the country that I come from, Bantry, that is now absolutely closed down.  I am aware, of course, that reasons other than the want of protection might be responsible for that calamity.  I am aware of the fact that a very large number of persons who were dependent for a livelihood on their employment in that particular mill are now unable even to get the unemployment benefit.  I saw a very large number of them in Bantry recently, and I saw the machinery in that mill getting rusty and useless. What I saw impressed on me the urgent need of something being done to put that industry on a better foundation generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter.  I wish to refer to the position of the Irish slate quarries.  It has been referred to in this Dáil before, and I think that the Minister might have done something to protect the slate industry in Cork. It is a notorious fact that for a long time Welsh slate in very large quantities has been coming into the country while the slate quarries in Cork county <Col N="343" /> and other parts of the Free State are idle or practically idle.  The Minister may say that a tax upon foreign slate would tend towards increasing the cost of houses, and I presume Deputy Good would not agree to it.  It is a regrettable fact also that persons in this country who obtained compensation from the State and are replacing houses destroyed during the troubles are spending Irish money in purchasing foreign materials for the replacing and reconstruction of those houses.  I think the Minister might at any rate do something towards bringing pressure to bear upon people who have got money in the shape of compensation, and insisting that these people, if they have no sense of patriotism of their own, would be compelled to use Irish-manufactured slate and so help to put the money got from the State to the best possible use.</P>
    <P>I also would like to have seen a proposal such as that mentioned by Deputy Cosgrave included in the Budget, and I may say that I think there are a very large number of people in the country who would like to see a remission of the tax on beer.  The Minister for Justice would hardly agree to that, I suppose, and perhaps it is a very unpopular suggestion to make, but I do hold that there are many people in this country to whom beer is something more than a luxury, and there are very many workers who would welcome, and to my mind who would need, some remission of the tax on beer.</P>
    <P>I regret also that the Minister has not seen fit to replace the money deducted from the old age pensioners.  I think the money taken from the old age pensioners is the biggest blot upon the administration of the Government, perhaps the only blot, and certainly the Government should be pretty well aware of that.  They know that the restoration of that shilling has been pressed upon them by our friends all over the country, and by people in the country, irrespective of party.  I think it is a pity that the income tax should be reduced, while the old age pensioners are kept in the position that <Col N="344" /> they are in, and I did hope that the Minister would consider that matter as one in regard to which something might be done long before the twelve months which he mentioned.  On the whole, I believe his Budget is going to do a great deal of good, and I am satisfied that the proposals for the imposition of new taxes, the protection proposals, will be welcomed by the people generally.  It has been very clearly proved that the imposition of new taxes, from the figures we have received, will mean additional employment, and that certainly is one of the things that will be appreciated by the people of this country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to unemployment has been for many months, and is still, lamentable.  Last week in the city of Cork, a procession of unemployed persons to the number of 7,000 or 8,000 was seen and responsible members of trade unions in Cork city very conversant with the position have told me recently that they could well do with work for 20,000 persons.  While I believe that the solution of the unemployment question is, unfortunately, still a long way from us, I welcome the advance the Government has made towards providing something like a permanent solution of the problem, and while I think that something might have been done with regard to the few items I mentioned, I am satisfied that the Budget as a whole is a good one and is going to be popular in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with some remarks made by some of the last speakers, first.  Deputy Good, I think, must not have a very good memory for dates, because he told us a beautiful story of how the Corporation Profits Tax was imposed during war time how, when peace came about, the British Government after the first year of peace reduced it to 6d., later on abolished it altogether, that we on the contrary continued that tax in a state of absolute peace and far away from war and that that was a very unjustifiable thing.  As a matter of fact, the Corporation Tax was not imposed until after the European War was over. I think it was imposed in 1920, so the theory of its being a sort of tax that <Col N="345" /> could only be put on in moments of extreme emergency does not hold.  He was also wrong in reference to the period that elapsed before the bottle duties became effective.  The Budget speech containing the proposals for the bottle duties was made on the 25th April and the bottle duties became operative on the 12th May, so that the actual amount of forestalment that took place in the case of bottles was not very large.  I do not think that there was a very large stock of bottles already in existence in the country works.  I do not think that tourists from America will encounter any difficulties with the Customs as a result of the new tariffs. They will cause them no inconvenience. As a matter of fact, trunks are already examined and the trunks of people coming from America will not be examined very closely with a view to finding apparel that ought to pay duty. I should say people like them will experience no difficulty at all in the examination to which their effects will be subject in the future, compared with the examination that was made of them in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister see that instructions are issued to that effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be quite unnecessary to give any special instructions.  As a matter of fact, in France, there is a tax upon a certain class of wearing apparel, but one does not find that genuine travellers are subjected to any inconvenience in connection with it.  I do not think that any difficulty need be anticipated.  There might be a certain difference in examinations at Dun Laoghaire and places like Dundalk, because you might have people making frequent trips for the purpose of bringing apparel in that should be taxed and bringing it in as personal effects, and it may be necessary to make special arrangements to ensure that that tax is not evaded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of dealing with defective goods which have been taken out of Customs custody by a manufacturer or trader and are returned after a considerable period with a demand that duty be repaid, the Deputy should <Col N="346" /> understand that to allow that would be opening up many opportunities of defrauding the revenue.  In general, the position in regard to Customs tariffs must be just that which prevails in the Post Office: when you take your change from the counter there is no rectification if it is wrong.  You cannot very well in general do anything different with the Customs.  When people take their goods and have paid their tax, then the Customs have nothing more to say to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not the opportunity of examining the goods before they take them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that a very reasonable examination could be made before they are taken out&mdash;perhaps not a very full examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>That is impossible at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the shipping companies and others concerned have provided all the accommodation that should be provided and that they ought to provide for the traffic.  Considerations of space may create some difficulties, but if the transit companies would provide suitable accommodation there would be no difficulty in any trader making all the examination that would be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>That would only meet the difficulty partially, because it would be impossible to say with regard to a number of these goods whether they were right or wrong, without making a careful examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>If you adopted an arrangement to have the duty refunded or a draw-back paid, it would be difficult to be sure that you were not paying back at a higher rate than the duty was paid at, or that you were not paying on different goods altogether.  It is a matter that would not be easy to arrange. It is quite different from allowing certain goods in on certain conditions without duty, with the idea that they should be re-exported, because in that case you know exactly what is <Col N="347" /> going to happen to these goods; you can have the premises inspected and make arrangements to ensure that the revenue will not be defrauded.  But, in the case of an ordinary trader simply bringing in goods, not for re-export, you cannot exercise supervision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk in the course of this debate about a Geddes Committee.  It seems to me that the people who talk about a Geddes Committee have not given themselves time to think a great deal about it.  As a matter of fact, most of the discussion and advocacy of the Geddes Committee has been simply in the nature of repeating a parrot cry.  I do not know whether anybody who talks about it has tried to find out exactly how the Committee worked and what in effect the Geddes Committee was.  If you had really a Geddes Committee that would do what is wanted, a really perfect committee would put its imprimatur simply on all the demands of the Treasury officials.  A Geddes Committee that was not absolutely perfect would sit in judgment between the Treasury and the other departments that wanted to spend. The Geddes Committee that would try to make investigations on its own behalf in the departments would be a joke.  I do not say that the time may not arise when some sort of a committee like that, to put its imprimatur on the demands of the Finance Department that certain services should be cut down, might not be a good thing. Such a time may come, but there is no volume of demand which the Finance Department is making on other departments and which it cannot enforce. Your Geddes Committee must hear the evidence that the people from the Finance Department put up to it.  It can, if it likes, hear any evidence in contradiction from the departments that wish to continue expenditure, and come to some decision.  But to get a group of business-men or others to come into a department and decide whether there was too much staff for the work to be done, or anything of that nature, would be impossible.  It would be impossible, again, to get the business-men; it would be impossible <Col N="348" /> to get the personnel of the committee. There are not so many business-men of outstanding ability, who have the leisure, and who would have the backbone to stand up to the sort of criticism to which they would be subject, to do this work.  If it were supposed to be possible that a committee such as has been suggested should actually go into the departments, go through each branch and inspect the work of each clerk, you would have to have men who would be prepared to spend many months&mdash;perhaps I should rather say years&mdash;at the work, away from their own business, and they would want to be business-men of some standing.  Obviously they could not be had.</P>
    <P>You cannot put up a committee such as that to deal with policy.  Some people think that if you had such a committee the Government or the Dáil should delegate to it such questions as recommending whether we should have a Department of External Affairs, or a Department of Fisheries; whether we should have any connection with the League of Nations, or whether we should have an Envoy at Washington. You could not delegate such things to a committee.  You gain nothing by trying to divide your authority and getting up a super-Government of some sort over the Government that you have.</P>
    <P>Then again, apart from big questions of policy, there are minor questions that have, at any rate, a political complexion, and I have no hesitation in saying that, in some ways, a very large number of possible people for such a committee from the point of view of their business knowledge and standing, would be utterly impossible and unsuitable because of their political past, and because of the political questions that arise.  We are a new State.  We have divisions of a type that do not exist in Great Britain.  Things that might be well done five or six years hence could not so well be done now.</P>
    <P>I may say that I spoke to representatives of various business organisations on this question and discussed it frankly with them, and, after discussion, at least a couple of groups of business men whom I met said frankly <Col N="349" /> that they did not believe there was anything at all in this Geddes Committee idea and that in fact it was really in the nature of &ldquo;tosh,&rdquo; the circumstances being what they are.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooper asked about the cost of collection of the Customs entry duty and the parcels delivery fee.  There is no appreciable cost involved in the collection of either of these taxes. They are extremely easy and cheap to collect.  The postman collects one in the ordinary round of his duties and it adds nothing appreciable to the cost of Post Office administration.  The other is collected by affixing stamps and involves very little trouble, except the counting up of the items by the Customs officer.</P>
    <P>It is not true to suggest that we are really imposing a multiplicity of small taxes and that we are altering the scheme of taxation, as it were, by doing that.  Listening to Deputy Cooper, one would have thought that when we took office there were two or three great main taxes and that we were adding a multiplicity of vexatious small taxes to them.  In fact, we have probably removed as many taxes as we put on. There were duties on chloroform and a number of other preparations which we have removed.  There were safeguarding of industries duties and key industries duties which we removed, as well as the duties we removed from tea, coffee, and cocoa. To suggest that we are really adding to the number of taxes in a way that is vexatious to the public is not a suggestion that will bear examination.</P>
    <P>Neither is our position in relation to the imposition of tariffs exactly the position of Great Britain.  Deputy Cooper talked about the system the British are initiating, whereby firms or industries who want protection will have to prove unfair competition, prove that they were likely to employ more labour, and that they were efficiently conducted.  That is all very well when you have a big industrial country and when dealing actually with the safeguarding of industries, but when you are dealing with a country that is not industrially developed, when your tariffs&mdash;if you are going to impose them&mdash;are not so much for <Col N="350" /> the protection of industries that are there and in full development, but for the protection of industries that are in their infancy, and for the stimulation of industries, you are in a different position.  I am not saying that in the course of a year or so we ought not have some sort of formal tribunal examining matters and having cases made and opposed before it.  At present, certainly, we cannot apply standards that are suitable in Great Britain. It may be that an industry was not efficiently conducted here and that might be one of the reasons for applying a tariff so that you will bring in people who would conduct it efficiently. One might say that the application of a tariff in certain cases has already done that.  The fact of an industry not being efficiently conducted in Great Britain would be a case for not putting on a tariff.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the question of beer and spirits, and it was suggested that it was unfortunate we had not budgetted for a reduction in the duty on beer or spirits.  A reduction in the beer duty that would give one penny reduction per pint would be £1 per standard barrel, assuming that the brewers also gave some reduction. The cost of that, if there was no increase in consumption, would be something like £750,000.  We made inquiries, not in connection with this Budget, but in connection with last year's Budget, to see if there was likely to be any increase in consumption that would prevent the loss to the revenue being the full £750,000.  The result of the inquiries, which were as careful as we could make them, was that there would be really only a very slight increase in consumption and that we would have to look on certainly three-quarters, or more than three-quarters, of the £750,000 as a dead loss to the revenue.  We did not feel that we would be justified in giving that reduction at that cost, and in consequence, were unable to give other reductions, because while a small number of people might with some justice claim that beer is a necessity to them, they are nothing like one per cent. of the community.  People who could justly claim to be habitual users of <Col N="351" /> beer or stout are only a very small proportion of the community.</P>
    <P>When you are thinking of a remission of taxation when it is high, and that only a limited remission can be given, you must remember that an article such as sugar is used by the whole community&mdash;men, women and children.  Beer is perhaps used by one-sixth of the community, or perhaps less. Perhaps not more than one-tenth habitually use beer or stout.  You would be failing to give a reduction, or would give a much smaller reduction on an article of common consumption in favour of giving a reduction on an article of much more restricted consumption. Again, as the beer revenue is not falling and as the yield from spirits duty has fallen, and shows some signs of falling a little further, it could well be argued that it is really on the duty on spirits we should give a reduction. Socially, I do not think that would be desirable.  I do not think it would be well to aim at increasing the consumption of spirits as against the consumption of beer.  In any case, if we were to give reductions that could be felt on both beer and spirits we would be unable to give any other reductions elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It may be that the pot-still industry shows signs of dying out.  Certainly it does not seem in a good way.  It is not merely a matter of the duty we have put on spirits.  In other countries the distilling industry does not seem to be dying out.  It seems to be flourishing. I do not know what steps could be taken by distillers here to check the sort of decay into which their industry seems to be falling.  I am certainly convinced that the cure is not in a reduction of duty on our part.  Their outside markets seem to be falling away.  Whether the fault is theirs, or whether it is due to circumstances over which they have no control, I do not know.  The whole question of the decay of the pot-still industry is a bigger one than we could deal with in this Budget, in the ordinary way.  It may be well that fashions have changed or that the ordinary development of the industry has made it necessary for <Col N="352" /> a complete revolution in methods here. As I say, that is a very big matter.</P>
    <P>Much the same reply applies to tobacco.  Tobacco certainly is not fully a necessity.  It is not used, shall we say, when we take the women and children of the country into account, by one-third of the population.  A reduction that would be felt appreciably would be a reduction that would involve very considerable sums of money.  Deputy Cosgrave talked about a reduction of 3d. per oz.  I think 3d. per oz. would involve us in almost one and a half millions of revenue.  I do not think we could justify giving a reduction there at the expense of a reduction in other commodities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Figgis suggested that it was not proper to borrow for the money necessary to re-pay Ways and Means advances and Savings Certificates.  He said that should be done out of revenue. If we were to provide for the repayment out of revenue of Ways and Means advances and Savings Certificates, as well as what we are already doing, that is the repayment of the National Loan Sinking Fund and Compensation Stock drawings, we would be providing £1,240,000 out of revenue for the redemption of debts which, I think, with the size of our debt and our actual position, would be somewhat unnecessary As a matter of fact, the repayment of Savings Certificates will not require anything in the nature of funded borrowing.  The amount that will come in from the taking out of new Savings Certificates by the public will far exceed the amount that will be required to be paid out of the Central Fund for Savings Certificates cancelled. Ways and Means advances are in the nature of temporary borrowing, which may well be funded.  I do not know whether Deputy Figgis's remarks were made after any consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Figgis also asked when would steps be taken to float a new loan.  My answer would be that that question cannot arise for a considerable time.  We have £1,600,000 of an Exchequer balance.  If we raise a new loan, the money must lie in the Exchequer; by law it cannot be invested.  We would get some small rate of interest <Col N="353" /> on it, but we would pay 5¼ per cent. on what we would borrow.  Naturally, we would not float a loan until we had actually increased our short-term borrowings. It would be some considerable time after our Exchequer balance was exhausted before the question of floating a loan would arise.  Deputy Redmond said that really we were not deducting sufficient items from the total, with a view to getting at the normal and recurrent expenditure.  He suggested that we should only regard £1,000,000 of the Army charge as normal. I cannot see that we can, in any reasonable time, get to the position where the cost of the Army would only be £1,000,000.  I think it would be entirely unsound to regard such a small portion of the Army cost as recurrent, and to borrow the rest.  If we were to take a figure that we do not see some reasonable and immediate prospect of getting down to as recurrent cost, and borrow for the remainder, we might find ourselves piling up a type of debt that would be very injurious to the credit of the country and to the ordinary industries of the country through the effect of State credit on those industries.</P>
    <P>I am absolutely satisfied, and firm in the opinion, that we must never put ourselves in a position where we can be accused of riding for a fall in the matter of State finance.  It was suggested that separate rates of reduction might be made in income tax under the various schedules.  There are many things we might do in the matter of changing the system in regard to income tax.  But I do not see that we can do very much until we have arrived at some simpler procedure in the matter of double taxation relief.  I believe that if we were now to depart very largely from the system under which the tax is levied in Great Britain, the granting of double taxation relief or the recovery of tax due under the Double Taxation Relief Scheme would become a very much more difficult matter.  Computations are difficult enough at the present time.  The principles under which relief is given are complex enough, and if we added to these by widely separating our provisions from the British provisions, I <Col N="354" /> think it could only have the effect of making the Double Taxation Relief Scheme, as it exists, unworkable.  If it were made unworkable before we had a simpler one to replace it, the effect would be to drive capital out of this country.  I feel that in our position it is easier to drive capital out of the country than it is in most other countries. The capital itself, in a great number of cases, is actually out of the country.  What is here is ownership of the capital.  There is £150,000,000 or £160,000,000 of Saorstát-owned money actually invested outside.  One of the ways in which we can drive capital out of the country is by driving a proportion of the owners of that capital out.  If you do that, you do sustain a national loss.  comparable in some ways to the loss sustained by the absenteeism of the landlords.  The people go out, the wealth goes with them, and national ownership of a certain amount of money is lost.  We cannot afford to make it practically impossible to get relief from double taxation. I think I have already said that we are exploring means to get the whole problem of double taxation put on a much better basis.  I have written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in connection with certain proposals that are on foot in the matter.  I hope, before the next Budget comes along, we will have got something that will be equitable to this country and will not involve us in any loss of revenue. We certainly could not accept any arrangement that would involve us in loss of revenue.  I hope we will arrive at a system that will be simpler for the taxpayer and that will avoid much of the vexation and delay that is inevitable as long as the system stands as it is at present.</P>
    <P>We have been asked: &ldquo;Why close the door?&rdquo;  Deputy McBride has said that the Minister for Finance is obviously against protection himself. People have asked: &ldquo;Why not put a tax on woollens and on leather?&rdquo;  It is easy to show why a tax should not be put on woollens or on leather.  I think I have already dealt with woollens. If we put a tax on woollens and do not want completely to destroy all making-up and tailoring in this country, <Col N="355" /> we must put a higher tax on apparel. If we put fifteen per cent. of a tax on woollens, there must be a thirty per cent tax on apparel.  One can stand for putting a thirty per cent. tax on something like furniture, where the purchases are not so frequent, and where the renewals are not so necessary and so urgent as in the case of clothing, but we do not feel that we could&mdash;or that any Government could &mdash;in the position that exists, stand for putting up the cost of clothing by, say, thirty per cent. or more.  Consequently, it is impossible to deal with the question of the taxation of woollens.  The same thing applies to leather.  A fifteen per cent.  tax on boots would be no use if you had ten or fifteen per cent. on leather.  You must add the boot tax to any tax you put on leather and again, you would have a rise of a marked character.  In any particular class of goods, that rise would have reactions on public opinion, and on the experiment, that would be very bad indeed. There is no possibility that a tax could be put on either of these articles for several years to come.  There is no possibility of the boot or making-up industry being so firmly established, so well organised, so well capitalised, for some years at any rate, that we can think of taxing woollens used in making up, and leather used in the making of boots.  People who feel alarmed at the prospect of closing the door for a few years and people who are interested particularly in articles of this sort, may be satisfied that whether the door is closed or not, the things they are interested in will not be really materially affected.  I am not a against protection, and I am not a believer in protection as a panacea.  I certainly am not a believer in our deciding that everything that ever has been made or that can be made in this country should be made the subject of a tariff, so that for the future the whole requirements of the country in that particular line, shall be made here.  We feel that we must limit the speed at which we can go.  Even assuming that we were to go the whole hog, it would be necessary to limit the speed.</P>
    <P>It would be improper to put on the <Col N="356" /> country the cumulative burden that would be involved if an undue number of protective tariffs were to be imposed. There are a number of industries which we cannot really give protection to, because we must go slowly, apart altogether from the question of regarding the matter as experimental.  Those interested in those industries, instead of attending to the adoption of new methods and trying to meet and overcome their difficulties, would, if some pronouncement were not made, spend the whole of next year on our doorsteps, or spend the year in clamorous agitation for tariffs, in seeing Deputies, promoting agitation and, perhaps, making their case a great deal worse than it would have been, if those concerned in the management had simply made up their minds that nothing was coming to them for the present and that they had got to get their teeth into it and hold on.  Certain things have been mentioned here and regrets have been expressed that tariffs have not been put on.  There are a great number of things that could be protected.  But we simply cannot take them on.  It would be unfair to the country.  I believe it would destroy the prospects of the experiment that we are making and I believe it would add to the cost of living and add to the burden that the agricultural industry has to bear. Brushes and brass ware, iron-founding and polish-making, paper-making and agricultural implements, earthenware chemicals, artificial manures, slates, cement, building stone, builders' woodwork, carriages, vehicles, matches&mdash;all these and other industries are clamouring for some sort of protection.  I am largely in agreement with Deputy Baxter when he talks about trivial industries which clamour for protection. I certainly feel that a lot of these little industries have no real possibility of growth before them and that it would simply be burthening the community to protect them.  In any case, I think we have gone a long distance.  It will be some years before all the space we have made by these protective measures for our industries to grow in has been filled up.  It will be a long time before our boot industry <Col N="357" /> is supplying anything like the percentage of the country's requirements that it might supply.  I suppose we will always have a certain percentage of imported boots, but it will be a very long time before eighty or ninety per cent. of the boot requirements of the country is provided by our own factories. There is ample room for the absorption of labour, the extension of premises and the installation of new plant there.  It will be a good while before all the hosiery that is needed in this country is made here and until all the articles of apparel that the country requires are made at home.  There will be room for growth each year and it is not necessary to be in such a hurry in the matter.  There is no necessity for us to be seeking out some new thing each year to put on our lists in order to give employment to people who, perhaps, will not be employed by the industries already protected.</P>
    <P>I think we will give those industries already protected a greater chance of benefiting if we do not extend tariffs unduly.  It is said of certain countries, with very high protection systems, that they have neutralised to a very large extent the benefit of protection in the case of each industry.  A very high tariff means increased production-cost to each industry, with the result that some of the benefit of protection is taken away from that industry.  I feel that, whether we go very far or only a short distance, it is better that we should be content to go by reasonable steps, and that we should, as it were, dig ourselves in industrially before we try to advance further.  Let some of those industries that we have protected get themselves well established. Let them accumulate or attract the capital that is necessary.  Let them train their workers.  Let them get their plant.  Let them reduce their cost.  Let them conquer the market here and be in a position to bear their share of any burden that may be involved by fresh advances.  I do not think that any Deputy should have any regret that we are going to stop, for the moment, in the matter of protection and that we are going to let those tariffs that we put on have their effect to some reasonable extent and let the <Col N="358" /> country have a real demonstration of what can be done.  It is clear, from the case of the boots, that a year or two years gives you very little time for knowing what exactly a tariff is going to do.  We have given a good deal of consideration to this matter and Deputies will, I think, if they reflect, see that we are well advised in arranging for a halt and for the possibility of what would correspond to a stocktaking by the whole country.</P>
    <P>What I said in my Budget statement had reference to manufactured goods. Although I cannot see that agricultural tariffs would have any effect, it did not preclude the possibility of agricultural tariffs.  I do not think that the Farmers' Union, or any other representatives of the farmers, will, on consideration, think it wise to demand tariffs on any particular class of goods, but if they do, we are not precluded from dealing with them in the next Budget.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gorey talked about the number of civil servants employed by the State&mdash;22,000 or 23,000.  Two-thirds of those are employed in the Post Office. Apart from the additional staff required in the Board of Works, in the Army Finance Office and offices dealing with damage, commandeering and work of that character, a number of the additional officers are engaged in the Land Commission and in the Department of Agriculture.  Lately, I was asked by the Minister for Agriculture to sanction certain additional payments in respect of cow-testing.  I could easily have taken up the attitude that we could spend no more money. But I had the view that expenditure on cow-testing was reproductive, and that, even though it was devoted to some extent to the employment of some sort of State servants, it was proper expenditure and good expenditure.  I believe that the expenditure being undertaken by the Land Commission is absolutely good expenditure and reproductive expenditure.  When you have the lands divided, you will have real wealth produced, as well as contentment created that will be worth the expenditure.  There is no use in talking about the employment of people as if it did not matter whether <Col N="359" /> they were working or not working, or what they were working at.  It all boils down to a question of what value the community is getting.</P>
    <P>There is not a bit of use in talking about twenty, twenty-two or thirty millions and talking about Denmark. The real question is what is being done for the money.  Is it a kind of productive or reproductive expenditure? It may be that certain expenditure is too long in being reproductive and such as we in our circumstances could not afford.  There might be need for cutting that off, but the real question in connection with expenditure is what is being done with the money.  Deputy Gorey said the expenditure could be reduced by four or five million pounds.  It could.  I was looking at the Estimates the other day and saw that they could be reduced by fourteen or fifteen millions without destroying the means of preserving order and continuing the State.  We could do that by wiping out the Department of Agriculture, by stopping the work of the Land Commission and abolishing the old age pensions, by saying that people who wanted their children educated should pay for the education, thus stopping all expenditure on education, on hospitals, on harbours, and grants to local authorities for asylums.</P>
    <P>We could save 14 or 15 millions in that way if that were a policy that commended itself to the Deputies, and we could have low taxation, but I do not think this country would benefit by cutting off services which all modern nations regard as essential services and are taking up more and more.  I do not think there is any great room for reduction in expenditure. I do not say that some fairly substantial amount cannot be saved, but when people are talking about sums of four or five millions they are talking without having considered the matter very fully.  If we like to cut off all services they can be cut off, but I do not know any big service that can be cut off.  It is very common to say that national health insurance can be cut off.  I do not think that is correct.  I think there is a great deal of misrepresentation on national health insurance, <Col N="360" /> that on the whole very good value is given, and that even the agricultural worker gets good value out of it. While the system may be improved, it is not the kind of system that you may cut off.  Neither can you get rid of money for services that are a distinct social benefit.</P>
    <P>It is a common theory that civil servants are tumbling over one another in the offices.  I do not say you might not have a superfluous staff here and there.  One of the things in the organisation of the Civil Service that seems lamentable is the sort of bottle-necking in the matter of responsibility. A great number of men and women in the lower ranks of the Civil Service are put on work of a routine character where they are very much controlled and have little responsibility.  The responsibility is more concentrated than it would be in many types of business organisation.  You will find that lower types of civil servants may tend to go to seed, but in all the responsible grades of the Civil Service I think anyone who has experience will say that you will find no more hardworking class in the community.  Anyone will know that there is no one in this Dáil who works harder than those types of civil servants do.  The suggestion made that you have men with big salaries walking around the offices and spending the time idling, is the biggest nonsense that could be sent around. That is the sort of thing you will always hear and that will always be thrown out by people who would not be able to pass an examination to get into the Service to the end of time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gorey suggested that one of his principal objections to the Budget was that he had no confidence that there would be a response to the gesture which was held out to industry. I do not agree with him.  I really think there has been a good deal of a vicious circle in this country, that you had not efficiency in industry because you had not the industrial spirit and you had not the industrial spirit because you had not the industries there as a result of inefficiency.  By breaking this vicious circle we will have.  I believe, better work and people turning to industry.  For instance, men of one <Col N="361" /> particular class from the point of view of money and education are going into professions.  I believe it would be a great gain to have men of a particular stamp and education turning their minds to industry and production rather than other ways of life that, in many cases, mean their export to other countries.</P>
    <P>As regards workers in industries, I believe if there is a development and a prospect of steady employment you will have a good response from them too.  I feel satisfied we will have a good deal of difference in the whole mind of the country and in the minds of all sorts of workers if we once get any sort of progress going.  This will not be without its effect on the farming community because it will do more good for the farmers than anything else if some of them were to think more freely about their own business.  Great improvements could be made in agriculture, but the farmer is very often unable to turn to those new methods and adopt them.  Any change in the outlook of the country is going to have its reaction on agriculture.</P>
    <P>We did one thing at any rate for agriculture and that is the arrangement to inaugurate a beet sugar industry. Deputy Wilson said that it was ridiculous that a subsidy should be given and he said you could buy Tates' cubes at 30/- per cwt.  A beet experiment must be a costly experiment and big sums must be paid over a long period of years before there could be any hope of that industry standing on its feet.  You must get people in to build a factory.  Big sums must be invested and if you are not sure of a supply of beet, big expenses must be incurred. Experts must be brought in from other countries.  You must get the farmers accustomed to growing beet and able to grow it.  The industry will only get on its feet when the farmer is able to get a big crop each year with a high sugar content, and when the farmer is able to grow beet well knowing the treatment that suits the climate here He must also be willing to grow beet with a small profit.  A great deal of the growth of beet depends on its careful cultivation and the condition it leaves the soil, as a result of the good <Col N="362" /> cultivation and heavy manuring it requires.  In other countries farmers do not expect big prices on the beet. It will require that the farmers must be paid at first what we may regard as abnormal prices which the beet sugar industry could not pay until the heavy crops are grown.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister for Agriculture referred to the beet-growing experiment, but in any case it is the foundation of agriculture, in many of the countries in which it is grown.  If the experiment is a success here it will not only give employment, but it will give it at seasons in the year when it is badly wanted.  It gives it in the winter months.  It will also increase winter dairying and improve the efficiency of agriculture.  It has done that in other countries.  There are countries now, that after long years, are able to grow beet in Europe without any subsidy.  It will be a long time before we reach that stage, but if we reach the stage in a short time when it can be grown at a moderate subsidy, it will be worth our while to have factories put up.  The industry, when set up, will have a revolutionary effect on agriculture.  Taking all the facts into consideration, we are not paying very much more than the British, and the experiments have been going on there for a very considerable time.  Big losses have been incurred.  Certain workers will have to be taught how to work.  It will take many years, and as I pointed out when I was speaking on Wednesday, our terms are not comparable with the British terms unless those facts are taken into consideration. Then, again, this country has certain disadvantages compared with Great Britain for anyone starting a beet industry here.  Firstly, coal, which is a big item in manufacturing sugar, is dearer.  Transport is, perhaps, worse and the cost of transporting beet to the factory is an important item.  Engineering workshops do not exist here. Any break-down in the plant during the manufacture of beet sugar, unless it can be immediately repaired, involves the breaking of the process and heavy losses.  One of the results of the small number of skilled workers in this country with regard to the item of <Col N="363" /> equipment, will be that the equipment will have to be triplicated here, where it is only duplicated in Great Britain. Repair workshops will have to be set up for factories of a size not required in Great Britain, and mechanics will have to be brought here.  Higher wages will have to be paid them.  All those things will make the subsidy required very heavy, compared with the subsidy required in England.  We are satisfied, after a great deal of thought and study, that the terms we have got are good ones, and may be described, having regard to all the circumstances, as being even with the English terms. Deputy Davin, I think, asked whether the National Cycling and Athletic Union would be included with the Gaelic Athletic Union, and Deputy Heffernan asked would Rugby and hockey and other such games.  The form of the section which will go in the Finance Bill has not yet been settled. The only thing definitely settled is that the illegal position which has existed cannot be allowed to continue, and must be regularised.</P>
    <P>The proposal in reference to the Dog Tax was to make a change in regard to the financing of the expenses of the District Courts.  In the past, the Petty Sessions Courts, which the District Courts succeeded were financed out of the Dog Tax and other funds and now we wish the District Courts to have their expenses provided by the Dáil in the ordinary way.  The proceeds of the Dog Duty tax will go direct into the Exchequer.  The duty has been 4s. With a 1s.  stamp we are making it a 5s. duty.  It will be slightly higher, therefore, in the case of a person who has a certain number of dogs and pays 4s. each on one stamp.  There would be one or two other remissions in the case of a dog transferred from one owner to another.  I think the point which Deputy Gorey raised about putting the particulars of a number of dogs on one paper can be met and I see no reason why the difficulty cannot be got over.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have referred to the Road Tax and some Deputy referred to it in connection with the Ford car. <Col N="364" /> I certainly would be prepared to meet the case but I do not think we can legislate specifically for a particular type of car, even if it is made here.  I do feel that in the present formula the car pays an undue proportion of tax, compared with other cars of the same weight which travel at a high speed and that the formula is unfair to that car.  I think we cannot legislate for that particular car. Whatever is to be done should be done generally, and I would not like Deputies to take it that we are going to propose a petrol tax, because the duties we are deciding to impose in this Budget will for some time give just as much as they can do to the Customs administration, and I would certainly not like to do anything that would add largely to the press of work that is to be done there, because if you overload your Customs administration it can only have the effect that care will not be taken to collect the duty.  Remember, that well over half our staff are young men just brought in.  If you start those young men with the practice of not collecting the duties you will have demoralisation in the service for which the country will pay dearly in the future.  On the other hand, if you are overburdened and insist that the duty be collected, then you will have great delays in the importation of goods and a genuine cause for dissatisfaction amongst the people.  I think, even if it were to be effective, this proposal could not be attempted under the tax for the present year.</P>
    <P>We believe that Farmer Deputies are looking at the future and looking at the whole position from too narrow a paint of view.  However important industry is, you cannot measure the life of a country by simply taking the industries. You cannot talk about farming and ignore the people who are brought up on farms and have to be provided for.  You cannot talk about farming and ignore the people who have come off the land into the towns.  We cannot split this country into a whole lot of economic segments and deal with each separately.  We must have the country as being one economic unit, and we must try to do the best for the whole <Col N="365" /> country on the balance.  I have said before, and I wish to repeat it, that I believe that for a reduction of taxation or anything of that nature, the best hope is in the improvement of productivity. I regard these protective tariffs as being in the nature of an investment. I have said that often before, and I think it is an absolutely true presentation of the position.  It may be that we are too poor to pay very much in that direction, but we are not so poor that we must neglect the future for the present.  It costs something to send a boy to learn a trade.  It costs something to send a young man to a university to learn a profession, but if he is any good it is a good investment. If the industries here are such as have any prospect of growth, this is a good investment.  It should repay the whole community to spend a little to enable them to become established and to grow strong.  The growth of these industries will mean an increase of wealth to the whole country, and if we have new industries springing up we will have new sources of revenue.</P>
    <P>I do not anticipate any great falling off of revenue because the boot tax or the apparel tax in a year or two may not yield such a return as the workers in these industries who would not otherwise be employed, will be consuming dutiable commodities, and new sources of revenue will be created.  I believe that if you increase the number of industries, if you increase the population of the country in a way that it can be supported, not merely the increase that occurs through the stoppage of emigration, but an increase through increasing the productive capacity of the country, then the public services will become proportionately cheaper.  Your Post Office service will become proprotinately cheaper, your Customs system will become proprtionately cheaper, and so also your headquarters administration. Your expenses and the <Col N="366" /> losses incurred in educating and in bringing up children and sending them out of the country when they could earn and repay what has been spent on them will cease.  A lot of your doles and unemployment grants and expenditure on works of relief in giving employment will also cease.  I believe that by having, as it were, the country taught its trade, and the possibilities of the country developed, you will get great relief from taxation and you will get opportunities for the farmer. But if you look at it in too narrow a way and think of nothing but keeping down expenditure, regardless of what the result may be, you may make your farmer a worse farmer, you may cause social and political difficulties and disturbances to arise in the country and you may breed such a spirit that the farmers, in the end, will be far worse off as a result of this economy.</P>
    <P>I think it is about time to take some sort of hopeful and confident outlook for the future, in feeling that in this country we can do at least what other peoples have been able to do in their countries by bending our minds, all of us, with something of the altruism that was in the political movement, to the work of economic development.  I do not see any reason why everybody should not be anxious for the development of new industries, for improved methods in all industries, and interest in them, in the way that they were interested in the political changes and the political cause of the country, in the past, and if we can turn what there is of patriotism and public spirit in the country into economic channels, I think very big results can be achieved</P>
