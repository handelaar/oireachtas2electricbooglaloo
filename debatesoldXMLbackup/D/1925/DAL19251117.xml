      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state why repeated communications of mine addressed to his Department relative to the claim of Mrs. MacDermott, Killeshandra, for compensation for bedding supplied to Volunteers and afterwards taken over by the National Army, and the claim of Mrs. McGahern, Killeshandra, for meat supplied at the same time, as well as the matter of a number of claims for compensation for the dismantling of motor cars by orders of the British Authorities, have been continually ignored; if he will state when these claims will be paid, and if he will take immediate steps to hasten same.</P>

      <P>It is much regretted that any communications from the Deputy should have remained unanswered.  The two claims have actually been considered by the Indemnity Act Committee and will be discharged at a very early date.</P>
      <P>Correspondence relating to claims for compensation in respect of the dismantling of motor cars should have been addressed to the Compensation (Ireland) Commission, whose awards in a number of such cases will shortly be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and discharged without avoidable delay after publication.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, the Deputy's first communications were apparently addressed to the Compensation Commission, which is not a branch of the Government at all.  The case was not within the purview of the Compensation Commission, and perhaps that is how the difficulty arose.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state how many money-lenders are registered as such in the Saorstát, and whether there are any registrations under the Registration of Business Names Act, 1916, as money-lenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question, the number of persons at present registered as money-lenders <Col N="371" /> under the Money-lenders Act, 1900, in An Saorstát is 178.</P>
      <P>The second part of the question should strictly have been addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce as the Administration of the Registration of Business Names Act, 1916, is under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, a matter for his Department. I have made some inquiries, however, and find that to supply the information asked for in this part of the question would involve a search through over 7,500 files, and in view of the fact that all money-lenders are bound under severe penalties to register under the Moneylenders' Act, 1900, and that the number of persons so registered has been stated in the reply to the first part of the question, the Minister for Industry and Commerce agrees with me that the result would not justify the expenditure of time and money involved.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that the residence of Mr. R. W. Evans, Doneraile, was raided by the Detective <Col N="372" /> Division of the Gárda Síochána and two swords (old family relics), fishing tackle, and accessories were taken therefrom; whether the object of the visit was in connection with a gun stated to have been held by Mr. Evans without a permit; whether this man applied for and paid for a permit several weeks previously, and whether the articles taken from Mr. Evans will be returned.</P>

Evans on the 1st October last under a search order issued in accordance with the provisions of the Firearms Act, 1925.  No fishing tackle or swords were taken on the occasion.</P>
      <P>Mr. Evans applied for a limited certificate for a gun on the 5th September, but as an application for a similar permit in respect of the same gun was received from a Mr. O'Connor, no certificate has yet been issued.</P>
      <P>A muzzle-loading pistol and a quantity of percussion caps and accessories for making shot, were seized during the visit, and proceedings for the illegal possession of these articles are about to be instituted against Mr. Evans.</P>

      <P>The answer to the question is in the negative.  I propose to enforce the existing law.  Smallpox has for some time been endemic in parts of England and elsewhere, while An Saorstát has fortunately been immune.  In the last serious outbreak of the disease the mortality recorded in Dublin amongst unvaccinated as compared with vaccinated cases was as 6 to 1.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that Home Assistance Officers are now compiling figures as to the numbers of unemployed persons in their district; whether he is aware that in the course of such work, Home Assistance Officers in some cases merely call at Unemployment Exchanges and obtain figures of the numbers of persons registering, thereby providing a totally inaccurate return, and whether he will arrange that in order to provide an accurate return Trade Union officials in the different districts and other persons with local knowledge will be consulted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a statement was made during the discussion in the Dáil, before the adjournment last June, that the figures then supplied were inaccurate?  Take, for instance, my own constituency, in which the return stated that there was no unemployment whatever.  I gave a flat contradiction to that and invited verification of it.  I will ask the Minister to say whether the method adopted <Col N="374" /> now to gain that information is as unreliable as was the method adopted then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. MURPHY Mr. MURPHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that these figures are compiled simply by the officials going into the local offices of the Labour Exchange and asking how many are registered for unemployment, without having any regard to the position of those people who have never registered in the offices of the labour exchange?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture if he will state the number of Agricultural Credit Societies which have been established in the Saorstát since 1st June, 1925, and what portion of the £100,000 voted for their establishment has been applied for and advanced to date.</P>

      <P>The number of Credit Societies registered since the date in question is eight, while corresspondence <Col N="375" /> in regard to the setting up of other societies is proceeding.  The amount advanced up to the present to new societies is £3,500 (in the proportion of £2 to each £1 of local deposits). Until recently previously existing Credit Societies were not able, under the terms of the scheme, to obtain advances from State funds, but, under a modification approved by the Minister for Finance this difficulty is being removed, and it is anticipated that advances against the existing deposits of a number of these societies will be made at an early date, in response to applications from them for the purposes of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that at the time of the old Sinn <Col N="376" /> Fein Party, of which I presume the Minister was also a member, persons who went down to Carlow told the people there to guarantee the price of the land and that they would make it right when they got into power in the new Dáil?  Does the Minister intend to introduce legislation whereby the guarantors will be made safe, and the land will be left so that it could be divided by the Land Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a number of supplementary questions which, possibly, the Deputy could have asked me and in reply to which I could have given him a considerable amount of information; but I did not expect that he would make the case that the old Sinn Fein Party told the people down there to give this guarantee and that they would make it all right when they would come into power.  I never heard that.  I may say that there are proposals before the Minister for Finance for dealing with such cases as this.</P>

      <P>I propose to ask the Dáil to sit later than 8.30 and to take the motion for the adjournment not later than 10.30 to-night, and also to-morrow night, in order to enable the Education Estimates to be finished to-morrow.  I propose to take the Order Paper in the order in which the items are set out on it, with this understanding, that the items on the Order Paper are non-contentious. I would like to allow time for the Education Estimates.  I move that the Dáil sit later than 8.30 p.m., and that the motion for the adjournment be taken not later than 10.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose that motion. The Dáil was called together a fortnight ago; we met for three hours, and then the President moved that we adjourn for a week because he had no business.  Now he comes forward and suggests a late sitting.  It seems to me to be a very curious procedure that, on the one hand, Deputies should be called from the country and sent home again in one day, and then within a week afterwards, when nothing new has occurred&mdash;when nothing but what could be foreseen has arisen&mdash;the President <Col N="378" /> comes along and asks us to sit late.  Now, I think that is no way to treat the business of the Dáil, and I think the Dáil should not agree to the extension of the sitting.  As a protest against the method adopted of conducting business, I shall certainly oppose the motion.</P>

Several Deputies have been serving on Committees from early this morning, and it is not fair to expect them to sit here during the debate until 10.30 p.m. and then serve again on a Committee to-morrow morning.  It is not right to expect that of some Deputies, who feel there is an obligation on them to be present as much as they possibly can be during this debate.  One Minister may come into the House and have the business he is interested in disposed of; then another Minister can come along, and Ministers can, so to speak, work in relays.  Deputies cannot do that, and it is not fair to expect them to do so much as they are now asked to do. I will support Deputy Johnson in his opposition to this proposal.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputies Johnson and Baxter.  It is unfortunate, at this early stage, that we should be asked to put in what, in the case of those Deputies who sit on Committees, amounts to a 12-hours' day. I would like to have a little more light thrown on the President's statement to the effect that it is assumed that the items on the Order Paper are not contentious. For the most part they are Departmental matters.  I hope, if we accept the President's view that they are non-contentious so far as the Second Reading is concerned, that we shall not be thought to be debarred from putting down amendments on the Committee Stage.  Though the whole Bill may not be contentious from the point of view of principle, there may be details in it that are objectionable. I, therefore, want to enter a <i>caveat</i> at this stage.  I think I can make in Committee <Col N="379" /> the point that I am anxious to raise; I will not do so on the Second Reading.  In respect to one of these Bills I do desire to raise a point.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to support the view put forward by Deputy Johnson.  The President has not made any case, so far as necessity is concerned.  What is the necessity that urges the President to put forward this motion?  This matter has been sprung upon us.  There are many Deputies who have made arrangements in regard to other business. All of us have our time well occupied on Committees and one thing or another. It is not a case of getting the Education Estimates passed within a certain time so that they may be included in an Appropriation Bill, or anything of that sort.  As a matter of fact, the Estimates are already passed.  This is largely a question of a debate which can be postponed and continued into next week, if necessary.  This was the understanding under which the debate was taken up; it was understood that the ordinary business of the session would have precedence over the Education debate, which could be continued at different periods until finished.  I cannot see the necessity for this late sitting. No argument has been put forward by the President to show that any necessity exists.</P>

      <P>I would like to mention that I calculated the time during which the debate on educational matters was proceeding in the Dáil and I discovered that it was more than one-fifth of the time that had been allotted for the discussion on the Estimates. I understood it would have been generally agreed that the question could be put to the House to-morrow night at 10.30.  The Minister for Education, in order to be present here, put off appointments on to-day and to-morrow.  If the House is not satisfied that there is sufficient time in which to discuss the Estimates, it will simply mean that we will be taking the Estimates to-day and to-morrow and then holding the debate over until next week.  I am prepared to do that.  As <Col N="380" /> I say, I understood that the question would be taken to-morrow night and that the time I was allotting to the discussion was ample.  If what I am suggesting is not acceptable to the House, I will not press it.  The discussion on the original motion could be continued after to-morrow.</P>

      <P>I think it is quite discourteous to Deputies that the President should, without, as far as I know, any previous communication of any kind with anybody, endeavour to make a complete change in the programme set out for the Dáil.  As I have already stated, the House adjourned for a week without having any tangible reason for so doing.  Much of this legislation that is now placed on the Order Paper could, with an hour's, or two hours' foresight, have been dealt with during that week.  Motions have been put down by two Deputies and the <Col N="381" /> regular arrangements were made for discussing those motions.  Now the President thinks he can come along and put everything aside.  He tells us that because it suits the convenience of one Minister, the House itself must have no consideration.  I protest emphatically against such procedure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not very much inconvenience if a motion put down for consideration on one day is taken for consideration on another day, and in any case it would not be done without the consent of the House.  I am putting forward a motion for the approval of the House, and I have generally got accommodation in that direction.  I have generally met any applications made to me in the same spirit as that in which members <Col N="382" /> have met me.  If the proposals which I have made do not meet with the approval of the House business may be shortened this week, and that is a matter about which Deputies must make up their minds.

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be well, even at this stage, if some explanation was given by the Minister as to the necessity of the Bill having the proviso that these provisions should only apply until a certain and definite date to be fixed.  I would like to know whether it is the view of the Minister that, apart from the possibility that at some future time electricity may be supplied by the Shannon, the powers supplied by the Bill are undesirable. If they are desirable, in any case, it seems to me that we ought not to insert this proviso regarding the period, because there is a possibility that the period may be very greatly extended, and if there are evils connected with the proposition to confer these powers upon undertakings then it is well that we should be warned in time and not <Col N="385" /> confer the powers for an unlimited period.  I do not know whether the Minister has any information to give to the House as to the period, or probable period, which he has in mind if these powers should be granted to local authorities and to electricity undertakings. If there is any difficulty, or anything undesirable in conferring them for an unlimited period upon local authorities or electricity supply undertakings, we should not press the Bill. Personally, I do not see that there is any great evil; in fact there might be good, but others who may have more knowledge about electricity undertakings might see evils if these powers are to be permanent or extended over a long period.</P>
      <P>From a review of the present position in regard to the Shannon Electricity Supply, and the amount of progress that is being made, and is likely to be made, under conditions which the Minister and the Ministry have supported, I think the chances are that the scheme will be prolonged very much beyond the date which was originally contemplated, and, as a consequence, there may be danger in giving these powers for a much longer period than was contemplated when the Bill was drafted.  I would like to hear the Minister on that point as to whether he considers that the three year period is sufficient in view of the policy of the Ministry in regard to the rates of wages to be paid on that undertaking, whether he still thinks that the rates of wages are sufficient to induce classes of men to work at the job who are capable of carrying out the work, and whether there is likely to be any longer period than was contemplated occupied in the work of preparing for the Shannon electrification scheme.  I want to say that, in my judgment and with my help, the scheme will take much longer to perfect unless the terms and conditions which have been ratified in effect by the Dáil are greatly amended.  The Dáil should understand that the period contemplated in this Bill will be very much longer than that originally suggested when the Minister moved the First Reading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked two questions.  One has been <Col N="386" /> perfunctorily put and the other is the important one.  I need not delay over the first.  It is not a question of good or evil, but a question of convenience. The Deputy, or other people, may say that there is evil in it inasmuch as to a slight extent it runs counter to certain privileges which statutory undertakings have heretofore provided, but this Bill has been introduced at the suggestion of statutory undertakings likely to be affected and has their approval in principle and in detail, with the exception of a slight amendment, which I hoped to have moved here the other day and which I now expect to move in another place.  The second point is the important matter, as to the time the Shannon scheme may take to complete, and as to the progress made or likely to be made, in so far as that progress has reference to an indefinite time not named in this Bill. It is a peculiar thing which I might reveal now in connection with the Shannon scheme, that, during a considerable period when the men were alleged to be on strike, there was really no work for them as, owing to a mistake on the part of a German engineer, the men were called before the time they were needed.  The men who were influenced, or who were authorised, to go on strike by certain theorists in this House, have the gloomy satisfaction of knowing that they had been refusing work at a time when it would have been very hard to provide them with it.</P>

All that is happening in regard to the canteen is this: that we state that there are communal food arrangements under which the men can save a certain amount of money.  If they do not like to avail of the communal food arrangements, then they can arrange for their food supplies in any other way that they like.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  The object of bringing this Bill in at the present time is, I should say, mainly to meet an undertaking given to Deputy Johnson before the Recess.  The view of the Government on this question of allotments has all along been sympathetic, but having regard to the fact that, judging by the position here in Dublin, at all events, which is the only area likely to be affected to any considerable extent by the measure in question, the allotments movement is not on the up grade&mdash;if anything, it is going down at the present time&mdash;the Government did not feel justified in giving priority to a measure of this kind at a time when the Dáil was very hard pressed with legislation.  It did not feel justified in giving priority to such a measure over Bills, the need and demand for which appeared to be much more urgent. Deputy Johnson brought the matter to a head during the last session of the Dáil by introducing a Bill himself.  He refused to withdraw that Bill until he had got a very explicit undertaking that the Government would introduce a similar measure on the first opportunity that presented itself.  In his Second Reading statement, in bringing forward that measure, Deputy Johnson made a case for the general principles of his Bill which, I think, met with practically the unanimous approval of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>This measure is intended to embody the main principles of the Bill introduced by Deputy Johnson with certain modifications, such as the exigencies of drafting and so as to safeguard the interests of all the parties concerned in the matter.  The position with regard to allotments at the present time is that under the Cultivation of Land (Allotments) Act, 1917, urban local authorities have power to acquire land for allotments by agreement. During the war they had also certain compulsory powers, but these powers have now lapsed, and the view of present and prospective allotment holders is that local authorities should have compulsory powers.  This Bill is an attempt to meet that desire.  The Bill does not go so far as Deputy Johnson's measure in making it obligatory on local authorities to provide allotments. The Bill enables local authorities, first of all, to provide land by agreement, and where they fail to get land by agreement, then the compulsory clause comes into operation.  The local authorities are enabled, under the Bill, to acquire land by agreement when they are satisfied that a demand for such land exists, and in order to test whether such a demand really <i>bona fide</i> exists, it is necessary that they be satisfied, or be of the opinion, that they will be able to get sufficient rent for the allotments to cover the cost of providing them, because there is no question of providing any of the funds out of the rates.  If the local authority is not able to acquire suitable land within its own area, then it can go outside, but it can only acquire land outside its own area with the consent of the local authority in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the local authority is in a position to acquire land it draws up a scheme stating the work to be carried out, the rent to be charged, and other material facts, and these are submitted to the Ministry which can approve of the scheme with or without alterations. When the scheme is approved it becomes binding on the local authorities. It can only remain in operation for five years, as it is not considered advisable that a local authority should be committed to acquiring a fee simple interest <Col N="391" /> in land the value of which is likely to fluctuate considerably.  If, after making reasonable efforts to get the land by agreement, the local authority does not succeed, then it can acquire land compulsorily under the same procedure as under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and as the Land Commission fixes the price of the land acquired under the Labourers Acts.</P>
    <P>There are certain classes of land excluded from this particular provision. Any land which forms part of a demesne, garden or pleasure ground, or which &ldquo;forms part of the home farm attached to and usually occupied with a mansion or is otherwise necessary for the amenity or convenience of a dwelling-house,&rdquo; or any land held by a local authority or other incorporated body for the purposes of any railway, tramway, dock, canal, water or other public undertaking, or land which is the site of an ancient monument or other object of archæological interest, is excluded from this particular provision. It is also provided that, in acquiring land, the local authority is to have due regard to the fact that it should not acquire an undue proportion of land from any one owner, and also that it should not acquire land in such a way as would be likely to throw any large number of men out of employment.  When the land has been acquired a scheme is then drawn up and submitted to the Minister, but in a case where it is acquired by agreement he sanctions it in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>A scheme may be withdrawn within six weeks after the price is fixed by the Land Commission if the local authority is of the opinion that the land cannot be let at a proper rent, but due notice of the intention has to be given to all the parties interested. In other cases, the immediate landlord can resume his land if he can show that he requires it: if he can make out a <i>bona fide</i> case that he requires the land for housing, mining, or any industrial purpose apart from agriculture. Powers are given to inspectors to visit land, and on showing written <Col N="392" /> authority, if anyone interferes with them in carrying out their duty, they are liable to a penalty not exceeding £5.  The deeds in connection with the provision of allotments are free from the payment of stamp duty.  These are, generally, the main provisions of the Bill.  As I said at the opening, in this Bill we are going as far as we consider practicable to meet the measure introduced last Session by Deputy Johnson.  I think that the House has already expressed its agreement with the general provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is very far astray in his view of the position of the House in this matter. The Minister was good enough to say, in regard to the Bill introduced by me some time ago, that the House, during the discussion of it, expressed its agreement with the general principles embodied in that Bill.  Then we were discussing a Second Reading as we are now discussing a Second Reading. That is to say, the Minister is asking the House to agree with the general principles embodied in a Bill respecting the acquisition of land for allotments, but at the instigation of the Minister in respect to my Bill&mdash;so far from it being true, as the Minister now says, that the House has already declared itself in favour of the principle &mdash;the House refused to accept the principle of my Bill and voted against the Second Reading.  So that I am afraid the Minister has not quite understood the position regarding the last Bill or this Bill or his own action in respect to the same.  The key to this Bill may be found in the first two or three sentences of the Minister's speech.  He said that it had been brought in mainly to fulfil an undertaking given to me when my Bill was under discussion, and I think that is true.  He has brought it in mainly to fulfil that undertaking, but he has no heart in it: he does not believe in it, and he is like the Minister for Education in regard to a compulsory attendance Bill&mdash;he does not believe in it.  He is introducing it to fulfil certain demands and certain undertakings, but he is not going to put any steam into the scheme of the allotment movement.  The whole <Col N="393" /> frame of this Bill, while it goes a little way, suggests that the Department is careless, and as a matter of fact has no heart in the matter, and while it will give local authorities compulsory powers to acquire land in certain circumstances, it is not going to go out of its way to encourage local authorities to do this thing, and it is not going to put them in the position of urging or assisting this movement for the compulsory acquisition of allotments and tillage gardens by town-dwellers.  If a town council under this Bill is keen and eager, then it may be able to persuade the Ministry that no great harm is being done, but the Ministry at any rate is not going to give any assistance to urge councils to push forward the allotment movement.  The defects of the Bill may be said, mainly, to consist of omissions.  A Bill carrying out the general policy of the Ministry is chary of giving powers when a local authority endeavours to exercise any powers, and is going to retain as tight a hold as possible, and to erect all safeguards and all possible obstructions against a local authority carrying out its powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill we proposed we had regard to a very general demand in small towns and country districts from labourers for land for the grazing of cows and goats.  We inserted a provision in that Bill for grazing plots to be held by groups which would provide grass for cows, grass for goats, and so on.  This Bill contains no such provision.  It rigorously rules out any provision of the allotments movement to cover cow parks.  We also find that there is no direct encouragement of allotments in the way we suggested, ensuring that the people actually concerned in the movement will co-operate with the local council, by taking part in the direction and management of the holdings.  That was a provision which I considered of great value and one which was recommended by all the allotments associations both in Ireland and Great Britain, and, I think I am right in saying, was approved of by the very competent commission of inquiry that discussed this matter in respect to Scotland.  It would have been evidence of a real interest on the part of the Ministry if they had adopted a provision of that kind, <Col N="394" /> such as was inserted in the Bill we introduced.  I think restrictions regarding the acquisition of land outside the jurisdiction of the council are such as would enable a county council, for instance, to frustrate the growth of the allotments movement amongst dwellers in a town.  It is true, of course, that compulsory powers may be sought. We all know that the obtaining of compulsory powers in a matter of this kind means adding greatly to the expense and trouble, by making easy the placing of obstacles in the way of the growth and development of this movement, especially when the Bill provides that all the legal expenses must be borne by the allotments holders through the rents to be charged.  That, I think, is a defect which I am sorry the Minister has seen fit to insert in the Bill.  I also think that the provision of a five years' limit is unnecessarily short, and that, at any rate, ten years could be readily conceded without causing anyone any trouble or doing anyone any harm.</P>
    <P>So far as it goes, the Bill is acceptable. It is very short of what is wanted to meet the needs of this movement. Perhaps even more important is the evidence of lack of enthusiasm and real interest in this matter on the part of the Ministry.  They say there is no sign of the movement growing.  I think I have proved&mdash;I could have added much in the way of evidence if it was required&mdash;that so far as the City of Dublin and district were concerned, the movement had declined&mdash;by no means had it failed&mdash;because of the state of the law and the obstruction involved by the re-acquisition of the land by the former owners and the lapsing of powers under the Defence of the Realm Act.  Even if it were true that there is no evidence of any great force behind this movement in the country, I submit that it is a movement that would be worthy of positive encouragement by the Ministry instead of the careless lack of interest that is shown by the Minister's speech, and the Bill itself.  The movement has within it very commendable characteristics and is capable of assisting very many men in bad times to feed their children. One would have thought that that itself <Col N="395" /> would lead the Ministry to take up the work with some enthusiasm instead of introducing a Bill of this kind mainly to meet an undertaking given to myself by the Minister.  We must be thankful for small mercies and I am not going to oppose the Second Reading. I hope it will be possible to amend and extend its provisions before the Bill passes through the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson has thanked me for the Bill, even though he considers it a small mercy.  Naturally I did not expect him to enthuse very much, but I thought he could give us credit at least for the alacrity with which we met his wishes, as expressed before the Recess.</P>

      <P>So it was.  The main points touched on by Deputy Johnson as being left out of the measure dealt with the provision of common pasturage. I am not at all in favour of the idea of having common pasturage near our cities and towns.  Even in the country, where local authorities have powers to provide such plots, they have not been, by any means, a conspicuous success.  For the most part they have been used by fairly large landowners and very seldom for the purpose for which the original Act intended them.  I think five years is a very necessary and a very sensible safeguard. As I said, property, particularly in cities, has a tendency to fluctuate in value very considerably.  Most of those plots consist of property which is likely, within a short time, to be used for building or for similar purposes.  It would be a very serious matter for the community at large if a local authority could acquire such land for a long period.  It would also be a serious matter if they had to hold on to such land at a rent which might be altogether above what might be the average rent of similar property in the district.  For that reason, I think five years limitation very reasonable.  But we can discuss these matters more fully on the Committee Stage.</P>

    <Title>COURTS OF JUSTICE BILL, 1925&mdash;SECOND STAGE.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Courts of Justice Bill, 1925, be read a second time.&rdquo;  This Bill is something in the nature of a second thought.  It proposes to dispense with portion of the machinery provided for in the Courts of Justice Act passed last year.  It proposes to dispense with the Court of the High Court Circuit and transfer to the Central Criminal Court all cases that are outside the criminal jurisdiction of the Circuit Judge, including such cases as are now pending and were returned for trial to this Court of the High Court Circuit.  The Committee which sat between January and June, I think, of 1923, to make recommendations on the judicial system recommended that all criminal matters should be dealt with by the Circuit Courts except comparatively trifling cases which would fall to be dealt with summarily by the District Justice and, at the other end of the scale, that the more serious class of offence, such as murder, attempted murder, treason and, I think, one other rather rare offence, piracy, should be dealt with by a judge of the High Court rather than by a Circuit judge.  Proceeding on that view they recommended that Commissions of Assize should be sent as required to such centres and at such times as the Executive Council may determine for the amalgamated counties. There should be a Central Criminal Court for Dublin city, and the home counties system of Dublin, Louth, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow, each judge of the High Court to be liable to serve in this court.  It should have jurisdiction in all cases excepted from the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts arising within Dublin city or the home counties and also in all cases sent forward to it from the Circuit Courts of such city and counties, or in which the venue has been changed to Dublin city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conception urged by this Judiciary Committee was that cases beyond the criminal jurisdiction of the Circuit <Col N="397" /> judge should be dealt with either by the Central Criminal Court covering the area and jurisdiction of Dublin city and counties Louth, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow, and for the rest of the country by a Court of the High Court Circuit, going out periodically in some such way as in the past winter assizes were held.  In practice there seems little justification for this extra machinery of the High Court Circuit, and on reflection, having had the advantage of consultation with the judges, who acted on the Rule-making Committee, I am not satisfied that the Dáil would be well advised to proceed with constituting that Court, and I am asking in this short Bill that the Court of the High Court Circuit be dispensed with and that cases that were returned for trial to it should be dealt with by the Central Criminal Court.  Possibly the committee which sat to consider the judicial machinery that would be necessary were sub-consciously affected by the condition of things in the country at the time and the amount of crime prevalent, but on examining the cases sent for trial to this High Court Circuit one sees that they are quite few and very widely scattered through the country.  A list shows that there are four such cases from Cork, four from Mayo, four from Galway, two from Leitrim, two from Donegal, one from Longford, two from Limerick, two from Tipperary, one from Clare, two from Kildare, one from Carlow, eight from County Dublin, three from Offaly, one from Wicklow, one from Leix, one from Meath, and a total of thirty-nine cases.</P>
    <P>If one were to say that to deal with these cases a judge of the High Court should go out on circuit and sit, say, at four, five or six centres through the country, it would be an inconvenience and expense out of all proportion to the number of cases that stand for trial, and when you remember that the list represents the situation which we had through the last year, and that reasonably one might be entitled to hope that major crime would even continue to diminish, I think there is justification for the course we are now taking in asking the Dáil to share the view that this Court of the High Court Circuit is <Col N="398" /> an unnecessary portion of our judicial machinery and that cases outside the ambit of the criminal jurisdiction may well be tried by the central criminal court in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I have only one word to add.  It is in connection with the position of jurors in the city of Dublin.  A Bill is in draft in my Department which will probably be introduced early in the new year&mdash; I should hope shortly after the Dáil resumes sitting in January&mdash;which will enlarge the area from which jurors will be drawn for the Dublin courts.  It is estimated that it will exactly double&mdash; not exactly, but approximately&mdash;the panel of jurors and that under a provision of the Bill when the extension is operative individual jurors will not be called upon for service more than once every three or four years.  I think it is more likely to be four than three.  That extension will more than meet the slightly increased burden which this proposal we are now considering places on the shoulders of the jurors of the city of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear from the Minister that he has a Bill in contemplation that will, to some extent, relieve the heavy burden from which jurors in Dublin suffer.  I would like to see, if it were at all possible, the Bill introduced during the present Session. If the Minister could only spare time to attend one of these courts he would see the enormous strain that is placed upon Dublin jurors, and I think, to a considerable extent, it is loss of time on the part of many of these jurors.  If he could see his way to introduce that Bill at some period during this session, I think it would be a very welcome measure to the jurors of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two other points I pressed on the Minister in connection with the administration of justice in the city, and to which he promised to give some attention.  The first of these was, that at the present moment children who come under the provisions of the School Attendance Act, are brought up in what are now known as the District Courts.  It is true, as the Minister has pointed out, that a special day or a special afternoon is reserved in one of these courts, but it is, nevertheless, <Col N="399" /> true that these courts adjoin one another, and while one court may be reserved for the purpose of these younger children and their parents and friends, the other court is functioning immediately adjoining the Children's Court, and you have that very objectionable atmosphere and objectionable surroundings of what were known in former days as the Police Courts.  That is a matter that should be remedied, and I was hopeful that the Minister could have done something before this to deal with that grievance.  The House is unanimous on the necessity for such a measure.</P>
    <P>I also pressed on the Minister that it was necessary to do something for the commercial community.  At present the commercial community, when it is necessary for it to recover liabilities, is compelled to go to the Police Court and to bring, in many cases, the lady members of its staff to prove its different debts&mdash;to bring them into, as I have said, the objectionable surroundings of these courts.  That is a procedure that does not exist in any other State, and one was hopeful that Commerce and the importance of Commerce would have led the Minister to alter these unsatisfactory arrangements when his attention had been drawn to them.  I hope, before this Bill passes, that he will see his way to do something to remedy these two grievances which have been pressed on many occasions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, like Deputy Good, welcome that portion of the Bill which gives relief to Dublin city jurors. Within the past few days the question of relief for Dublin jurors has become rather a popular subject to tackle.  I remember eighteen months ago putting the matter forward to the Minister and asking for relief for Dublin jurors, and that the jury lists should be extended to take in Rathmines and his own area generally.  I was promised at the time that a Bill would be introduced.  That is over eighteen months ago, but even now I am glad that the Minister is taking steps to relieve them.  It is really an unfortunate thing that Dublin business men are called away from their business as often as they are at <Col N="400" /> present.  Regularly, every year, it appears to be one set of men who are called to give up six or seven weeks of their time.</P>
      <P>There is another point which the Minister might consider and that is the question of granting exemption from service altogether to the proprietor of a one-man business.  A case came to my notice within the past few weeks where a young man was called to serve on a jury and he informed me that he would have to close down his business while serving.  I think exemption should be given in these cases.  There was also a case brought to my notice in which a workman was four or five days on a jury, and at the end of the week he had no wages to get from his employer. I think there should be some method of seeing that no injustice is done to the families of men of the type I have just mentioned.  I welcome the Bill now even though it is rather late.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Such criticism as we have heard has not been criticism of the Bill.  Rather the Bill was used as a peg whereon to hang a general criticism of Court arrangements.  Deputy Good, I am sure, is quite well aware that such minor inconveniences as he refers to are not matters calling for legislation.  They do not arise from anything in the existing Act and it is not a question of the necessity of introducing something into the present Act to meet them.  It arises simply from considerations of space and considerations of Court accommodation. The Deputy raised these matters on the Estimates of my Department last summer.  I am fully conscious of the desirability of doing something to meet both cases which he mentions, the case of the Children's Court and the necessity of separating the civil business of the District Court from the ordinary Police Court business.  At present we are actually in consultation with the Senior Justice and certain others concerned with a view to seeing whether the Children's Court can be held elsewhere than at Inns Quay.  On the question of the grievance of the business community in being brought as witnesses to the District Court, I am afraid until the Four Courts is reconstructed and accommodation assigned <Col N="401" /> there, it will not be possible to separate entirely the criminal and the civil jurisdiction of the District Courts but arrangements are being made in connection with the reconstruction of the Four Courts to ensure that we will be in a position to meet the point of view which Deputy Good expressed on this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne welcomed that portion of the Bill which gives relief to the Dublin jurors.  Of course, if Deputy Byrne had read the Bill more carefully he would see that no portion of it gives relief to Dublin jurors, and that in fact, in so far as the current Bill affects Dublin jurors at all, it is to increase somewhat their already heavy burdens. I spoke of a Bill which will be introduced this year if possible&mdash;if not possible this year, then, certainly early next year&mdash;which will extend the area from which jurors are drawn to the courts that are held in Dublin city.  It is proposed to take in the townships for jury purposes, and I think the effect will be to about double the jury panel.  At present in Dublin I think the individual juror is called upon to serve about once every eighteen months.  That is considerably more often than the individual juror down the country.  I think in most counties it is estimated that a juror is called upon to serve about every three or four years.  The proposed extension of the jury area for the Dublin courts will just about put Dublin jurors on a level with the country jurors as regards frequency of service. It will mean, I think, that they, too, will be called upon to serve every three or four years.</P>
      <P>I am glad that in so far as there has been criticism, it was criticism in respect of sins of omission, real or imaginary; that no one finds serious fault with the actual contents of the Bill, and with the proposal not to proceed to set up this Court of the High Court Circuit.  I am satisfied that the situation in the country with regard to serious crime does not warrant that step, and that the proposal that is embodied in this Bill will also be to some extent a financial economy.</P>

      <P>On Vote 41 in connection with the headquarters of the Department I have a few remarks to make.  I can find here no provision, and I believe there is no provision, at the headquarters of this Ministry for research work in the science of education, if I may put it that way.  Education is a science that, like other sciences, does not stand still.  Progress is being made continually; there are interesting developments in many countries, and there is nobody, so far as I know, at the Department to keep in touch with these developments in other countries, to keep the people here who are interested in educational matters in touch with them, to supply information as to what is being done in other countries, and to issue reports occasionally. On more than one occasion I was anxious to find out, when considering a special problem in this country, how that problem had been dealt with in other countries.  Naturally one would turn to the Department of Education for information on such a matter, but no such information was available, and we had to try to get it elsewhere as best we could.  I think it would be very well if there were at the headquarters of the Ministry one or two officers set aside to do that kind of work.  We have problems that are not present in other countries.  I believe there are very few countries that attempt to teach two languages in the primary schools.  We would be very much interested to know if there are any other countries, as I believe there are, where that problem is present, where it has been tackled, and how it has been dealt with.  That would be exceedingly interesting information, and I would be glad if the Department were in a position to supply it, issue occasionally reports as to what is being done, and generally to collect information of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that such body or Department might do: they might work in connection with the preparation of school-readers or schoolbooks generally.  There is a very general complaint that the books used in our schools are not always of the kind that we would be anxious to see <Col N="405" /> used.  If one examines or thinks over the rather haphazard manner in which they are prepared and published, one could hardly expect them to be otherwise. A programme or syllabus is issued by the Department of Education, and immediately a publishing firm get hold of that and prepare books that they think are suitable to fulfil the conditions laid down in the syllabus. It is true, of course, that they have to submit these books for sanction before use, but that approbation is only of a negative kind; it is hardly sufficient.  I think it is very important to the whole scheme the Minister has in view that proper books should be used in the schools.  I am afraid the Department has not taken sufficient care to see that books of the right sort are made available.</P>
    <P>Stress has been laid in the Minister's statement on the necessity for giving education a local bias, if I might use the word.  He suggests that the outlook of the schools should be to improve and uplift the community in which it is situated, and with that object in view, local history and local topography should be cultivated in the schools.  I agree thoroughly; but in practice it is found to be no very easy matter.  Teachers are recommended, for instance, to procure and use books dealing with local history.  When they set out to procure these books it is found either that very few are available or that such as are available are at prohibitive prices.  I think, in pursuance of the aim which the Minister has in view, it would be well if his Department took some practical steps to enable those who have connection with the actual work to carry it out.  I think some attention should be given to that particular aspect of educational work.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter dealing with this particular section that I would like to mention.  It is in connection with the Minister himself.  I was the person who first raised in the Dáil an objection to the absence of the Minister from his Department.  I want to make it quite clear, in view of what the Minister said on the last evening, that there is no implication whatever that, because of his absence, the work <Col N="406" /> of the Department, or the work of the officials of his Department, was in any way neglected.  If he will read the statement I made last July he will find that what I said was quite the contrary. The Minister himself tells us that he inherited a system of education in this country which he thought it his duty completely to reverse.  I do not think there is any other Minister in the Government who is in a position to say he had to adopt a policy which was a complete reversal of the one that he found in operation when he came into the Department.  If that is so the Minister must surely see the great necessity there was to inform the people of the country, as a whole, of the steps that were taken.  No one can do that but the Minister.  An official cannot do it.  An official is not in a position to do it.  What I complained of was that the Department was left without the driving force of the Minister who was the only one who could do this.  It was not the Minister I blamed, but the Executive Council.  I did not blame the Executive Council for taking Professor Eoin MacNeill and appointing him on the Boundary Commission; but I did and do complain that they took the Minister for Education and appointed him on the Boundary Commission. That was the position I took up.  I want to make that clear.  The Minister will fully understand that the particular kind of work that I complained of as being neglected was work that none of his officials was in a position to do and only he himself could do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a word in support of Deputy O'Connell. I made a reference the other evening to this question of the preparation of books in the schools.  Although in a sense it may seem a small matter, it plays a very big part in our educational system; I should say that the effect of it on our educational system is serious.  There is general agreement that the standard of the text books in the schools is not as high as the teachers or parents of the children would like.  There is a feeling that there should be some effort made by the Ministry to standardise the books used in our schools.  I do not think that the present method is at all satisfactory. Any publisher may get out a book with a sort of formal sanction, or, if you like, no prohibition to publication on the part of the publishing firm, or purchase on the part of the pupils. When sanctioned, these books are made available in the schools.  I think the Minister will have to take some action such as the setting up of an editing department at headquarters, where authors will be invited to send in their works.  From the best works the Ministry will select books that are to be used, books that will be of value from the point of view of the pupil, in giving to him, as the Minister says, a bias or bent in the right direction, that will obviate the possibility or likelihood of books being sent down to rural schools that include lessons that have absolutely no bearing on the life of the children and that are of no value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to repeat what I said the other evening on the question of the cost of books in the schools.  A system whereby readers have to be changed yearly is prevalent, I think, at the present time.  We have heard various complaints <Col N="408" /> about this matter from the point of view of many of the poorer parents.  It is a very serious matter indeed.  I have had complaints made to myself on this matter.  Whether it is possible for the Ministry to have text books in our schools that will be available for two or three standards in succession, is a matter for consideration. The kind of text books that ought to be used, and the cost of the text-books in the schools, are things that are influencing education at the present time and are things that are going to influence it in the future.  This matter demands consideration from the Minister.  There is a good deal in the plea that Deputy O'Connell put forward and, in my opinion, it is entitled to consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection I would like to know if the Minister has any figures to put before us that would enable us to criticise this general increase. I notice that the increase in the amount of the Estimate for the present year over the preceding year, that is for the year 1924-25, amounts to the nett figure of £21,408.  In the absence of any statistics showing the attendance at the schools, it is very hard to criticise that increase as a wise or unwise expenditure.  If the Minister could give us some information that would justify that figure, it would save time in criticising the amounts in the abstract form in which they appear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="Professor MacNEILL Professor MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, as that deals with the amount of the Vote in general, it would be better for me to touch upon it now at this stage. The increase, I regret, is largely an imaginary one.  I wish it were a real one.  That is caused mainly by the new classification under which this Vote is presented.  One of the largest items in the increase will be found detailed in A1&mdash;Office Salaries, Wages and Allowances, 1924-5, £71,477, and 1925-26, <Col N="409" /> £86,057.  That shows an increase of £14,580.  This increase is mainly due to the inclusion of £11,930 for Secondary Education.  Prior to this year, 1925-26, Secondary Education services were met out of the statutory fund administered by the old Intermediate Education Commission. The next large item of increase is under B1, Inspection and Organisation salaries; the amount is £4,856.  The explanation is the same as in the case of A1.</P>

      <P>It is quite true that the Department has nothing that could be called a sub-department of educational research.  I also believe it to be true that the Department is in touch, well in touch, with the principal educational developments in other countries.  I may say that Deputy O'Connell's complaint on this point is the first that has reached me, and it would undoubtedly be the desire of the Department to afford Deputies and others interested in educational developments all possible information, even to make inquiry where information is not available, on their behalf into educational development of any kind in other countries.  With regard to the official provision of text books, I suppose that Deputy O'Connell remembers the time, as I remember it, when the provision of books was not remarkably successful.  Whenever I got hold of a set of such books in official use, when I was a pupil in a primary school, I found them extremely amusing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>They were fairly successful from the point of <Col N="411" /> view of achieving their object.  I suppose there is a middle course between allowing outsiders, I might say, and non-official people, to provide books that are intended to meet the requirements of the programme, and providing them altogether departmentally. I may say that we in the Department have that in view and seriously under consideration.  Not knowing that this point was likely to arise to-day, I was discussing it only this morning&mdash;I mean the question of providing suitable books.  From the point of view of the development that I outlined and which, I think, meets with general public approval and of enabling schools to interest themselves in the local community and its developments, I recognise that we are by no means well equipped in the provision of proper books, whether under official supervision or otherwise, and that that is bound to occupy, and will occupy, the serious attention of the Department. There are obvious difficulties connected with it.  It was suggested, I think, by Deputy Baxter, that we might get authors to submit books and make a selection.  Authors, however, are very particular about authorship, and I do not know how we should stand in regard to the question of authorship if we had to pick a composite reading text book which was the work of several authors.  I do not think that any of these difficulties are insuperable.  As for supplying books which would cover more than one standard and which would cover several years, I should like to have an opportunity of thinking very carefully over that point as a practical proposal.  Evidently a certain amount of economy and cheapness to those who have to buy the books might be secured in that way, but whether that gain might not be counterbalanced by disadvantages I do not know.  I should like to have an opportunity of thinking over carefully a proposal of that kind.  I may say, in general, that the provision of suitable books from the point of view of the general policy which I have outlined is occupying and will occupy the most serious consideration of the Department.</P>

      <P>It is, so far as the right kind of books is concerned, but particularly so far as Irish is concerned, and there is a crying necessity as to the provision of a suitable standard in the books which are to be used in school.  The Minister must know better than anybody else that the types of books which are written in Irish are not at all such, in number or standard, as we would wish to see available for the choice of teachers. The Minister has said nothing in regard to books dealing with local history, or with the provision of them, or with the collection of them or, perhaps, with the republishing of, at least, portions of the works available, or with getting out a summarised version suitable for schools.  There are several such works available, I understand, but they are in a form not at all suitable for school use or even for the use of teachers generally.  They are generally rare copies and in many cases they are dear. I think the Minister's Department might make some effort to have these available for use in schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="Professor MacNEILL Professor MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise clearly the necessity of providing better books than we have in Irish, and as regards the point about making provision for books dealing with local history and everything else of local interest, I am sure it will be recognised that, except for the class of books which, as the Deputy has said, are rare and, as a rule, expensive and out of reach of primary schools, teachers and pupils, such material at present does not exist.  There are many other things besides books on local history, such as local maps and various things of that kind which, I think, should be in every school.  I should also like to find means of interesting the teachers and pupils in the traditions, music, and <Col N="413" /> folk-lore of their locality, and it will be recognised generally that so far as bringing matters of that kind into the system of primary education, we are really making a new beginning, and the provision, for the most part, will have to be anew.  What exists in books already written and printed is largely unsuitable as it has been written for a totally different class of readers, and not with the object of interesting the young, especially the young pupils who attend primary schools.  I did not intend to pass over that suggestion of Deputy O'Connell.  On the contrary, I intended to include it in the general remarks I made to the effect that the question of the provision of books is to receive the most earnest consideration of my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The next Vote I propose to discuss is No. 41, which deals with inspection and organisation. It is one of very great importance. I believe I will be right in saying that it is one of the utmost importance so far as the actual administration of the Department, and the carrying out of the work of the Department, is concerned, and I trust Deputies will bear with me while I deal with it at some length.  It may appear to be a technical matter, but I assure the House it is one of the very greatest in interest and importance to the great body of people who are engaged in carrying out the work with which the Department is charged.  Inspection of schools is necessary.  There is no question about that.  It is necessary from the point of view of the State to see that the money which is spent on education is well, economically and properly spent, and that value is got for it.  That is a principle which is unquestioningly admitted. I can assure the House and the Minister that at present there is very grave and deep-seated discontent among large bodies of teachers in connection with the present system of inspection. The Minister has inherited this system from the old regime, and he has not thought proper to reverse, or at least to completely reverse it.  There were always grievances in connection with the inspection of schools ever since the inception of the system, and the <Col N="414" /> trouble, to my mind, in any case to-day, is largely because of the old tradition that has come down to us from the early years of the national system.  It is a bad tradition, and it is very hard to get rid of it.  I happen to know that in the other branches of the system, if I might say so, the technical and secondary departments, there has never been that volume of complaint under the heading of inspection that we continually find under the heading of primary education.  I am not prepared to say, or to believe, that these complaints are due to a particular and extra dose of original sin either on the part of the primary teachers or the inspectors, and I believe it must be due to the system of inspection.</P>
      <P>There is no similar system of inspection in any country I know of&mdash;certainly not in Scotland or England. That is not to say that because of that our system is necessarily bad or wrong. It might indeed be quite the opposite. I may say, further, that among the teaching bodies generally of other countries one hears of all kinds of grievances, but never one with regard to inspection.  Certainly it is never stressed at their conferences or meetings. One begins to think whether after all other systems are not better than ours, or whether in any case they ought not to get a trial here.  I think it was the President who, in his statement in July, said that the question is often asked: &ldquo;What is wrong with primary education?&rdquo; I can assure the President if he attended meetings of teachers all through the country, as I have to do, and if he asked that question, he would almost invariably get one answer from the teachers&mdash;if they were asked to put their finger on what they thought was the greatest grievance in connection with the administration to-day, they would say the inspection system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a good deal of complaint about the overloading of programmes, and their unsuitability from the point of view of teachers and of those connected with teaching, but you will find invariably if you probe the matter that what the teacher has in the back of his mind is not so much the unsuitability of the syllabus or programme, or the <Col N="415" /> overloading of it, or anything else, but how that will react on his position from the point of view of the inspector.  That is really the trouble, and if that were faced in the way it should be, and if that problem were solved you would hear very little complaint about overloading programmes or of their unsuitability. The Minister will, undoubtedly, produce circulars, rules, laws and regulations, and all that kind of thing governing the inspection system, showing how there are no grounds for these complaints if this, that and the other thing were done.  I came across a few days ago a statement that, I think, is exceedingly appropriate to this question. It was written over 150 years ago by, I think, Young in his &ldquo;Tour in Ireland.&rdquo; He was referring to the position of the peasantry, and he said that the language of written law may be that of liberty, but to discover what the liberty of the people is, we must live among them, and not look for it in the statutes of the Realm.</P>
    <P>Now, I think that is peculiarly appropriate to this question.  If you examine the circulars that have been issued for the guidance and instruction of inspectors, you will find it hard, and I would find it hard to put my finger on any particular paragraph or sentence in them that ought not to be there.  Generally speaking, I can say that the instructions of the Department to their inspectors are such as would fairly meet the situation under the present system as it has been adopted, but in addition to that, there is undoubtedly this discontent with the system as it operates.  An attempt has been made more or less to machine the system of inspection.  I think it is deplorable and very much to be regretted that anything in connection with the administration of education should partake of the nature of a machine.  Some Deputies at least will remember the agitation that arose in 1912 or 1913 out of the dismissal of the then Vice-President of the Teachers' Organisation, Mr. Mansfield, for his public protest made after every other avenue seemed closed to him&mdash;his public protest against the action of the then Commissioners of National Education and their inspection system.</P>

      <Col N="416" /> At that time a Commission was set up which went at very great length into this whole matter dealing with the inspection of schools.  The principal complaint made at the time was that there was a system of labelling schools by various terms, such as &ldquo;very good,&rdquo;&ldquo;good,&rdquo;&ldquo;middling,&rdquo;&ldquo;very fair,&rdquo;&ldquo;bad,&rdquo; and so on, and that this system was working out to the detriment of many good teachers.  There is no doubt whatever that if the Minister will examine the Report of the Dill Commission that sat in 1913 he will see that the inspection system, as it existed at that time, was tried, found guilty, and condemned, but the execution lay with the Commissioners of National Education, and they did not carry out the sentence. As a matter of fact, there are many in the teaching profession to-day who will say that things are very much worse now than they were then, because nowadays there is not one label for the schools as a whole, but there is a label for every subject that is taught under the programme.</P>
    <P>I have in my hand the circular issued to inspectors, and therein is set out the conditions under which certain of these labels are attached.  It is detailed, and it partakes, as I have said, of the nature of a machine, and, despite the best intentions of inspectors, I hold the view that it is humanly impossible for an inspector always to do&mdash;I do not want or ask meticulous justice&mdash;even fair justice, because what he is asked to do is something like this: Take, say, a subject like geography or history.  The inspector goes into a school which he visits once or twice in the year.  He cannot visit it any oftener owing to the amount of work he has to do and the number of schools he has to visit.  He spends a few hours in that school observing the teacher carrying on his work.  Then, perhaps, he may put a few questions to the children.  They may answer these particular questions correctly or they may not, but on the result of his observations, extending over a few hours, each class is marked or labelled, and each subject is marked or labelled &ldquo;good,&rdquo;&ldquo;very good,&rdquo;&ldquo;middling,&rdquo;&ldquo;fair,&rdquo; and so on.  If the label put down in that way opposite, say, history is &ldquo;good,&rdquo; then the subject is marked &ldquo;good.&rdquo; A report <Col N="417" /> then comes from the Education Office, and that is taken to mean that for the previous twelve months the teaching of history by that teacher has been &ldquo;good,&rdquo;&ldquo;fair,&rdquo; or &ldquo;middling,&rdquo; as the label given indicated.  Now, I maintain that it is not possible for the inspector to sum up in one word in that way the whole work of a teacher during the previous year in a particular subject. Then we have it that, on that report, on the number of &ldquo;goods,&rdquo;&ldquo;very goods&rdquo;&ldquo;fair,&rdquo; or &ldquo;middling,&rdquo; or whatever the marking has been, will depend whether the teacher is going to get his increment or his promotion, or be qualified to take up a certain position or not.  Therefore, the teacher must of necessity always teach with one eye on the inspector, and I hold that is not good for the teacher.  It destroys initiative, without which a teacher cannot hope to be successful.  The position is that the teacher must always have regard to the particular view that a particular inspector will have when he goes into a school.</P>
    <P>We have heard on many occasions condemnation of what is called the examination system.  We have heard described more than once the efforts made by teachers to discover when a new inspector came into a district what his fancies were in any particular direction. Efforts have been made repeatedly to secure uniformity of action and a uniformity of standard on the part of inspectors so that there could be, as it were, a uniform standard and a uniform measure arrived at by which you could measure automatically, and without any possibility of mistake, the work done by a given teacher in a given school during a given period.  I say that it is impossible ever to discover any such standard.  You might, for instance, find out whether the teacher taught multiplication by ascertaining if the children were able to do it or not, but I think the Minister himself will agree that the chief work which a teacher does is not the imparting of a given amount of knowledge in a given time to a given child.  That is not his work. I say that that is not the main function of the teacher, but it is rather the way he does his work; it is above all the building up of the child's character, <Col N="418" /> and the training of his mind, and I suggest that you cannot measure character training by a foot rule or by any standard arrived at in that mechanical way.  As a matter of fact, it is quite possible to say that it is not during his school years that the pupil will show the chief value of the teacher's work. It is when he leaves school, and goes into the world, and has to take part in the affairs of the world, that the good or bad training he gets in his early years will show, and for these things the teacher never gets praise or blame. It is not a subject&mdash;character-training and character-teaching of boys and girls to be good young men and women &mdash;that is not a subject carrying a label which in turn carries an increment.</P>
    <P>I have gone to meetings of the teachers throughout the country in connection with the discussion of the new programme since that programme came into operation.  I have discussed the points which were troubling them; I put it up to them, especially because I myself had a very great deal to do with the drafting of the programme; I was secretary to the Conference that drafted it, and I felt it my duty to defend certain provisions in which very great freedom was allowed to the teachers; and whenever a teacher objected about this or that, I said: &ldquo;You are at liberty to do this or that under the programme,&rdquo; but I have been invariably met with the answer: &ldquo;Oh, but what about the inspector when he comes in?&rdquo; And it is because of that that we have this demand, from the teachers, for a detailed and definite programme down to the last detail if possible.</P>
    <P>Now the teachers' central executive when they submitted their statement to the recent Programme Conference pointed out that it was their belief that it was not good, from the point of view of education, that there should be a detailed programme set out for every school, or that we should adopt the system that was once in operation in France, I believe, where the Minister could sit down and say: &ldquo;At this hour every child, in every department of France, is doing multiplication.&rdquo; We believe that is bad and wrong, and that the teachers should have a very <Col N="419" /> great measure of freedom.  But the teachers who were engaged in the work have insisted in the demand for detail and very much detail in the syllabuses and programmes laid down by the Department, and they give as their reason that they want to know where they are so far as the Inspector is concerned. I hold, as I say, that you are destroying the work of the teacher if you put him in the position that he has continuously to keep his mind fixed upon what the Inspector is going to do.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself, I think in 1924, when this question was just briefly touched on, said: &ldquo;There is no doubt that as to the Inspectorate question it is the desire of the Ministry that they should act not in spirit of censorship, and not as censors of the work done by the teachers of the schools, but, primarily, to encourage, to assist, and develop that work.  That is the primary business of the Inspectorate.&rdquo; I thoroughly and sincerely agree with that statement.  But let the Minister, if he wishes to show how far that is carried out in practice, get the files of reports submitted by his Inspectorate of any given series of schools.  You have this position occurring. The teacher has a good record. He gets the report &ldquo;very good&rdquo; for a series of years.  I am speaking now of his official record, and we find that a man with twenty years' experience, during which possibly he never got anything but a very favourable report, might find himself reduced as his report is reduced.  It will be argued, of course, that that is in accordance with the directions in the Circular but you must remember the effect this has on the man.  He feels it is not due, and it is not always alleged that it is due, by any means, to want of effort upon his part or want of diligence upon his part.  He might find circumstances such that he has not been able to keep up to the standard and he finds that his profession or reputation is at stake.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that there are many very good teachers&mdash;and it is for good teachers that I plead rather than for the indifferent ones&mdash;who regard their professional reputation, <Col N="420" /> and who put their professional reputation far before any financial increment that may come to them or which they may lose as a result of a bad report. The late Doctor Starkie, in giving evidence before the Dill Commission, admitted that the system was a hardship upon the best teacher and upon the good teachers.  I think if statistics are examined the Minister will find that something like 90 or 95 per cent&mdash;90 per cent. in any case&mdash;of the teachers are doing good average work in the schools.  Of these, at least 30 per cent. are doing work of a superior class. They get reports termed &ldquo;highly efficient,&rdquo; which means that they are doing work very much above the work expected from the average teacher, and a proportion varying from five to six or seven per cent. are doing more or less indifferent work.  He will find a further remarkable thing that these figures have not varied in the last ten or fifteen years.  Perhaps the period of unrest might be omitted.  But for a very great number of years they have not varied.  Yet the same system continues, and 90 per cent. of the teachers doing good average work all over the country are put in this position that they do not know to-day or to-morrow or next year what may happen.  They do not know where they stand.  They may find their whole record cut away. I am not saying that that is a usual thing, but it is sufficiently usual and sufficiently common to create uneasiness in the minds of the teachers.</P>
    <P>Then there is a book used in school which used to be called the &ldquo;Observation Book,&rdquo; and which is now called the &ldquo;Suggestion Book.&rdquo; The Dill Commission had many complaints with regard to the use or rather the abuse of this book.  It is the book in the schools in which the inspector is supposed to make entries&mdash;a kind of log book.  Many statements were given in evidence to the Dill Commission to show where statements were entered in this particular book derogatory to the teachers, and in some cases was shown to be undesirable, and the Dill Commission recommended that this book should be abolished and done away with.  The Commissioners, however, did not agree to acept that view, but <Col N="421" /> they recommended that the book in future should be known as the &ldquo;Suggestion Book,&rdquo; and that nothing should be written into this book except suggestions&mdash;suggestions, I take it, for the improvement of the work of the schools.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the idea in the Commissioners mind at the time is not being carried out, as an examination of these figures will show.  Cases have been quoted&mdash;I am sorry to say they have been rather numerous&mdash;of entries made in these books which are open to examination by any officer of the Department and to the school manager.  I think entries are sometimes made thoughtlessly which causes very great pain to the teachers about whom they are made.  I have known cases of teachers who, when leaving one school for another, knowing that there were certain entries in that book derogatory to their character as a teacher, violated the Department's rules and destroyed the records rather than let their successor see the notes made about them. I think that it is a matter that ought to be considered.  In illustration of that I received a letter a few weeks ago from a teacher.  I do not think it is typical but I say it should not occur. The inspector visited the school, where a lesson was being taught.  He made an entry to the effect that the teacher had not sufficient preparation made for this lesson.  That in itself might be justifiable, but he goes on to write this: &ldquo;The first assistant has, for a history and geography syllabus, Leinster and the Danes.  He has no preparation and his knowledge of the Dano-Irish period is peculiarly meagre.  In fact, he is practically illiterate on the important point of the subject.  Surely both assistants should know something about Danish place-names and Dano-Irish personal names.&rdquo; The particular teacher referred to there is a man with twenty years' unbroken good service, and I think it is not right that an inspector, in spite of circulars or anything else, should have the right to make an entry of that kind about the teacher in a book which is open to inspection by officers of the Department and school managers.</P>
    <P>School managers are not always in <Col N="422" /> close touch with school work.  They are sometimes inclined to attach more value to an entry of that kind than it deserves, and cases have not been unknown in which what was really a technical phrase in an inspector's report was used by a manager to show that the particular teacher under his charge was inefficient.  The inspector who made this entry was not a youngster in the profession.  That, perhaps, adds to the gravity of it.  I do not wish to go into any greater detail with regard to this matter.  I think I have said sufficient to show that it is a problem that is pressing for a solution of some kind.  It is not easy to suggest a solution. It is, perhaps, more pressing now than it has been for some years owing to the introduction into the schools of a new subject of which the teachers are not masters by any means, and regarding which they believe that their failure to go up to a certain standard will mean loss of position, status and increment.  That feeling is creating unconsciously a kind of antagonism, as it were, to the subject.  It is bound to create it if it goes on and the Minister knows better than anyone else that to make the teaching of Irish successful in the schools it is essential that the enthusiasm must be kept up.  The teachers' love for the subject must be fostered, but a man cannot have very much love for a subject which he knows is going to be the means of reducing his status.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to suggest a solution. Still I believe a solution is possible and the best suggestion I can think of at the moment is that the Department should recognise that that difficulty is there.  I am afraid they have not sufficiently recognised that.  If they recognise that difficulty and that the complaints from time to time are, to some extent, justified I think it would be possible then to have a small committee of inspectors and teachers who have had experience of the actual working of the system and it would be possible for such a committee to arrive at a scheme that would be calculated to bring most satisfaction to those engaged in the work.  That would give them a greater sense of freedom and independence.  They feel that there is <Col N="423" /> no such thing as freedom, independence and initiative.</P>
    <P>I would say, too, that it has been the means of preventing men of recognised ability either from entering the service of primary teaching or it has been the means of driving out some of those who were in it.  I have, before my mind, two men of outstanding ability, both of them known, not only in Ireland, but the countries adjoining for their literary work.  One at least left the service because of some juggling of those &ldquo;goods&rdquo; and &ldquo;very goods,&rdquo; and so on.  He felt he did not get the promotion which he thought should come his way.  Possibly the inspector who marked that man &ldquo;good&rdquo; when he should have marked him &ldquo;very good&rdquo; felt he was doing his duty conscientiously, but one cannot help having the feeling that the children who would sit under that man, even though he did not meet the inspector's view as to what was &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;very good,&rdquo; would derive a very great advantage from being in contact with him.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will recognise that this is one of the biggest problems he is faced with in the administration of education, and that if the teachers felt they were free to take their own line &mdash;I do not mean that they could do what they liked&mdash;within a given course, and that they had that spirit of independence of being captain on their own quarter-deck, they would be better adjuncts to the community and would do better work for the country as a whole.  If it is thought that the present machine-like system should be continued, with temporary improvements here and there, I think the Minister will find that some day there will be an outburst such as there was in 1913 and the whole thing will be bad for education, bad for the system, bad for the teachers themselves and above all, bad for the children under their care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Not alone have the teachers to be considered; the children, above all, have to be considered.  After all Deputy O'Connell has said, we must all recognise there is cause for some complaint.  Whether the trouble is as <Col N="424" /> great as he suggests or not depends on the point of view of the individual who looks at it&mdash;that is, whether it is the teacher or the Ministry.  What strikes me about it is that apparently the effort is to try to pay men for what they do in accordance with the amount of service they give.  The Minister will try to judge that by a certain method.  The teachers' objection is that the decision of the inspector on the work the teacher has done and on the salary he should be paid sometimes is not a just decision, because the means of arriving at that decision are not the best means.</P>
      <P>We must continue a system of inspection, but whether the old method is to be continued depends to a very great extent on the spirit in which the Ministry try to get the teachers to take up the work.  My feeling is that, if you cannot get the teachers to engage in their work in the proper spirit, and recognise how great that work is for the nation, by, in a sense, putting them on a plane where they will be above suspicion, and where it will be accepted that they are out to do their best, and to be treated accordingly, it will be difficult to get men to rise to a high level. The teacher will tell you that an inspector will go into a school, and, while he may not be satisfied with the teacher's methods, or the results of his work, he is not prepared to put down on paper suggestions as to how the teacher should raise the standard of teaching in the school.  It seems to me that between the inspection staff and the teachers there must, unquestionably, be a spirit of co-operation.  I do not say that in the sense that the inspector must always dominate the teacher, but that on every occasion he must help and advise the teacher, whenever teacher or inspector feels there is a necessity for advice.  The direction must be given in the right spirit, and the inspector must determine the spirit, so that the teacher can get on with his work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the present system of inspection is such that, where a teacher after a series of reports has been proved inefficient, he is dispensed with.  I have some knowledge, in one or two cases at least, of inefficiency on the part of teachers which, although <Col N="425" /> recognised, was passed over for ten years.  I feel that, while Deputy O'Connell has put the case very strongly, and while the teacher, no doubt, has cause for complaint, there is a danger that between the spirit the teacher is expected to carry on his work in and that of the inspector the education of the children would suffer.  Where there is a suggestion that there is legitimate cause for complaint, I think it is the duty of the Ministry to take up the matter between the inspection staff and the teacher and see if a better and more satisfactory system could be devised so that the education of the pupils will not suffer.  The teacher should get a fair chance of giving of his best, without running the risk of suffering in any way because, perhaps, he tries to give a little more of the personal touch, or tries to influence through his personality the character of his work by getting a little off the beaten track which the inspector may take up as the basis of his examination.  If between the inspection staff and the teachers a better system of inspection could be devised whereby the children would not suffer. I believe the educational system would benefit considerably and all causes of complaints would be removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point, arising out of Deputy Baxter's statement, that I wish to refer to before the Minister replies.  I did not plead, and I have never pleaded for the inefficient teacher.  I am not speaking on his behalf.  I do not want him in the service.  I want to stress that in anything I have said I have had before my mind, what everyone engaged in education should have in mind, the interests of education and the interests of the children.  My whole criticism is on the line that if the inspector and the teacher work together in a spirit of co-operation, rather than in a spirit of servant and master, there will be better work done in the schools and the children will benefit.  I want to make it plain that there are many inspectors in the Department&mdash;the best of them&mdash;who in all cases endeavour to carry out, in so far as this system will allow them, their work in a spirit of co-operation, of help and advice.  There is not sufficient of <Col N="426" /> that kind of work possible under the system as it works.</P>
      <P>The inspector, I hold, should feel that he is the adviser, the chief adviser, rather than the critic of the teacher, that he is the chief helper, a man on whom the teacher should feel that he would be anxious to call.  A question I have been in the habit of putting at meetings of teachers in discussing this matter is this: &ldquo;How many of you would be glad to see your inspector coming into your school on Monday morning?&rdquo; I am sorry to say the number who express a wish to see their inspector coming in is small.  If there was that real spirit that I want to see there, the teacher would be glad to see his inspector coming into him quite often, because he would know that it was unnecessary for him to look around when he sees the inspector at the gate to see that the pictures are hanging straight on the wall or that no bits of paper are scattered about the floor, or that the particular subject he has on the time-table for that particular time is being taught.  Unfortunately, that is not the feeling at present.</P>
      <P>The teacher should feel when he sees the inspector anywhere about that he is going to get advice and help about some of the difficulties of his position, and that now is his chance when the inspector is coming to get this advice. Unfortunately, they do not feel that. Anyone in touch with the schools knows that that is not the feeling.  It would be well for the children if that were the case, and the teachers could work much better than they work at present.  It is on behalf of the good teachers I make this plea; not on behalf of those who are inefficient and indifferent to their work.  I hold no brief whatever for the man who shirks his work.  I think it will be found that there is no body of workers in the State to-day who apply themselves with more diligence to their work than the teachers of our national schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="Professor MacNEILL Professor MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point of the system of inspection, Deputy O'Connell very frankly recognises the difficulties of the case&mdash;the difficulty of the human equation.  It is always present, and in it the difficulty always lies. <Col N="427" /> A good teacher is always anxious to do his best, but his interpretation of doing his best is subject to the judgment of another person.  That is always imperfect, and any system in which it is necessary must always interfere with freedom and initiative.</P>
      <P>I cannot forget my own particular debt to a primary school teacher, and I have to say that the best of his work, as I saw it, and the part from which I derived most advantage, was not subject to the test of any inspector.  I think I spoke my mind about this matter a couple of years ago, and I do not want to be uttering virtuous platitudes to you on every occasion or any occasion.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell recognises that there might be considerable difficulty in arriving at a system which would be free from the disadvantages of the system of inspection actually in operation. I think he ought to be conscious that the Educational Department does recognise and has recognised the existing difficulties and will welcome a better system if a better system can be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say that the suggestion that has been made by the Deputy of bringing a number of teachers and a number of inspectors together to look into this question is one that appeals to me. I do not like to give assent, on the spur of the moment, to any sort of proposals that are put up to me, but I certainly do look with favour on that particular suggestion and will undertake to see what effect can be given to it.  I know that it is possible to express certain things in official circulars and that the things that are stated in circulars do not necessarily rule the spirit of an institution or of a system.  Here again, as the Deputy is aware, we have a tradition. There is not merely the tradition of the inspector but the tradition of the teaching body who, many of them, were brought up under, what one might almost call, a police system of inspection and the working out, I should imagine, of any system that can be devised, to test efficiency, will essentially depend on the spirit in which it is worked.  Just as circulars of advice that are issued from this Department may not produce the full effect which is <Col N="428" /> aimed at in them, so even if we have a better system set up, something which on the face of it is a better system, it would not work successfully unless it is animated by the right spirit, the spirit that Deputy Baxter mentioned, of co-operation between the whole body of those who are engaged in the work of education.  As I have said, I do not want to run into generalities and platitudes about this.  To the practical suggestion that has come out of the discussion, that a number of inspectors and teachers might come together and look into this, I promise the most friendly consideration.  I say no more at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a proposition that I think is worthy of the Minister's consideration if he wants to develop that spirit of co-operative activity between the Department itself, the inspectorate, and the teachers, that I would speak about publicly, which, I think, has been occasionally adverted to privately.  It is that there should be frequently, perhaps one might say periodically, open conferences between teachers in a particular area and the inspectorate, or the heads of the Department, so that there could be that collaboration, and the discussion of educational questions as well as internal problems.  I have spoken to many teachers, quite apart from the ordinary routine, and I have come to the conclusion that teachers would welcome the introduction of some plan of that kind where the inspectorate, perhaps the Minister, or the Departmental officials, would meet occasionally in particular districts groups of teachers at conferences to discuss either questions dealing with the administration of the education services or questions dealing with the problems of education.  If that idea were put into practice I am sure that there would very soon develop a better understanding of the requirements of the case and a better spirit generally as between teachers and the Department, and that it would have its reflection upon the children and upon the whole school teaching.  I know that some such processes in respect of head teachers takes place in other countries, and my information is that it has been <Col N="429" /> extremely successful and valuable in producing good effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with what Deputy Johnson has said, I might point out that teachers have repeatedly advocated this system of conferences with inspectors, because we believe that very great good indeed could come from it, especially when it is a question of the introduction of new subjects.  A few of such conferences, unfortunately, far too few, have been held.  Some of them have been extremely successful and helpful, some not quite so, because the particular inspector concerned felt that he was not quite free to voice his opinions.  I had reason to complain on the Estimates of last year, I think, of an inspector who refused to take part in a conference. The instruction with regard to the matter that has been issued to inspectors is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Inspectors may, but are not required to organise conferences with groups of teachers to discuss ways and means of improving the work of the schools, or may attend conferences organised by the teachers.  These conferences must take place on Saturdays only.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the inspector has a very heavy week's work in connection with this business of school labelling and subject labelling, as I might call it.  He has to visit a great number of schools at certain definite times per year and attach, as I say, labels to various subjects according as he finds them.  He has very little time on hands for these conferences, and what I would plead for is that he should be set free from a great deal of the unnecessary routine and office work that he has to perform, and that he should be much freer to engage in these conferences than he is at present. Inspectors complain, and I believe rightly complain, that they are expected to do far too much work of a routine nature, sending up reports of all kinds, where they have been at a particular hour on a particular day, and such matters.  They say that the local inspector of police has an office and an office staff at his elbow to do such work, while they, equally important to the life of the community, have to do this purely clerical work themselves. <Col N="430" /> An inspector should be regarded as the director of education in his district, and he should be largely trusted with the work of keeping education right in that district.  It should be assumed that inspectors are able to do that, and they should be trusted to do it to a very large extent.</P>
    <P>With regard to the appointment to the inspectorate, I think it should be recognised as a general principle that the person best qualified to judge of the work that is to be done in a national school is the person who has had experience in such a school.  I say that as a general rule.  I do not say that it is absolutely necessary to stick to that as an invariable rule.  Under the old regime there were regulations whereby a certain definite proportion of those appointed to the inspectorate should be teachers of national schools.  That has been departed from, and a complaint is made, whether justly or otherwise, that of late to a very great extent appointments have been made of teachers who certainly have had experience of teaching, but have no experience of teaching in a national school.  One of the reasons put forward for that, and I think possibly with some justice, is that the number of national teachers who apply for these posts is less than it used to be, and I wonder whether one of the finance regulations that operate in connection with the appointments has not something to do with that.  A man who has ten, fifteen or twenty years' experience in a national school will not apply for an inspectorate when he knows that so far as pension is concerned his years of service will not count to his credit, and that he will have to enter on the inspectorate and begin to reckon his pension as a civil servant just as if he were appointed after one year's experience as a teacher.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Minister will take serious note of that hardship.  It is a very great hardship, and the principle with regard to it has already been admitted in the case of other Departments. Here you have two people engaged in the same class of work, both under the same Ministry; one is promoted to the inspectorate, to the higher division, as you might say, of the same work, but his years of service in the <Col N="431" /> other division do not count for his pension. Of course, he is not anxious or willing in all cases that that should be so, and many otherwise capable men are lost to the inspectorate by the operation of that rule.  I cannot see what great principle or what difficulty is involved.  Under the Local Government Act we have an arrangement whereby if a man is removed from a local body to the central body his pension is made continuous, and it was more difficult in that case, because they were two different bodies.  The pension of the teacher and the pension of the inspector are both paid by the State, although at the moment from different funds.</P>
    <P>So far as the machinery is concerned, there could be no difficulty in it, and I do think that that barrier should be removed, so that there would be encouragement to men of fairly long service to go up for the higher posts of the inspectorate.  Their experience in the schools would be of very great value to them as inspectors.  I do hope the Minister will keep in mind the suggestion made by Deputy Johnson with regard to conferences.  They should be very much more frequent, and the inspectors should be relieved of a good deal of their present routine work, in order that they may be able to engage in this class of work, which would be more advantageous.</P>

      <P>I want to support the contention of Deputy O'Connell in respect to the selection of inspectors and the practical effect of the present regulations regarding pensions.  As he has pointed out, the effect of the present rules is that the primary school teacher, no matter how long his experience may have been, loses the advantages and loses the pension rights which have accrued by virtue of his service as a national school teacher. That has the effect of limiting the number of applicants for inspectorial <Col N="432" /> posts from the class of national school teachers.  It seems to me that the case made by Deputy O'Connell requires to be answered, and it would require an extraordinary amount of explanation to make a satisfactory answer.  The assumption that the schoolmaster and the inspector should be in two different categories of the public service is one that I think ought not be maintained. I think it would be good for the service if the assumption were that these various elements were part of a cooperating whole and that their services in one capacity might well be rewarded by at least an opportunity of being placed in the higher capacity of inspector of schools.  I cannot see how anyone can argue in favour of the maintenance of a position which would ensure that the services rendered as teacher and master would count for nothing when it came to pension rights.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that the present system is limiting the area from which inspectors would be called, and that it militates against the particular element which has had experience of national school teaching being appointed to inspectorial posts. I would like to have from the Minister some explanation, if there is any, why that attitude is maintained.  If he is not satisfied with the present position, and if in this case, as in so many others, he would like the change that is advocated to be put into operation, will he tell us why it is not being put into operation?  Will he tell us that he is going to make a change which will bring the amended course of action into actual operation?</P>

      <P>There are numbers of points that arise all round. I do not know whether Deputy Johnson believes me when I state that I am in favour of every possible inducement, in financial form or otherwise, that would favour the teaching profession. But I am not going to make that change.  I have not the power to make it.  I have acute experience myself of the same disadvantage.  Changing from one branch of the public service to another.  I left behind pension rights that had been accumulating for over twenty years.  The only thing I <Col N="433" /> can say in general is that I am in favour of everything that would tend to improve the position of the whole teaching profession, including primary teachers, inspectors and the rest.  That is again, I suppose, a platitude.  I presume the practical reason for it is that certain remuneration is fixed for those who enter the occupation of inspectors, and it is fixed as a sufficient inducement. All who enter into that branch of the teaching profession, as I may call it, enter it on a level.  If it were possible to make the conditions better, no person would be more pleased than myself.</P>

      <P>While we recognise that the Minister has not the right and the power in his own Department to make the change, he has the power, and I suggest that he should take action, to make strong representations to the Department of Finance, if he believes it is a proposal that is deserving of serious consideration.  It has been said that the remuneration which has been fixed is fixed with the view that it is sufficient to induce suitable persons to come forward and that they all enter on a level.  I cannot quite follow the Minister in that.  I think the facts are&mdash;it has been asserted, in any case&mdash;that the number of national teachers of fairly long service applying for a post as inspector is much less than it used to be in previous years.  The salary has something to do with that, probably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of the deprivation of the pension is a very serious one for the teachers.  I suggest that if the Minister feels as strongly on this matter as the rest of us, he should make representations to the Department of Finance on the point.  He should see that the mere passing from one branch of the service to another would not mean for any person the losing of the years already served, when it comes to estimating the pensionable service.  If the Minister for Finance finds any great difficulty in dealing with that matter, he can adopt the arrangement already adopted under the Local Government Act.  He can arrange that the branch of service from which the teacher comes would be liable to bear its proportionate share of <Col N="434" /> the pension, when the pension comes to be payable.  A scheme like that has already been adopted in connection with Local Government, and I do not see why it could not also be adopted in this case.  I would recommend that suggestion to the serious consideration of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the remarks made by Deputy O'Connell with reference to the grievance&mdash;I think it is a grievance&mdash;under which many of these inspectors suffer. At the moment I am particularly referring to men already in the service.  A large number can never expect to receive the full pensions which they should be entitled to in the normal course.  Nevertheless, they will have to give their whole life to the work of education.  I think a real grievance exists.  Take the case of a particular individual who has already served 20 years as a national school teacher.  If he serves another 20 years as an inspector he can never hope to have a pension based on more than the service of 20 years as an inspector.  I think that is a real grievance, and I hope the Minister will take up that matter seriously and remove what must be a hindrance to many national teachers applying to be appointed as inspectors.  Later I will say something in regard to the general question of appointments.</P>

I do not know what basis is adopted in the matter of the choice of those who are being appointed as national school inspectors.  I am informed&mdash;I do not know if it is true, and I would like, if it is not, to have it contradicted&mdash;that in recent years some 30 persons were appointed as national school inspectors and not a single one of them was a graduate of Trinity College. I would ask the Minister to give us some indication of the basis for <Col N="435" /> choosing inspectors and the qualifications that are looked for.  At the moment I am not prepared to advocate, though it may be advisable to do it ultimately, that the old method of examination should be gone back to.  I do look forward to the time when all Civil Service appointments will be made as a result of fair competition.  Probably the Minister will be able to tell us on what basis the choice is at present made.</P>

I do not think that any school inspector ought to be appointed who has not that knowledge. Of course, it is probable that the number of Trinity College graduates who have that qualification would be comparatively small, and, being small in number, their chances of appointment at present would not be so great, but we hope that they will be in a year or two.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>My endeavour is to get clearly and definitely what the attitude of the Ministry is with regard to teaching subjects through the medium of Irish.  I shall set out by stating two positions which, I think, are generally accepted.  There is, first, the position of Irish as an ordinary subject in the schools and, so far as I am concerned, there is no question about that.  There is then the position where a teacher has a fluent knowledge of the language and can use it as freely, or almost as freely, as he can use English and can carry on his work quite freely in it, and where the pupils under his charge, although they may not have that same freedom as he has, have at least this much, that they can easily follow his instructions and benefit by them.  With regard to that second position, there is no dispute so far as I am concerned.  I am in agreement with the Minister in the aim and purpose outlined in his statement, and I am prepared to accept the position that such a teacher should carry on his work through the medium of Irish. There is, however, an intermediate position, and the majority of schools and teachers are in that position.  That is, the position in which the teacher has not that command of the language necessary to make his teaching a live teaching and the pupils have not that understanding of the language, and have not reached that particular stage, whereby they can follow quite easily the instructions of the teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="437" /> Let us take the teachers first.  Teaching, to be effective, must be elastic.  To put ideas before children the teacher must take an idea, twist and turn it, and present it in numerous ways if he wants the children to grasp it thoroughly. One presentation of an idea to a child may be useless, but if it is presented in another way the child may grasp the meaning of it at once.  While endeavouring to present new ideas to a child, if the teacher has continually to grope for a new word, or a new form of expression, and feel a certain diffidence as to whether he is using the right language at all in giving his lesson, he cannot, undoubtedly, be expected to do successful work.  Similarly, on the other hand, if the children have not reached that stage where they can profit by the instruction and follow the teacher completely, they, too, will be at a disadvantage.  The Minister, on Friday last I think it was, read out certain paragraphs with regard to this point from the circular issued to inspectors, but there was one which he did not read, and which, I think, has a bearing on the issue.  &ldquo;It has been decided that where the teachers have not, as yet, sufficient facility in the language, and generally in districts other than Irish-speaking districts, in accordance with the new programme, every effort should be made to introduce gradual instruction in various subjects through the medium of Irish.&rdquo; I think the Minister must realise, in view of what I said earlier in this debate that an instruction of that kind will carry very much more weight with teachers and others engaged in the work of education than would appear on the surface. It is known that the declared policy of the Ministry is to encourage Irish in every possible way, but one result of that knowledge, coupled with this instruction, has been that teachers have attempted to do what they are not, in fact, able to do.  That may be very creditable enthusiasm, but I think it will be found, and I believe it has been found, that the cause of the Irish language has suffered as a result of that practice.  What I have in mind in raising the matter to-night is that some definite guidance, some definite principle, should be laid down whereby <Col N="438" /> teachers would know exactly the conditions under which they are expected to take up the teaching of subjects other than Irish through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <P>There is evidence available, and the Minister, I am sure, knows of it, to the effect that in many cases where attempts were made by teachers who were only partially qualified in the language to teach other subjects like history, geography, or mathematics through the medium of Irish, the subject is used not so much to teach history, geography or mathematics, as to teach Irish.  That would be quite all right if in the course of the Irish lesson historical dates or geographical facts are used, but if it is desired to teach a certain amount of geography or arithmetic, as such, then I think it will be generally admitted that the medium used in teaching this subject should be such as can be used fluently by the teacher; and, secondly, that the children should have such a knowledge of that medium as to follow quite easily and without conscious effort the lessons and instruction of the teacher.  When I spoke on this subject last week I referred to the reports which were made available, and are available, to the Department, and which, I think, are about to be published if they have not been published already.  I am very sorry that they are not in the hands of the Deputies at the moment, for they would throw a great deal of light not alone on this but on some of the other matters we have been discussing, and on the whole question of education.  Some of these reports of inspectors are extremely valuable.  One may not agree with everything they say, but one must recognise that they are of the utmost importance from the point of view of education.  They are excellent in many ways.  Here is what an inspector who is in a district not entirely Irish speaking says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Attempts are made in most schools to teach history and parts of geography through Irish.  One result is that much less ground is covered in these subjects than used to be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why is that done, if it was not thought, rightly or wrongly, that it was the policy of the Department that such <Col N="439" /> could be done in a hurry?  I am making the case that the administration should take up this attitude, that if they feel that it is not of educational advantage to the children then they should not allow the teacher in his over-enthusiasm for Irish to give instruction in this subject through the medium of Irish, if he is not capable of doing so.  Here is what another inspector from districts which might be called Breac-Gaeltacht says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To teach subjects successfully through Irish needs a teacher fairly expert in the language.  In this respect of using Irish as a medium of teaching inspectors, so far as I know, are not forcing teachers to do what they are incapable of doing.  Indeed, in a few cases it has been considered proper to advise teachers who were manifestly unfit to abandon their efforts to teach history or geography through Irish.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I quote that to be quite impartial, and to show that inspectors find it necessary and think it advisable to do that.  That is one of the strongest difficulties in the teaching of Irish in the schools and he finds it necessary to say that the inspectors are not forcing teachers to teach through the medium of Irish, and finds it necessary in some cases to discourage the teaching through Irish where the teacher was not properly qualified to do so.  An inspector dealing with a largely English-speaking district writes:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;History and geography are fairly frequently, and arithmetic occasionally, taught through the medium of Irish.  Hitherto the scholars have been acquiring not so much a knowledge of these subjects as of the language itself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what I have been saying: that if geography, history and arithmetic, as such, are to be taught, and if Irish has to be taught in addition, it should be plainly stated.  If we are to have history and geography taught in the schools I hold the aim should be to have that teaching as effective as possible, and through the medium found for the time being to be most <Col N="440" /> effective.  Another inspector reports as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An ill-advised attempt was made by many teachers who possessed only a slight knowledge of Irish, and whose pupils had necessarily less, to teach history and geography through the medium of Irish.  The programme was itself to blame, as it laid down that the history and geography of Ireland were to be taught in Irish, without stating that this could only be expected when both teachers and pupils had made considerable headway with Irish, and not in the majority of schools for some years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It might be thought that I am taking the teachers' part in this matter, but I want to make the case that there is a feeling among the teachers they are expected to do this, and that it is only by doing so they will gain the approbation of the Minister and the Department. Personally I do not think that is so.  I think the position, as stated by the Minister last year, and repeated this year, is clear enough, but what I am anxious to do is to have the matter set right, and make it quite clear and definite for the information of all concerned. This consideration was well set out by one of the inspectors in his report with regard to the whole position of Irish, and the teaching of it in the school.  He refers to it in this way:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In one respect it is work not the best suited to our national temperament. It cannot be done in a rush, or by one big brief effort.  It will take more than a generation of steady, unremitting plodding, but that in itself will be a most useful training in other directions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is an exceedingly sensible view to take of the question&mdash;that you cannot revive Irish, and undo the work of 50, 60 or 70 years in a few years, and it would be well if we could feel and say that in 15 or 20 years time this country will be a bi-lingual or an Irish-speaking nation.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself, speaking on Friday, quoted one of the regulations, and then said: &ldquo;Discretion must be allowed to the teacher in the choice of medium.  He should not be urged to <Col N="441" /> teach through Irish if he is not confident of his ability to do so effectively.&rdquo; That is a clear and definite instruction, but I am afraid it has not always been fully observed in the spirit it ought to have been.  I put the question to the Minister as to who was to be the judge in that case, and he answered that the teacher is made judge because, he says, &ldquo;he should not be urged to teach through the medium of Irish if he is not confident of his ability to do so effectively.&rdquo; It must be remembered that all this time I have in mind a particular class of teacher and a particular class of school: the teacher who feels that he has an imperfect knowledge of the language and who is in a school in which the children have up to the present only an imperfect understanding of the language.</P>
    <P>Speaking for myself, I should say that I would not press this point of view very strongly in the case of the infant standards.  In that case the teacher is the main factor, and not so much the pupils.  I would not press the second condition in that case&mdash; namely, that the children must have an understanding of what is being taught, but I would say that in that case no teacher should attempt to do the whole work in the infant standards in Irish unless he or she has a complete command of the language&mdash;a good, free and easy command of the language, such as he or she uses without any conscious effort or groping after words.  So far as conversation, training, play, and that kind of work which is generally done in infant schools is concerned, I believe myself that to a child English is always as new, not quite as new perhaps, but almost as new as Irish, and a child at that age is generally found to pick up a language quite unconsciously; but, as I say, I would not press at all, or strongly, in that case that the pupils should be taught through the medium of Irish unless they had such a knowledge of the language as would enable them to follow the teacher easily from the beginning.  They will gain that unconsciously, after some time, through practice.  This whole question is one of the most important with regard to the teaching of Irish, and the success or failure of the language in <Col N="442" /> the schools depends entirely on the attitude of the Ministry towards that question and on the amount of pressure that is put on.  If it is assumed you have not the co-operation of the teachers you will not succeed without very great difficulty in reviving the language. Enthusiasm is necessary on the part of the teachers, and if they feel that there is undue pressure being put upon them, or if they are asked or expected to do something that they are not really capable of doing well, it will be bad for the language, and it certainly will not encourage them to put forth their best and to approach their work in the spirit in which they ought to approach it.</P>

      <P>I quite appreciate the point of view that has been put before us by Deputy O'Connell on this matter.  I think, however, he has largely provided the answer.  He used the phrase.  &ldquo;The amount of pressure put on.&rdquo; If we take what the Deputy has just said in conjunction with what he said at an earlier stage in the discussion to-day about inspectors and the part that they play, and the fact, if there is such a thing as putting on pressure, I think they are practically the only medium through which pressure could be put on.  Individual teachers have not got their eye on the Minister! We are told about them teaching with one eye on the inspector, but I have not been told up to the present, though I would be rather flattered to be told, that they carry on their work in the schools with one eye on the Minister.</P>

      <P>Doctors differ, but apparently Deputy Good is serious about my rushing.  I really think that all these circumstances that are so strongly impressed on us here are taken into account.  It certainly has been the aim of the whole action of this Department to proceed rationally, to proceed taking full cognisance and making full calculations of all the factors in the case: the ability of the teacher to teach through Irish and the capacity of the pupil to learn through Irish.  The object in teaching through Irish is to spread a knowledge of the Irish language, and where it is found that the means that are recommended are not achieving that end those means will not be persisted in.  On the other hand we could state a position sometimes that appears reasonable on the face of it, but as a matter of fact does not stand examination.  Now, a teacher without being absolutely fluent in Irish, and having Irish at his command, for all purposes, may be an excellent teacher through Irish.  I myself am not fluent in any language.  I do not say I do excellent teaching.  Even when I have to express myself here to my fellow Deputies in the Dáil I find myself constantly not in the happy position of many Deputies to whom words come apparently without effort.</P>

      <P>A certain amount of effort and a certain amount of groping, provided it be not mere helplessness, has itself its value, and a certain amount of variation in the form of expression has itself its value in teaching.  I suppose the most difficult subject, of those mentioned by the Deputy, to teach through Irish, would be arithmetic because it is less discursive than subjects like history and geography, and yet I have it that the teaching of arithmetic is being done, and successfully done, through the <Col N="444" /> medium of Irish.  I would point out also that this is a stage of transition. The teachers, as a body, have zealously responded, I am not going to say to the demand or the requirements of the Ministry, but to the sense of national duty which they consider as being expressed in these requirements.  We have now about 6,000 teachers who hold one or other certified qualification in Irish.</P>
      <P>As for the suggestion that the moderating counsels which have been sent out by the Department have not always been observed, I presume that in a matter of this kind it will never be found possible to keep absolutely accurately upon a particular line.  In some instances the line will be exceeded, and in other instances there will be a falling short.  I do not see how&mdash;possibly the Deputy will be able to assist me&mdash;a definite principle can be laid down.  I think a certain amount of elasticity, of recognition of the variability of circumstances, must be allowed, and if we were to attempt to lay down now a hard and fast line in definite words how far every teacher in every school was to make use, or not to make use, of Irish as a teaching medium, we should be aiming at something that was not practicable at all.</P>
      <P>I do not know that I have anything further to add on that point.  The fact that inspectors are acting in furtherance of the programme and at the same time freely giving their advice to the Department, with regard to the restriction and with regard to the limitations on furthering the programme in this respect, is sufficiently significant of the spirit in which this particular feature of the programme is being put into practice.</P>

      <P>I do not like to make statements without having definite facts to produce, if necessary, and it is very hard to get facts in this matter that one can really base a statement on.  I suppose the Minister would admit&mdash;I think, perhaps, he has already admitted&mdash;with me, that the object of the school is to educate the child.  I think he has already admitted what seems to me to be axiomatic, and that is that unless you have got a medium of communication that is <Col N="445" /> familiar to both teachers and child it is impossible for any new ideas to be communicated from one to the other, to any appreciable extent at any rate.  Much of what the Minister said was quite unexceptional, but still one cannot help feeling, in view of the many statements made, and the facts one comes across, in many directions, that the sentiments to which he has given expression are not permeating through the Department under his administration. There must be many cases&mdash;I cannot, as I said, definitely produce one from all the things that have come under my notice&mdash;I am sure there are many cases in which education has really failed because futile attempts have been made to communicate instruction through the medium of a language that was not familiar, in many cases, either to the teacher or to the child.  Unless it is familiar to both education fails.  I simply rose to bring whatever pressure I could to bear upon the Minister to get him to have such sentiments as he gave expression to made to pass right through the whole administration of his Department. Much of the feeling that has arisen&mdash; and I think a feeling of doubt has arisen&mdash;much of it has arisen from this attempt to communicate instruction through a medium which was neither familiar to the teacher nor to the child, and very often was only familiar to the one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know definitely from the Minister as to whether it is really the intention that the method of instruction in the national schools now&mdash;I am speaking of those other than the infants' division&mdash;is to be bi-lingual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know it definitely from the Minister, because he seems to say at one moment, &ldquo;We do not desire to press any definite line on the teachers,&rdquo; yet, when we take up the programme put into the hands of the teachers there is practically a very definite instruction in it.  I would like to know whether the teachers are supposed to follow this programme, or whether they are supposed to take the line that has been outlined by the Minister this afternoon, that is, that every teacher is left more <Col N="446" /> or less free to take whatever he thinks the most suitable line for those he has to instruct.  One would like a definite view from the Minister, because, on taking up this programme of instruction, one is certainly forced to a certain conclusion with regard to it.  I will read one or two paragraphs to give Deputies an idea of what impression would be left on the mind of the ordinary teacher.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Many bi-lingual schools have already been doing more than is demanded in this programme in the matter of teaching subjects through Irish.  Such schools are now, as far as possible, making Irish the sole medium of instruction, English being taught as an ordinary subject.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, I take it that that reference applies to the national schools outside the infant standard.  That is one of the reasons why I asked the Minister if we are to understand that these schools are to be carried on on a bi-lingual basis. If that be the intention of the Ministry, what is the meaning of the paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Such schools are now, as far as possible, making Irish the sole medium of instruction, English being taught as an ordinary subject.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, if we proceed further on the same page, we find, under the heading. &ldquo;Some notes on the subject of instruction&rdquo;: &ldquo;English should just have the limited place due to English literature amongst all European literatures.&rdquo; If we proceed further in connection with this programme, for a school other than the infant division, we find, with regard to drill and dancing, the following paragraph: &ldquo;Irish step-dancing and Irish figure-dancing should be introduced and practised where possible.&rdquo; The paragraph concludes with the following instruction: &ldquo;All instruction and orders are to be given through the medium of the Irish language.&rdquo; On the same page follows the programme for infants, prefaced by this note: &ldquo;The work of the infant standard is to be entirely in Irish.&rdquo; I have just read these items from the programme to try and get into the minds of Deputies the intention that the programme is intended to convey.  To my mind it is quite clear that instruction, apart from the infant division, is, as far as possible, <Col N="447" /> to be through the medium of Irish.  I also take it, following on the lines of what Deputy O'Connell stated, that the schoolmaster who can achieve that particular object in accordance with the programme of the Department will be held up amongst his fellow-teachers as an example.  That is only human nature.  The Minister says that is the intention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly I misunderstood the Minister.  I tried to understand him since the discussion of these Estimates commenced, and the impression, certainly, left in my mind is that it is a matter very largely for the teacher to decide whether the instruction given to the pupils in his charge is to be through the medium of Irish or through the medium of English. When we were discussing this matter a couple of nights ago, the Minister told us that his policy with regard to teaching was to be intensely national.  I take it, it is to be along the lines laid down in this programme, rather intensified.  In other words, it is the intention, as far as this Department is concerned, that every effort should be made so that the product of the national schools should be taught through one language, and one language only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This afternoon the question was raised with regard to the difficulty of getting suitable books for conveying the instruction to pupils through the medium of Irish.  For many years I have been interested in the question of technical education.  Our technical schools are dependent entirely on our primary schools.  I do not think that will be questioned by anyone.  What is going to be the effect on our technical schools of pupils coming along who know Irish, and only know of instruction through the medium of Irish?  We talk about the problem of books in connection with national schools.  Have you ever conceived the difficulty of giving the manifold and various instructions in technical schools through the medium of Irish?  I doubt if there are books in existence through which <Col N="448" /> that instruction can be given.  Let us assume, and it is a big assumption, that it will take place.  I am satisfied it is not practical politics at present.  The effect of this would be that for a considerable time at all events our technical schools will cease to do even the comparatively small amount of useful work done in them at the moment.</P>
    <P>Let us take this subject a little further.  We find the product of the national school reaching the stage of manhood.  The intension of the Minister is, when the pupils reach that stage, that there will be work to absorb their usefulness.  There may be a great increase in the demand for labour in the future over what we have in the Saorstát to-day, but no matter what view one takes of the future, from the point of view of increase in the amount of employment, there will still be a number of unemployed.  There will still be a number who desire to go to friends in America.  There will still be a number in our trades who desire to migrate to Great Britain for more constant employment and for other reasons.  There will still be a number of harvestmen who will desire to go to Great Britain to avail of the harvest wages and the employment there.  There will still be a considerable number who will desire to follow a seafaring occupation and to obtain employment in the many steamers that go overseas.  How is your Irishman, who has been educated on an intensified national basis, and who can speak only through the medium of Irish, to get on?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to follow the programme outlined on the Department's instruction.  I was following that on through the different schools, and I tried to picture the product of those schools applying for employment. It was from that point of view I was seeing how far this particular method was going to help the pupil.  If trade could absorb the whole product of those different national schools and leave none unemployed, then I could understand <Col N="449" /> the system; but can any of us, even the most optimistic Irishman, conceive such a situation?  If that be too optimistic a view to take, what is to become of those highly trained Irishmen in the language if they cannot find employment to absorb their energy in their own country?</P>
      <P>We had a case not very long ago where an emigrant was refused admission to the United States because of his deficiency in the knowledge of English. That knowledge, according to this programme, is to be less in the future than it is to-day.  Last year 19,000 odd emigrants left the country. Seventy-five per cent. went to the United States.  If they had been trained on this intensively national basis, how many of them would have got into the United States?  If they had been refused admission, what was the outlook for them?  To go back to the old country and there to try and eke out an existence on the dole or in the workhouse.</P>

      <P>The Minister has better access to information of this kind than I have, but I have been told on good authority that people have been refused admission to the States on account of an insufficient knowledge of English. If that knowledge of English is to be less in the future, what is to become of the people?  No doubt the Minister looks at this problem from what you might call an educational point of view.  He is keenly interested in what he calls the native language of his own country, but there are other aspects of this question one must look at.  I look at it naturally from the point of view of the usefulness of those people subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use telling us what has happened in Denmark and other countries. We are in an extraordinary position in this country.  We are within fifty miles of Great Britain.  Ninety odd per cent. of our imports come from Great Britain.  Ninety odd per cent of our exports go to Great Britain. No one knows that better than Deputy Davin.

We want to try to bring up our people in a way in which they may become useful citizens and in a way in which they may, from Deputy Johnson's point of view, earn good wages, and, from the general point of view of the community, live happy, useful lives.  May I say that I am not satisfied that this particular basis now enunciated by the Minister is going to carry out that idea?</P>

      <P>Am I asked to base the plan of education on the margin of unemployment?  Am I asked to base it on the requirements of emigration? That does not appeal to me. I base it on the needs of this country, the needs of the people who live in this country, and the people who are going to live in this country.  A great many instances have been produced&mdash;&ldquo;What is to become of harvestmen?&rdquo; Harvestmen went from this country for generations with absolutely no instruction in English, and Irish was their language in going and coming.  We have heard them. Any person who has been travelling on the railways and boats when those men are going backwards and forwards know what is their language.  As regards seafaring occupations, I think it <Col N="451" /> is a matter of history that the Irish language had to be forbidden in the days when the British Navy was acquiring the mastery of the seas.  The Irish language was so prevalent amongst those who were recruited to that navy that its use had actually to be forbidden. Dancing and drilling&mdash;I do not know whether it was the compulsory Irish dancing or the accompanying words of direction that the Deputy was complaining of.  Really, I am not at all sure that the Deputy in his own mind does not feel sorry that he was not himself compelled to acquire a competent knowledge of the Irish language when he was young.</P>

I should mention, with regard to emigration, that it is a well-known historical fact that the majority of Washington's army at Valley Forge spoke the Irish language, and they were thoroughly efficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that nothing arises on B1 and B2.  Under C1 there is one point that I would like to bring before the House.  I raised this on one or two occasions before, but little progress has been made in the meantime.  I refer to the question of granting diplomas to teachers.  It should be known that after a teacher has spent two years in the training college he has to spend a further period of two years on probation, as it is called, and at the end of that time he is awarded a training diploma.  There is a regulation whereby this training diploma must be got inside five years, otherwise the teacher has to quit the service, generally speaking.  Since the Free State was established I understand no actual parchment diplomas have been issued.  So far as those who were actually serving in the Free State all the time are concerned, there is no great grievance on that account inasmuch as a letter from the Department saying that the period of probation was concluded on a certain date is generally accepted as a substitute for the possession of the actual parchment diploma.  But many teachers are anxious to get the diplomas themselves, and some managers, in making appointments, are inclined to insist on them. There were, however, on the occasion <Col N="454" /> of the transfer over, a certain number of teachers trained in our colleges who had taken service in Great Britain, and the previous practice was that their diplomas were awarded on the reports of the British inspectors.  Now, the British authorities have refused and are refusing to accept this letter which is issued to the Irish teacher as sufficient evidence that the man is a qualified teacher, and are insisting on the production of the actual parchment diploma before they recognise such teachers as being fully qualified.</P>
      <P>I think it is only right and fair that those teachers&mdash;there are not very many&mdash;should not be left in this position that they have to accept a salary very much lower than they would be entitled to if they could produce this document.  They were all people who had taken service before this Ministry was set up, because a teacher trained in our colleges will not be recognised in Britain, and <i>vice versa.</i>  There is also the question of negotiations with regard to these diplomas as between Northern Ireland and the Saorstát.  I know of no reason why there should be a delay or a holding up of the issue of these parchments.  We made inquiries on several occasions and were informed that they were in course of being printed.  I think it was suggested that a new design, appropriate to the changed conditions, was being thought out.  Whatever the reason is, the facts are that it is now practically four years after the change of Government, and my information is that during that time none of these parchment diplomas have been issued.  That is the position, and it is unsatisfactory from the point of view of the teacher who likes to get his diploma, put it in a frame, and hang it up in his school.  It is a great injustice in the case of teachers trained in Irish colleges who are at present in positions in Britain, who cannot be accepted or recognised as fully qualified and trained teachers and put on the salary scale appropriate to the trained teacher pending the production of this diploma.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one other question in connection with diplomas to which I would like to refer.  Complaint has been made that there is a good deal of delay in the issuing of this letter from the <Col N="455" /> Department saying that the period of probation is completed.  I thoroughly approve of the principle that there should be at this stage a close examination of the teacher's work while he is on probation, because everybody recognises that scholarship in itself is not sufficient to make a teacher.  It is recognised, I think, to a large extent, that the art of teaching is largely a natural talent.  But, while I say that, examination and careful watching of the young student teacher is necessary.  I believe there is a good deal of delay in the granting of the diploma on the completion of the period of probation.  That is serious for the teacher, because his incremental period does not begin until his period of probation is passed. He is put on the minimum salary for the two years' probation period, but there are very few teachers who complete their probation of teaching in two years.  I would say that the average is at least three years, and that means that right along the whole scale one year's increment is missed.  That is a serious matter from the teachers' point of view, and there is no great reason why this thing should not be speeded up.</P>
    <P>The ordinary reports that are made on a teacher who has passed his period of probation are not sufficient in the case of a young teacher on probation. There are special reports made by the inspector who has to visit this teacher's classes more frequently, as to his methods of teaching, his preparation for his work, his diligence, and all that kind of thing, and it is quite right that they should be made.  But the teacher on probation does not see these special reports.  The ordinary teacher gets the report with regard to his work during the year, and this class of teacher that I am speaking of will get that ordinary report, but he never sees the special report.  It may and does happen, especially where there is a large number of teachers in a school, that this teacher's ordinary report will be quite all right but the special report will be rather damaging and it would be well that the teacher should be in a position to see that report, and if he finds, say after one <Col N="456" /> year's work, that his method is criticised and that he is not doing his work as he ought to do it, he ought to know what the opinion of the inspector is so far as his work is concerned. We have urged that it would be better to make these special reports available to these young men and women on probation, but it has not been done, and I think it is only right that it should be done, so that they may know at the earliest moment whether they are travelling along the right lines or not.</P>

      <P>I did not like to interrupt or curtail, in any way, the Deputy when he was explaining the case about diplomas, but, as a matter of fact, a great deal of the delay must be due to my well-known tendency to rush things.  The delay with regard to those has come to an end.  Those diplomas are now being issued.

      <P>Before leaving that question of the diploma, I would like to refer to another matter which <Col N="457" /> has been before the Minister more than once.  It is rather a technical point, but it is important to the teachers and to the people concerned.  There is a class of teacher in our school known as the junior assistant mistress, of whom I will have something to say later on under another heading.  Generally speaking, there are untrained teachers.  But sometimes teachers who are fully trained take up those positions of junior assistant mistresses.  If a teacher leaving the training college takes up this position and serves the full period of probation, she is not awarded the training diploma for no good reason that I could ever discover.  This matter was brought to the notice of the old Commissioners and we convinced them from their own regulations and from their own rules that these teachers were bound to get the diploma, having served in the capacity of junior assistant mistress.  They accepted that position, and we were informed that it was necessary to get the special sanction of the Treasury at the time.  The matter was put up before the Treasury, but it was put up at an unfortunate time when there was a general order that anything that might possibly, under any conceivable circumstances, mean an extra penny should be ruthlessly turned down.  It was unfortunate that it was at that particular time that the matter was brought before the Treasury Department. However, it was turned down. We brought the matter before the present Ministry and we have not heard a word as to what happened.  I think it was assumed that the case put up was a reasonable one, and one in which there was no justification for continuing the present practice of refusing diplomas to these teachers.  I would like to know if the Minister has anything new to add or to tell us about the position this evening.</P>

      <P>There is one <Col N="458" /> point which perhaps arises properly under C1.  It is the question of physical training.  The question was raised on the Estimates last year about physical training.  Perhaps the Minister would be able to tell us if anything has been done to secure a system of physical training for the children.  I raise it particularly at the moment, because I feel that there is a general tendency on the part of a large body of teachers, as it were, to repudiate any responsibility for the physical training of the pupils attending the national schools.  Whether that may be another way of directing attention to the fact that they are dissatisfied with the inspectorial system or not, I do not know.  Deputy Johnson outlined to us recently the very elaborate steps that are taken, in a preventative way, to look after the health of the children in the New York schools.  I think we cannot shut our eyes to the opportunity that the teachers have of looking after the physical education of their pupils as well as after the mental education. Personally, I feel that it is absolutely necessary that a systematised scheme of physical training should be obligatory throughout our national school course.  In view of the tendency we find to repudiate any responsibility for paying attention to these things, on the part of a number of teachers, I raise the question.  I would ask the Minister if it is contemplated that suitable training will be given in the training colleges for that purpose, and that in the meantime nothing be left undone in the primary schools to see that physical education is given to pupils.</P>

      <P>I want to support Deputy Mulcahy with regard to the physical training of the children.  I recognise that physical training, if it is to receive the attention which in my opinion it should receive, must be taken up in the training colleges for the teachers.  The teachers must be trained in a system which will allow them adequately to transfer to the children what they have learned in the training colleges.  I think the cultivation of the body only takes second place to the cultivation of the mind.  Some people think it takes first place.  At any rate, physical training takes a very <Col N="459" /> important position in the training of any child.  My experience is that in the National Schools of Ireland physical training practically receives no attention whatever.  There was a certain amount of prejudice in the past against drill in the national schools. Many people thought that the idea underlying physical training in the national schools under the old system was that it was a system of preparing boys for service in the British Army. For that reason it met with a certain amount of prejudice.  I think that any such idea is now cleared away from the minds of the children's parents.  In connection with the establishment of a system of physical culture and physical training in the schools, another matter which should be taken into account is the provision of the necessary apparatus. Because, apart from the question of drill, I think it would be possible very often to provide outdoor apparatus of a simple kind which would be suitable for gymnastic exercises and physical training of an elementary kind.  I would like to see this matter of physical training made an obligatory subject, if possible, in the schools.  I believe there is a conference sitting at the present time dealing with the future programme of the national schools, and I hope that this question will be brought to the front when the conference is considering this programme. I trust that the Minister will use his influence to see that this subject receives the consideration which in my opinion and in the opinion of Deputy Mulcahy it ought to receive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is hardly anybody in the country who has so persistently and so consistently kept before the people the necessity for physical training for the well-being of the children as the teachers. They have raised this matter on various occasions at their meetings.  It has been put forward on their behalf in the Dáil.  At their annual conferences, people specially qualified have been invited to speak on the necessity of much greater attention to the physical well-being of the children in the future than in the past.  I think Deputy Mulcahy, when he speaks of the tendency on the <Col N="460" /> part of the teachers to repudiate responsibility for physical training, forgets what the position is here in this country with regard to the possibilities of doing anything effective.  It is all right, of course, to make arrangements for the physical training of children in large centres and in big schools.</P>
      <P>When we are speaking of education in this country it must never be forgotten&mdash;I am afraid it is too often forgotten&mdash;that practically all our schools are small schools of the type known as the two-teacher school.  That applies to a very great proportion of them.  I believe that out of 5,338 something like 600 have three or more teachers. They are all small schools.  Let us picture a typical small school in the country at which physical training is to be carried out.  Where is it to be carried out?  In the schoolroom, will Deputy Mulcahy say?  I am sure he will say &ldquo;no.&rdquo; The atmosphere of the school is not suitable for the purpose of carrying out instruction in physical training.  Will the Deputy have us go out into the public road?  In regard to the majority of those schools there is no other place for the children to go out to.  There is no playground attached other than a muddy playground, like a fair-green on a wet winter's afternoon.  The Deputy must know what the position is in the vast majority of schools.  Apart from those conditions, you cannot have effective training unless you are dealing with a considerable number of children.  Take an ordinary average country school of 40 or 50 pupils as an example.  You will have pupils there from the ages of 14 and perhaps 16 down to the age of 4 years.  It would not be a very inspiring spectacle to see 3 or 4, 9 or 10 or, perhaps, the whole school out and the teacher endeavouring to exercise them.  To do so would, in my opinion, be extremely difficult because the exercises might not suit the different conditions and the varying ages of the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered, too, that it is not everybody who can be in a position, especially after reaching early middle life, to give instructions in physical training.  The teachers say the physical training is a matter for which some <Col N="461" /> special provision should be made.  That is their position.  They are not opposing physical training as such, but they say it is not possible to give effective instruction in physical training in all our national schools because of the conditions that I have touched upon.  It must not be taken that they are opposed to the idea; quite the contrary.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Heffernan has stated, there is the question of the apparatus for physical training.  Who is to provide it?  How is it to be provided? There is no machinery at present by which it can be provided.  All these things should be taken into account.  I agree with Deputy Mulcahy that it is a matter that has been very much neglected.  I am afraid, however, the object we have in mind will not be effected simply by saying that you must, in every school, make physical training part of the ordinary instruction of the day.</P>

      <P>I must say I thought I could no longer be astonished in the Dáil, but Deputy Heffernan has astonished me.  He said that there was a reluctance in this country to drill.  I was under the impression that most of the difficulties of the last few years had been caused by an over-exuberant desire to drill, and that the chief trouble arose from the question: Who was to give the words of command for that drill?  In spite of my astonishment, I did not intend to intervene in this debate were it not for Deputy O'Connell's speech.  I am glad that in principle he agreed with Deputy Mulcahy, as I agree with Deputy Mulcahy.  I do not want to go back to a controversy we had a little while ago.  I remember Deputy Mulcahy making the speech last year in Irish that he made this year in English&mdash;and we had a more informing discussion this year.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell touched upon two difficulties.  One, I think, is illusory.  He said there was no place to drill, and that you could not drill in the school.  I quite agree that you could not drill in the average country school.  He said there was no place <Col N="462" /> outside the school except the public road or some muddy place.  It does not rain every day, even in this country, and nearly every school in my part of the world has about half an acre attached to it.</P>

      <P>I am speaking of Sligo.  I do not know what Connemara is like.  In Sligo every school has a quarter or half an acre around it.  That would afford enough space to drill.  I do not think the difficulty with regard to apparatus need arise.  There is an enormous variety of physical drill which can be done without apparatus of any kind.  I agree with Deputy O'Connell when he says there are teachers who may be excellent teachers, admirable teachers, but who are not fit to instruct in physical drill for reasons that one need not go far to seek.  They may not be qualified to demonstrate the exercises they desire the pupils to perform.  Would it not be possible&mdash;I know the Minister would have to consult with another Minister on the subject&mdash;to invoke the services of the Gárda Síochána for the limited period on each school-day during which instruction would be necessary?  The Gárda are available in those places. They are trained in drill and, if you could get a sergeant or a Gárda to go down for half an hour each day and put the pupils through a course of drill, I believe they would have sufficient instruction. By doing so you would relieve the teachers of a certain amount of their work, and the benefit to the health and physique of the children would be very great.  That is not a considered suggestion; it arises from the difficulties that I felt Deputy O'Connell to be under.  I do, however, think it would be worth a little consideration on the part of the Ministry.  On the one hand you have children needing instruction in physical training, and on the other hand you have in most places men who have had the instruction and are qualified to impart it.  I think the problem of bringing the two together would not be insuperable.</P>

      <P>In connection with this subject of providing physical drill <Col N="463" /> for children, I would ask the Minister if he would also bear in mind, for the physical well-being of the children, the provision of hot and cold baths.  It would be a valuable education to poor children, and to some who are better off, to have them taught to bath themselves. It is, in fact, the only opportunity they could get of becoming acquainted with baths, and I believe that cleanliness would have a very stimulating effect on the ambition of a child. I agree with Deputy O'Connell as to the difficulty there would be in getting teachers to give physical drill.  When a man attains my age and my corpulence he is not a very graceful subject to go somersaulting about the school.  I think that Deputy Cooper has made a very valuable suggestion when he asks that another Ministry might arrange with the Ministry of Education to supply the Gárda Síochána for the purpose of giving these drills.</P>

The difficulties in the matter of making anything like general arrangements have been pointed out by Deputy O'Connell, and I need not cover the ground.</P>
      <P>Deputy Heffernan has also suggested that if it is going to be a matter of programme it could properly be dealt with by the conference which is dealing with the question of programme and of which Deputy Mulcahy is a member.

      <P>I would like to ask a question of the Minister as regards C3&mdash;that is, in connection with the expenses of teachers attending instructional courses in Irish.  I raised this on the general discussion and asked what the policy of the Minister would be in future and whether we are to have the continuation of these courses or not. If the courses are to be continued I would like to suggest to the Minister that the time at which these courses should take place should be a period of the year when the attendance at the schools would not be as seriously affected as is the case at present.  As I pointed out the other day, when the teachers' courses start in July it is a period of the year when in rural districts the children can most conveniently attend school with the least possible hardship.  While recognising that if Irish has to be taught teachers will have to get an opportunity of learning it, we must also recognise that the teachers are learning Irish to teach it to the pupils.  No one will debate the point that children in rural districts can much more conveniently attend school in July than in September, October, November and winter months. If the courses are to be continued I suggest that the Minister would be well advised to consider the question of changing the month in which they are held, as in July the children can attend school most conveniently.  They are least wanted at home at that period and that is a time that would be most satisfactory to all concerned.</P>

The staffing of the schools has, for instance, to be considered.</P>

      <P>Take the case of a teacher who is aged 44 when the course starts.  He is, I understand, eligible to obtain expenses for attending, but if he passes the age of 45 there is no obligation on him to attend, and I do not think that he would be entitled to expenses if he did attend.  Although such a teacher may have attended two courses in succession, he is not able, if he reaches a certain age, to obtain expenses for attending again, and I question whether that is advisable or fair in the case of a teacher desirous of learning the language and capable of assimilating what is taught.  In such cases I urge that the regulation be altered.  I also wish again to urge on the Minister the point I have already made with regard to the date on which the courses are held.  It may be a trifling point, but it is such things which prejudice people in this country, where they are easily influenced.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Vote for elementary evening schools, I would like to know the position. It seems to be a matter to which much attention has not been paid.  I was looking over old statistics and reports&mdash;I cannot at the moment get the actual figures&mdash;and I noticed that in the early years of the century in 1904 or 1905, I think, there were 650, or thereabouts, of these evening schools <Col N="466" /> in operation.  Coming down to 1914, I think there were over 300, but, so far as I can gather from the last report, there were less than 50 in operation. To the best of my recollection, these are the facts.  Elementary evening schools, or night schools, as we used to call them, served a very useful purpose, in my opinion, especially in a country like this, where, owing to irregular attendance, or failure to obtain proper primary education, many young men were glad to attend these evening schools and endeavour to make up for the years that had been lost.  I know that in many of these schools valuable work was done.  They were attended by young people of 18 or 19 years, and in some cases, to my own knowledge, by people of 45 and over.  The young people benefitted considerably by these schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of one area where youths came to the school specially to be prepared for entrance to the winter agricultural classes.  It seems that of late no attention has been paid to this matter, but now that the two Departments have co-ordinated there may be some arrangement whereby the technical instruction committees could take up this work, which was previously done through the National Board.  I do not know whether or not a working arrangement has been come to.  I have been told on good authority that the only new regulation the Department made in connection with the night schools was to discontinue the extra expenses allowed to inspectors who inspected these schools.  I do not know whether the Ministry of Education was responsible for that or not.  At any rate, my information is that there is such a regulation.  An inspector should not be expected after his ordinary day's work to drive a long distance to one of these schools without being entitled to extra expense.  If he is not entitled to that, it would be only natural he would discourage continuance at the night schools, or at least he could hardly be expected to encourage the opening of night schools all over the area under his charge.  I think this matter, in view of the peculiar position in which this country has been placed in the past owing to the want of primary <Col N="467" /> education, should engage the attention of the Minister now that the departments of technical and primary education are under the one Ministry. There ought to be some system whereby these schools would be encouraged throughout the country.</P>

Has the Minister anything to add to the statement of the President on that occasion? I think it was made on the condition that the Dáil expressed the view that such a committee was desired.  I think there would be general agreement that post-primary education is a matter which is being sadly neglected.  If one of the ways of bringing about an improvement, which everybody agrees is necessary, be the setting up of a committee to investigate what, in the first place, is necessary to recommend to the Minister in connection with this question, then I think everybody would be in agreement that such a committee ought to be set up at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point that is, perhaps, worth mentioning. I realise that this question of post-primary education is a very difficult one.  I would draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that quite recently, when going through different parts of the country, I came across young men of between 18 and 20 years of age, who have been four or five years left the primary schools, and who, perhaps, to a very large extent, have forgotten how to write or to do much reading, and who feel their position to some extent.  Some of them do, at all events.  I think it is worth drawing attention to the point that we have children of, say, 12 years of age at the <Col N="469" /> primary schools to-day who will leave the primary schools in two years' time with a quickened interest in their education generally.  These are children who will follow the footsteps of the people I have spoken of, but with a quickened interest in education and a grasp of the great facilities that will be before them to follow up their primary education in the country.  Then we will come to a situation in six or eight years' time, when those who are 18 or 20 now will be 26 or 28 years of age, and will feel themselves handicapped at the moment with lack of education, and will find themselves very backward at that age as compared with youths of 18 or 19, who at that time will have got the advantages of the great interest in education at the present moment.  In considering this matter of post-primary education, it is worth bearing in mind that in many parts of the country there will be a kind of transition period when people of 18 or 19 or 20 years of age, at the present moment, will be requiring facilities of that particular type.  It is a matter that is fairly urgent.</P>

It is well enough for the Minister to say he realises the bad condition of so many hundreds of schools, if not thousands. But I think the Dáil should ask the Minister and the Ministry to give us some definite statement of their intention in regard to this matter.  I suppose it is hardly necessary to repeat the evidence of the bad condition of the schools.  Deputy O'Connell has read one or two extracts from reports made at different times, showing that some of the schools are entirely without windows, having been subject to bombardment, and that they have been in that condition for months, if not for years; that there are no funds available for putting panes of glass in the windows; in other cases that the roofs are bad, that the rooms inside are dirty, that the walls are damp, and, in a general way, that the schools in very many cases are in an insanitary condition.  I raised the question a few days ago as to what was the relationship, or was there any relationship between the Ministry of Education and the Health authorities so that there would be some kind of liaison between these bodies in respect of the health of the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But one may ask, is there any relationship between the Ministry of Education and the sanitary authorities?  Is it known to the Ministry of Education that the sanitary authorities have ever <Col N="471" /> taken effective action to secure that schools shall be put into a sanitary condition, and if such action has been taken, upon whom does the onus lie?  Does it mean that if the manager of the school has not funds or cannot get funds to put the school into a sanitary condition the school must be closed as a house would be closed, and that therefore the children have to be deprived of the opportunity for education?  I think it would not be unfair to say that if the sanitary authorities were to carry out their work satisfactorily, very many schools would be obliged to close.  They would not be allowed to remain open because of their insanitary condition.  That is a very terrible state of things.  It is a state of things which, I think, the Ministry has the right to pay very serious attention to.  Of course we shall be told that the whole problem is one of finance.  I have no doubt that is a great portion of the problem, but I have no doubt either that if the Ministry's mind was clear as to the necessities of the case and if other problems associated with the rehabilitation of school&mdash;buildings were present in their minds they could find means of raising a fund&mdash;of raising moneys by the issue of bonds or something of a special kind&mdash;to deal with a very special purpose, namely, to provide accommodation for the education of the children.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House as a whole was interested to hear Deputy Dr. Hennessy suggest that there should be hot and cold water baths provided for the children in the schools.  There are many idealists of different kinds, many Utopians, but I am prepared to say that I would wait for a little while for the provision of hot and cold water baths in some of the wilder parts of the country if we could be sure that we were going to have the school buildings made sanitary and habitable.  In the first instance, let us look after the buildings and the necessary equipment and then perhaps the hot and cold water baths will come in due time, very useful and very good as they would be.  I think we had better direct our attention to the making habitable of the many insanitary and decayed <Col N="472" /> school buildings we have at present. The Minister will say that he is in entire agreement.  He understands this matter a great deal more closely than we do because of representations that have been made, time and time again, to his Department.  He has been inundated with complaints and has taken them very sorely to heart.  But can he tell us what is the position of the Ministry of Finance in regard to his demand that this question should be taken in hands seriously and put in the way of solution?  I do not know whether there is any problem in connection with the responsibility, but I think the Minister should open his heart in this matter and let the Dáil understand, as far as he is acquainted with it, the whole problem and why it is that for so long so many school buildings have been allowed to remain in an insanitary condition.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy has had experience of one school or another which required at least painting and cleaning, of many which would require a great deal more than that, and I think everyone in the country knows that school-buildings in a very large number of cases are not fit for the work they are intended for.  I think we ought to recognise that the surroundings of the school play a great part in the mental development of the children.  Many of them unfortunately come from homes which are not particularly bright or cheerful: not particularly entertaining, and certainly not calculated to develop any æsthetic sense.  These school buildings and their equipment ought, I suggest, to be the means of imparting to the children some better ideas in regard to what is beautiful, clean, sweet and good, but unfortunately the school is the contrary in too many cases.  The school, in too many instances, gives the idea to the child that dirt and squalor and all that is unlovely should be the normal condition of the life of the child: that the State and the school authorities and all connected with the training of children are quite satisfied with that state of things and that there is no, or at least very little, care taken in regard to making things brighter and better.  As a matter of fact the child really does not think that the school is a place which should be <Col N="473" /> bright and cheerful.  I have had the privilege of visiting some schools in the country which were really a delight, and I am sure their attractive surroundings comprise the best part of the unconscious education which the children are receiving because of their brightness and beauty.  Many others are quite the contrary and, unfortunately, all the efforts of the teachers are damped because of the surroundings and the physical impossibility of making the schools bright and cheerful. I hope something will be said by the Minister to give us some hope, at any rate, that the Ministry is tackling this problem earnestly and with a sincere desire and will to remedy the existing grievances.</P>

      <P>I was rather surprised to hear the unanimous chorus from all sides of the Dáil as to the great unsuitability of the schools throughout the country.  I am glad to be able to say that in the part of the country I come from the position is very different, and I attribute a great deal of this to the action of the managers and teachers in that district.  I believe myself that it would be almost impossible for the Minister for Education and his Department to look after the upkeep of all the schools in the country.  I hold that in those places where the schools are in the dilapidated state described by Deputy O'Connell and other Deputies a great deal of the fault rests with the managers and the teachers.  Where you have energetic managers and teachers you have no such thing as the dirt and squalor in the schools that has been complained of by some Deputies.  Some of the best buildings in my part of the country are the national schools.  Where you have energetic managers and teachers you are certain to find good school buildings, and I am glad to be able to say that the splendid school buildings we have all over South Wexford are a credit to our energetic managers and teachers.</P>

      <P>I wish to join with Deputy Johnson in impressing on the Minister the great necessity for having proper sanitary arrangements provided <Col N="474" /> in the schools.  Deputy Doyle mentioned that the schools in his district were in good condition, but I know schools that have been built within the last 10 or 12 years, splendid buildings, that lack sanitary arrangements and a water supply.  When the children want to quench their thirst in the warm weather they have to go to troughs in the fields and drink the water at which the farmers water their cattle.  For a small outlay a proper water supply could be provided in most of the schools, and I want to urge on the Minister the necessity of seeing that such a water supply is provided where it can be obtained without very great cost.</P>

      <P>As one of the Deputies who raised a question about school buildings, I do not like to let this occasion pass without joining with other Deputies in asking the Minister to make some definite declaration of policy with regard to the building, maintenance and refitting of schools. In my county there are a great many good schools, but there are also many bad ones.  I believe that medical inspection of school children is only tinkering with the problem of improving the physical condition of the children unless we begin in the right way, and, in my opinion, the proper place to begin is with the school building.  I cannot see how any real advantage could accrue from medical inspection while the schools are left in the condition that they are now in.  I am at present against the medical inspection of school children, as I believe it would be waste of money.  On the other hand, I am strongly in favour of improving school buildings.  As we spend £3,000,000 yearly on primary education, there should be some means of providing a further sum that would put the schools in a good condition.  I would support the issue of National Bonds, repayable over a lengthy period, for the purpose of financing such work.  I believe the State and the Government could not do better than to pledge their credit by the issue of a State loan or bonds with which to provide adequate school buildings.  In many of the schools the cubic space is insufficient, <Col N="475" /> they are badly lighted, badly ventilated, often damp, and with poor sanitary accommodation.  I have it on the authority of a medical specialist on tuberculosis that by far the greatest amount of infection is contracted by children during their youthful years. I believe that many of the schools are breeding grounds for this disease.  As a lay man, that is my opinion, and the information was given me by a medical man who is interested in the subject. Perhaps Deputy Hennessy may have something to say on that aspect.</P>
      <P>Our schools compare very unfavourably with schools in other countries.  I know that in Western Canada, a country with a scattered population, and with comparatively narrow financial resources, the first consideration is to provide a good school in a district.  In comparatively small towns there are school buildings of an excellent type. I think this is not a matter of simply giving lip service or of uttering pious platitudes.  It is an urgent problem and should be dealt with immediately. The whole future of our educational system depends on the rectification of the present unhappy condition of affairs.  I am in full agreement with Deputy Johnson about the effect that must be produced on pupils by sordid and unpleasant surroundings.  That has been recognised in large industries where it is a common thing for the employers to provide surroundings that produce happy feelings in the minds of the workers.  The effect on children who have to spend day after day in drab and sordid schools must be very serious and must react on their future outlook on life.</P>

      <P>The doctrine of self-help has been lost, and the State is to be the happy mother of everybody.  If Deputies who talk of the wretched school buildings in their areas spent the eloquence that we have listened to here in pointing out to the people the means already provided by which these buildings could be improved, they would be doing good service.  As Deputy Heffernan is aware there is a scheme by which the greater portion of the money necessary for building schools can be obtained through the <Col N="476" /> Department of Public Works, and if the Deputy would go to the particular area where schools are needed and ask the ratepayers to subscribe a small amount which would be supplemented by the State grant, suitable schools could be provided.  As Deputy Doyle stated, the manager, the school teacher, and public opinion can get that done. It is a very peculiar thing that these complaints should be made here when they could be easily remedied by acting on the doctrine of self-help.</P>

      <P>Deputy Heffernan has asked my opinion on the expert medical evidence he has quoted.  I agree with all he has stated except as to the prevention of the spread of tuberculosis in the schools and the spread of other virulent diseases such as scarlet fever and measles.  The only way you can prevent the spreading is by medical inspection.  A medical inspector will detect them and if detected it is hoped he will have the power of insisting that those children be kept from the schools.</P>

      <P>Perhaps if the Deputies were as keen to see that the Minister would make provision to have the children properly fed as well as properly housed, there might not be much necessity for all the medical inspection, and so on.  I think if the tendency, as it appears to be, is to make it still more difficult for the average workman to provide for his children, the medical inspectors will be required very urgently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be well to state what the present position is with regard to provision for schools and the upkeep of schools.  There is a Vote here under C.9 of £13,800 being granted towards the cost of lighting and heating of schools, etc.  A small calculation will show that this is an average of a little over £2 per school. That is the only grant that comes from any source as a matter of course.  This State grant is totally inadequate to meet the requirements of the situation. The position is that the local manager of the school is charged with the upkeep of the school, and there is a regulation of the Department itself that <Col N="477" /> it is the duty of the manager to see that every school is adequately heated and cleaned, but nothing happens if the manager fails to do this.  So far as I can discover, no power resides in the Department to enforce that regulation, if the manager fails from any reason whatever to make that provision.  We must recognise the fact that the voluntary contributions, which the manager can lay his hands on, come very often only from the parents of the children, who are the people among the community least able to provide this money.  There is no machinery.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Wilson's suggestion that the State should not be asked to carry everything.  If Deputy Wilson will read carefully any pronouncements I have made on this matter he will find I have never suggested that it was the duty of the State to maintain the school in proper condition. If Deputy Noonan takes Deputy Wilson's views and preaches them in his locality, what machinery is there if there are one or two amongst the community, and those the largest ratepayers, who do not send their children to the national schools and who refuse to give any assistance to the upkeep of the school?  There is no machinery to compel them to contribute.  It is purely on a voluntary basis, and it was admitted seven years ago that the voluntary basis has broken down. Managers were finding it, even before that time, increasingly difficult to meet the necessities of the case and to meet the expenses which were necessary even for the ordinary cleaning and heating of the schools, and Deputies must know that it is the usual practice in the national schools for the ordinary cleaning and dusting to be done by the school children after hours.  I need not ask Deputy Dr. Hennessy's opinion as to that practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister cannot plead that this is a question he must look into or set up a commission about.  I am sure the Minister has read the report of the Killanin Committee set up in 1918 composed of the Commissioners of National Education at the time, the teachers and the managers of the national schools. The Most Rev. Dr. O'Donnell, Archbishop of Armagh, the Very Rev. Dean <Col N="478" /> Macken, and other Ministers of religion were members.  They came to an unanimous feeling with regard to this matter and recommended the machinery. The machinery as to how this problem can be dealt with is there.  I hope the Minister has read the report, and I hope he will read it again after this debate.  I hope, above all, that he will take immediate steps to set up the machinery recommended in the report. If he does, he will have gone a long way to meet the difficulties that have arisen in connection with the provision of school buildings, especially the upkeep of the present buildings and the putting of them into a proper sanitary condition.</P>

      <P>The heating of the schools in the winter amounts to about two tons of coal at a cost of £6.  In the neighbourhood I come from a collection is made from those capable of paying, and the parents of those children supply the rest, so that there is a continuous fire all through the winter in those areas.  That is again a matter for the people in the area, and while it may be a great thing to have the Minister for Education setting down on these Estimates the provision of two tons of coal for each school in the Saorstát where there is proper public opinion and where the people are directed as to the necessity for those things, this can be easily remedied as it is remedied in every area I know of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this particular matter in my opening remarks on the discussion of the President's motion.  I did so because I was anxious that Deputies should give it as much and as close attention as they could.  It is some time since I read the report of that Commission, and I cannot charge my memory.  I cannot answer offhand, but I think that their recommendation was that local committees should be formed to deal with this question.  The actual condition of things is that the person responsible for the upkeep of the school buildings is the manager of the school.  As has been said already, here the schools are <Col N="479" /> not State schools; they are State-aided schools.  I think it has also been stated that the particular system of management which exists is one that apparently has general public support, and for practical reasons no change in it is proposed or recommended.  While that is so, it is evidently not possible, without changing that system, to impose by the authority of the State a system of local committees, whatever might be done to encourage it.</P>
      <P>We are not window-dressing with regard to this matter.  Months ago the inspectors were required to supply the Department with a return as to the condition of the school buildings in their respective sections.  The return will cover cases in which new school buildings are required, owing to the defective conditions of the existing schools, cases in which the existing schools require to be enlarged, to be structurally improved, and cases in which school houses are required where none exist at present.  The inspectors have also been asked to report on schools which are at present overcrowded, and schools in which the result of a measure of compulsory attendance is likely to be overcrowding, and various other details, such as the provision of partitions in schools, and other structural work that does not come under the description of the work of maintenance and repairs.  That return is in preparation and it will take some time to complete it.  Until it is completed I will not be in a position to make to anyone, the Minister for Finance, the Dáil, or anyone else, anything like definite proposals; I will not be in a position to state what the scale of such proposals will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson invites me to say what the position is in this respect with regard to the Minister for Finance. Well, matters discussed between myself and the Minister for Finance are discussed between me and the Minister for Finance.  If there are any questions to be put to him they can be put to him.  I know from my own knowledge a good deal about the condition of these schools and, as Deputy Johnson <Col N="480" /> said, I could tell you of continual representations made to me with regard to necessitous cases.  I also know that a bad standard was fixed in the early period and that the inferior schools are in most cases the older schools, the schools that have been longest built in country districts; poor, sometimes from the point of view of structure; often built, and that, I think, probably because there was no choice, on very undesirable sites, and I do expect, when the question comes to be dealt with, as I think it must be, in a comprehensive way, that it will mean a very considerable expenditure. When Deputy Heffernan said that it was not a case for lip service I thought he was going to take his hand out of his pocket.  I was expecting it.  However, seriously, I think we can anticipate that putting the primary schools &mdash;many of them are good schools, but those which are not&mdash;into a proper condition and providing proper school accommodation where it does not exist at present, will be a very costly affair, and as to whether it is to be dealt with by the issuing of bonds, by a special loan, or by anything of that kind, that is a matter which will have to be faced when we are in possession of the full facts of the case.</P>
    <P>As I said, I am glad that so much attention has been directed to the matter. It might be the impression of people, and of some who have approached me I should say that it is the impression, that necessitous schools in a bad condition of repair, dilapidated and on bad sites, exist only here and there.  I am afraid that when we get a proper return we shall find that they exist in a very large number of cases &mdash;and Deputy Doyle's district is indeed very fortunate if it has no such schools &mdash;that even districts which could not be described as economically backward, which are not congested districts, districts in which there are very substantial residents, and still in many cases very poor school accommodation.</P>
