      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that a pension which Timothy Bohan, Millstreet, Co. Cork, No. 11684, 38th Battalion, had been receiving was withdrawn on June 30th, 1925; that on May 15th, 1925, he appeared before a Medical Board, and that he has since then heard nothing of the decision of the Board, and if he will take steps to expedite the decision of the Board regarding the claim to continuance of the pension.</P>

      <P>Mr. Bohan made a claim under the Army Pensions Act, 1923, in respect of a gun-shot wound.  He was awarded a temporary pension of 42/- a week for the period from the 29th March, 1924, to the 30th June, 1925, pending further examination and investigation. Medical examination revealed the fact that he was suffering from &ldquo;pulmonary tuberculosis.&rdquo; As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Act does not provide for diseases incurred on active service, and the question as to whether Mr. Bohan's present disability is due to the wound he received in 1922 has been engaging the attention of my Department.  Arrangements are being made to bring Mr. Bohan to Dublin for special examination, after which it is hoped an early decision will be reached in his case.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if representations were made to him on behalf of the Fermoy Urban Council requesting the payment of £603 in respect of contributions in lieu of rates for the year 1920/21, and if he will state what action he intends to take in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. The Deputy himself made representations to my Department on behalf of the Fermoy Urban District Council in May last, and a letter was sent to him on the 20th May, 1925, explaining fully the position.  In that letter the Deputy was informed that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In regard to the sum of £600 odd which the Council stated was due to them as balance of their claim for bounty (in lieu of rates) for 1920-21, the Council were informed that no funds were available to the Government for the purpose of making any payments of bounty in respect of any period prior to 1st April, 1922, when the functions of Government were transferred to the Saorstát. There is absolutely no prospect of any further payment being made now to the Council in respect of bounty for the year 1920-21 in excess of the amount which was paid or credited to the Council in that year. You may not be aware that there is no legal liability to pay contribution in lieu of rates on Government property, <Col N="1970" /> all such payments being purely ex gratia.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Similar replies to other communications on the same subject were sent as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  To W.J. Magnier, solicitor to the Council, on the 6th July, 1923.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Stage of the Expiring Laws Bill.  This Bill proposes to continue for another year some twenty-one enactments which were continued by last year's Act up to 31st December of the present year.  The Acts which it is proposed to continue are all included in last year's Act.  There were also in that Act two others&mdash;the Licensing Act of 1902 and the Lands Drainage Act of 1914 &mdash;which have been replaced by legislation carried through this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an old battlefield for contests between the Minister for Finance and myself.  We have fought every year for the last two years over these expiring laws, because I have always endeavoured to persuade him that the statutes that governed the use of motor cars and wireless telegraphy should not be temporary statutes passed twenty years ago.  The Motor Car Act was passed in 1903.  In 1903 the motor car was the rich man's <Col N="1974" /> luxury.  Now it is a commercial factor of enormous importance and many of the provisions of that Act with regard to speed limits and with regard to the granting of licences are out-of-date and archaic, and ought to be reconsidered. But I am not so unreasonable as to expect the Government to reconsider them before the 31st December.  I realise that, owing to circumstances over which they have no control, or less control than they ought to have, their timetable has been much disorganised.  I do not say to the Minister, therefore: Bring in and pass a Motor Car Bill between now and Christmas, but I do urge the Minister to go into this question in the coming year.  Otherwise, on the understanding of agreeing to an armistice for the present year, I shall have to fight here next year, but for this year I am prepared to allow this Bill to go through without obstruction. The Minister told us that a new Wireless Telegraphy Bill is contemplated.  I hope that a new Motor Car Bill is also contemplated and that the necessary inquiries are on foot to enable that Bill to be a good and a useful Bill.  I urge the Minister&mdash;I do not ask him for a definite pledge&mdash;to give some indication that he is going to move in that direction.  If that is so I shall not hamper him in getting his Bill through this year.</P>

      <P>As the memorandum that I circulated shows, it is anticipated that several of these enactments will not appear in next year's Bill, others of them will, and will continue to be renewed from year to year for some time. The question of new motor legislation is quite complicated.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two Bills in the Schedule to which I would like to direct a little attention. Deputy Cooper already touched upon the Motor Car Act of 1903.  I should like to ask the Ministers if they would tell us something in respect to the Corrupt Practices (Commission Expenses) Act.  I agree there is a certain limitation in that, but I would draw the attention of Ministers to the necessity of legislation which would amend this present Act with a view to simplifying, and cheapening the procedure in regard to election petitions.  One would hope that the necessity for election petitions would not continue.  The necessity has been obvious in recent times, but the expense is quite sufficient to make the Act of little effect. But if we are to have corrupt practices, then the means of upsetting elections which have been accomplished by corrupt practices, that is, by election petitions, and the expenses of such petitions, should be lessened.  The Local Government (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1916, deals with statistics, and Sections 13, 21 and 23, I think, have to do with modifying the requirements of the Department in regard to the provisions of returns and statistics. I think it is probable that with our circumstances the requirements of the original Act, modified by this Act, impose too great an obligation, and the statistics needed for our purposes are, perhaps, not as great as the original Act, as amended by that Act, requires.</P>
      <P>The Dáil went out of Committee.</P>
      <P>Bill reported without amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1976" /> But at present the figures and statistics we are provided with are entirely too scanty, and I urge the consideration of the point that there is something between what is at present given, and what was required by the original Act, which was amended by this Act of 1916, and that we should have some amendment of the present practice in regard to the provision of statistics. It may be that will be dealt with when we touch on the Statistics Bill; I do not know, but I call attention to it.</P>
    <P>Again, in regard to the Workmen's Compensation Act, I understand, of course, that a Commission is sitting and is dealing with this matter.  I hope that when the report of that Committee is brought forward it will receive consideration so quickly as will enable a measure of a permanent character to be brought forward and passed before the end of next year. These are the three points to which I wish to direct attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say that I have noted what Deputy Johnson said. The question of corrupt practices at elections probably does require further legislation.  At any rate, I think it was felt, following our recent election, that every possible avenue of improper practices was not stopped completely. It may be that you can deal more fully with the matter.  The Local Government Department, I think, recognises that at present the statistics provided are hardly sufficient, but as Deputies are aware, a great many changes have been introduced into the machinery of Local Government in recent years and further changes are to be expected following the report of the Commission on Poor Law.  I think when changes have been decided on and new machinery set in order, there will be agreement that fuller information should be provided than at present.</P>

      <P>I am not quite sure that I am entitled to raise, on this section, a question with reference to notices which have appeared in the Press, in the last few days, in regard to certain members of the Defence Forces being sent to the United States for education purposes.  I do not know if the Minister would be willing, at this stage, to give the House any information or confirmation as to the reports which appeared in the Press on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like also if the Minister would add to our knowledge of the Defence Forces, as to what are his intentions regarding the Corps of Engineers.  I have been informed that certain new arrangements are being arrived at in this matter and that a certain disbandment is taking place in connection with some reorganisation of the Corps of Engineers.  While my information is not at all definite, I invite the Minister to take us into his confidence and tell us if anything of that kind is taking place and what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="MINISTER for DEFENCE (Mr. Hughes) Peter Hughes">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for DEFENCE (Mr. Hughes)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the point raised by Deputy Esmonde, as to the question of sending a delegation of officers to America, for the purpose of seeing how things are done there and of bringing back information that would be useful to us in our training school, it is proposed to send a delegation of officers to America.  The arrangements are not yet complete, and until they have been completed I will not be in a position to give all the information the Deputy would like on the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the point raised by Deputy Johnson, a scheme of reorganisation is being prepared in my Department, but it has not reached me yet for my approval or disapproval. <Col N="1980" /> What the exact details of the scheme are I do not know at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say how many times there have been reorganisation schemes since, say, two years ago in this Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there were two reorganisation schemes, so that this will be the third.  I do not suppose that even this will be the final one.  We are building up the Army, and there will have to be several schemes of reorganisation before it reaches its final stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not accept this proposition as a general proposition, that no organisation, either civil or military, is likely to grow into health and strength if it is going to be recast every six months, or if reorganisation is going to take place before a proper trial has been given to the last attempt?  I am sorry the Minister is not able to give us any further information as to the present proposal, but it surely is a sign of very great weakness and, shall I say, incompetence, to have reorganisation schemes put into operation every few months.  The Minister says this will be the third.  The Army is not many years old, and I suppose the Army Corps of Engineers is younger than any other portion of the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has stated that arrangements are not yet completed with regard to this delegation to America, I should like to know from him whether it is his intention that this delegation of officers are to go to America simply to investigate that training in that country, or whether it is his intention that this school of officers shall undergo a definite course of training in that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention that they will undergo a course of training in some of the schools of America.  I think one of them is Westpoint. As regards the exact training that they will get there, I am not in a position to say, but it will be for the delegation when they go there or for the head of the delegation to find out <Col N="1981" /> exactly what is being done in these schools and to bring back anything that would be helpful to the Army and to the country generally in connection with the forming of our school for military training.  I do hope that when these officers return we will be in a position to start our school on a proper footing.  A school for military training has been contemplated for a long time, but, before forming it, I think it is better that we should get all the information we can from countries that have longer army traditions behind them than we have.  We shall have that information collated, so that we can start our school on a proper basis.</P>
      <P>So far as Deputy Johnson's point is concerned, I do not think that any reorganisation that is contemplated at the present time is going to prejudice any person.  The Corps of Engineers is just as old as the Army itself.  There were engineers, as far as I remember, from the beginning.  If it is found necessary, in the public interest and the interests of the Army, that that corps or any other corps should be reorganised, I think it is for the benefit of the whole Army that it should be done.  If we found defects in the present scheme I think we should be lacking in our duty if we did not try to remedy them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Minister is perfectly right in saying that if he found a certain thing necessary that it should be done.  Obviously, he did not realise that what was found necessary twelve months ago led to a particular form of reorganisation.  I think the reorganisation that was then put into operation has not had time to get a fair trial.  If, every few months, it is found necessary to reorganise any institution, it is a sign of too hurried reorganisation on the last occasion, or changes in policy which were not contemplated, perhaps sudden changes in policy or faulty personnel.  Surely it will be admitted that it is an undesirable thing, speaking generally, to reorganise any institution too frequently. If it is said now that when the necessity arises reorganisation should be accomplished we will admit that, but tell <Col N="1982" /> us then what is the necessity.  I think we ought to be acquainted with what it is that has made this reorganisation necessary.  Obviously if reorganisation has to take place too often there is a necessary failure to do the work properly under the last reorganisation scheme.  I think it is a definite sign of weakness in the administration of the Defence Forces if reorganisation has to take place too frequently.</P>
      <P>As to the point about the deputation to America, I do not think it has been said whether it is a deputation in respect of the Air Force only or not.  Do I understand it is not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>It has nothing to do with the Air Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the newspaper announcements was to the effect that officers of the Air Force were to attempt to fly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The officers who are going to attempt to fly are not going for the purpose of learning how to conduct an army school; they are going for adventure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope they will come back too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister, if these officers are valuable, that unless he sees a real purpose in the attempt to fly to America he should not allow it to be done.  It should be left to those who have longer experience of flying and who have more officers to spare for that kind of expedition.  I had a notion that this was part of the scheme for sending delegations to America for training purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not want to lose them all at once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Then this is another delegation.  The Minister has not much faith in the projects of his Department, and he does not seem to know quite what the purpose is of this delegation to America, or what it is they are going to endeavour to learn.  Apparently it is only at the suggestion stage, when no inquiries have yet been made of <Col N="1983" /> America as to whether they would be received, whether they would be trained and in what they will be trained.  Surely the Minister can give us some more information than he has given.  To say that he is not quite sure what they are going to learn, or what they are going to attempt to learn, is not enough, and the Dáil has a right, I think, to ask from the Minister for Defence some more information.  Let us understand what they are going to risk these men for, especially if the Minister thinks they will not come back.  They may prove themselves to be potential generals for the American Army.  He had better not risk that visit if he is afraid they may not come back.  I would press the Minister to give us some more information as to this project, what it is they are really going to seek, what particular class of training? Is it air training?  Is it military training? Is it chemical warfare training? I know, as a matter of fact, that the Americans are specialising in the use of noxious gases.  Is that the Department the Minister has in mind when he is sending these soldiers to America?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended to ask the Minister the same question, because it does not seem clear what purpose these officers are going for, or what particular class of officers are going to be sent.  If the Minister is sending officers over to America to get information as to the working of the Air Force there, it is only natural that he should send experienced flying officers, who will be able to obtain the required information.  On the other hand, if the Minister is sending over untrained cadets, it would be impossible for these young fellows to acquire any useful information, and the only useful course would be to send them into the schools there and get them trained.  The Minister mentioned Westpoint. If I remember aright a statement in the newspaper, they would not be taken at Westpoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Deputy would not pay so much attention to what he sees in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like if <Col N="1984" /> the Minister would contradict it.  I would like that we should get clearer information as to the type of officer that is to be sent over&mdash;whether he is to be an experienced officer or whether he is to be an inexperienced cadet.  I do not know whether this is the right time to raise a question about general army organisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I already suggested to the Minister that consideration should be given to the question of reorganising the Army on a territorial or militia basis.  I think greater weight has been lent to that suggestion by the agreement with England with regard to the Boundary.  That places us in a different position altogether with regard to the Army, and I think it will be generally acknowledged that the maintenance of a comparatively large standing army in Ireland is inadvisable.  To a certain extent, I think it is really dangerous that an army without traditions, as naturally our Army must be, without the prospect of colonial fighting and without the prospect, as I hope, of home fighting, should be maintained.  It will be difficult to keep that an efficient and effective army; it will be liable to get embroiled in political questions or to take too great an interest in political questions.  We might, I think, have an assurance from the Minister that consideration is being given to the question of complete reorganisation of the Army, with a view to very considerable reduction in the present personnel and consequential reduction in the expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Heffernan is very anxious to get back to the militia stage in this country.  I can assure him that if we send officers to America, we are not going to send cadets or inexperienced men.  We will send some of the best officers we have in the Army, men who will be able to absorb any education they get or any instruction offered.  I do not purpose, at the present time, going into the question as to what form the Army will take in the future.  As far as I am personally concerned, <Col N="1985" /> I do favour the keeping of a standing Army, properly equipped and properly trained, in this country.  If the Dáil, or the Government, think otherwise, it will be a matter for determination in the future, and it will come up when the permanent Army Act is introduced to the House.</P>
      <P>So far as the question raised by Deputy Johnson is concerned regarding the aerial voyages to America, that has not had my serious consideration.  It has come under my notice, but I have not considered it yet, and the rumours that appear in the Press day after day as to certain officers and certain machines flying to America are not correct.  The matter is just as much in the air as the aeroplanes are in the air. That question does not come under review at the present time.  Somebody started that hare, and it will take some time to run it to earth.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde wanted to know what class of training these officers are to get.  The training they are to get is the training which is necessary in order that an army may function properly. Nobody can expect the young men in this country&mdash;who have no army experience except the experience they gained in our own Army during the last couple of years&mdash;to be in a position to train a modern army and keep it up-to-date.  I think the experience of all countries&mdash;at least of all countries with new armies&mdash;is that they must seek information from older States on this question of military organisation. That is exactly what we are doing.  Any time or money we spend in getting the necessary information and in getting our officers properly trained, will be well spent money if we retain an army.  If we are to have an army, my intention is that it shall be equipped and trained as well as our moderate resources will permit.</P>

      <P>I cannot say whether they will attend more than one college <Col N="1986" /> in America.  The arrangements have not been completed with the American Government.  As a matter of fact, we have not yet had any official correspondence with the American Government on the subject.  That is a matter that will have to be arranged before these men go out.  If the American Government raise any objection about taking our officers or about giving them the facilities they will require, they will not be sent.  But no official communication has taken place between this Government and the American Government.</P>

      <P>The Minister's answer rather upsets things.  We have had the definite statement in the Press confirmed by the Minister, that this visit is contemplated.  But the Minister says there has been no communication from the Government here to the Government in America with regard to the visit.  Is the whole suggestion informal and unauthorised?  Surely, a matter of that kind is serious enough to warrant communication from the officials of one country to the officials of another before public announcements are made.</P>

      <P>My Department is not responsible, nor am I responsible, for the public announcements.  If announcements of a semi-official character appear in the newspapers, I do not think any Department of Government can be held responsible for them.  I did not give any authority, nor did my Department give authority, to any person to publish the fact that this visit was contemplated, and no official correspondence between this Government and the American Government has taken place.  There were certain informal conversations by people in America with officers of the <Col N="1987" /> American Army, as to whether facilities might be granted to our officers, but the matter has not gone beyond that.  Since the question is not settled, I cannot be responsible for what appears in the Press regarding it.</P>

    <P>This resolution was promised in reply to a question set down by Deputy Cooper on the 18th of last month. That reply was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I understand the facts to be as stated in the question, but the latest information available would suggest that the establishment of a Food Council does not entirely solve the problem of reductions in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The Executive Council is, however, prepared to move a Resolution in each House of the Oireachtas to the effect that it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into a matter of urgent public importance, namely, the cost of certain articles of general consumption.</P>
    <P>Should that resolution be adopted by the Dáil and Seanad, it would then be possible to establish a tribunal under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, and to confer on it powers to summon witnesses and to examine them on oath and to require the production of documents.</P>
    <P>The setting down of this motion to-day is in fulfilment of the promise given in that answer.  I am not going to stress here the urgency of this matter.  On the same day on which Deputy Cooper put that question, the matter was raised again on the adjournment, in order to get fuller information. I rather indicated the point of view then, that not a great deal in the way of results could be solidly and immediately hoped for from the establishment of this committee. I do not want to say anything more than that.  I think the committee should be given the fullest possible powers we can give them under this Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act to ensure that they get the fullest information. I believe they can get information, but that the securing of that information will lead to the other desired result&mdash;a lowering of prices&mdash;is a matter about which I cannot prophesy. I have been particular to introduce into the resolution this phrase, &ldquo;practical methods of effecting reductions therein,&rdquo; because I do not want the result to be that the committee would be got together, a certain number of witnesses <Col N="1989" /> heard, a certain amount of evidence sifted, and after that that there should be simply a certain state of facts revealed with regard to a particular commodity or a series of commodities. That evidence might disclose profiteering. It might disappoint those in favour of this Committee and those who hope for immediate results from it by not disclosing profiteering.  It might disclose, as I said before, a peculiar system of distribution in the country, which is economically unsound, but the changing of which would be a matter of years.  Even if it did disclose profiteering, it might emerge that there is no practical way of dealing with profiteering at a single blow or even over a period.  The House, however, will be in the possession of certain information, once this Committee has heard evidence, and once it has recorded its view on the evidence put before it, but I think it is necessary that the tribunal should be asked to give their view as to practical methods of effecting reductions in whatever subjects they may bring within the scope of their inquiry.</P>
    <P>I think that that is the answer.  I insist on it that that should be there, for if it is not the result will simply be that the Government, or this House, will be handed a certain amount of information and the natural result will be that people will look for an immediate reduction in prices.  I foresee two difficulties in regard to this Committee, but I do not want to emphasise them.  They might, in some slight way, prejudice the work of the Committee, and I think it should be given every possible chance.  The Tribunal of Evidence Inquiry Act, which I have here, was taken over under the general legislation, and it is the only Act applicable to this type of inquiry in this country at present.  It gives the fullest power to summon on oath and have documents and other material produced, and it allows for sittings in camera and in public.  It is the only possible means of getting evidence with regard to matters of this sort and of collecting information.  I have no doubt it can get all the information that can be extracted from people supposed to be in <Col N="1990" /> a position to give information.  It is about the second part of the work of the tribunal that I have doubts&mdash;can the tribunal suggest practical methods of effecting reductions even when it has got the information?  The resolution has been framed generally to inquire into the retail prices of articles of general consumption.  There may be some objection to that.  People may argue that it would be better to set down one item and ask for an inquiry into that, or to choose one or two items and so limit the work of the Committee. I think it better that the Committee should have before it whatever discussion may ensue here, and have the advantage of the points of view expressed by the Seanad and Dáil, as to what the inquiry should be directed, but it would, in my opinion, be unwise to limit the Committee to one or two items.  If later it seems to the Dáil and Seanad that the tribunal is setting out in the wrong direction, it would be open to me to bring in a further resolution calling the attention of the Committee specifically to certain matters, but in the beginning I think it would be better to allow the tribunal to be set up and to have it understand what is the task before it.</P>
    <P>The tribunal may have to call evidence under this Tribunal of Evidence Inquiry Act to see what is the most important matter which requires immediate attention.  Having power to call evidence for that purpose, the tribunal will be in a better position to judge what article of general consumption calls for attack first.  I suggest that it would be better to leave it to the tribunal to set out these articles in an order, having determined the matter after hearing evidence.  If it is later seen that is wrong, we could amend this and direct attention to certain articles.  The question of the personnel of the tribunal is not a matter with which I can deal at present.  It is impossible to ask people to serve on the tribunal until it is sure to be set up.  It should not be difficult to get it set up, with the exception of the chairman, and that is a matter over which there will be difficulty.  The tribunal operates under a technical Act and I think it is almost essential that <Col N="1991" /> the chairman should be a lawyer.  There will be, I think, a certain amount of difficulty in getting a lawyer to give his services as chairman of the Committee, but it should not be insuperable. I move the motion.</P>

      <P>There were moments when I thought that the Minister had come to bury the motion rather than to praise it.  I agree, however, that it is wise not to raise false hopes.  Although the work of this proposed tribunal may be important and valuable, it probably will not bring about an immediate reduction in the prices of essential articles.  It is, I think, a move in the right direction. It is a step to recognise the magnitude of the problem, and I am glad to see that we have at last admitted the urgency of the problem of food prices. High prices for food and articles of general consumption are at the bottom of half the discontent and trouble in this country, and at the bottom of half the injury to business enterprise.  The Tribunal of Evidence of Inquiry Act refers to the instrument by which the tribunal is appointed.  I take it that this resolution is not the instrument and, perhaps, the Minister could indicate whether the instrument will be a further resolution or order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain things have to be specified in the instrument. As regards the scope of the inquiry, I have referred to the procedure at the British inquiry and I find that on the whole the words used in connection with that inquiry have been followed closely.  There is, however, an important omission.  In this resolution we have mention of retail prices of articles of general consumption, whereas the British wording referred to the conditions prevailing in the wholesale and retail trades of articles of food and general consumption.  Ours is wider and at the same time, narrower. It is wider inasmuch as it is not confined to food or clothing but it can consider food, clothing, newspapers, and so forth.  I do not know <Col N="1992" /> that you can satisfactorily inquire into retail prices without inquiring also into wholesale prices.  I would not be surprised if a retailer came before the tribunal and said: &ldquo;I got this article at so much from a wholesaler and my profit is so and so.&rdquo; I should like the Minister to consider whether the inclusion of the word &ldquo;wholesale&rdquo; is not necessary.  Perhaps he could deal with it later by a resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not implied in the last three lines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that we can proceed by implication in this matter.  A person called in evidence might refuse to answer questions with regard to a wholesale business and might be justified in doing so because the word &ldquo;wholesale&rdquo; is not mentioned in the resolution.  The Minister is also a lawyer, and if he is satisfied that that word is not essential I, too, will be satisfied.  As regards the general scope of the inquiry the Minister may be right in saying that it is better not to be too specific, not to indicate exactly what articles are to be inquired into.  There again I feel that a person who is called and who does not want to give evidence will say: &ldquo;Mine are not articles of general consumption. I am a butcher and there are a number of vegetarians in the world.&rdquo; Liquor prices may be engaging attention and the person called may say: &ldquo;There are many men occupying eminent positions who are teetotalers, therefore these are not articles of general consumption.&rdquo; I hope the Minister is satisfied with that.  The inquiry must begin with certain specific things.  If it is to be a roving inquiry which one day talks about bread, the next about boots, and the day after about vegetables, it will not get anywhere. It is better to follow the example of the British inquiry and concentrate on two or three things.  The two things to concentrate on would, in my opinion, be the prices of bread and meat, as in regard to them we have the investigations of the British tribunal. Bread and meat are world-wide commodities. Bread comes from all over the world, and meat is obtained so far away as New Zealand and the Argentine. <Col N="1993" /> The fact that inquiry into them has been made by economists in Great Britain is bound to be of great assistance to us.  We could also get information with regard to them from our Government Departments.  The Army run an abattoir at the Curragh, not on a profit-making basis, and we ought to be able to get from them a fair price as to killing of meat, and you could add to that a reasonable amount for distribution and overhead charges.  We ought to be able to compare the cost of a loaf in the Army with the cost of a loaf produced by an individual.  There are two other points to which I hope investigation will be directed as soon as the Committee is set up.  These are the prices of vegetables and milk. There you have producers and consumers, and the middleman's profit would want to be carefully investigated. As to the composition of the Committee, I agree with the Minister that it would be obviously impossible to announce the names at this stage.  I suggest, however, that one member ought to be a chartered accountant, or someone accustomed to dealing with figures, because the tribunal will almost necessarily have to examine long balance-sheets, and unless a man has a facility in dealing with figures he will likely miss the true point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There ought also be either one or two Labour representatives, and I think there should most certainly be a woman, if possible an ordinary housewife living in Dublin, Cork or Waterford, who goes out and buys her food and who knows the prices in shops. If the Minister tells me that he does not know where to find such a woman, I can tell him that he will find a very good one on the benches of his own party.  The Minister said that there is no certain way of dealing with profiteering. He is quite right.  There is no patent medicine in this matter, but there is one great enemy of profiteering, and that is publicity, which is the anti-toxin with which the body politic can be inoculated to crush profiteering. I am not making wholesale charges against profiteers.  I have no doubt that many charges could bear inquiry and that very often the trader will be in a position to say that he has only <Col N="1994" /> taken an ordinary commercial profit, but there are men who seek to turn national calamities and shortages to the advantage of their own pocket.</P>
    <P>In October, 1846, in the middle of the great famine, the then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, writing to the British Prime Minister, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have no fear of carrying this into effect if the price of provisions does not thwart me, but the increasing price and the avarice of merchants in hoarding their corn gives me greater uneasiness.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That has happened in the past, and may happen again.  I believe the best protection against it is publicity and the knowledge that the State does not recognise the right to make an unlimited profit at the cost of the poorest in the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of this tribunal.  I am not sure if the Minister stated that the tribunal was to have powers to compel witnesses to come forward and give information, and to compel the production of accounts and books, because as far as I remember in connection with the previous tribunal on prices it found itself up against the problem that it was not able to force witnesses to come before it and give definite information with regard to their business, and to produce balance sheets and statements of accounts.  I agree with Deputy Major Bryan Cooper that the main advantage of this tribunal will be the publicity it will give to the question.  I do not hope for any immediate results from it.  I think they will be slow, but there will be results in the end.  The sittings of this tribunal will be published in the papers, and people will read and talk about it. If there are any flagrant cases of profiteering disclosed in the matter people connected with that class of business will be influenced to take action about reducing prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In modern times there has been a considerable increase in the numbers of the community engaged in the distributing trade, and the question as to whether the difference in the prices paid to the producer and the retail prices is used up in the form of profiteering <Col N="1995" /> or used up by the excessive number of distributors, is a problem that is growing in other countries.  In France the number of distributors has increased altogether out of proportion to the number of people engaged in the productive trades and professions. Personally I am inclined to think there is profiteering in certain directions. Evidence available to the ordinary man in the street points in that direction. We in the farming community are probably affected by that to a greater extent than others, for we are producers of the raw material.  We sell in the wholesale market, and are obliged to buy in the dearest retail market, that is the smaller retail shops in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Existing conditions force us into that position.  There may be remedies, but they are not easily available, and it is difficult to get farmers to avail of these remedies as freely as they might.  The conditions, however, exist, and I believe the tribunal may have some effect in remedying them.  I want to know from the Minister if it will be possible for the tribunal to get information from the Income Tax Department?  I quite understand it will be out of the question to expect that the private affairs of an individual should be exhibited in the tribunal, but I see no reason why selected cases should not be placed before it&mdash;cases which are common to the different classes of traders or distributors&mdash;and why accounts without the names of the people concerned should not be placed before it.  This will give the tribunal a chance of knowing the extent of the profits obtained from the particular businesses concerned.  On the whole I feel this tribunal will have some effect, perhaps not a great effect, but it is a step in the right direction.  I agree that the best effect will result from the publicity.  I think at this stage an appeal should be made to the people directly concerned, the people who are complaining about prices, that they <Col N="1996" /> should come forward freely and give information.  The difficulty that arose in connection with the last Commission on prices was the reluctance of people to give information, and in many places where the tribunal sat it was found impossible to get people to give information with regard to complaints made.  Deputy Major Bryan Cooper suggested that on this tribunal there should be representatives of labour and of the housekeeping class.  I would suggest to the Minister that the farmers should also be represented.  I think if anything they are more intimately concerned in this problem than even labour.  I believe it would be quite wrong to establish a tribunal of this sort in which the farming community would not have adequate representation.</P>

      <P>I am not very confident as to the result of an inquiry of the kind it is proposed to establish under this Resolution.  We are informed that it is a definite matter of urgent public importance.  I do not know what has happened to make it urgent to-day when it was not urgent six or twelve months or two years ago, and as to the definiteness, an inquiry is to be held into the &ldquo;retail prices of articles of general consumption and practical methods of effecting reductions therein with special regard to the difference between the prices received by producers and the prices paid by consumers.&rdquo; If that is &ldquo;definite&rdquo; I do not know what &ldquo;general&rdquo; is, because I can see within that resolution the likelihood of a very long and very widely spread inquiry into articles of general consumption, including the bread, meat, vegetables and milk.  If it includes that, and also the immense variety of commodities that are imported, such as tinned foods, clothing, boots, blankets, bed covering, furniture, and the hundred and one articles that enter into the consumption of every household, the inquiry will last interminably.  They are all articles of general consumption, unless we accept Deputy Cooper's view that only an article that is consumed by everybody without exception is an article of general consumption.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the difference between the prices received by the producers and the prices paid by consumers, these articles I have mentioned are in the main produced outside this country, and I think we would find it difficult to get a Commission to report with any speed if they are to inquire into the difference between the prices received by producers and the prices paid by consumers here. Surely we are not to consider the price paid for tea in India and China, the price paid in the Argentine to the producers of maize, or that paid to the producers of the bacon that comes from Canada?  I take it that what is intended is the price paid to the producers of commodities in Ireland, and the price paid by consumers of these particular classes of commodities.  As the motion is drawn it is so very wide and indefinite that the inquiry is going to be a very long one.  As to the question of a permanent tribunal, I am inclined to the view that a small tribunal, or a small official committee, having for its purpose the collection of data respecting the prices paid to producers in this country, or by importers, and the prices charged by retailers&mdash;a permanent body sitting with powers to collect data and publish periodically and regularly, or as they think it necessary, all the information that is available is more likely to be of permanent value than this proposed tribunal.</P>
      <P>I am very glad that the word profiteering has not been introduced.  I have not yet had from anybody a satisfactory definition of the term.  It is used very loosely, and as though it were a well understood term.  Without a very definite meaning being attached to the word people are apt to be very much confused.  I agree that publication of the facts would probably have as useful an influence as anything else in the present state of public thought. I will not suggest here, though it might be suggested to the tribunal if it is set up, that a public market with a definite fixed rate of profit for certain classes of commodities might be established in every town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1998" /> That might be one way of securing at least the maximum advantage, but even that in the present stage, with public opinion in the country towns the way it is, when commodities are sold by shopkeepers at ten and twenty per cent. higher than the same goods can be purchased near by, because the brother, sister, cousin, or aunt of the purchaser is the keeper of the shop&mdash; that is a factor that weighs very greatly in the matter of prices.  We had, a little while ago, a statement made by a Deputy here regarding the price of bread.  I had a communication from the Cork Co-operative Society, in which they say that their price for bread in Cork is 9d. per pair, while the allegation of the Deputy was that the price in general was 11d. The co-operative bread sold at 9d. in Cork is produced under trade union conditions, with trade union wages paid, and with 75 per cent. of the flour guaranteed to be milled in Ireland, but nevertheless a price for bread considerably higher than that rules even in Cork.  Now, I suppose, to use a common word, it is the psychological factor that has to be dealt with.  Publicity, probably, is the best method that can be used unless we are prepared to use the powers of the State, of public institutions and of public bodies for the purpose of putting forward in every locality a public market or a public store.  I am afraid public opinion is not prepared for that.  My only suggestion is that the resolution itself should be restricted rather than amplified, that it should confine itself to a series of named articles, and that it should be a small tribunal, permanent or with continuous existence, making periodical reports upon its work.  The factor that I think Deputy Heffernan hinted at of finance and currency will also, I have no doubt, come within the scope of an inquiry of this kind, unless the Chairman is prepared to rule very strictly that only the ordinary factors of wages, expenses and profits are allowed to be the subject of the inquiry.  In general, I feel that the motion opens too wide an inquiry to have any assurance of an early and effective report.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to be able to support this motion.  I am not in the least surprised that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is quite confident as to the results that will be achieved.  As one who has had some experience in this matter, I agree with him that there are two things that must be taken into consideration. One is the old-fashioned method of distribution that costs so much, and the other is that there are far too many people distributing articles in proportion to the number of people producing them.  Any Commission that is set up will find itself up against these two important factors. As regards the resolution itself, I think it is far too indefinite.  Like Deputy Johnson, I would like to see something more fixed in it.  It seems to me that when the tribunal is set up it will have to set itself to the task of drawing up a list of the articles that are going to be inquired into.  When one considers the word consumption here, one is rather at a loss to know whether it means consumption as food or consumption in the use of clothing and boots.  When I looked at the resolution at first, I was under the impression that possibly nothing but food stuffs were to be inquired into.  Someone suggested that it may be necessary to go outside the word &ldquo;consumption&rdquo; as understood in the resolution, and to include articles of clothing.  Deputy Cooper suggested that one might regard the ordinary bottle of stout as an article of consumption.  Deputy Johnson has now raised another point about articles manufactured elsewhere and brought in here, and as to how we can get any definite information with regard to the prices charged for tea, sugar and other articles brought into this country.  It will be very hard, I think, to get definite information as to what is the cost of the production of these articles so that a comparison might be made as to the retail prices charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another very important item that, no doubt, will be brought before the Commission.  That is the great difference in price for the same articles sold in houses side by side.  That is brought to one's notice practically <Col N="2000" /> every day.  In one house you see an article labelled to be sold at 2/3, and in the next house you see the same article of the same quality and in the same state of preservation labelled to be sold at 2/6.  That is a thing that will have to be inquired into.  At the moment I have no intention of going into this matter of prices or into anything that would in any way interfere with the work of the Commission.  I do know that the work of the Commission is not going to be easy.  I know, too, that when the members of the Commission are finished with their work they will feel very dissatisfied as to the results of it.  I suggest that what the Minister has stated is of the greatest possible importance, that there is no use in the members of the Commission simply putting down their findings about things.  They will have to suggest some way of carrying out improvements that will be of practical use.</P>
    <P>As I said before, the old method of distribution is intolerable.  One is surprised at the enormous amount of money that is spent in the distribution of important articles such as milk and bread.  Unless the members of the Commission set themselves to find some practical methods by which this large expenditure can be overcome they can scarcely hope to have done any good. At all events I am sure every Deputy in the House will support this resolution. It may be somewhat indefinite. One would prefer to have it much more definite in its terminology so that the Commission may not start on a wild-goose chase after a hopeless set of articles for consumption, and waste not only months but years in getting them.</P>

      <P>I do not think this motion is going to do a great deal of good.  This Commission, if set up, is going to be like a great many others set up by the Government.  For example, it will be like the Old Age Pension Commission; nothing will come of it.  Like every other Commission set up by the Dáil, the findings of this Commission, when they are arrived at, after perhaps twelve months' investigation, will all end in a bottle of smoke. The workers of Ireland will get no advantage from it.  The Government have the opportunity now, if they <Col N="2001" /> would but avail of it, of introducing proper legislation to regulate food prices.  Let them pass legislation by which Committees could be set up, in each town, to compel the traders who, in their opinion, are profiteers, to exhibit their prices and also their cost of production.</P>

      <P>Overcharging.  The cost of living, as we know, is higher in the Saorstát than in that portion of Ireland with which we were so anxious to come to agreement a few days ago.  The cost of living in the Saorstát is also higher than in the sister nation as we now call it.  During the time of the war, when the British Government were here, they did regulate food prices, and if the Minister is serious, and no doubt he is, in trying to have the cost of living reduced, he will form Committees, such as I have suggested, in the different towns to deal with the matter.  If he sets up this Commission it may last for two years and prices will continue the same.  I think the least he should do is to have the workers and the general citizens safeguarded against paying exorbitant prices, and I think they should demand the right to have representation upon this tribunal.  I think that is absolutely necessary.  The farmer is a man who produces the greater portion of our food supplies, and he gets the smallest prices in return.  The middleman, who purchases from him, can charge 50 or 60 per cent. over and above what the farmer charges.  The result is that the farmer cannot pay his wages&mdash;at least he says he cannot.  He has no market but the middleman, and when the article he sells reaches the consumer it has reached a figure several prices above what the farmer got for it.  I think the farmers should have representation upon any Commission set up to deal with food prices, but I hold that it is only on the threat of having such a tribunal in existence that the Government are going to work, and, consequently, there may not be as much profiteering by the middleman while it is in existence.  However, I welcome the measure as it is.</P>

      <P>I desire to say a <Col N="2002" /> few words.  I think this is a very important matter, probably one of the most important that this House could deal with.  There are, undoubtedly, too many people in this country engaged in distribution, and while, in some cases, the profits made may not be very great, still when there are so many people engaged in distribution it makes it absolutely necessary that each person so engaged must get a living out of the sale of these commodities.  I think the Minister, or the committee that he sets up, would do well to bear in mind what Deputy Cooper said, and they would be well advised to take bread and meat, and try to deal with these two items at the beginning.  It seems to me to be nothing short of a scandal the way the price of the four-pound loaf varies in this country.  It varies from ninepence to a shilling and one-and-twopence.  The position is that in most of the smaller towns in the country the lowest price charged for the four-pound loaf is one shilling, while it is retailed in some of the larger towns as low as ninepence.  It is retailed by the Cork Co-operative Society at ninepence, and ninety per cent. of the flour they use, not seventy-five per cent., as Deputy Johnson stated, is milled in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be advisable that this committee should be a small committee, and that, if possible, it should sit continuously, and make periodic reports to the Minister.  But there is very little use in the committee sitting, and hearing evidence, and making reports unless the Minister is prepared to act upon them, and to come to the House and seek whatever powers are necessary to give effect to the recommendations of the committee.  If this resolution only means that a commission will be set up, and that evidence will be taken from certain people about the prices of commodities, and that a certain amount of publicity will be given, and that this is to be the end of it, there is no use bringing it into existence at all.  I should say, in regard to the points made by Deputy Lyons, when he mentioned the Old Age Pensions Committee, that I was a member of that committee, and I think it is only fair to the Minister for Finance <Col N="2003" /> to say that the Commission only very recently submitted their report to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>The resolution before the House was proposed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and, may I say at the outset, that I do not think the Minister's heart was in his job.  In fact, I think the Minister wanted to know why on earth he was asked to bring forward such a resolution as this, and he answered by saying Deputy Cooper had inaugurated a discussion upon this subject which necessitated his formulating this resolution. The resolution means a lot, and it means nothing.  It is what you would call a profound resolution, and the discussion that has followed, on the rather brief introduction of this measure, has been very much on a par with the Boundary discussion, because I think we leave off pretty much where we started.  It has been said that there are a great many things wrong, but there has been no indication whatsoever of how they are to be put right.  I think Deputy Johnson, in his wisdom, is also very sceptical about this, and I think the Labour Party, as a whole, may be sceptical, because the reference to the Commission is so wide that it may bring in the question of wages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think he would.  I think he has his hands full of that already.  The man in the street is represented by some Deputies as of a kind that makes vague accusations that everyone is doing him in the eye, while he is doing nobody in the eye.  He is the unfortunate victim of the machinations of vulturous traders, and everybody else.  Deputy Sir James Craig did not, I think, refer specifically to <Col N="2004" /> the Commission on which he and I sat. It was connected with prices.  We started with great enthusiasm.  The public were demanding reductions and complaining that they were being overcharged and treated scandalously by the traders.  We were to put that right. We spent an immense amount of time in dealing with the matter, but the public did not even as much as come to hear the evidence that was given before us.  On that Commission were representatives of the housekeepers and of Labour.  I think it was a fine Commission. If any Deputy wants to see what a Commission of the sort is going to produce, I would venture to suggest that he should get the verbatim report of the proceedings, which must have cost the country a great deal.  I would ask him to read it, and, having read it, I would ask him was he any wiser.  The selling price of an article is largely governed by what you pay for it, but what you pay for it may be the result of various ingredients from different sources.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that people's books should be produced for examination by the Commission without, I think, any understanding of what that means.  Even the income tax authorities do not allow an examination of a firm's books.  This Commission is going to go further than the inquisition that is allowed to the Income Tax Commissioners in the matter of examining people's books and private affairs.  I tell you straight that there will be very considerable resistance to any such thing, and resistance which, I think, will be justified.  Even the information which the Income Tax Commissioners get is under an oath of secrecy.  If you are going to say that a commission is going to have liberty to disclose all the details of a man's business it may ruin that man so far as his competitors are concerned, and may involve the disclosing of trade secrets. If the Dáil visualises what they are going to do, or what they are going to require to be done, I think they will have to undertake very great responsibility if they permit such to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that there are too many distributors.  I think we have been told that there are too many public-houses. <Col N="2005" /> Probably both statements are quite right.  When the Commission has sat for months and months and got all the information they can get, what is the solution for the too many shops going to be?  Are you going to compel the closing down of shops?  As regards the regulation of prices, are you going to form organisations of trades which will be compelled to pay on the one side and receive on the other?  Are you going, as a Dáil, to regulate interest on capital, working expenses and the hundred and one etceteras that go to make up a profit and loss account?  Are you going to take any particular trade and say that what happens at the present time is that one trader is making vastly different profits from another man in the same trade, and that the man who is making the higher profits is doing something wrong?  Are you going to assume that?  Are you going to analyse the books of every person in that trade?  Even if you come to the conclusion that a trade is charging more than it should for a particular article, what are you going to do? Really, a roving commission like that is not going to do any good, and it is going to do a great deal of harm.  It is only people who do not think of what they are saying who talk about profiteering.</P>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan, who supported the resolution, talked about the farmers.  The farmer is an innocent man! He sells his commodities in the cheapest markets, and he buys everything he gets in the dearest.  If that is so, it is no wonder that the farmers tell us here that they are not making any money, and that farming is an unprofitable occupation.  It is unusual in any trade to act on those lines.  After all, in trade a person's profit is, I think, largely due to his minding his business, buying in the cheapest market and selling in the dearest market.  The farmer is not really so innocent as he would lead us to believe.  We have heard the farmers holding up their stuff as well as other people, of cornering the market, in order to get a better price.  If you go down to the oats market at the present moment you will find that the price of oats has jumped up from a very moderate price to a <Col N="2006" /> high price.  There is nothing wrong in the farmer trying to get the best price he can, or the buyer trying to buy at the lowest price he can. The two points of view have to come together sooner or later, but they never come together until one or other of them gives way on some point, or until the purchaser needs to buy, or the seller needs to sell.  It is only bunkum to say that prices can be regulated by any Commission.  Prices are much more far-reaching than that. During the late war millions of money were spent on controlling the selling prices of everything under the sun. An organisation was set up which was the completest thing in the way of organisations for controlling prices, I suppose, that the world has ever seen. What was the result?</P>

      <P>Well, it was not very satisfactory for anyone.  If the advocates of this motion want to carry things to the logical conclusion they will come to a system of control similar to that of the Great War, and I hope the people will like it when they get it. I am not opposing this motion.  Not at all! I am trying to say that it is foolishness, foolishness in its waste of time.  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce will have some difficulty in getting a chairman; possibly he may get one.  There are so many people who seem to be badly off for something to do that perhaps a man can be found to spend the rest of his life in a chair.  We saw the result of a campaign of publicity in connection with the Commission in London.  They made the great discovery that the bakers were charging too much, and they stampeded them into reducing their prices.  A few days afterwards the price of corn went up, and the price of bread went up again, and, as far as one can see, the beneficial result did not last very long.  I do not think it was likely to last very long.  Perhaps the public were satisfied.  The Commission having done that, created a certain amount of confusion.  Perhaps the public will be satisfied when <Col N="2007" /> you set up a broadcasting inquiry into the ramifications of business prices and everything else.</P>

      <P>It is quite evident that the Deputy who has just spoken in connection with this Commission has something to be afraid of, when he is prepared to throw cold water on the Commission.  Everybody knows that there is profiteering going on.  The Deputy has accused farmers of profiteering. I ask him are there any greater producers in the country than the farmers, and has any other section of the community less to say as regards the price of the articles they produce than the farmer?  As regards the holding up of produce, the farmer cannot afford to do it.  He has no place to <Col N="2008" /> keep it, and he has to meet his annuities and to pay his rent.  It is well known that at the present time a great amount of annuities is due.  Is it to be suggested that the farmers are holding up their crops in order to get higher prices and that they allow their annuities and rents to accumulate until the sheriff comes along.  I think that that is a false statement to make in connection with the farming community.  It is well known that the farmers are the people who produce most and gain the least by it.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the motion made by the Minister for the formation of this tribunal.  I am not at all as pessimistic as many of the speakers who debated the question who held that it is not going to do any good. A great many Deputies have spoken about the Commissions that have already sat, and held that they did little good.  To my mind, there is scarcely any commission that sat since the initiation of this Government that did not do a vast amount of good.  I think that this tribunal that it is now proposed to set up is badly wanted at the present moment.  I think Deputy Johnson said its urgency is not great, if it was not urgent some time ago.  I think it is better to right wrongs late than never.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DOYLE Mr. DOYLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The longer it is delayed the more urgent it becomes.  The articles that Deputy Cooper mentioned as those that should have first consideration are the proper articles.  They are the food of every man and woman daily, and they require to be looked into to see if the price from the producer to the consumer does not allow a very wide margin of profit.  We know, to our cost, that, in the case of agricultural products, a profit of 300 per cent. is added before they reach <Col N="2009" /> the consumer.  I think that is a matter that requires inquiry by a tribunal such as this.  Even if it only gave publicity to the matter, it would do some good. Some advantage would be gained even if the Minister never followed the inquiry up by legislation.  Deputy Hewat complains about farmers coming here and complaining that they cannot make things pay, and he says that they are selling in the worst markets and buying in the dearest.  I do not think any farmer does that of his own choice.  It is necessary for a great many farmers to sell their commodities in the local markets.  Transit to a larger or more distant market is so costly that it is out of the question.  It is up to the farmer to sell in the best local market he can secure.  I am sure that Deputy Hewat, from the experience of farming which he had some little time ago, can plainly see that farmers are not making a fortune.  I should say that he was rather glad to get rid of his farm.  I am quite sure that this tribunal set up by the Minister&mdash;I am quite sure he would not take it in hands except he was prepared to carry it out, as he carries out every other matter he takes in hands&mdash;will do good to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the setting up of this tribunal by the Minister, because although we may not expect a new heaven and a new earth as the result of the motion, good will, nevertheless, accrue from it.  Although prices were limited to some extent during the Great War, that did not stop profiteering.  However, publicity is everything in matters of this sort, and I think the mere fact that this tribunal is in being will have a great effect on people who are inclined to be extortionate in their charges and, in some cases, to take advantage of poverty.  I think Deputy Cooper said it was desirable to start with the most important articles of food&mdash;bread and meat.  I agree with that, but I would add tea to the list.  Although there is no duty on tea, there is no doubt that in certain country districts there is great profiteering going on in that commodity.  In fact, country people are ignorant of the fact that the duty has been taken off. They have an idea that there is some duty on it still, and advantage is taken <Col N="2010" /> of their ignorance.  Where tea is bought in small quantities, great hardship is done to people who have very little money to spend.  I have not the slightest doubt that there is frightful profiteering in bread.  Anybody who is fortunate enough to be able to have bread baked in his own house knows that he saves tremendously.  It is clear that there must be considerable profiteering in the sale of bread.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience is as I have stated, and I have had bread baked in my house for over 30 years. As regards meat, it has always been the prevalent idea that, whatever the cost of cattle, the retail price is always high and, in the opinion of many people, too high.  It will be for the tribunal to go into these matters, and the result should be of advantage.  I do not think you could expect traders to disclose all their accounts.  I do not think we have any right to go into their private affairs, but I think we have a right to expect that the prices of all articles should be properly exhibited in the shops, so that when people go in they will know exactly what the price of each article is.  It should be the law that in every shop the chief articles of food should have the prices marked in plain figures.  It is most important that the tribunal should consist of competent people and that the number should be small.  It is very important that the chairman <Col N="2011" /> should be impartial and competent.  I think a tribunal of this kind ought to be the beginning of a permanent institution. Even the knowledge that it is going to be appointed will have effects and I look forward, with confidence, to the result of the labours of the tribunal.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hewat went on to say that the man in the street who, he supposed, was represented in this assembly, was for ever grumbling, and thought himself a victim at all times of the unscrupulous trader.  I think it will be generally admitted that the man in the street&mdash;the worker and the person described as &ldquo;middle class,&rdquo; with a fixed income&mdash;are continually grumbling that there is profiteering in this country.  I am not in a position to say absolutely that there is, but if there is anything wanted in this country at the present moment it is contentment.  We want something to remove the discontent that prevails all over the land.  If this Commission were set up, even though it should prove to the public that there is no profiteering and no overcharging, it would have done good work.  Deputy Hewat objects to a tribunal of this kind inquiring into the affairs of the different traders.  But Deputy Hewat never objects when it is a question of going into the amount of the workman's <Col N="2012" /> wages.  Deputy Hewat, I take it, is in favour of the wage that is being paid to the men on the Shannon scheme.  The unfortunate man who is altogether down can take a job, and his affairs are open to the whole country. It is very easy to examine his position.  He has got to buy in a particular market, and Deputy Good objects to the conditions of that market being inquired into.  To put it mildly, I do not think that is &ldquo;playing the game.&rdquo; He talks about the farmers, I do not come here, by any means, as an advocate of the farmers, but I think everybody knows their position to-day. So far as &ldquo;cornering&rdquo; is concerned, in the particular county from which I come many of the farmers, so far from &ldquo;cornering,&rdquo; would be glad to get the price they were offered at the beginning of the season.  He said that, supposing we admitted for a moment that it was &ldquo;cornering,&rdquo; that that is known as good business.  Deputy Good objects to men striking.  He holds up his hands in holy horror if men at any time strike against what they regard as an unfair wage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that any body acting in this manner are striking in another way, and what is good for one section of the community ought not to be bad for the other.  Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Johnson have already pointed out the great variation there is in the price of bread in this country.  Deputy Morrissey reminded Deputy Hewat, when he was speaking, that the price of the loaf in England was 3d. or 4d. cheaper per four pound than it was in this country.  Deputy Good made answer that that was due to the difference in wages between the two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I did not say that that was my opinion.  I said that some people might say that that was the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Hewat's statement was very definite. Certain evidence was tendered recently by employers in the milling trade and the baking trade on this question of <Col N="2013" /> costs.  They established, very definitely and on very clear-cut lines, that from the time the wheat leaves the ship until the bread is delivered at the consumer's house&mdash;that includes unloading, loading, carting, milling and baking&mdash;the whole cost of labour is 34 per cent. of the retail price.  I think Deputy Hewat will agree that that is not an extraordinarily high percentage.  I think he would agree, too, if this whole question of the baking of bread were gone into, that if we could not get down to the London level, we certainly ought not to be as high as we are at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>

      <P>So far as we can find out it is 9d. for a 4lb. loaf.  I have not seen anything to the contrary.  As I said before, I hope that the Committee will have the desired effect.  All over the country to-day there is an opinion that there is profiteering and overcharging. The tendency is for wages to be reduced, and when suggestions come from employers that wages should be reduced, people naturally look for a reduction in the prices of commodities which these employers manufacture. That hope is, however, never realised. Even if this Committee is able to prove that there is no profiteering it will have done something and will lead to what is badly needed in the country&mdash;contentment.</P>

      <P>I welcome this motion. I believe it is time to tackle this question of profiteering.  I do not think that there can be any question as to profiteering.  We know that prices are soaring and that the cost of living is still going up.  I would suggest that one practical method for effecting reductions would be to give the tribunal power to publish any glaring case of profiteering that comes before them, and to have the facts posted up outside the Gárda barracks and Post Offices so that people could see the way in which they are being fleeced.  I think that would be a more effective way to deal with that evil than anything else. In some cases there is a difference of from 4d. to 6d. per lb. in the price of butter in one street.  Surely there must be profiteering there.  What we want to get is a sound public opinion which will put an end to this and give the workers a chance of living.  I think the Minister should give the tribunal power to expose glaring cases of profiteering.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>

      <P>In answer to Deputy Hewat, I may say that I can give him an instance which came to my notice no later than to-day.  I was passing through a market where turkeys were on sale, and I found that the price in the case of one firm was 1/8 a lb., and, for an exactly similar turkey, the price in the case of another firm was 1/4 a lb.  That, I think, is a clear-cut example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Deputy realises the position.  If it <Col N="2015" /> was so plain that there was a difference of 4d. per lb. in the price of similar turkeys, why would &ldquo;mugs&rdquo; pay 1/8 per lb. where they could get the same quality for 1/4?</P>

As to the holding up of farm produce, perhaps Deputy Hewat would practice some of the doctrines which he preaches to farmers and not hold up his supplies of coal.  If he did he would be doing good to the community during this cold weather.  In many cases the better quality of coal is held up in order to sell inferior cargoes at high prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that the debate which was about to ensue on this motion would have given some direction to the tribunal as to the line it might follow, but I am afraid when the tribunal get the report of this debate they will be more mystified than ever.  Deputy Cooper complained that there was no explicit power of inquiring into wholesale prices.  I think, however, that that is contained in the last three lines of the resolution.  A great many other Deputies complained that the resolution is too wide and that it should be limited.  On that point I may say that I thought it was better to draft the resolution widely and let the tribunal then set its own course.  If, as Deputy Johnson seems to imagine, the Committee is going to be a collection of playboys, who will try to see in what way they best can bring the tribunal into ridicule, they might behave in the way he indicates.  The tribunal may come together solemnly and <Col N="2016" /> say that they are given a wide field and the best way to cover it is to take certain articles at haphazard.  I would prefer to leave that to the people on the tribunal, as I do not want to bind them too hard.  They may, perhaps, take one or two articles.  They may have to call evidence to see which article offers the best prospect of reduction in price.  It is open to the Committee under this widely drafted resolution to do that, and it leaves room for them to behave as Deputy Johnson mentioned.  Deputy Johnson refers to the words &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; and &ldquo;definite,&rdquo; and complains that this matter is only now described as urgent.  I am not saying that it was not urgent six months ago.  It might have been quite as urgent six months or a year ago, but people are now suddenly galvanised into believing&mdash;I trust their hopes will be realised&mdash;that the Food Commission set up on the other side is going to achieve good results.  Owing to that fact, a demand was made here which was not made some time ago.  The fact, however, that the matters over which the scope of the Committee will range are many and varied does not take away from the fact that this is urgent and definite, and it will be made more definite by the choice of suitable persons on the Committee.  I am not arguing that people coming together to make this a farce could not play havoc with the whole suggestion, but I do not believe that they are going to act in that way.  I will therefore give them that freedom within which they can properly set their course and bring about some achievement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister has in mind other Commissions with wide terms of reference which found it difficult to bring their inquiry to a satisfactory conclusion because of the extent of the terms of reference and the divergency of views?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that that is a danger, but I am only balancing the freedom as against possible results. If there appears to be difficulty in coming to definite conclusions it will be for the Dáil and Seanad to see that they get more explicit terms of reference. Deputy Cooper urges that we <Col N="2017" /> should, for instance, make mention of wholesale prices, but if you mention wholesale prices distinctly you might have the committee saying that they will inquire first into wholesale prices.  There might then be the difficulty which Deputy Johnson suggests. There might be a range of articles which might be described as articles of general consumption but the producers of which are outside this country, so that the committee could not go further and could not get at the price received by the producers.  They could not get costings of factories abroad, and therefore they must rule out certain articles.  The committee might say in their report that owing to the producers being outside the country they had to start at the point where the article arrived at the quayside.  They might then discover some unconscionable addition to the price after the article arrived.  I have no desire to abide rigidly by the terms of the resolution. If Deputies think it would be better to insert the word &ldquo;wholesale&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;retail&rdquo; let that be done.  I urge that it is not directing attention in the direction we want, especially having regard to the fact that if we want to enquire into the other matter there is leave in the last three lines to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite agreeable to do that if the House desires, but there are two parties apparently in the House in this matter.  One says the resolution is far too wide and it ought to be limited, and the other party states it is too limited and needs enlargement. If there is any accommodation or agreement between the two sets of people, and some other formula is evolved, I am ready to receive it.  Deputy Major Bryan Cooper raised the point as to the instrument, and there was a point raised by Deputy Heffernan as to the machinery under this Act.  The Act states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where it has been resolved by both Houses of Parliament that it is expedient that a tribunal be established <Col N="2018" /> for inquiring into a definite matter described in the resolution as of urgent public importance, and when in pursuance of the resolution the tribunal is appointed for the purpose, the instrument by which the tribunal is appointed or any instrument supplemental thereto may provide that this Act shall apply.</P>
    <P>If the resolution meets with the approval of the Dáil and Seanad there has to be an instrument, a document appointing the tribunal.  That instrument giving the names of those on the tribunal may contain a statement that this Act shall apply to that tribunal. If the Act is made applicable to the tribunal by the instrument of appointment the following powers are given to the tribunal:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The tribunal shall have all such powers, rights and privileges as are vested in the High Court ... on the occasion of an action in respect of the following matters:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  The enforcing the attendance of witnesses and examining them on oath, affirmation, or otherwise;</P>
    <P>(b)  The compelling the production of documents;</P>
    <P>(c)  Subject to rules of court, the issuing of a commission or request to examine witnesses abroad.</P>
    <P>It says further:&mdash;</P>
    <P>If any person on being duly summoned as a witness before a tribunal makes default in attending, or being in attendance as a witness refuses to take an oath legally required by the tribunal to be taken, or to produce any document in his power or control legally required by the tribunal to be produced by him, or to answer any question to which the tribunal may legally require an answer&mdash;</P>
    <P>and there is set out that steps may be taken for the punishment of that person in like manner as if he had been guilty of contempt of court.  I think that ought to answer Deputy Heffernan's question as to the enforcement of witnesses, and the production of documents. A question was raised with regard to income tax accounts that I cannot answer.  I know the High Court <Col N="2019" /> has certain powers with regard to inquiries into income tax.  Whether an income tax official may be brought before a court I cannot say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that power did exist in England to bring income tax officials before the courts, and that abstracts of accounts were submitted by these officials to courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the difficulty the Food Council found themselves in on the other side was that they could not have produced certain documents they required.  They afterwards got these powers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The first report of the Royal Commission on Food Prices contains the following with regard to the relation of profit to the turnover in the food trades:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have been fortunate in obtaining from the Board of Inland Revenue certain evidence of a general statistical character which throws interesting light on the relation of profit to turnover in the wholesale and retail distribution of food.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Evidence was given by an official of the Inland Revenue Department, and I presume a similar official could be summoned to give evidence here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that is so.  The Food Council in England were met by a refusal from bakers to produce books for inspection.  They got over the difficulty by threatening to publish the names of the people on a white list.  However, that is the Act under which it is proposed this tribunal should act.  That gives certain powers; all of these powers will be given to the tribunal, and it seems that they are quite sufficient to get information required in this matter.  A further section in the Act states that the tribunal has power to exclude the public if it thinks fit when certain evidence is being given&mdash;that is, to keep certain information from the public or people who might make an unfair use of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That had all been considered presumably when the Act was passed.  I am moving to avail of that Act, and give the tribunal all the powers it gives them.  With regard to the remark about the production of books, books could be ordered for production under this Act, and that power is given to the tribunal. Deputy Major Bryan Cooper referred to the composition of the tribunal, and he spoke of having a chartered accountant on it, and some representative of labour.  Deputy Heffernan also moved that there should be some representative of the farming community. The sort of tribunal I had in my mind was one of which the chairman must necessarily be a lawyer; there should then be on the committee one or two people who might be described as professional economists&mdash;I should say &ldquo;professor of economy&rdquo; are not words that have fallen into disrepute lately&mdash;and I would like to put on it a representative of the large retail trade. That person might have to be changed according to the particular trade which was being inquired into.  There should also be a representative of Labour, and a representative, say, of the farmers' and co-operative societies. I hope what I am going to say will not be considered too personal, but, taking the two speeches, I would like to see Deputy Bryan Cooper have his persuasive eloquence exercised on the committee, but I would not like to have Deputy Johnson appearing on the committee for fear he might deal with articles at haphazard, and have all those wanderings that might occur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that would be a proper kind of tribunal, with the addition of two or three people, either because of their interest in this matter, or because of some special qualification which individuals might have, rendering them suitable to serve on such a tribunal.  I had intended not to put a chartered accountant on the tribunal as a member, but <Col N="2021" /> rather to have him associated with the tribunal in a paid capacity, so that he could examine in a professional way any documents or books that may be submitted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot imagine putting anybody on this tribunal who will not have a dual capacity, because everybody will be a consumer.  Suggestions have been made with regard to the tribunal.  I have not moved towards asking anybody to act on the tribunal as this resolution had not gone through.  I think it was Deputy Johnson who pleaded that the tribunal should be small.  I would rather have it small.  If we are to have representatives of the wholesale and retail trades, of Labour, farmers, and the Chambers of Commerce, this tribunal may get unwieldy, but there is nothing definite about the forming of the tribunal.  I have merely thrown out what was in my mind.  Deputy Johnson has urged that a permanent committee, or tribunal would be better.  It may come to that, but I think after all the criticism we have been subjected to with regard to adding to the cost of the Department, or adding to the expenditure of the Government, that it would be better to try the methods proposed where the expenditure is strictly limited, and if it seems to offer good results we might move towards appointing a permanent commission which would examine all such matters as the price of commodities coming from abroad and the prices retail here. I do not by any means say that a permanent commission is entirely ruled out, but I do not think there is any case made for it at the moment.  I <Col N="2022" /> think rather that the lukewarm reception given to this proposal in some quarters of the House is a sign that possibly certain Deputies here would consider it waste to spend any money at all upon this Commission, and if that be so I can imagine the volume of protest there would be if we were to set up a permanent committee with, presumably, paid officials to go along this useless sort of path.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Well I think it is a matter of one calculation against the other.  I think at the moment it is better to see what can be got from this; if sufficient evidence can be brought before the tribunal to make people believe that there is some value in having a tribunal such as is suggested here, or some tribunal like it, set up as a permanency.  I prefer not to go into the expense of a permanent tribunal, even though it might be similar to this, before its worth has been shown.  Deputy Sir James Craig, Deputy Doyle and Deputy Colohan have urged that it is possible in the same street to see a great difference of price with regard to the same article.  I think the discussion that took place after the statements made by these Deputies went to show how difficult it is to determine that it was the same article and of the same quality, and in the end you are faced with this difficulty; what is one to do or should one do anything for people who, say, see two turkeys, exactly the same type of bird, one at 1/8 per lb. and the other at 1/4, and then proceed to buy the bird at 1/8 per lb.? I do not know if anything really should be done for people of that sort.  It reminds me of the old description in the American story-books of the type that is called a &ldquo;sucker&rdquo; in the slang of that country.  One man describes himself as being so much of that type that if he did business with an automatic machine he would be fooled.  If we have a considerable number of people of that type in this country, the sooner some of us go into the distributing business the better, because apparently there is money to be made where you have such an enormous number of foolish people about.  Deputy Lyons, I <Col N="2023" /> think, suggested having local committees established, and Deputy Colohan suggested that the Gárda Síochána might be made use of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lyons suggested that the committees in each town should have some authority to punish people for what he called profiteering. I asked him what was profiteering, and was given the answer &ldquo;overcharging.&rdquo; Overcharging is equally as vague a synonym, if a synonym at all, as profiteering.  As regards Deputy Colohan's suggestion on what standard are the Gárda to act when making an inquiry into the quality of certain goods, into the number of hands through which the article passes, or is there to be a rough and ready test that these articles cost so much and should be priced at so much?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughColohan" hpid="Mr. COLOHAN Mr. COLOHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister adopted my suggestion and put the words that I suggested into his motion, they would have the effect of reducing prices this very night.  The prices would be reduced as soon as it became known throughout the country that words to the effect I suggested had been inserted in the motion.  That would be an effective means of bringing down prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know. I think the only effect would be that you would have a certain amount of publicity.  As regards the suggestion made by Deputy Doyle, I have already shown that I do not take his object lesson as being one that could be too strictly regarded.  Even taking what he said, and even if you have publicity given to the prices, one labelled at so much and the other at sixpence or four-pence per pound more, and that even to the expert eye of Deputy Doyle the two birds are of the same quality, yet apparently inasmuch as the higher priced article remained on sale and was being looked for, what is the good of publicity in those circumstances? We have to go a long way before we can get to certain standards as regards price and quality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="2024" /> accept a case which I am about to quote as one that might be classed as profiteering?  A farmer's wife goes into a country town and sells to the local shopkeeper a roll of butter at ninepence a pound.  The shopkeeper retails the butter at one and sixpence or two shillings per pound.  That is quite a common kind of occurrence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the kind of matters that would come before this Committee of Inquiry, but how is that type of case, a glaring one of that kind, going to be tackled by the Gárda or the local authorities on the lines suggested by Deputies. First of all, they would have to make inquiries as to prices, and it would require a great deal of evidence to show in the case of an article bought at ninepence and retailed at two shillings, that there was not somewhere extortion, but it is conceivable that in the case of a retailer in a small town where there was a considerable number of retail shops, where competition was very severe and where the expense of keeping up a retail shop would be fairly high, that there could be made a case that the retail prices charged was not profiteering, even in the loose sense in which the word is used.  I believe there was a proposal in France, but whether it actually became law or not I do not know, which seemed to go on the lines of setting up local committees and of giving local authorities power to act upon a standard which was to be fixed for a district, that is to say, fixed by some sort of a central authority.  If this tribunal can do anything like that, and if it comes to any conclusion there may be some scope afterwards for the local authority or for the Gárda Síochána to act under it, but I think you must get evidence taken first to get a prima facie case made out with regard to excesses in the way of charges.</P>

What I am prepared to do now is to let this tribunal consider and report as to practical methods of effecting reductions. If the tribunal makes any recommendation of the sort referred to by Deputy Lyons, then we can have that considered and discussed here in the Dáil, to see whether the gain likely to result from the suggestion will outweigh any extra expense incurred in carrying the report of the Committee into effect.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hewat put the point, and I stressed it, that if after hearing the evidence and spending a lot of time upon it we simply come to the conclusion that there is a question of too many distributors, what are you going to do?  When I put that question, it leads to a certain dilemma but, at the same time, it clarifies matters. It may be that the whole system of distribution is wrong and that it will not rectify itself by what would be in other countries the ordinary pressure exersised by keen consumers seeing whether they can get a bit off the prices in one shop as compared with another. And what I rather fear, in regard to this Committee, is that it may take a dive in a course where one does not quite see the end at the moment.  It is possible that we may have to come to the fixing and controlling of prices which may lead to a sort of interference with articles coming in from outside. That may involve the setting up of a permanent Government Department with tremendous expenditure to tackle it and it might be a matter afterwards of balance to see whether the set-off likely in the way of reduction would be equated by the expenditure involved in the setting up of such a big Government Department.  Deputy Hewat referred to the Commission in <Col N="2026" /> England.  I think that the Commission in England is what led to the demand, at this period, for this tribunal to be set up here, and in response to that demand I am going to set up a tribunal. I am not sure that the Commission in England has done all that the people who are so enthusiastic about it say it has done.  It did bring down the price of flour and the price of bread, and then the price of flour and the price of bread went up again, and I wonder whether people are any better off at this moment.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister suggest that that is a case of cause and effect?  Does he suggest that the reduction in the price of bread inevitably and automatically led to an increased demand for flour, or are there not any other causes that lead to an increase in the price of wheat and in the price of flour?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly there are other causes.  I am simply putting it as a matter of fact that the food council on the other side sat, after the Royal Commission on prices had issued a report on a particular date, and the price of bread was reduced. Now, whether it was through the Food Council, or not, I am not going to say, but, having got to the point where the price of bread was reduced, there came about another fluctuation, and the price of bread went up again, and the price of bread now is as high as it was at the time when the food council began to sit.</P>

      <P>Take the question of publicity, and the showing up of people.  I think there was a great indictment framed in the report of the committee on which Deputy Hewat and Deputy Sir James Craig sat, of one particular trade, but at the same time it did not bring down the cost of the article that they were retailing by one farthing.  That committee, through no fault of its own, did not achieve anything, and I do not think it is fair to compare it with the tribunal that I am now setting up.  That committee had not power to call for witnesses or to authorise the production of books and documents.  It was very limited in its scope, but the information that was brought before it produced very damning statements with regard to one trade, but, as I say, it did not bring down the retail price in that trade by one farthing.  I am keeping the resolution as it stands.  If Deputy Cooper is moving to put in after the word &ldquo;prices&rdquo; in line 5 the words &ldquo;wholesale prices if necessary,&rdquo; I am prepared to accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that, to cover that point, it would be necessary to add the words &ldquo;prices paid by importers.&rdquo; I take it that is what Deputy Cooper has in mind.  There are wholesalers who only deal with home produce and others who deal almost entirely with imported goods.</P>

I would like to give the benefit of the experience I gained on the Committee on Food Prices on which I sat.  One of the great objections some of the trades made to giving information to that Commission was the fact that some of the members of the Commission were in the same line of business&mdash;not directly in the same line perhaps&mdash;as themselves. Now, the Minister says he is going to give the co-operative system representation. It was in connection with the co-operative representation on that Committee that the principal objection was raised, and in other directions too.

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That owing to the large number of citizens of the Saorstát who are suffering acute distress through the want of employment, the Dáil is of opinion that immediate steps should be taken by the Government to introduce <Col N="2029" /> legislation to subsidise existing industries and to enable grants to be made to Public Authorities of amounts equal to that which they are or may be authorised to borrow for the relief of unemployment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This motion has been on the Paper for the past fortnight, and I am sure every Deputy knows its terms very well.  I am sorry that the Minister for Finance is not here to tell us what amount of money the Government is prepared to give for the relief of the unemployed in the country.  There is something over 80,000 registered unemployed in the twenty-six counties. We have had relief grants in the last year to the amount of £250,000.  This year a very large number of the unemployed who were in receipt of unemployment benefit are now without benefit.  Their families are suffering, there is acute distress in practically every worker's home in the two counties I represent, namely, Westmeath and Longford, and the same applies to every county.  The amount of home help given in these two counties in the past year amounted to £12,500.  In Westmeath alone £9,000 of the ratepayers' money had to be given for the relief of distress, while £3,500 was given in Longford.  If the Government are really sincere in trying to relieve the citizens in general, surely they will do what is asked in this motion.  Many industries at the present time are practically ruined, and a huge amount of money would be needed to subsidise them.  A vote similar to that for the Shannon scheme would probably be needed.  The bad state of these industries is not due to bad management but to the after-effects of the Great War and of our own civil war.  The woollen industry gave employment to practically one-third of the population of the Saorstát.  That industry has failed.  In the town of Athlone, where 800 people had been employed in that industry, 300 people are now employed on alternate days.  Some few days ago in Cork the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs lamented the ruin of the woollen industry and favoured tariffs on woollen goods coming into the country.  At first he said he thought that tariffs were not profitable to the State, but that since <Col N="2030" /> their introduction he was satisfied that they did good for the country and gave employment, and he promised that he would try to get the Government to protect industries.  Deputies who make these statements to their constituents and who are supporters of the Government have an opportunity now on this motion of putting forward their views, and I sincerely hope that they will do so.  You have hundreds of small flour mills in the country that are barely existing; where 15 or 16 people had been employed in one of these small mills you have now one miller who acts as ploughman, gardener, and miller.</P>
    <P>The Government, I think, have taken advantage of this motion.  It has been on the Paper for a fortnight, and now they ask us to agree to the introduction of a supplementary estimate for relief schemes.  We were not asked to agree to that a fortnight ago.  The Minister for Finance got Deputy Sears to ask a question yesterday, and the reply was that the Dáil would be asked to vote a supplementary estimate. Whether the Government cares or not, I claim the benefit of having this motion introduced by the Minister for Finance.  It would be too much, of course, to tell us what the total amount will be.  I hope it will be at least half the amount that will be saved through the Agreement and through the deletion of Article V. of the Treaty, and if that amount is so huge as we are told, then I say that the workers of the Saorstát will have a very happy Christmas.  I do not expect that the Government will do anything that I would wish them to do on this motion. I do not expect that they will float a loan for the purpose of subsidising industries, but I want it to be made clear that by subsidising existing industries you would be giving employment to a very large number of people.  The unemployed at the present moment, I regret to say, are like a lot of unfortunates looking for alms from the Labour Exchange.  They do not want that. They want employment.  I do not expect that there is a worker's home in the twenty-six counties where there will be a turkey for the Christmas dinner.  I know of a case where there are seven children in a house; five of <Col N="2031" /> them are of school age, and they have not gone to school for the past three months, or to their religious duties on Sundays, for the want of food and clothes.  The father of these children applied to the Labour Exchange, and he was told that there was nothing for him.  There are hundreds of similar cases in Westmeath and Longford, and I am sure there are thousands of them in the Saorstát.  These people are living in deplorable conditions for the want of employment.  They are decent, respectable people, but they are driven at the present moment to a state of absolute destitution.</P>
    <P>Let Deputies visit those people and let them see the want that prevails in those houses.  If they do that, and refuse to support this motion, then I say that their hearts are harder than the heart of the hard-hearted man. You have thousands of people in the city who are to-night going to bed without their suppers.  I have this motion on the paper for a fortnight, and I think I should propose a vote of thanks to the Government for allowing me to proceed with it to-night. The milling industry has practically gone, leaving thousands of our people unemployed.  In the creamery industry many people are unemployed.  I wonder would the Minister for Industry and Commerce be able to give us the figures of unemployment in connection with the creameries for the past twelve months.  They are not able to carry on for want of funds.</P>
    <P>We have introduced a Trade Loans Act, but the interest on loans under that Act are as a millstone about the neck of any firm.  At six per cent., some firms are paying, by way of interest on their loans under this Act, £2,300. How could these people give employment? Under the Act, a firm will not get a loan even at 6 per cent. except for the purpose of purchasing machinery. I wonder will the machinery purchased be something like the automatic bottle-making machine purchased by the Ringsend firm.  I leave that question to the Dublin Deputies, who will be able to prove to the Government that the installation of such machinery does not mean the relief of <Col N="2032" /> unemployment but tends to add to unemployment. The same thing applies to big firms in the country districts. They can get a loan for the purpose of installing machinery but not for the purpose of developing their industries in other ways, which would give greater employment.  The loan is not given to pay wages.  The Government must do something very quickly to protect the few industries we have.  It is not a question of money.  When the Government, some time ago, issued a loan of £10,000,000 they had to refuse and refund money.  It was over subscribed.  Could money be devoted to a better purpose than the creation of industries and the diminution of unemployment? I do not want to say anything about the Northern Government. There is a lot of unemployment in the North, but they are giving a great deal more money for the relief of distress there than is being given in the Saorstát.  As a people, they may be more generous there.  I hope when the debate on this motion is concluding that the President and the Minister for Finance will be here, if possible.  I want to see if the Government are really serious so far as the interests of these people are concerned.  They can prove that by giving some little subsidies to Irish industries.  The places of the Farmers' Party are vacant here at present.  At the moment they are only a furniture party, but I do not see why they should not support this motion.  It would apply to many industries which they are interested in, and I think the least they could do would be to try and get some relief for the people who are trying to carry on those industries.  We do not want charity.  I am not looking for charity for any individual.  I am looking for employment for those people.  I want the Government to do something immediately to give employment.</P>
    <P>The Government have started a Shannon scheme and they guaranteed 3,000 men employment for three years. Three thousand men could be got in one county alone.  There are over 3,000 men unemployed in Longford-Westmeath. There are, I am sure, 14,000 or 15,000 ex-Servicemen unemployed.  Those men are not entitled to benefit from the <Col N="2033" /> Labour Exchange, and their families are suffering.  Ex-Captains of the National Army are quite prepared to take a hammer and go out and break stones, in order to keep body and soul together, but they cannot get even that employment.  I wonder when many of those men were wounded and in hospital, and when arrangements were being made to give ex-Servicemen preference in regard to certain positions, was the fact that they were in hospital at the time taken into account, and will marks be awarded in order to put them on equality with men who were studying outside at that time?  Day after day, the number of unemployed is increasing. The tariff on boots was instrumental in giving employment to 2,000 people extra.  If you cannot subsidise industries, why not put a tariff on every manufactured article that comes into the country?  Why not put it on woollen materials?  To-day, there is a question of establishing a tribunal to deal with the cost of living.  What better way could the Government deal with the cost of living than by giving employment to the workers and having the output increased.  Goods could then be manufactured more cheaply.  Every man, woman and child in the Saorstát is taxed to the extent of about £12 per head.  What are we getting for it?</P>

      <P>One thing I do want is, to get some relief for the unemployed for Christmas.  If you cannot <Col N="2034" /> give them employment immediately, then every man who is unemployed, and ineligible for drawing benefit at the Labour Exchange, should get £1 or £1 10s. to bring home at Christmas. That would convince the workers of the Saorstát that even if the employing class do not recognise that they are Christians, the Government does and is not going to see them hungry for Christmas.  You have thousands of people in this country who have locked up in the bank large sums of money, earned by the sweat of labour.  But when the call came in 1921 for thousands of young men to don the uniform of the National Army and save the property of this country, who responded? The young men who saved the wealth of the nation then were heroes, but now they are not recognised. Why should not the Government, without paying one penny from the exchequer, not make an appeal to the wealthy class of the community for a loan for the purpose of relieving distress amongst unemployed?</P>
      <P>I come now to the portion of my motion which deals with grants to public authorities equal in amount to those which they may be authorised to borrow for relief of unemployment. This would not mean new legislation. In past years the British Government gave grants to the extent of 50 per cent., or a sum equivalent to the sum which a local authority was prepared to borrow for the purpose of relieving distress.  If a council is prepared to borrow £10,000 or £20,000 to relieve distress, surely it is not too much to ask the Government to give an equal amount?  That money will come back on the double in a few years time to the district in which it is spent.  This money could be spent on such work as road-making and bridge-building, which would be of benefit to the various districts.  I am not asking something for nothing.  I am asking the Government to give some assurance that they are prepared to subsidise existing industry by giving grants in aid so that they may be able to give more employment, and I also ask them to give to local authorities amounts equivalent to those which they are prepared to borrow.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the motion which has been so ably proposed by Deputy Lyons.  He has explored every avenue left to him for the purpose of relieving unemployment, but I think that the wind was taken out of his sails by the Supplementary Estimate which was proposed this evening. In my district there are four or five large mills which used to give employment to hundreds of men, but now they are working on half time.  If there was a tax on manufactured flour which is imported, and if wheat were allowed in free, it might have the desired effect of getting these mills working again on full time.  It is much easier to put a tax on such a commodity than to get a subsidy from the Minister for Finance.  I think he ought to be willing to do so in view of the success of the tariff put on in regard to goods.  That tariff has proved a great success in Cork.  I would like also to see the Minister for Finance reduce the price of stout.</P>

      <P>It would help to reduce unemployment.  There is another way of helping employment, and in this regard I am glad to see the Minister for Agriculture here.  The agricultural grant is given indiscriminately to men with 500 and 600 acres who do not till a sod of it.  That is, in fact, subsidising idleness.  It is subsidising a man and a dog in a field.  If that grant were given as a subsidy to those who till the land it would relieve unemployment.</P>

      <P>I would like to say that I am in perfect sympathy with what I consider to be the underlying object of this proposal, but I am rather doubtful as to the wisdom of passing this resolution in its present form.  Deputy Lyons asks the Government to bring forward legislation to enable grants to be made to public authorities of amounts equal to those which they can borrow for relieving unemployment. That, in my opinion, provides a loophole to the Government to <Col N="2036" /> get out of giving grants to local authorities.  Anyone acquainted with the conditions prevailing in the Saorstát to-day will know the difficulties experienced by local authorities with the banks in raising loans.  I doubt, in fact, if 5 per cent. of the local authorities could get a loan to carry out relief works and, if this resolution is passed, the Government will only be called on to provide grants to any local authority which is lucky enough to induce a bank to give it a loan.  I am not criticising Deputy Lyons, but I think that he, on reconsideration, will see the difficulty created in that connection and I believe that the Government would be delighted to pass that particular part of the resolution.  So far as the other portion of the resolution is concerned, in which Deputy Lyons asks the Government to subsidise the industries of the country, I do not agree with it.  I do not believe that any subsidy which the Government could give to any industry would be sufficient to put that industry on its feet.  I believe that the only subsidy which will do any good to industry is a full measure of protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in a position to speak for my constituency in which there are three agricultural implement manufacturers who up to three years ago employed 1,000 men, whereas to-day only 300 are employed.  The proprietors and men have sent up joint applications repeatedly within the last two or three years asking for protection.  They have assured the Ministry that their machinery is just as good as the imported type, and that it will be sold at the same price, but the Ministry have refused up to now to afford protection to that industry.  I think that subsidies will only be a temporary palliative and they will not serve the purpose which Deputy Lyons hopes they will.  As I have said, I am in sympathy with the object underlying the motion, and were it not for the fact that the Minister for Finance has carried the First Reading of the Supplementary Estimate-to-day I would have more to say on the subject, but I prefer to reserve my remarks on unemployment until to-morrow, when that Estimate will receive a Second Reading.  I hope that <Col N="2037" /> this resolution will not be passed in its present form, but I hope that the Ministry will take cognisance of what Deputy Lyons has said about unemployment.</P>

      <P>This motion gives me the opportunity of drawing attention to the unemployed in the City of Dublin.  Almost daily we have processions of the unemployed in the various trades, men who are willing to work if they get the chance.  One of the largest processions I saw of the unemployed in Dublin was composed of members of an old-established industry&mdash;that is, the coachbuilding.  The coachbuilders at present, I think, have not more than 33 per cent. of their members working. Of the rest some get casual employment, but a large number get no employment. Some time ago I raised here a question as to the possibility of the Government allowing into this country, free of charge, motor car chassis so that the bodies could be made in Ireland, and so give much-needed employment. Coachbuilders are also very seriously affected owing to the action of our controlled railway company, who, in spite of promises given some time ago in this House that they would not import any more foreign waggons or engines, have been, as we noticed recently, importing large quantities of material for use on Irish railways.  The excuse was given from the Government Benches that it was a question of space, that they were not able to find space for all these men, the boilermakers, coachbuilders, and so on.  That statement was made, that it was merely a question of space, while everyone knows that the directors of that controlled company have closed down one of their workshops&mdash;I refer to the Westland Row workshop.  The men who were employed there were transferred to another workshop that the Minister said was insufficient for the work, with the result that foreign-made waggons from England were imported whilst we had many hundreds of these men&mdash;smiths, coachbuilders and other mechanics&mdash;walking idle about the streets.  I hope that importation will not be repeated again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen in a list of our imports, <Col N="2038" /> and I noticed that on a recent date very large numbers of room-doors, hall-doors, and kitchen-doors had been imported, with the handles and locks attached, all practically ready for fitting on.  I do not think that should be allowed.  The Government provided money for housing schemes, and it should not be permissible that these manufactured doors and shutters for the houses that are being built should be brought in ready-made, and so depriving the woodworkers or carpenters of work.  The Government should interest themselves in that matter so far as their housing schemes are concerned. I also take the opportunity of drawing attention to the condition of the printing trade.  Fifty per cent. of the skilled men in the printing trade are unemployed.  Passing through the streets you will see on the advertising hoardings coloured posters and other public announcements that are not printed in the Saorstát.  Go into any ordinary shop in town and take up a prayer-book or a bible, and turn over the front page, and you will see that the book has been printed in Belgium. When the Government are dealing with their next Budget I think they should take these matters into consideration. Wholesale importation of printed matter into this country should not be allowed while so many members of the printing trade are walking the streets idle.  I raised the question of woollens on the occasion of the last Budget.  I hope that the matter referred to by Deputy Lyons in this connection will be taken into consideration, and that some effort will be made to revive the woollen industries.  I am aware that in the constituency of a Deputy who has just spoken, one of these industries was closed down a few months ago, and it formerly gave much-needed employment. I also wish to draw the attention of the Minister to the failure to provide, or to encourage the provision of any employment, so far as female labour is concerned.  I know of one or two industries in Dublin which in the past gave employment to female labour, but they are not employing their former workers even on half-time as a result of the wholesale dumping of goods not made in this country.  I <Col N="2039" /> mention that as a matter that ought also be considered.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance allows thousands and thousands of grosses of matches to be dumped at the North Wall and sold in the Saorstát.  These matches, made abroad, are placed exactly on the same terms as matches made in Dublin as regards duty.  I suggest that some preferential rate should be given to the Irish-made matches so far as the duty is concerned. I am satisfied that the match factory in Dublin is capable of employing twice its present number.  All during the war when there was a difficulty in getting a supply of matches.  Paterson's match factory was able to supply the whole of Ireland.  The machinery is there capable of doing the same again. The consumer gets no benefit as a result of foreign matches coming into the country.  A man going into a tobacconists pays one penny for a box of foreign-made matches, but the Irish box of matches for one penny contains the same number of matches as the foreign-made box, and the Irish matches are of better quality.  I certainly think the Government should give some preference to the Irish article.  Some time ago I raised a question regarding the bottle-making industry. I regret to say that the tax on bottles has not been as successful as I hoped, as the result of the introduction of machinery subsidised under the Trades Loans Act.  I understand one firm got a grant of something up to £60,000.  When they gave that sum of money, I think the Government should have got some guarantee that the old bottle hands who were formerly engaged in making hand bottles would get employment.  I have had an interview with some of those old bottle hands, and I understand if they could get a small grant they would form a co-operative society.  If they even got a couple of thousand pounds they would be satisfied to put the fires going again and would set to work in turning out hand-made bottles.</P>
    <P>A month ago I asked a question as to the number of unemployed who were drawing or were refused unemployment benefits for a period of three weeks&mdash;October to November.  The <Col N="2040" /> total number of applications for a continuance of unemployment benefit was 26,264, and of these over 18,000 have been allowed.  A certain number were rejected, and some 6,000 were awaiting a decision.  That means that the number rejected could not get a continuance of benefits, and no effort is made to provide employment for them when they lose benefit.  How are they to live with no unemployment benefits and no relief schemes?  I am speaking for the centre of Dublin, for the area I represent, and I am aware there are hundreds of people in there on the verge of starvation.  They have made repeated applications for unemployment benefits without result.  They cannot get a day's work, and I would like to know what is to become of that class of person?</P>
    <P>Many of them have been looked after by the St. Vincent de Paul Society and other charitable institutions, but the resources of these institutions are practically exhausted, and they are unable to do anything for that class of person, except to give a temporary relief order to tide them over a day or two. It is the duty of Governments to see that people shall not die of hunger. That is a duty the Government have accepted, and I hope something will be done for the unfortunate casual worker who never registers and gets no unemployment benefits.  The figures we get about the registered number of unemployed are not the real figures, as I think every Deputy knows, because there is a class of casual workers, both male and female, who never register or apply for benefits.  Every Deputy knows of the class of person I refer to, who just gets an odd day's work here and there.  I hope my representations will be considered favourably by the Government.  I put them forward with all seriousness.  I say that, as a result of the wholesale dumping of foreign goods, one-fourth of our population is unemployed to-day, and many of them are hungry.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to take steps to see that articles that can be made in this country on equal terms and under more favourable conditions than imported articles will get some form of protection.  In the city of Dublin, <Col N="2041" /> up to twenty years ago, we had a huge number of foundries, but to-day there are only two or three of them left, and these are almost on the verge of collapse. I mentioned that carpentry work was being imported for our housing schemes.  I am satisfied also that ironwork, which could be made in the city of Dublin by our foundries on equal terms with the foreign manufactured article, is also being brought into this country, and to what purpose, I ask?  No one knows, because I say the Irish article is just as cheap as the foreign one.  I hope that in the future our iron foundries will get some consideration from the Government.  This particular industry is one of the hardest hit that we have.  In this industry, if employment could be provided for all the skilled men who are out of employment at present, it would mean that the number of unskilled men to be taken on could be doubled. I hope that the Government, so far as their own contract is concerned, will give this industry all the encouragement they can.  If they do that, then I am satisfied that very many deserving people at present unemployed will be able to get work.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I wish to refer to, and I am sorry the Minister for Defence is not present to hear what I have to say.  In connection with this I have put down a question.  Quite recently, I have been told, a contract for Army leggings and for Army caps was sent out of the Saorstát.  I do not know whether that is true or not, but if it is, I do not think it is playing fair on the part of our Government.  The Government certainly should not send out contracts to people who are not subject to taxation here or to the payment of rates and other charges which our own contractors have to bear.  I hope that in this matter the Government will set a good headline and that if a home contractor comes within a reasonable figure of the foreigner who is not subject to our taxation that he will get sympathetic consideration from the Government and that when the giving of the contract is being considered that due allowance will be made for the fact that the foreigner is not paying taxes here.  I hope that the <Col N="2042" /> points I have made will receive the sympathetic consideration of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to add my quota to the usual Christmas wail.  I think the Ministry is under no illusions at the present time as to the gravity of the situation that we are faced with. It is known to every Deputy in the House and to the people throughout the country that the Government should tackle this question of unemployment in a determined way and deal with it generously.  I hope that when the Minister for Finance introduces his supplementary estimate to-morrow that it will be at least for £1,000,000.  Anything less will not be of any use to solve this problem of unemployment that exists all over the country.  I cannot agree with the motion tabled by Deputy Lyons, because it says that it is to enable grants to be made to public authorities of amounts &ldquo;equal to that which they are or may be authorised to borrow for the relief of unemployment.&rdquo; I suggest to him that he should delete the words after the word &ldquo;authorities&rdquo; in line 5 to the word &ldquo;for&rdquo; in line seven, and that he should make his motion read: &ldquo;That owing to the large number of citizens in the Saorstát who are suffering acute distress through the want of unemployment the Dáil is of opinion that immediate steps should be taken by the Government to introduce legislation to subsidise existing industries and to enable grants to be made to public authorities for the relief of unemployment.&rdquo; The reason I suggest that is that the local authorities are not in a position at the present time to increase their commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking for my own county, the County of Kildare, we have already exceeded the amount provided for home assistance this year by about £23,000.  We provided £17,000, and by the end of the year we will have expended £40,000.  That shows that we cannot borrow any more.  There are a few points that were put before the Minister for Local Government on the 17th November last by our Board of Health which I would like to refer to. It is not necessary for me to go into <Col N="2043" /> these things in detail.  There are a few points, however, that I would like to mention so that they may be remembered in the distribution of grants if any grants are made.  Naas put up a demand for £8,000 for urban roads and sewerage extension works.  Athy made a similar demand for a similar sum to carry out works of the same description, and also asked for assistance from the road-making authority.  Newbridge and Kildare put up a demand for £15,000 in connection with the Liffey bridge and other works.  I would like to mention the widening of the Liffey bridge at Newbridge.  I mentioned it some time ago by putting a question down to the Minister.  He gave me an assurance when the deputation waited on him last November that if we got plans, specifications and estimates sent forward to the Road Board, that he would recommend them; I hope he will keep that promise.  The reason I am bringing this forward here is that I want to put the responsibility for any accidents that may happen or for any lives that are lost at that bridge on the Minister for Local Government.  I have repeatedly brought this question before the authorities and it has been turned down.  I was told a few months ago that we should concentrate on road services.  Here you have a bridge crossing the Liffey close to churches and schools with all the traffic between Dublin and Cork passing over it.  The bridge is a great danger to those who use it, as between the kerb and the parapet it is only eighteen feet wide, and you can understand that with six-ton lorries passing backward and forward over it what a danger it is to the public.</P>
    <P>Another demand that was put forward was for a new cemetery to be made at the Curragh for the use of the Army there.  That would give a certain amount of employment.  I think there is an objection to them going into the old cemetery.  We do not want them in the Newbridge Cemetery because it is small enough for ourselves.  I expect that we will have it pretty well filled before long if the Government does not come to our assistance.  I brought before the Minister on several occasions <Col N="2044" /> the closing down of the mills at Ballymore-Eustace, and I strongly urged on him the necessity of helping to re-establish these mills again as well as the mills at Leixlip.  There is also a proposal to make a new road for the Tower Bus Company between Celbridge and Clane.  There is another point I would like to draw attention to. It is this: that several schemes for arterial drainage were sent in to the Kildare County Council.  They were passed by the County Council, and I presume have been sent on to the Ministry here.  I heard since that it is not likely these schemes will be started until the year 1927.  I would urge on the Ministry to get the levels taken and the necessary preliminaries carried out, so that when the weather conditions permit, these works can be gone on with.  I imagine that 90 per cent. of the money expended on them will be given in wages and that as the farmers are clamouring to have this work done, the Ministry should do all in their power to facilitate it.</P>
    <P>There is another thing I would like to suggest to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Some years ago there were about 50 men employed in the ballast pit at Pollardstown, between Newbridge and Kildare.  All these men have been discharged, and I suggest that the Minister should make representations to the Great Southern Railways Company to have this pit opened as a depot for the permanent way department. They could store all their sleepers and rails, and they could instal their creosote plant, including their saw-mills, and that would mean the employment of about 50 hands more. There is another thing I suggest, and that is that the concrete casting works be transferred to that pit.  You have the finest material there for concrete in the country, and the place is central for distribution all along the Great Southern and Western line, and I think that the casting of wall-blocks, kerbs, copings, platform blocks, fencing posts, &amp;c., could be made there, and in that way you would give a good deal of employment in the county.  I think that the railway company should be brought to realise that they have drawn a great deal of revenue from <Col N="2045" /> Kildare in the past, and that it is their duty to do something for that county now, and I think the Pollardstown pit should be looked upon as one that deserves very serious attention.</P>
    <P>As to unemployment generally, it seems that is a hardy annual, and comes up every Christmas, but it comes up more intensely now than last Christmas.  God knows it was bad enough last Christmas, but it is infinitely worse to-day.  I ask the Government to tackle this question determinedly, and I ask the Minister when he brings his supplementary estimate before us to-morrow not to handle the matter in a beggarly manner.  Nothing less than £1,000,000 will be any good if he wants really to tackle this question and do something for the people.</P>

      <P>For the past four weeks I have seen it stated in the Press that the Army contract for leggings was given away to an English firm.  From enquiries that I have made I find that is not accurate, but it appears in the Press again to-day, and I suppose it was there that Deputy Byrne got his information.  I should be very thankful to the Minister if he would state whether that is accurate or otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. EVERETT Mr. EVERETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Colohan I take exception to Deputy Lyons' motion where it asks us to assist industries. I agree we can assist local bodies if we re-establish the Local Loans Fund.  If the Minister would bring in a Bill re-establishing the Local Loans Fund a number of public bodies could then secure loans over a large number of years, and would be able to absorb a large number of builders' labourers and tradesmen in the erection of houses for the working-classes. Owing to the limited finances of public bodies at the present time they are unable to avail of the different Building Facilities Acts and other means, because the banks will only give loans for a certain number of years, and if you build a house you want to be able to set it at an economic rent, otherwise it will remain idle.  I suggest to the Minister that he should assist local bodies by bringing in a Bill for the re-establishment of Local Loans, <Col N="2046" /> and give those bodies a chance of trying to solve the housing problem in their area as well as giving employment to a great number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also appeal to the Minister, when considering any grant to be given to local bodies, that he should consider the advisability of giving them a grant for reafforestation in their various counties.  We are all aware of the number of plantations that were denuded during the great war.  Very little has been done by the Government up to the present.  It is not sufficient merely to replant 2,500 acres.  Contrast that with the fact that seventy thousand tons of trees were removed from my own constituency during the great war and shipped to a foreign country. These local bodies are prepared to strike a rate if they get a grant to assist them in forming plantations that would add to the beauty of the country as well as providing work of utility in the future.  I agree with Deputy Daly when he suggested that there should be a tax on foreign flour. We are all well aware that in a number of our rural areas we have flour-mills and that the men in these mills are only working three-quarter time owing to the number of English manufacturers who are dumping flour here at less than the cost of the manufacture in Ireland.  Although Irish flour is equal, if not superior, to the foreign flour, unfortunately our people do not support it.  I appeal to the Minister, when he is considering his Budget, to bear in mind the possibility of putting a tax on foreign flour.  I appeal also to the farmers, if they are so anxious as they say they are to solve unemployment, to assist the Irish Fertilisers Association by purchasing from them Irish manufactured manure.  It is superior to Belgian and other foreign manures which are dumped into this country, and Irish manures to-day are only 13 per cent. over pre-war prices. They have guaranteed to the Farmers' Union that if the Government puts a tax on foreign manures and gives the Irish producers an opportunity to compete in their own market they will not charge any excess price to the farmers for the manures, and they state that they will be able to employ over 3,000 <Col N="2047" /> more men in their firms in the Saorstát. Recently, a very representative body of the Farmers' Union sent a resolution to the Government appealing to them to put a tax on foreign manures which would help to double the output of industry and to give a great deal more employment to our people.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of that.  The Deputy may or he may not be in favour of purchasing the foreign article, but I put it to the farmers and the county generally that the foreigners always dump their surplus stock here so as to close up our manufactures. People may purchase the foreign and the cheap article for a time, but when our industries are closed up, and destroyed, the foreigner comes along and makes the farmer pay for his pound of flesh after he has succeeded in destroying our Irish manufactures.  That will happen if the Belgian manures are supported in preference to Irish fertilisers. These are the only points that I suggest to the Minister on Deputy Lyons's motion.  I would ask him to bear in mind the remarks I have made.  Any other remarks I have to make as regards unemployment I will keep until I see what the estimate that will be brought in to-morrow will be.  I do not agree with Deputy Colohan that a million pounds would be sufficient to relieve unemployment at the present time.  If we are going to tackle the unemployment problem in real earnest, we will have to face facts and, if necessary, borrow money and provide work of public utility.  In that way we will be able to bring peace and contentment to the workers.</P>

I do not approve of the idea suggested in Deputy Lyons's motion.  I have the greatest possible sympathy with the unemployed, but I disagree altogether with the suggestions that are put forward here for the relief of unemployment.  In particular, I disagree with the suggestion that subsidies should be given to industries. Deputy Lyons, Deputy Everett and Deputy Byrne seem to think that the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmer is the main producer in this country.  He has to produce his goods and to face open competition in the world-markets with those goods, and no effective subsidy could be given or no effective protection could be given, in my opinion, to farm produce.  While he has to sell in an open competitive market the farmer has to buy in a protected and subsidised market.  The farmer has eventually to bear the great weight of anything in the nature of subsidies or protective tariffs, and there is nothing that he can get in return.  It is not necessary for me to point out the dire condition of the farming industry. There are farmers at the present time who are practically unemployed, or <Col N="2049" /> whose remuneration from the work in which they are engaged is little better than that obtained by unemployed men who have gone on the dole.  The farming industry is undoubtedly in a very bad condition, and anything in the nature of subsidising industries must react to the further detriment of the industry.  It is all very fine for Deputy Byrne to talk about subsidising this industry and that industry, and giving the Army contracts to special industries. I would like to see Irish industries getting the Army contracts, but I would like to see them facing the competition of outside industries, just as the farmers have to face outside competition. If we are told that commodities of inferior quality can be sent in here to compete with commodities of better quality produced in this country, the implication is that the Irish producer is buying an inferior article.  I do not believe that the Irish consumer is prepared to pay as high a price for an inferior foreign article as for a home-made article.  If that is so, I would say the remedy is not so much in subsidising industries as by a system of propaganda, to encourage the Irish purchaser to buy Irish articles.  I would say that it is up to the Irish manufacturer to keep in step with modern development and to advertise his products so that they will be as well known to the public as the foreign articles which are coming in and competing with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Everett has referred to the question of artificial manures.  I know something about the importation of artificial manures.  I believe that the very fact that the Irish farmers did buy imported artificial manures led to the very considerable reduction that has taken place in the price of artificial manures in the Saorstát.  I know that a few years ago the quotations of the Irish manure manufacturers could not, in any way, approach the quotations which we could get for similar artificial manures from the Continent. I am not prepared at the present moment to deal with prices, but I say it is up to the Irish manufacturer to put himself in a position to offer his goods to the Irish farmers of as good a quality and at as low a price as the foreign <Col N="2050" /> importer.  If he cannot, it is not fair to ask the farmers to subsidise him by paying higher prices than he could get goods for in the outside market.  The Irish farmer does not get higher prices for his goods because they are Irish grown.  He has to face open world competition, and I maintain that the Irish manufacturers have no right to get better terms than the main industry of this country gets, the agricultural industry.  The effect of all this subsidising is increased taxation and the hampering of the Irish farmer, and thereby, in my opinion, an increase in unemployment.</P>
    <P>I believe that a good deal of the unemployment is due to the fact that the Irish farmer is finding it difficult to make ends meet.  He is finding it very difficult to make a profit, and as a consequence the whole tendency is to cut down expenses to the very lowest level, and to do the barely necessary work on his farm, and putting work which is not absolutely necessary on the long finger, with the result that there has been growing unemployment in the rural districts.  That is a form of unemployment that is not reflected in the unemployment returns.  I think there is a tendency for the unemployed in the agricultural districts to drift into the towns and gradually to increase the number of unemployed in the towns and cities.  I believe that this is a bigger question than can be dealt with by means of a grant or subsidy.  It may be all right to give a grant or subsidy at a particular season of the year.  It is certainly almost impossible to object to anything in the nature of a relief grant at this season of the year, because nobody can have anything but sympathy with those who have to face Christmas without the necessary sustenance, and without something to cheer them up, but the fact of the matter is that all these grants and subsidies must eventually hamper the main industry of the country.  I believe, if we are to put the country on its feet, and get unemployment wiped out, and stimulate industries in a natural manner, the way we will have to do it is to begin with the agricultural industry, give the agricultural industry a chance by reduced <Col N="2051" /> taxation, and by every other means at the disposal of the State encourage it, but not by means of subsidy.  I do not believe that you could adequately subsidise the agricultural industry.  The Minister for Posts would probably say that you could.  I believe the best you could do would be to subsidise a section of it.  You may subsidise beet-growing, or one particular section, but the result will be that you will have the whole farming industry paying a subsidy to a section.  If you want to subsidise agricultural industry you will have to subsidise the whole industry, and as our agricultural exports are roughly forty millions, a fifteen per cent. subsidy on agriculture would mean something like six millions to the State.  Is the State prepared to foot a bill for six millions?  Even if it were, I, as a farmer's representative would not be prepared to back such a subsidy for the agricultural industry, because I believe in the final issue that subsidy would have to be paid by the agricultural industry, and in addition to paying this subsidy the industry would have to pay the salaries of a host of extra officials who would be employed to see that the subsidy was properly administered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamSears" hpid="Mr. SEARS Mr. SEARS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not find myself able to support the motion of Deputy Lyons.  I am not in favour of subsidies. I listened to Deputy Heffernan replying to the arguments of Deputy Lyons and Deputy Everett.  He did not content himself with condemning subsidies, but he went out of his way to condemn tariffs.  I do not think that he made a very good case against tariffs.  Any experiments that the Government have made, so far, with regard to tariffs, have had wonderfully good results for both capital and labour in this country. Take the City of Dublin.  A small tariff on tobacco has brought two new factories to the city in which hundreds of people are employed.  Is not that a grand thing to point to?  We have those young men and girls spending money in their own country instead of sending their money out of it.  Take the boot industry.  Deputy Doyle spoke of hundreds who have got employment in their own country and earn money <Col N="2052" /> from farmers and others for the boots they are making, instead of sending the money to Northampton or elsewhere. When there was trouble here about the Border question I met a man from Monaghan in the Lobby.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I hope that my little area will not be included in the Six Counties. When the tariff was put on boots I started a little factory in Monaghan I have sixty-five men employed and we are doing splendidly.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is an argument in favour of tariffs.  I listened to the case that Deputy Lyons put up about the woollen factory in Athlone where the hands are working on alternate days.  I wonder do they have to do without meals on alternate days?  That is the case of an industry that is starved for the lack of a tariff.  Take the case of the agricultural implement factory in Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I knew the town of Wexford when there were three factories in it and 1,500 or 1,600 men employed&mdash;as good a class of artizan as you would find in the whole world.  Those industries now employ 300 to 400 men.  If the farmers had given those factories any support, they would be getting better ploughs and cheaper ploughs than they are getting to-day.  There is a tariff wanted to-day.  Wexford men were thrown out of employment and foreigners are employed.  Deputy Heffernan has to send over his beasts or his produce to the foreigner to pay for the implements that he uses, and he has to pay the cost of transit.  Is that good business?  That the Wexford foundries should be closed and that people should be suffering is a scandalous thing.  I know of a case where a father of a family died of starvation, and in a fortnight afterwards the mother died from starvation.  Yet the farmer says that none but a plough from Yorkshire or Derbyshire is good enough for him. In fact, he says: &ldquo;I do not care whether those men are employed or not.&rdquo; That is bad policy.  Tariffs are needed for this country, and Deputy Heffernan is preaching a policy for agriculture that is suicidal.  He said that agriculture is the sole support of the State. If the State is standing on one leg, is not that a reason why we should put <Col N="2053" /> another leg under it?  Should we not have an industrial prop as well?  Deputy Heffernan says that they have to bring their goods into an open market. And he complains of that.  Are we not offering him a market at home, a better market, where he will not have the same competition?  In England, the small farmer has to bring his produce into competition with that of men who have farms large as a parish, who have motor ploughs and every facility for mass production.  The Deputy is crying out against the very thing that would make agriculture rich. When protection was proposed in America, all the American farmers protested strongly against it.  They said it would be the ruin of agriculture in America.  To-day the States of America in which they have industries are the States where land is highly valued.  In the States where there are no industries, farming is backward, the people are backward, the farms have a lower valuation, and the farmers are making no profits.  The fact that agriculture is prosperous in the industrial State is attributable to protection. If America, which is a Continent, with no other country near it, needs protection, surely a little island like ours, side by side with the foremost industrial country in the world, needs protection.  &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; asks Deputy Heffernan, &ldquo;do not the manufacturers of Ireland compete against those of England?&rdquo; He might as well ask why does an ordinary man not enter the ring and compete with one of the leading pugilists?  England is a long way ahead.  It is, perhaps, the most highly-trained industrial country in the world.  We are behind.  They have a rich market at their door, whereas we have not.  They have mass production, where we have not.  But the case is not hopeless for the Irish manufacturer if we go the right way about it.</P>
    <P>We have a rich country and an intelligent people.  The manufacturers of England, Scotland and America are glad to avail of the service of our young men and young women.  They make good use of them, and when Deputy Heffernan, or men like him, get hold of a product made by Irish hands in England or America, they find no fault with it.  But there are men in this <Col N="2054" /> country who doubt everything Irish. The people who opened factories in Dublin recently and who are selling their goods in Dublin, are not proclaiming that their goods are Irish.  There is no advantage in proclaiming them Irish.  Some people have such a doubt of everything Irish that they purchase the foreign article in preference to the home-made article, thus acting contrary to the spirit in which the people of every other country act.  The only way to save agriculture here, and to save the country, is by tariffs.  I mentioned wheat-growing here one time, and the leader of the Farmers' Party scouted the idea.  &ldquo;Wheat in Ireland!&rdquo; he exclaimed. Of course, I could not set myself up as an authority on the subject against Deputy Gorey.  But I saw some men engaged in the milling trade in Ireland afterwards, and I asked if Irish land was so bad that we could not hope to grow wheat in it.  They told me that in the Crimean war the British army was fed on flour made from Munster wheat.  There was nothing wrong with Irish wheat and nothing wrong with Irish land then. If America had never been discovered, we would be using Irish wheat in our own home-made bread to-day.  Our scientists would probably be able to give us a wheat suitable to our climate, as the French scientists are producing a wheat suitable to the French climate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan referred to the poor wages paid to the farm labourers. How could they be paid good wages when we are paying £7,000,000 to the Canadian farmer to grow our wheat and paying the Canadian railway man to carry the flour down to the sea?  We have a line of ships carrying flour across the Atlantic, and Deputy Heffernan is afraid that the Canadian farmer will lose this profitable crop if we take to growing wheat.  Why should we not grow wheat?  Wheat is the mainstay of every nation in the world, and, since the war, all the small nations of Europe have taken to growing their own wheat.  Nothing can help us to grow wheat except a tariff on foreign flour and wheat.  At the present time we have wheat, eggs, butter and practically every article of produce coming in from New Zealand, China, Russia, Denmark and other countries, and we <Col N="2055" /> are told that agriculture does not require protection.  You say to the agricultural labourer that he cannot get a better wage, because this is a poor country.  You say to the worker on the Shannon scheme that he cannot get more than 32/- per week, because this is a poor country.  This is not a poor country.  We have the most fertile soil in the world.  As to the articles that you import, see the prices you pay for those articles.  Those are the dimensions of your market, and if the farm labourer has to put up with small wages, because this is a poor country, there should be a tariff put on, so that every class would bear the burden of the poverty of the country.  It does not necessarily follow that tariffs will always raise prices.  Mass production leads to cheaper prices, and if Pierces were producing a thousand ploughs, where formerly they were producing 100, the price per plough would be cheaper.  Tariffs can benefit both the farmer and industrialist.  There should be no antagonism between them.  There is nothing radically wrong with the farmer's son or with the young women of this country.  They are able to make any article.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sears puts it to the Dáil that tariffs are the saving of the country, and he relates what an advantage they have been to the few industries they have been placed on.

      <P>They benefited at the expense of the general public.  Deputy Sears made a powerful onslaught on the farmers for not buying Irish-made implements and goods.  There may be <Col N="2056" /> some truth in the charge, but I tell Deputy Sears that the farmer is prevented from buying those goods by his inability to pay for them, more than by any other reason.  The price of these goods is prohibitive in the present state of agriculture.  When no money is being made in the industry, the farmers must do with the old implements repaired. If there be any dereliction on their part in the purchase of Irish-made goods, that is the reason of it.  It is not the farmers who killed those industries. Their inability to buy those implements may have hurt them, but, when all is said and done, I do not think it was the farmers who were responsible for depriving a lot of these men of employment in the foundries.  Other reasons were responsible for curtailing their output.  I remember myself when they were in a flourishing condition and were turning out all the stuff that Deputy Sears boasted of.  What happened? A prolonged strike occurred in Wexford, with Mr. Larkin at its head.  He came down there and practically shut the foundries and they never recovered since.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lyons's motion is specific in respect of subsidies and grants to local authorities.  I suppose that is the reason why the Minister for Industry and Commerce was replaced by the Minister for Finance and why he has been replaced by the President. I feel that it is just worth my while to say that I am not in entire agreement with some of my colleagues in regard to their advocacy of a full measure of protection&mdash;if that means a general tariff&mdash;for everything imported and their opposition to subsidies in any event.  I do not take that view at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that industries may be sustained by State action: some by tariffs, some by subsidies or bounties, some by assistance, through financial aid and various means of that kind.  Different diseases require different remedies, and I am not going to shut out a subsidy where a subsidy is obviously the most effective and cheapest method <Col N="2057" /> for the general community.  I can conceive, for instance, a certain industry that it is very desirable to keep alive for the country's health, not for the interest of individuals, and yet that it is not desirable to put a tariff on every article imported of the kind produced by that industry.  So that in some cases a subsidy or bounty might be beneficent and I am not going to shut out subsidies.</P>
    <P>As to Deputy Heffernan's remarks, I should like to put this to him.  His contention is that the whole of the country's population is dependent, in the last resort, upon agriculture, and that all taxation is, in the last resort, paid out of the produce of agriculture.  That is the basis of his argument and the contention of farmers generally.  Men and women who are unemployed and are not adding to the public wealth must be consuming the country's wealth to keep them alive, whether in food, clothing, or otherwise, and their sustenance, at any rate on the hypothesis of the Deputy, comes out of the produce of agriculture.  On that assumption, would it not be better if these people who are living on the farmers' produce were adding something to the country's wealth and living better on the produce of the farmers? They are an actual cost to the community, to the agricultural elements in the community, as they are.  If they were producing they would be adding something to the total wealth of the community and becoming better and healthier citizens.  If the Deputy wants to insist, as he has the right to do, that the population must live out of the produce of agriculture as things are, is it not better that there should be some encouragement given to other industries, in addition to agriculture, so that these very people will not have henceforth to live merely upon the bounty that agriculture provides? Something to encourage and increase the total gross production of national wealth is required.  If that can be through agriculture so much the better. If it cannot be through agriculture, let it be through other things.  But it is preferable that there should be an increase both in agricultural wealth production and industrial wealth production, <Col N="2058" /> and I have not yet seen any other method in the present state of the country's economy than positive State assistance&mdash;that is to say, a community organised and deliberately assisting in the production of increased wealth.  That may be done by protection, by tariffs, in view of the general system of commerce.  It may be done by subsidies in some cases beneficently, but I think that we ought to recognise that there is a case made for positive State assistance to employ both labour and capital in this country for the production of greater wealth.</P>
    <P>There were two points raised by Deputy Byrne that I should like to emphasise.  He touched upon the very grave unemployment at present in the coachbuilding trade.  He spoke of the number of motor cars imported, and advocated a change in the fiscal system respecting motor cars, so that there would be encouragement given to the building of motor bodies here.  He probably exaggerated the number of unemployed in that trade, but probably half the total number of skilled coach-makers are idle.  I am told also that a concern, of which Deputy Byrne recently had something to say, is proposing to introduce a large number of motor buses, and is about to give, if it has not already given, orders for about 100 buses, which are to be made in England.  It is a matter very well worth the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, whether some kind of pressure could not be brought to bear upon industrial concerns, whether they are being assisted by the State or not&mdash;I do not know whether this one is&mdash;to get as much of their work done in this country as possible, and not to allow 100 motor buses to be imported while hundreds of coach-builders are idle here.</P>
    <P>Another point made by Deputy Byrne was in respect to bottle-making. Undoubtedly there is something not quite satisfactory in respect to this industry. I joined with other Deputies in urging that assistance should be given by tariffs to bottle-making.  I understand that considerable assistance was given to the industry in Ringsend through the Trade Facilities Act.  I wonder what enquiry was made in respect <Col N="2059" /> to the effect upon employment.  I think it is worth calling the attention of the Minister to that point.  A case is made by the men in Ringsend that, while with the new method of bottle-making by automatic machine, they make bottles in larger numbers, it would have very little effect in increasing the amount of employment.  From a return furnished by the Minister a few days ago, it is quite clear that whatever may have been the effect on the making of bottles, the effect upon employment has been very small indeed. On behalf of the bottlemakers, I have requested that the Minister will receive a deputation, and I would publicly urge him to give some attention to the case that these men make, that the automatic machine industry is not going to succeed by virtue of technical defects and unwillingness of purchasers to buy that particular class of bottle, and that there is a case to be made for what they call the hand machine bottle.</P>
    <P>They contend that three or four or five times the number of men could be employed making a much better bottle, and probably as cheap.  Deputy Egan may know something about that.  I am not making a case definitely and positively on behalf of these men, but I am urging the Minister for Industry and Commerce to examine the case they make and to consider it, having in view not merely the number of bottles that will be made in the country, instead of those made outside, but also the number of men that will be employed in making these bottles.  I put that forward, as I say, not as a special advocate of one method over the other, but I believe a case has been made, and I am doubtful whether full consideration was given to all the facts in respect of the effect upon employment when aiding this particular industry.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Lyons has been well advised in the formulation of his motion.  I do not know whether it is necessary to introduce legislation at this stage to do the work that he requires to be done.  Certainly a promise of legislation now would not assist people before Christmas.  I am with the Deputy in this, that the <Col N="2060" /> Government should look with sympathy on authenticated cases where industries are capable of survival, capable of serving the public interests well, but are in a condition of sickness and ill-health because of undeserving attacks from competitors abroad that are in a very much stronger position.  I do not think the doctrine of the survival of the fittest, taking into account the strong, well-organised foreign industry, in competition with the weaker and smaller capitalised industry in this country, should prevail.  I think we have a right as a community to stand by the smaller and weaker industries in this country so long as they show vitality, so long as they show some life and recuperative power.</P>
