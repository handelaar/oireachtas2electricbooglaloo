      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that Mr. John Nallen obtained a decree for £30 at Birr Sessions in March, 1924, for goods taken by Irregulars, and a further decree for £80; that he has not received payment of any of the money yet; further, if he will state when it is expected to pay this man, and what is the cause of delay.</P>

      <P>Mr. Ambrose, <Col N="1054" /> on behalf of himself and others, filed an application for a guarantee under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, in respect of a loan of £10,000, the proceeds of which it was proposed to apply to the development of mineral deposits in Achill Island.  As the result of correspondence with my Department, it appeared that the applicants could not raise the working capital which would be necessary for the schemes they had in view and, accordingly, Mr. Ambrose, by letter dated the 14th May, last, intimated his desire not to proceed further in the matter.  The application was not, therefore, submitted to the Advisory Committee.</P>

Wexford, by National troops on the 24th February, 1923, a lady's expanding gold wristlet watch, £2 10s. in cash, a gent's gold albert chain, and a double-barrelled shot-gun, were stolen by National troops; that Mr. quigley applied for the return of those articles, and, failing their return, compensation to the amount of £20; that now, after a lapse of two years, Mr. Quigley is informed by the Army Finance Department that all efforts to trace the missing articles or establish the identity of the culprits have failed, and that no compensation can be paid from Army Funds, and that Mr. Quigley's only remedy is a prosecution of the offenders under ordinary law, and whether the Minister will reconsider the claim to compensation in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the First Reading of the Oireachtas (Payment of Members) (Amendment) Bill, 1925.  It is a Bill to exempt allowances paid to or included in certain salaries of members of the Oireachtas under the Oireachtas (Payment of Members) Act, 1923, from income tax (including super-tax) and to relieve members of the Oireachtas from the suspension or abatement of pensions payable out of public moneys by reason of the receipt of such allowances or the inclusion thereof in such salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is necessary because it was found that the intention that was in the minds of the drafters of the Oireachtas (Payment of Members) Act, 1923, was not actually carried out, and that the allowance of £360 to members of the Oireachtas is not actually free from income tax, although that was intended. The other part of the Bill is necessary because certain pensions&mdash; particularly pensions under the Military Service Pensions Act&mdash;were abated <Col N="1057" /> substantially in the case of members of the Oireachtas, although people earning more substantial sums outside the Oireachtas would not have had their pensions abated.</P>

      <P>May I ask if this is one of the Bills that was suggested as likely to be brought in before the adjournment, but the further stages of which would not be taken until after the resumption in October.  There were a number of Bills which the Minister suggested would be dealt with in that way, and I would like to know if this is one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. We were unaware of the necessity for introducing this measure until quite recently. It would have been introduced directly the matter was brought under our notice, but that other matters were engaging the attention of the draftsman, and it was not possible to have this measure dealt with.  In my view&mdash; I am not sure as to whether it is entertained by the Minister for Finance or not&mdash;this is a measure which ought pass into law without delay, the position at the present moment being an undesirable one from the administrative point of view.  This Bill seeks to remedy a state of affairs which ought not to have arisen, but which, having arisen, ought to be remedied at the earliest possible moment.  This is not one of the measures which it was intended should be introduced before the adjournment and left over to the autumn to be dealt with further.</P>

The general principle of it has been before the Dáil, in consequence of the Budget statement, for a considerable time.  In order to expedite the passage of the Bill, and still leave sufficient time between Second Reading and Committee Stage, I would like to have the Second Reading on Friday if it were agreeable to the House.</P>

It may be a measure that will not excite any controversy, but we do not know whether it will be a Bill of few clauses or of many clauses, and between now and Friday gives very little time for consideration of it.  If circulated to-night, it would really mean only one day for consideration of the Bill.  I think the time for speeding up will come after the Second Reading, and not before it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned last night we were dealing with sub-head (M).  In connection with this sub-head, I want to raise a question as to the method of procuring statistics with regard to the agricultural conditions of the country&mdash;the number of acres of tillage, the number of cattle, and so on.  The Gárda Síochána, taking the place of the old police, are responsible for collection of the returns. They give, on the information of the occupier of the farm, accurate returns, <Col N="1059" /> as far as possible, of the number of cattle of different ages, horses of different ages, sheep of different ages, tillage, hay, grass, and all the rest. Sometimes it happens that farmers have more than one farm, and that these farms are situate in different police areas or different District Court areas.  A Civic Guard comes to the farmer and finds out the number of acres he has got altogether.  Then he will deal with the amount of tillage and cattle on the particular farm which is situate in his police area.  He will not deal with anything on the other farms, with the result, I take it, that no question has ever been asked in connection with his other farms. The result is that the returns in every case are not correct.  The particulars of those farms, on which the farmer is not living, are not embraced by these returns at all.  I would like to know if the returns thus compiled by the Gárda Síochána are available in any Government Department, and if they are available to Ministers and members of the Government, because I find references made in Cavan on Sunday last to questions arising out of those statistics.</P>

      <P>I will only refer to it in so far as it affects the Department of Agriculture, where they are interested in correct statistics.  A column is not set aside in those returns which would facilitate a Civic Guard, when he goes around on duty, in dealing with particulars of farms outside his own area.  A farm outside his area, though belonging to a farmer living inside his area, is not touched upon.  If some column was provided in the form which would enable the farmer's holding, even though it is outside the Civic Guard area, to be included in the return of statistics, it would be much better and more satisfactory.  Correct returns are not given at all now, or asked for, in regard to what I may term outside farms.  If some provision, such as I suggest, were made it would tend towards accuracy and correctness, and we have not those at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to obtain some information on two points, the first of which is the position of the &ldquo;Officer (Agricultural Labour Disputes).&rdquo; Are we to understand that the duties of this officer are confined to dealing with agricultural labour disputes and that he is only paid when there are agricultural labour disputes? Is it expected that in such a case there will be sufficient number of agricultural labour disputes to warrant our paying him £594, plus bonus, for the current year, or is he supposed to be the stimulus to one side or the other in possible disputes for the purpose of keeping the occupation alive?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In what direction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>In either direction, whatever may be most likely to perpetuate the job.  However, I take it there are other duties performed by this officer.  I merely draw attention to the designation and I suggest that it is desirable to have at least a little explanation in regard to the position. We would like to know if it is a proper description of his office.  Secondly, I would like some information as to the <Col N="1061" /> basis on which the allowance to farmers for keeping agricultural costings accounts&mdash;£600&mdash;is made and how many persons in the country are likely to participate in this grant.  It is undoubtedly a very important duty and ought not to require a great deal of money to encourage it.  I would like to know the views of the Department regarding the amount of encouragement necessary in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister what the figure of £500 for publicity means.  What form of publicity are we getting for the £500? Has it any reference to leaflets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to Deputy Gorey's point, a form is sent to the Civic Guard barracks which sets out that every Gárda collecting statistics is to collect, in his own area, particulars in regard to farms in that area.  He goes around with that form in his hand and visits, say, a man who owns two farms, one inside and one outside the area.  He gets particulars only in regard to the farm in his area; he refuses to take any particulars in regard to the outside farm.  There is no column in which he could enter that information.  Then some other member of the Civic Guards has to collect statistics in the area where the outside farm is situated.  There is no farmer there and there is no house at which to call for particulars.  That farm is likely to be missed.  I will give an understaking to see whether, in circumstances of that sort, statistics in regard to the second farm, likely to be uncollected now, will be collected and I will take whatever steps are necessary to see that statistics are obtained either by way of empowering the Civic Guard to collect statistics, not only in regard to the farm inside, but also in regard to the farm outside the area, or by some other method.  I will undertake to see if some suitable arrangements cannot be come to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the statistics were collected, not through the Civic Guard, but through a return sent to the occupiers of land, requesting them to forward particulars of stock and tillage and other things by a certain date.  The Minister's statement came as a surprise to me when he indicated that they had reverted to the old practice that was observed in the days of the R.I.C.  I was also unaware, until I looked up Estimate 51, that agricultural statistics were now under the control of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I remember that, at least two years ago, the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Mr. Merrick, dealt with that matter.  Has a change been made in the interval?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of whether it is proper to have the statistics in connection with agriculture collected by the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Industry and Commerce is something that could be debated in connection with the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I would suggest that the Deputy would defer this point until we come to the sub-head that provides moneys for that service.  The particulars are collected by the Department of Industry and Commerce under circumstances I have set out, and after consultation with the Department of Agriculture.  With regard to the collection of statistics by the Civic Guard, I take it the point that is troubling Deputy Gorey is to see that particulars in regard to a second farm will be collected.  At present, under the system operating, it may be that particulars in regard to the second farm are omitted.  I will give an undertaking to go into that matter and to consult with the Minister for Industry and Commerce with a view to seeing whether that can be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Johnson's point, I agree that the description &ldquo;Officer (Agricultural Labour Disputes)&rdquo; is misleading, and should be changed.  The Officer is one of the hardest worked men in the Department. He deals with agricultural labour <Col N="1063" /> disputes and all questions that have arisen, and they are extremely numerous, in connection with co-operative and proprietary creameries.  He has done that work during the last two years. It is the principal work that he has been on and it is difficult work.  It is work which takes up, not only his whole time, but the time of a large number of clerical and administrative officers. Between that work and minor duties in connection with agricultural labour disputes, his time is very fully occupied.</P>
    <P>I was asked what sum was paid to each farmer for keeping accounts.  The amount is £5.  A sum of £600 is provided. There is provision for paying one hundred farmers in the Free State in connection with keeping accounts. I hope this year we will spend all that money.  I think arrangements have been made for the keeping of accounts by four farmers in each county.  As regards publicity, that consists largely of pamphlets printed and published by the Department, touching on organisation, feeding, diseases, manuring, and so on.</P>

The provision also covers the production of new leaflets on new subjects which it is intended to keep on permanently and re-print.</P>

      <P>I would like to know from the Minister what the &ldquo;etcetera&rdquo; means under this sub-head. The sub-head itself is so wide that the word &ldquo;etcetera&rdquo; could mean anything from a stud turkey-cock to a wireless set for the village hall.  I cannot imagine how the word &ldquo;etcetera&rdquo; would apply amongst such a collection as stallions, bulls, corn mills, and scutch mills.  How are these loans being repaid?  The appropriations-in-aid show that £8,000,000 have been repaid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have said £8,000, as against the £19,000 we are voting.  Is the policy of granting loans being extended?  I think the Minister is very wise in lending money for the erection of village halls.  Under this sub-head it is stated &ldquo;Net sums advanced for ... erection of village halls and silos.&rdquo;  Is it the policy of the Department to erect village halls? It might be a very useful thing to erect some place where the farmers of the village could meet and discuss matters. That would be useful in places where, at the moment, facilities are unavailable. I think that the most potent cause and the most potent factor that makes for emigration is the dullness of the country.  A village hall, equipped with a wireless set would, for one thing, help a great deal and it would prevent the people in the country from crowding into the towns or going across the Atlantic.  If that is the policy of the Minister, I think it is a good policy.  We might be told what is being spent in connection with the erection of village halls, if anything is <Col N="1065" /> being spent, and I do not think it should be lumped in with such things as stallions, bulls, silos, and scutch mills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies are entitled to full information in regard to each sub-head; they have only to ask for it and, if it can be given them, it will be given.  I will not attempt to define the word &ldquo;etcetera.&rdquo;  I will say exactly how much of the £19,000 is being spent.  That is the way the sub-head has appeared in the Estimates always.  Village halls, silos, and all the other matters have been lumped in.  We are empowered, if we think it right, to grant a loan for the erection of a village hall, the erection of a silo, the purchase of a stallion, or the purchase of a bull.  We put in the word, &ldquo;etcetera,&rdquo; to save the trouble of coming later to the Dáil and possibly facing some criticism in regard, say, to the provision of a wireless set. Amongst the sums advanced were stallions, £5,000; agricultural implements, £10,000; and sprayers, which are also, I take it, implements, £3,000. Those loans are repaid at the rate of 5 per cent.  The method of repayment varies with the particular loan; as a rule it is paid in instalments over three or four years.  It would, to a great extent, depend on the loan.  This sort of loan has always been made.  I am not aware of the Department having lent money for village halls.  It is not the intention to do so this year. Power has always been taken, but the Department have never actually exercised it.  The method of repayment would obviously depend on the sort of loan it was&mdash;there are special methods with regard to stallions&mdash;and also it would depend on the amount of the loan.  In the case of loans for sprayers, one man might pay his loan off in a year and another in two years.  That matter is arranged on the recommendation of the instructor.  These loans have always been met, and they are coming in every year in lump sums. Perhaps there would be a loan of £400 in respect of a stallion.  That loan would be maturing for three or four years, and possibly the first year the owner would be able to pay £100. They do not pay on the principle of an <Col N="1066" /> annuity, with a sinking fund, but by instalments.  A loan of £1,000 would be an unusually big loan, and I do not think we have ever gone up to that, but take a loan of £500: A man might say, &ldquo;I will pay £100 the first year,&rdquo; and he could give good reason to show that he would have £400 spare cash at the end of four years.  At the end of that time the £400 would come in.  These loans have been going on for a long time, and consequently the appropriations-in-aid each year are pretty considerable.</P>

      <P>In connection with sub-head (N) (1), I wish to raise a matter, although the details of the sub-head do not specify anything in regard to it. Yesterday when dealing with another part of the Vote the question of contagious abortion was touched on, and it was suggested that it should be left over and be discussed on this sub-head.  I was saying yesterday that nothing, to my knowledge, has done more against the development of dairying in this country, has done more to break up cow-testing associations, has done more to break up the herds of the ordinary agriculturists than this plague of contagious abortion.  In the space of ten years farmers have suffered from three visitations of this scourge.  After building up dairies of a fairly good class of cattle, an outbreak of this disease has occured, and more or less swept away all that had been done.  A further effort was made and a new herd obtained.  Again, after a time another outbreak occurred, with the same result. <Col N="1068" /> If there is one thing more than another that is killing the dairying industry, the great key-industry of the nation, it is this plague of contagious abortion.  There have been efforts of prevention by means of spraying and washing out, and recently advice has been issued with regard to injections, so as to render the cattle immune.  I do not know how far that has been a success, because it has not had very much time to justify itself.  In dealing with this the Government staff cannot spend too much time, cannot even spend too much money, in trying to help and advise and in looking for methods to deal with this scourge.  Its cost to the country every year runs into millions; I do not think I would be exaggerating in stating that the losses amount to millions of pounds, and as a detriment to the development of the nation its effects cannot be overestimated.</P>
      <P>I would like to know what is being done in regard to research, because research is the only way in which it can be dealt with, what steps have been taken with the great colleges in other countries that are dealing with the matter, and what does the Government intend to do to keep abreast, and, if possible, to get ahead of the other people who are dealing with the matter.  I do not know if it is as bad in any other country as it is here.  I know that here it is a national calamity, worse even than the fluke we have recently had. The fluke has done a good deal of damage in sections of the country, but this disease we have always with us; it is annually exacting a tremendous toll from the resources of the agricultural community, and I think too much cannot be said in urging the Government to spend money and to do what they can to cope with this scourge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>While this scourge has been in existence for a number of years, and while the Department has done a great deal of very necessary work to combat it, there is one thing lacking; the Department will have to take other steps.  A large amount of money may be spent on research, and the more money spent on research in connection with this and other diseases <Col N="1069" /> the better, because such money would undoubtedly be well spent, but I, for one, feel that enough money is not being allocated for the purpose.  But I know this, that where the instructions of the Department were closely followed in cases where this disease had taken hold in some herds, the disinfecting of buildings, disinfecting cattle, and above all, the feeding of cattle with a certain type of hay, the condition of the land on which some of these cattle graze, which are all important points, the results were good.  Farms on which the disease had been for years changed hands and when the new owners followed accurately the instructions of the Department the disease became a thing of the past.  I mention that for this reason, that while I approve of Deputy Gorey's suggestion regarding the importance of the Department taking steps to deal with this scourge which is such a mighty loss to the country&mdash;because there are some farms on which dairy cattle are lost year after year through it&mdash;I say that the Department should take steps to see that knowledge of everything that has been done so far by it reaches every farmer, and above all, that the preventive measures which the Department has suggested and which have proved successful should be made known to every farmer who is liable to be affected. I think the necessity for taking proper percautions should be brought home to the farmers.  It is not a question of reporting it locally to the instructor, who cannot be in touch with every dairy farmer in the country, but that the Department must get in touch with dairy farmers whose herds are liable to it through being in contact with cattle that have been affected or otherwise.  The Minister will have to find means of bringing home the knowledge of these matters to every farmer who is liable to have an outbreak of this disease on his land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a footnote on page 179, dealing with the grant-in-aid. It says: &ldquo;Any unexpended balance of the Cattle Pleuro-Pneumonia Account is subject to the regulations contained in the Second Schedule of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894. <Col N="1070" /> The accounts in which the expenditure is recorded are examined by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.&rdquo;  I do not know whether there is in fact any account, or any credit to this account, existing and I am rather of opinion that it is intended to cover, not merely pleuro-pneumonia, but other diseases of animals.  Whether that is so or not I am anxious to know whether there is any provision made, whether there are annual sums set aside as an insurance fund to meet possible calls under this Act for compensation.  We ought not to lose sight of the possibilities, possibilities that an insurance company would take into account, that there may at some time be outbreaks of disease and demands for compensation.  Under this Act there is a statutory liability to pay compensation.  There are possibilities of outbreak sometimes, perhaps not just as great as the possibilities of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, but at least there are possibilities of outbreaks of pleuro-pneumonia, or other diseases of animals which are contagious. Having in view the experience of other countries as to the number of cattle which may have to be slaughtered, and the immense losses which would be occasioned to the country if that were to happen, I think we should be informed as to whether there are any sums set aside upon which calls would be made to pay the compensation, or whether it would simply necessitate new enactments and the raising of new moneys for the particular purpose when the occasion arose. I have no doubt we shall be told that the whole question of State liability and the possibility of calls upon the State cannot be treated as insurance, but if we knew that there was likely to be a call upon the State for compensation in case disease broke out of a widespread character, we might then feel it incumbent upon us to take steps beforehand, perhaps to call for contributory insurance for the purpose of meeting claims.  Of course the argument is very well known, that if compensation is likely to be paid, the likelihood of hiding disease is not so great.  It seems to me we ought to have in mind the possibility&mdash;remote, we hope&mdash;of disease breaking out, and the <Col N="1071" /> destruction and consequent loss of very many cattle.  It is, I think, opportune that this matter should be raised and that we should understand the position of the Department in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputies Gorey and D'Alton, there is no doubt whatever that farmers suffer far more from contagious abortion in cattle than from practically any other disease.  It would be very hard to measure the losses of the farmers, dairy farmers especially, each year as a result of it.  They have dairy herds and their cows abort.  They are counting upon so many spring calvers and so many autumn calvers.  Once one cow aborts, they may expect others to do it also.  The case is quite common where a man with twenty or thirty cows would experience fifteen or sixteen abortions per annum.  It is extremely hard to measure the losses that would be sustained by this country, and every other dairying country, from this disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a subject which has been receiving the attention of the veterinary profession and of the State Veterinary Departments of practically every country in Europe and the United States.  So far, there has been very little done to find anything that would give us any hope that a cure for the disease is likely to be found in the near future. Research is going on in Cambridge, in Scotland, Denmark, and especially in Sweden, going on in every country, in connection with it&mdash;that is to say, to find a cure.  Like tuberculosis, we have not got very far.  Most countries are considering the matter from the point of view of preventing the spread of the disease, once the outbreak occurs.  The usual advice given to farmers is, the moment an outbreak occurs to isolate the cows&mdash;to keep the cows that will not react to the test in one place, and the affected cows in another place.  You can say immediately whether cows have the germ of the disease in them. If they have, they will react to the test.  I was listening to a lecture myself at the R.D.S.  Show last year, in which the head of the London Veterinary College said that only a very <Col N="1072" /> small proportion of the herds of England were free from reactors, and that is very probably the case here.  The point is, that even though a cow is a reactor, it does not necessarily follow that it will abort.  In any event, there has been a test discovered which the Department will supply.  It is easily applied, or the Department will make the test.  The test will prove whether cows react or not, and that gives a certain amount of knowledge.  If the cows are not reacting, there is no possibility of aborting.  If you have 20 cows and one reacts, you had better sell her.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Sell her to some one else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not have said sell her.  You should get rid of her. But, even if most of the cows are reactors, and a farmer could not afford to get rid of them, it does not inevitably follow that they will abort.  In fact, it is the exception rather than the rule that they would abort.  The advice to isolate has been found impracticable so far as ordinary farmers are concerned, as they have not the facilities. As a rule, they have not got sufficient land to isolate the cows, and it would upset the whole economy of the farm for the year.  So far as the big farmer or breeder is concerned, he has plenty of land as a rule to isolate them, and in that way save himself from most of the losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the ordinary farmer is concerned, there is nothing that can be done that science can discover, except vaccinate, and sufficient tests have been made to justify the statement that vaccination, on the whole, is successful.  I can speak with considerable knowledge on that point, because I have seen experiments carried out, and I know fairly well from practical experience what happened in these cases.  It is the exception, and not the rule, so far as our experiments go, that the cow will abort, even if she reacts to the test after vaccination.  The Department have taken up the attitude of advising vaccination, and a great many farmers, particularly in the South, are availing themselves of that <Col N="1073" /> advice and vaccinating their herds, and I do not know of many cases in which cows have aborted afterwards. The culture is prepared here and made available to the farmer on application and, whatever else may be known, I think it is fairly well known among dairy farmers that they can get it from the Department.  It was believed, and it is still believed, that pregnant heifers should not be vaccinated, that cows should not be vaccinated until a considerable time after calving, and that a considerable time should elapse before they are vaccinated and mated again.  Experiments are at present being made in the Veterinary Department in connection with these three points.  As the farmer will understand, it is often most inconvenient to have to wait for three weeks before vaccinating certain cows.  It is also rather inconvenient to have to defer mating cows after vaccination.  It may put out all your plans in regard to winter milk, or in regard to having so many cows calving in spring, and so on.  It is a nuisance.  It is something that the farmer cannot do without losing money.  It might mean that he would have to sell cows at the wrong time, or that cows are calving at the wrong time.  Some of the money which was voted under the previous sub-head for veterinary research is to provide funds for an experiment which is going on under the head of the Veterinary Research Department on one of our farms in connection with these three points: to investigate the effect of vaccinating pregnant cows, just how long after calving you can safely vaccinate cows, and just how long after vaccination it is right to mate cows. These are the lines on which research is being carried on in connection with contagious abortion.</P>
    <P>Whether we spend further money or not on this question, it is not only a question of money but of men.  That is always the way in research.  It is a difficult matter, as the number of competent researchers is limited in any country.  So that when talking about research you must remember that unlimited money does not necessarily <Col N="1074" /> mean that you can start into research effectively all at once.  There is the story of the American millionaire who wanted to found a University and was willing to pay £1,000,000, provided there were 1,000 researchers available to do some work which would require scientific knowledge that was only acquired by one or two scientists in Europe.  We are doing research on these lines, and we have not lost sight of the fact that any discoveries, even on the lines I have mentioned, are extremely important.  We have got out a great many leaflets in connection with this matter.  They are got out immediately after the results are obtained. Everything I have said is in leaflet form, and has been circulated, and this leaflet is very largely bought. Research is being done all over Europe, in richer countries than this.  We can always get the benefits of research in other countries practically immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  I will let the Deputy know, as I am not clear about it.  There are at least 1,000 orders issued under the Diseases of Animals Act.  With regard to the point raised by Deputy Johnson as to the Diseases of Animals Acts and the various accounts it is a highly complicated subject.  These two accounts are very intricate, and will require some explanation.  Let me say first that there are seven or eight Acts, all called the Diseases of Animals Acts, administered <Col N="1075" /> either by the Department or by the local authorities.  The diseases dealt with, so far as I remember, are&mdash; cattle plague, pleuro-pneumonia, foot and mouth disease and swine fever.  I will stop there and say these are diseases which the Department are responsible for and deal with direct.  They are not dealt with by the local authorities, and they are paid for out of taxation. Of these diseases, the only important one at the moment, I am glad to say, is swine fever.  Cattle plague is practically unknown and pleuro-pneumonia is very rare.  Foot-and-mouth disease has not been in existence in this country for some years, but, of course, it may occur at any time.  So that last year and this year the disease that we are really concerned with is swine fever.  The diseases dealt with by local authorities under the Diseases of Animals Act and paid for by rate, except so far as the Department of Agriculture gives a grant-in-aid, are numerous&mdash;epizootic enphalitis, anthrax, and a hundred and one diseases.  They do not occur very often.  The diseases that the veterinary officer is called upon to manage are sheep scab and bovine tuberculosis.  The House will remember the diseases which the Department is most concerned with are foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever, and the local authorities are concerned with sheep scab mainly and bovine tuberculosis. Although the pleuro-pneumonia account is a special account of the general cattle diseases fund, there are two accounts in that fund&mdash;the name of one account is the general fund account, and the name of the other is the cattle pleuro-pneumonia account.  The general account is replenished by rate, and it is for the purpose of recouping local authorities certain of the sums which they pay in connection with the diseases that they deal with direct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cattle pleuro-pneumonia account is voted, except in cases where it is not in credit, and then there is a transfer made from the general account, which is the general cattle diseases account. It is paid by vote, and that is the particular account from which is paid the expenses which the Department incurs <Col N="1076" /> in administering the diseases I mentioned, notably swine fever.  It is rather misleading that swine fever should be paid from an account called the cattle pleuro-pneumonia account. The cattle pleuro-pneumonia account is the account which finances any operations of the Department in connection with the four diseases I mentioned, of which only two are really urgent, swine fever, and foot-and-mouth disease.  It is always a little in credit, but it is voted every year by grants from the Dáil.  This year you have grants-in-aid of the cattle pleuro-pneumonia account for the cost of execution of the Diseases of Animals Act as respects swine fever, £8,250. We do not contemplate that there will be any expenses this year in connection with cattle plague which I think is non-existent in the country for many years, or cattle pleuro-pneumonia.  As far as foot-and-mouth disease is concerned there is a token grant of £400. That is a grant to enable us to come to the Dáil for one million or two millions, or whatever the amount might be, in the event of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the country. Simplified, it comes to this, the only diseases we think it necessary to make provision for are these two diseases, foot-and-mouth disease, and swine fever.  There are, as I pointed out, only four diseases dealt with directly by the Department; two of them are non-existent, but the other two, foot-and-mouth disease, and swine fever, are the only two which we can contemplate, so to speak, at the beginning of the year.  It would be quite out of the question at the beginning of the year to ask the Dáil to vote a big sum of money for foot-and-mouth disease which we all hope may not occur. What we do in connection with it is to put on a token Vote to enable the Minister for Agriculture to ask the Dáil afterwards if necessary for an increase. But there is a full provision made for swine fever, and swine fever is practically non-existent, except in Dublin and perhaps a little in Cork and Limerick.  These are the only two diseases that are provided for.  The Pleuro-Pneumonia Account deals with these four diseases I named, and provision <Col N="1077" /> is always made under this sub-head. I think that covers the ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would not be out of order to ask whether there is any provision made in any of these accounts to&mdash;shall I say&mdash;form an insurance fund to cover losses that will be sustained by the closing of ports, owing to disease in other countries, and whether the Minister has considered the desirability of making provision in that respect by means of alternative use of the cattle which have been refused export facilities or otherwise.  Perhaps this is opening a question rather a little bit aside from this particular Vote, but I suggest that this is the time when there is no restriction, or practically none, and when disease is not prevalent in either country, that the matter should be given consideration.  I suggest the best insurance would be an alternative method of dealing with cattle refused facilities for export.</P>

      <P>I am not quite satisfied, taking all the circumstances into consideration, that this ought not to be made a notifiable disease.  Very drastic steps will have to be taken to try to stamp it out.  Deputy D'Alton mentioned that by proper precaution, and by using all the means at your disposal, you could clear your premises of the disease.  But it would creep in without your knowing anything about it.  Anybody who has animals for stud purposes can very easily tell you that the first injection you give is when your heifers begin to abort.  An injection of this vaccine is not recommended at a late stage in pregnancy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter that can scarcely be dealt with by question and answer in the Dáil.  It is a matter for serious consideration.  Men who have animals of this description take them to the fair and make the best hand they can of them, and these animals pass the disease around the country. People who have these animals will not tell you anything about them, and this plague in that way is being kept alive all over the country.  It has been said that the better-class milker is most subject to infection.  I am not at all sure that the disease ought not to be made notifiable.  Perhaps it is a matter that the Minister will take into consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickLeonard" hpid="Mr. LEONARD Mr. LEONARD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEONARD</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he cannot see his way to make provision for recompensing owners of tubercular cattle.  In the next Vote we actually vote money to local authorities for cattle suffering from tuberculosis that are destroyed, but these are cattle that are palpably <Col N="1079" /> suffering from the disease and are notified to the local authorities by the owner.  The local authorities' Vet. certifies that they are suffering from tuberculosis.  They are slaughtered and the owner gets compensation. There is a certain number of cases that occur every year in which valuable fat cattle, which show no sign of tuberculosis while they are alive, are found to be suffering from the disease in its initial stages, and the whole loss of these beasts falls on the last owner. I do not think that is fair or just or right.  A beast, because it is well fed and in good condition, is sold, say, in the Dublin market, for £35 or £36.  It is found by the Government Inspector after slaughter to be suffering from tubercular disease in its initial stage, and the carcass is condemned in the interests of the public.  Why should the loss fall on the owner of that beast, who in the case of Dublin is generally the butcher?  This man's property is lost for the benefit of the health of the community, and where the Minister makes provision for losses that may occur in the case of other diseases I would ask him to consider very seriously the possibility of providing for the recoupment of these losses.  While the law, as it is at present, does not provide compensation for the loss of a tubercular beast which, while it is alive, does not show that it has tuberculosis, there is an enormous temptation to pass on as much as possible of that tubercular beast's meat to the public.  You have the danger to the public health of that being done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickLeonard" hpid="Mr. LEONARD Mr. LEONARD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEONARD</NameTxt>
      <P>I want it to be clearly understood that the cattle I alluded to are not cases in which the beast was palpably sick and was simply condemned because the Government inspector found that out before the beef was eaten.  The cases I have alluded to were cases in which the cattle <Col N="1080" /> were apparently in perfect condition. I have known of cases within the last two years of cattle costing over £40 a head being condemned when they were slaughtered, but the number of these would be very, very small.  I do not suppose that, in the Dublin market, there would be more than ten or twelve cattle of that class in the year.  I am not taking into account at all the cattle that are sent up from the country and sold at low prices on the chance that they will get through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickLeonard" hpid="Mr. LEONARD Mr. LEONARD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEONARD</NameTxt>
      <P>For one small tubercular lesion, the practice is not to condemn the whole carcass.  A considerable portion is cut away and condemned, and they are allowed to sell the remainder.  Even where a beast is condemned or where a carcass has a considerable number of lesions, when that beast showed no signs of disease when alive, and when, from the fact of its being sold as a fat beast to one of the best Dublin butchers&mdash;who would not buy it if he thought there was anything wrong&mdash;it would appear to be all right.  I do not think it is fair that that Dublin butcher, who makes a point of buying well-finished cattle, should be at the total loss when the beast is condemned in the interests of the public health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Deputy Johnson interrupted, I was going to say that Deputy Leonard and he were raising the same point.  It all comes back to the insurance question.  I think this is a loss that should be covered by insurance.  If it is not, where are you going to end?  It is an ordinary trade loss.  Losses of the same kind are incurred in every business. <Col N="1081" /> If all these losses were to be covered by funds set aside by the State, then you would have very big funds so set aside, and you would have a very big increase in taxation.  I think this is the sort of loss that should be covered by insurance.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the provision made to recoup owners of tubercular cattle, whose cattle are slaughtered because it is considered to be good State policy to do so, in order to stamp out tuberculosis, should be extended any further than it must be extended. We do not, as a matter of fact, pay the whole cost in such cases.  If the beast is slaughtered in the early stages of tuberculosis, the owner gets two-thirds; if slaughtered in an advanced stage, he gets one-third.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of insurance is a very big and a very important question. There are two or three classes of insurance. You may have voluntary insurance, arranged for by the farmers themselves through associations, or insurance arranged for by the State, or, if you like, insurance which is partly one and partly the other.  I have considered that question very often.  As far as insurance by the State is concerned, you are estopped there by the consideration which other Governments in a similar position are estopped&mdash;that if you admit that principle it might be carried a very long way.  At the present time, Irish cattle slaughtered in England, provided they are not slaughtered within the period or at the detention port, are paid for by the British Government.  Apart from any other consideration, you have to consider very seriously the possible reaction of making State provision here for insurance of Irish cattle.  A good many people have been suggesting here and on the other side of the water, that, perhaps, insurance would be the right way to cover these losses in connection with foot-and-mouth disease. We have to be very careful not to do anything which would be construed as a departure from our position in insisting that Irish cattle, when slaughtered in England, be paid for by the British Government.  On the other hand, there is a question as to whether the State could not help in some way <Col N="1082" /> organisations of farmers or butchers, of associations of that sort, to establish an insurance scheme.  We probably could help, not so much by putting up funds&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>By recouping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  But we have got to have a scheme put up by the farmers' organisations.  They have got to do a little thinking on it themselves.  Take the case that Deputy Leonard has just mentioned.  That is obviously a thing that should be considered by a body like the Dublin butchers.  Take the other case, where a couple of thousand pounds' worth of cattle were slaughtered in an English detention yard some time ago.  Three or four dealers were very heavily hit indeed by that.  The whole thing only amounted to £5,000 or £6,000, but the number on which that loss fell was very small, and in some cases they might not be very well able to afford it.  That is a case where we could not possibly, for the reasons I suggested before, admit the principle that we should pay, but that is certainly a case for the cattle trade which is, I understand, amalgamated in one organisation. It is for them to put up some sort of insurance, and if we can be of any real help in any direction in connection with that, let them put the scheme before us, and it will be considered in a helpful spirit.  We can do nothing until the scheme is put before us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if there is any use in my raising the point I had in mind, because the Minister has just touched upon it now.  I have been asked to refer to a case of cattle slaughtered at the time of the last outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.  I think it happened at the end of 1923. As the Minister said, some people suffered loss at that time who could ill afford to suffer it.  He said that the only means of improving that is by insurance, but that it is up to the cattle trade to arrange that.  I think that is right.  I think it is up to the cattle trade&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It would, perhaps, be well if I should say now that what I <Col N="1083" /> suggested might not mean insurance, but might mean funds lying there which would be available.  Probably that would be much better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be some form of insurance.  But the point is that there was no insurance in the past and no suggestion of insurance, and those men are in a very unfortunate position.  They had no control whatever over the position.  The cattle were shipped across like all Irish cattle, and they were quite free from disease.  But, owing to the unfortunate outbreak of disease in the port, not conveyed from Ireland at all, but conveyed from England, those cattle were slaughtered. Some men lost practically their all, owing to the slaughter of those cattle, and they are still down and out on account of the loss incurred.  The opinion I formed during the discussion was that the Minister was not adamant in this matter, that he was still open to consider it, and that he was still open to suggestions.  I would like to know if his answer is absolutely final, and if he says that nothing can be done.  I would ask him to give serious consideration to the losses that have been suffered, particularly by those men who had all their capital at stake.  There were others who had only a small portion of their capital at stake, but I presume no distinction can be made.  I would ask the Minister to say if it is possible that anything can be done?</P>

I would be glad to know if it is the same veterinary inspectors the Department employ to deal with the diseases in connection with which they retain control as the local authorities employ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Then these are independent of the local veterinary <Col N="1084" /> surgeons for the other diseases.  I wish to support the idea of Deputy Gorey that abortion should be made notifiable. It would be also a good thing if the Minister would consider the case of cattle that have been subjected to the tuberculin test and have been found tubercular.  Those cattle&mdash;this specially applies to dairy cows&mdash;should not be allowed to be sent to the nearest town for the supply of milk to the people of that town.  In cases where veterinary surgeons have applied the tuberculin test and found tuberculosis, cattle have been sent to Cork, Dublin, Limerick and other towns and their milk has been given to children, thus endangering their health.  That is a very important consideration, because I am afraid there are a large number of dairy cattle tubercular in the country. I do not think there is the same amount of tuberculosis amongst fat cattle.  This is an important matter, and I hope the Minister will give it consideration.</P>

      <P>With regard to the point raised as to our policy in reference to the administration of the Diseases of Animals Act by local authorities, I think that applies largely to the veterinary surgeons who deal with the three diseases mentioned.  As a rule, there were two or three in each county, and there was some question of changing that system.  While it is very arguable that one veterinary surgeon, one whole-time officer for each county, would be able to do the work more efficiently, we have to try, and we are trying, to keep in mind the question of whether we could afford to dispense with the services of one or two veterinary surgeons in each county.  We are trying to work out a scheme which will have as many of the advantages of both as possible.  It will be a scheme that will enable us to control the work of the veterinary surgeons just as we control the work of a whole-time officer, and at the same time we will try to obviate having the local authorities dispensing with the services of one or two veterinary surgeons in each county. Next month there will be a conference with the veterinary profession, <Col N="1086" /> and this conference will deal with all the points arising out of that matter. Later on, when I get the figures, I will give the Deputy the exact sums spent last year.</P>

      <P>The regulations for the purposes of this Act (Livestock Breeding Act, 1925) are being prepared, and we hope to be able to publish them immediately. We hope to have the application forms ready before the 1st July. These are the forms on which each owner of a bull will apply for a licence. We will circulate these forms to all the G.S. Barracks, the county committees of agriculture and the post offices. They will be available there.  The forms will be quite simple, and all that will be required will be a few simple particulars which anybody can fill in.  We hope these forms will be properly filled in and returned by the end of July. Different particulars will be required; ages have to be given, and so forth. There will be a considerable amount of clerical work entailed, because there are 33,000 bulls in the country.  It will take a clear month before we have all the applications in.  I am sure a month will elapse before all the forms are returned, properly filled in.</P>

Posters will be displayed all over the country indicating the course to be followed in regard to the operation of the Act. There is one point I would like to refer to, and that touches on the question of age.  All bulls calved before the 1st January must be inspected first.  Subsequently, all animals calved during the first half-year up to the 30th June must be licensed before the 31st March of the following year.  The animal might be nine months, or might be fourteen or fifteen months.  All animals calved during the second half of the year must be licensed before the 31st August.  That is the important point.  For the first inspection, all bulls calved before the 1st January, 1925, must be presented for the inspection which will take place during the second <Col N="1088" /> week of September.

It would, of course, be absurd to go to pedigree breeders and pick them out for the purpose of dealing with ordinary bulls.  I may say that I have no idea as to who is to be appointed. I know that there are breeders of pedigree stock who would be first-class judges of bulls for the purposes of this Act, and whom most of the farmers' organisations would agree to.  I would not like to rule out <Col N="1089" /> any particular class.  We will try to get efficient, practical farmers who know their business.</P>

      <P>There are some matters under sub-head (o) (1) Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act, 1924, that deserve attention.  This act was recently put into operation, and its provisions are coming into actual practice.  Has the Minister any definite idea with regard to whether the stamp should be affixed by the exporter or, as we hold, at the source of origin?  I think the Minister provided that whichever would be found the most practical, it would be given effect to.  The Minister provided that in the Act.  I have gone to considerable trouble during the last six or eight months to find out the opinion of people who interest themselves in egg-production.  The unanimous opinion was that they prefer the stamp to be affixed at the source of origin, for several reasons.  First of all, it fixes responsibility, and, secondly, and most important of all, you arrive at the ideal you wish to attain in the least possible time.  There is also the question of expense.  If the exporter has to do, or has to get done, the stamping, when dealing with eggs in large quantities, it will mean that extra hands have to be employed, and responsibility will not be so fixed.  It cannot be fixed on the exporter, and it will not be fixed on the people who send in the eggs&mdash;the suppliers.  The exporter will compensate himself for the labour employed in branding, and for any loss created by differences in grade.  It will not in any way ensure a quick response to the principle underlying the Act.  I have spoken to a lot of farmers in the country, and farmers' wives, people interested, and they <Col N="1090" /> are unanimously of opinion that the proper way is to have the stamps applied at the source of origin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with the question of the appointment of the inspectors provided for under this sub-head. I notice, not alone in this case, but in every case where an appointment to the public service is to be made, that the advertisement states that ex-members of the National Army will get a preference, and that the appointments will be made by a selection board appointed by the Civil Service Commission.  I take, and have always taken, the view that no citizen has any more right than another to an appointment in the public service where the taxpayers' money is being spent, and I do question very seriously if one citizen, whether he has been in the National Army or not, has higher qualifications than any other man when it comes to questions of appointments of this or of any other kind.  We all know perfectly well that whatever service was rendered, and there was good service rendered by the men who joined the National Army, whether individuals joined for patriotic or for other motives&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to the point, if the Minister would refrain for a moment from interrupting me, that they were well paid for the services, whatever they were, that they rendered. The Estimates that have been passed here are the best indication of that.  If such a thing should ever have existed, the time has now arrived at any rate when that bogey should be dropped.  The same kind of thing was put up after the European war by Mr. Lloyd George and his friends, that the men who fought and won the Great War for England were the men who <Col N="1092" /> should get work and positions which were in the privilege of Ministers of the State and the Government to give.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Selection Board, I have read a speech made by the Minister for Finance at some dinner in the City of Dublin, where he said that neither he nor any of his colleagues have power to appoint even a shorthand-typist. I question that very much indeed, because I have discovered, and I think it should be within the knowledge of Deputies, that the men who compose the Selection Board appointed by the Civil Service Commissioners, are generally the heads of Departments of the State, or very highly-placed officials.  We all know that these men, whoever they may be, are very largely under the thumb of the Ministry, and for that reason appointments made in cases of this kind must have some bearing on the minds of the Ministers in regard to individuals who have made application.  I am making no accusation against the Minister for Lands and Agriculture at all, but against other Ministers.</P>

I know what would happen if I did.  The Civil Service Commissioners and the selection boards cannot be got at by a Minister with influence of any kind.  The heads of the Civil Service are men of character and reputation, and the fact that a senior officer, let us say, of the Ministry of Local Government or of Defence, or of Finance, is on the selection board to make an appointment, say, in the Land Commission does not mean that I can go to him and get at him.  That is not done.  We have our own responsibilities, number one, which would prevent us attempting it, and the particular officer in question, who is usually a high official, who is usually put there because he has some special knowledge, cannot be got at.  Therefore, from both points of view it is out of the question.</P>

That is all that there is in it.  I picked out at random a couple of Departments, the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Local Government, and spoke of appoinments in the Land Commission.  These were, of course, picked out at random.  I am merely pointing out that for every appointment that cannot be made by examination, and which requires a certain amount of technical knowledge, a certain amount of administrative ability, and a certain amount of general education, you must have a selection board made up of different kinds of people, people who have the requisite technical knowledge, the requisite administrative experience, and who are fair judges of what standard of education is necessary for the appointment.

I forget for the moment what the maintenance allowance is.

      <P>That is arguable.  It is a question for consideration whether estimates for educational work should not be brought all together.  This educational work was undoubtedly done in connection with the Act last year for the first time &mdash; deliberately done.  The Deputy may fairly state that we might abstract that from the total.  It does not amount to so much.</P>

      <P>I said it was arguable, and that is as far as I can go.  I have often considered the Estimates from the point of view of whether certain items should not be transferred from one sub-head to another.  There are good reasons for and against.  I am not saying that my personal opinion even would be that this should be transferred back to some educational sub-head, especially in view of the fact, as Deputy Johnson has pointed out, that this particular educational <Col N="1099" /> work is done in connection with the Act.  Of course we might argue whether it is in connection with the Act or not, but was done because of the Act, and in connection with the policy which the Act is also trying to further. One might argue that that would apply to the courses in the Munster Institute. On the other hand, this expenditure would not be incurred but for the Act. It was to meet the want that we felt would be there when we were looking for good officials at the beginning.  It is a very big question, which you cannot argue on a sub-head, as to whether the whole organisation of the Estimates might be changed.  There is a lot to be said on that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular sum is justified because it is required to <Col N="1100" /> make the Dairy Produce Act a success by having special training.  I do not see why it should come under the heading of education.  I know of no vote that is so necessary.  Farmer Deputies, like Deputy Hogan, who have knowledge of what is being done in preparation in order to make the Act a success, will appreciate the necessity for this particular education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with the principle of maintenance being included in scholarships.  In fact they would be no use without it.  The ordinary observer outside the Dáil sees in the estimates that we spend so much on education.  That is not a correct figure, because we find that, in addition to the sums that appear under education, large sums for educational purposes are administered under the agricultural Vote.  So that the sum put down in our estimates for education does not represent the money actually spent on education.  From that point of view it is desirable, and the opinion has been expressed outside and conveyed to the Minister for Finance, that our accounts might be made much more simple and definite.  All the steps that can be taken in that direction would be desirable, not only for Deputies but the public.</P>

      <P>What is the extent of these areas?  How long have they been scheduled?  What are the possibilities of wiping out the disease?  How far has the work of the propagation of specially selected seed proceeded, and what are the possibilities of the success of that seed in those areas, so that part of this Vote might be eliminated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, in fact, being eliminated gradually.  The Vote for 1923-24 was £3,664.  That was a special grant for the propagation of immune varieties of seed.  There are two of these areas scheduled.  They are small areas, but I could not give details as to the size.  The fact that black scab has only appeared in two areas has justified the policy of isolating the areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly before I became Minister for Agriculture.  They are scheduled three or four years&mdash; one of them at least.  The policy of the Department is to schedule the area to prevent export or import except under stringent conditions and to make arrangements for the propagation and distribution of immune varieties of seed.  I would not like to say how long they will remain scheduled.  We are very lucky that black scab has spread only to this very small extent.  It would be a very serious thing to take off the ban until we are abundantly satisfied that there is no danger.  Our investigations in regard to immune varieties of seed, and in regard to the disease in general, have not given any results that would justify the holding out of a hope that these particular areas will be made free areas within any short time.  I do not think there is any possibility <Col N="1102" /> at present of removing the limitations they suffer under.  On the other hand, we have spent a considerable amount of money in propagating and distributing immune varieties of seed, and for that reason we are able to reduce the sum under that particular sub-head.</P>

      <P>With regard to (o) (4), I would like to get some information from the Minister.  The other day a statement was made, I think by the Minister, that the Weeds Act was again going to be enforced.  I would like to know if proper investigation has been made into the question of spreading weeds in the country.  I know an intelligent farmer who maintains that thistles are not spread by the blowing of seeds, that they are spread by roots.  To all intents and purposes seeds do not cause any great spread of thistles.  That may seem a rather ridiculous statement to make, but I have known where thistles have been cut year after year and they still persist in growing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No; they are cut twice a year.  I know that sometimes they are cut after seeding, but in the case I speak of they are cut before seeding, and there are farmers who maintain that, to a certain extent, it is a waste of public money to enforce this Act.  I am not saying that that is correct, but I think it is a subject for investigation.  The enforcing of the Act means the employment of a number of inspectors, and a great deal of worrying to farmers.  I would like to be satisfied that we are fully justified in voting the amount required for such an item of expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My opinion is that thistles are propagated by seed and that is the opinion of the Department of Agriculture.  Supposing the Deputy were satisfied on that I would like to have his opinion as to whether the Act should be administered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to sub-head (o) (5), I do not really know <Col N="1103" /> what the conditions are, but the question Deputy Roddy put down would indicate that some quantities of foreign bacon, however small, are coming into this country, and the possibility of that stuff being re-sold, or re-exported, as Irish bacon, is something I would like to have information on.  There is a considerable consensus of opinion that sufficient attention is not being given to this question of looking after our exports and seeing that products of no other country are being sold as products of this country, and that our products are not being misrepresented. I have been told that it is customary for even business men in our own country to make people believe that the bacon they are selling is Irish bacon, whereas it may be Canadian or Danish, and not alone bacon, but many other commodities as well.  I am not satisfied that two inspectors are sufficient to look after all this, through the length and breadth of the country.  I think two are not nearly sufficient to do it.  I do not know what the position was in other days, but I think a considerably larger number of inspectors were engaged on this work.  I do suggest to the Minister, if the function of these inspectors is to see that none of the products of the Irish farmer is being misrepresented by having stuff from other countries sold here in the name of Irish agricultural products, that two men are not enough to do that work. If it is worth the money spent on the salaries of two men it is worth while doing it right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, I am informed that during the strike in Denmark recently a very considerable quantity of Irish butter was exported in kegs, and, of course, that means that it was sold in England as Danish butter, and it was sold when the market was against Irish butter to the extent of 20/- a cwt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the other side of the question.  We are selling Irish butter, and it is sold in England as Danish butter.  If the extra price went to the farmer I would be satisfied, but it does <Col N="1104" /> not go to the farmer.  I do not know whether the Minister's long arm could reach such a case.  If he can by any means get us the price that is paid for Danish butter, we will not object so long as we get the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different point.  There was no allegation that Canadian hay was sold as Irish hay. Canadian hay is coming in in very small quantities.</P>
      <P>These two inspectors are engaged mostly in investigating the question of whether butter contains margarine, or whether margarine is sold as butter. That is their main work.  I am not contending that these inspectors are sufficient to deal with questions arising in England, especially as to whether foreign produce is being sold as Irish produce.  They would be, of course, utterly inadequate for that.  We have not yet made final arrangements for inspectors of that sort in England. The reason is we are not quite sure of the number that will be required, and whether they should be part-time men or officials appointed by the High Commissioner or whether we should make use of certain people, perhaps in trade in England, for that purpose.  All these questions are being considered, and we will be in a better position to judge whether Siberian butter is being sold as Irish butter, or Chinese eggs as Irish eggs, when we have the Dairy Produce Act and the Eggs Act some little time in operation.  These two inspectors, as I say, were mainly employed in taking samples of butter. Of course they had to take samples in every case reported to them.  There are a few inspectors at present in England controlled by the High Commissioner and provided for in this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the case mentioned of foreign pigs coming into Sligo and being exported to England, there is an allegation that they were sold in England as Irish bacon.  We are investigating that at the moment.  We have not got any information that it is so <Col N="1105" /> It may be, but it will be investigated to the end.  We will be able to trace the bacon undoubtedly.  We will be able, I think, to make sure whether that was in fact sold as Irish bacon or not, and we can take steps accordingly; but we have not succeeded in getting that information as yet.  I said there were two cases; but, I think, that was the only case that was brought to my notice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has pointed out that the inspectors that are referred to here have as a duty mainly the testing of whether butter as sold retail contains margarine or whether margarine is being sold as butter.  I wonder whether there is a duplication of responsibility in this matter between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Justice.  Chicory sold as coffee is another instance of adulteration.  Are we to take it that only in respect of the adulteration of butter, or the misdescription of butter, is the Department of Agriculture responsible? It seems to me the time has come for the proper allocation of duties in respect of the sale of impure food or the detection of adulteration.  I cannot see why this particular police function should be the function of the Department of Agriculture, when all other similar functions in respect of the adulteration of food is under a different Department.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should have this matter discussed with the Minister for Justice and arrange for the bringing together in one Department of all the police functions in respect of misdescription, false description and adulteration of food.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the co-ordination of all these services is undoubtedly a question for consideration, not only here, but in England.  It is a big question.  It is bound up also with our trading in other countries, and with the whole question of appointing trade agents.  Having the right sort of agents makes the question a big one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a distinct difference between the question <Col N="1106" /> of the responsibilities of the Department of Agriculture acting on behalf of producers in respect of the sale of produce in other countries, and the question I have raised.  They would not initiate or be responsible for a prosecution in another country.  As regards goods sold in this country to the detriment of the consumer, that is a matter which surely should be the business of the Department of Justice, rather than the Department that represents the producer.  That is where I make a distinction. I think it is quite clear.</P>

A number of inspectors were previously engaged on this work who are not engaged on it now, and a good deal of stuff has been sold as Irish agricultural produce that is not Irish produce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite as bad as it looks, because they generally get information.  It is not a question of scouring the country or of rushing into this shop or that.  They generally get information, one way or the other, as <Col N="1107" /> to cases of adulteration, and they can so deal with specific cases.  I am aware that since the year 1922 there were not more than two inspectors on that work under the Department of Agriculture. I can vouch for that.  I do not know what happened before that. There have been prosecutions; there were a good many prosecutions last year.</P>

In years gone by, at any rate, the duties carried out by the agricultural analyst under this Act were, I am aware, very valuable.  They were taken advantage of largely in connection with manures and feeding stuffs. I would like to know whether there is any other Department doing the work that was hitherto done by the chief agricultural analyst, or whether it is undone.  If it is undone, it would be well if we had some information as to the reason.  There is no doubt that impurity and uselessness are very prevalent in regard to many manures and feeding stuffs from a chemical-analysis point of view.  A great many of these articles are marketed, and this Act, if I remember rightly, imposed upon the seller of an article the responsibility of stating the analysis.  There surely must be some check as to whether that analysis has been maintained in respect of the article sold.  If there is no officer on whom the responsibility lies of testing submitted samples, it means that the Act is in abeyance.  If the Act is in abeyance, probably many people are being defrauded because of the sale of useless manures, and unsatisfactory feeding stuffs.</P>

      <P>It would be extremely serious if that service were dropped, or even left in abeyance.  The allowance is not there, but the office and the service are there.  The reason for that is that, as a matter of general policy, it has been decided that all the analysis <Col N="1108" /> shall be done in one Department by the Chief State Chemist.  Officials in other Departments who have been doing that work have been transferred to the Department of the Chief State Chemist.  He is now doing the analysis for this Department and for every other Department, with special officers, of course, for special work.  The inspection of manures, fertilisers, and feeding stuffs, is done by all the instructors and inspectors of the Department, except the veterinary inspectors. There is no falling-off whatever in that regard.  The inspection is taking place, and is being carried out at least as energetically as ever it was.  We all realise the necessity for that service.  No Department of Agriculture could do without a Department which would make analysis available to the farmer to show whether or not fertilisers or manures were up to standard.  That is being done at present by the Chief State Chemist, who has a special staff for that purpose.</P>

      <P>Under sub-head (p) (Appropriations-in-Aid), I want to put a few questions.  I see in the fourth line, &ldquo;Receipts from students' fees, sale of livestock, farm produce, rents, etc.,&rdquo; with particulars of the receipts from the different colleges.  On the next page, I see &ldquo;Receipts from sale of dairy bulls at reduced prices, fees for leasing of such bulls, and registration fees, £1,250.&rdquo;  I want to know why these two items are not treated as one.  Are the receipts in the second case in respect of bulls that are purchased at shows and then sold to farmers at reduced prices?  I see, also, another item, &ldquo;Dairy Produce Act, 1924 &mdash; Receipts from fees for registration, etc., £2,800.&rdquo;  That seems to me to be a very low estimate of receipts from fees.  I would like to know from the Minister at what rate he has calculated them and what quantity of butter exported he has calculated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the second question, I take it the point is whether we decided on 2d. per cwt. or 4d. per cwt.  That point does not arise, because the export part of the Dairy Produce Act will come into operation only next year.  Part I. and the general provisions only come into operation this year.  The question of export will not, therefore, arise until next year. With regard to receipts from the sale of dairy bulls at reduced prices, that refers to an item in (g) (2)&mdash;&ldquo;Purchase and insurance of dairy bulls for leasing or re-sale at reduced prices&mdash; £3,000.&rdquo;  There was always provision made in the Endowment Fund for that purpose.  You may buy a bull for £200 and sell him at £60.  That has been going on for a long time, and this year <Col N="1110" /> we calculate that we will get about £1,250 in connection with these sales. What we will get from the purchaser will be, of course, considerably less than we pay for the bull.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at Deputy Wilson putting that question. He ought to know the practice.  Cow-testing associations from various parts of the country make representation and prove that they have no premium bull within their area.  They may, perhaps, prove that though they had a premium bull they had a bit of bad luck, and he died.  We have to make up our minds as to the most suitable centres where a few valuable bulls might be placed. Some district might, perhaps, have very valuable pedigree cows.  But these bulls cost a lot of money, and farmers could hardly be expected to buy a stock bull which would be up to the pedigree of the cows.  It would be of great advantage to them if, instead of asking them to spend £200 or £300 on a bull to mate with their particularly good cows, we bought a bull and leased it to them. The following year we would lease it to another district, and so on like that. A small farmer might have three or four pedigree cows.  He might have bred them himself or come by them cheaply.  It would be hard to expect him to pay £300 or £400 for a stock bull.  We would lease him that bull and lease it to the other farmers next year. In the ordinary way, that man, who might have very valuable cows, would be only able to give about £50 for a bull.  It would be very valuable for him, <Col N="1111" /> or for a cow-testing association, to get one of these bulls for a year.</P>

      <P>The Dáil will observe that there is an increase of £60,376 in this Estimate, and it is made up under different sub-heads:&mdash;Salaries, wages and allowances, £14,908; travelling expenses, £10,000; Solicitor's Department, £1,845; contribution towards charge for excess stock, £23,500; improvement of estates, £10,000.  Practically all those items explain themselves. The increase is largely on the outdoor staff, and, if Deputies will turn to sub-head (a), they will find there have been considerable increases in the outdoor staff.  There have been thirtytwo temporary inspectors appointed during the last year.  The increases in the Solicitor's Department are simply normal increases, in view of the normal increase in work.  The contribution towards charge for excess stock was incurred in connection with pending sales which fell due for financing up to the passing of the Land Act of 1923.  In regard to the improvement of estates, the figure for 1924-25 was £190,000; it is now £200,000.  That is for the purpose of making houses, <Col N="1113" /> roads, fences, etc., on estates as they are being purchased and divided.  We expect we will require £100,000 for that next year.  There is an increase also in respect to telegrams and telephones. The staff is increasing, especially the outdoor staff, and it is fairly certain there will be an increase under that sub-head next year.  It is rather a simple Estimate as compared with the Department of Agriculture.  I will await specific queries.</P>
      <P>When I was opening the debate in connection with the Department of Agriculture estimate, I gave certain figures and other particulars as to the number of agricultural holdings in this country, and mentioned what could be done under the Act of 1923.  The figures are very important, and it is essential that the House should realise what those figures mean and what is their implication.  It is extremely hard to get accurate figures; it will take some time to do so.  I mean by that figures that will please the statistician. We can, however, get figures accurate enough to give a picture of the problem that confronts us, and the possibilities from the point of view of dealing with it under the Land Act of 1923.  I stated there were about 14,000,000 acres of arable land in the country.  Those figures do not include what is commonly called barren mountain and high bog.  I gave figures to show that there would be no more than 1,500,000 acres of untenanted land available for the relief of congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been considering those figures and I am not quite satisfied that that is the right way to approach the matter, in view of the fact that the holdings of a great many tenants, especially in the congested districts, will include what is returned in the Departmental returns as barren mountain, high bog, waste, etc.  It would be better to start with the figure of 16,000,000 acres as the total area of land in the country, excluding towns, roads, railways and absolute waste.  It is the figure given usually in the returns &mdash; a little over 16,000,000 acres. That includes the figure of 2,000,000 acres, which is usually returned as barren mountain and high bog.  If you take 2,000,000 from 16,000,000 that will <Col N="1114" /> leave the 14,000,000 acres that I began at.  In view of the fact that the holdings of a great many tenants include some of the land described as barren mountain in the returns, it would be better begin with 16,000,000 acres and see where that brings us.  That is the real area of the Free State, leaving out towns, roadways, railways and waterways. Under previous Acts, the Land Commission dealt with 11,000,000 acres. The real figure is a little over that, but the difference is not worth talking about.  Therefore, that would leave 5,000,000 acres to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>There are 95,000 unpurchased holdings, and we are in a position to make a very fair guess at the total area of these holdings.  We have already got returns in respect to 1,700,000 acres, and those returns are only for 44,000 out of the 95,000 holdings I have referred to.  Of course, we have returns for all holdings as far as rents are concerned. The area of tenanted land, not purchased, is not far short of 3,300,000 acres.  It is probably somewhat more, but on that showing, if you deduct 3,300,000 from the 5,000,000 acres that I have mentioned, you will get 1,700,000 acres of untenanted land, undealt with under previous Land Acts.  There is not a figure there that can be doubted except one, and that is the area of tenanted land. The rest of the figures are simple.  I think you can take it that the area of tenanted land, namely, 3,300,000 acres, is not far wrong.  If anything, it errs on the small side.  That leaves you with 1,700,000 acres of untenanted land.  I would make a deduction for barren mountain and waste and high bog.  I would deduct at least 500,000 acres. Let it be remembered that in most of the Department's returns there are 2,000,000 acres set aside as barren mountain and bog.  If you deduct 500,000 acres you will have a very fair idea of the area of land that we will call suitable for the purposes of division. A considerable part of it will be very poor and scarcely fit for anything else but sheep, unless it is reclaimed, and even a considerable area is unreclaimable. That leaves 1,200,000 acres that could possibly be dealt with.</P>

If you add 500,000 acres for tenanted land that can be resumed &mdash; it is an outside figure &mdash;you get back again to 1,700,000 acres.  That is an area which is not in the possession of the Land Commission or the C.D. Board.

Remember that I deducted only 500,000 acres for barren mountain and high bog, notwithstanding that the usual figure returned for that purpose in all Departmental returns, is about 2,000,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That 2,000,000 acres is probably very high, or, to put it another way, it is very probable that the standard of calculation that was adopted for the purpose of these returns was high.  It is very probable that what was called barren mountain was land which was quite useful for grazing.  But even if that is so, it is perfectly clear, I think, that 500,000 acres is a conservative <Col N="1116" /> figure to deduct for barren mountain, turf bog, and waste.  And yet, even after making a deduction so small as that, we have no more than 1,700,000 acres that can possibly be dealt with as untenanted land under the Land Act of 1923.</P>

That 1,700,000 acres includes every perch of the country right up to the owners' doors, as well as untenanted land, properly so called, that is the demesnes.  It is assumed for the moment that you deduct 500,000 acres: that is the only figure that is now debatable, because we have no real information, but we arrive again at 1,200,000 acres.  We want to see how many people we can deal with on the 1,200,000 acres, or the 1,700,000 acres. Supposing that a congest has to get twenty-five acres of land statute, or sixteen Irish acres.

My opinion is that it is a very small figure, but it is the only debatable figure there, and in any case Deputies themselves know what it is and can make their own additions or subtractions in regard to it.

In my opinion that is a maximum; there is only one possible figure that would upset their calculation, and that is that figure of 3,300,000 acres as the acreage under the holdings of tenants not purchased.  That is the figure which I deducted from the 5,000,000, which is the difference between the 11,000,000 already dealt with, and 16,000,000 which is the total area of the country.  That gives you 5,000,000 acres of land not dealt with by the Land Commission, and I estimate that about 3,300,000 acres of that is under the holdings of tenants.  That figure cannot be far wrong.  We have already returns for 1,700,000 acres in respect of about 45,000 tenants.  The real big question of policy which the Land Commission has to consider is what is to be done with these 45,000 people and how to do it.</P>

      <P>No, only one.  In order to get at this thirty acres, I assume that it would be necessary to give a congest about twenty-five acres statute in addition to his existing holding, that would be sixteen Irish acres.  So far as the landless man is concerned, we would have to give him thirty-five acres statute or twenty-two acres Irish, and the average of those figures, twenty-five and thirty-five, would be thirty acres of land.  That is what you want.  Thirty acres of land will deal with the average case, whether he is a congest or a landless man, and if you divide thirty acres into 1,700,000 acres you can get 56,000 holdings.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about whether there are as many of one as the other.

      <P>Thirty-five statute acres is twenty-two Irish acres, and that would, on the average, be cutting it tight.  Remember that twenty-two Irish acres of average good land in the Midlands would not be as good as thirty acres in the East, and thirty acres of average land in Galway, Mayo, or Sligo would not be as good as twenty-two acres in the Midlands. Thirty is cutting it tight.  However, let us assume that these figures are right for the moment.  If you estimate that you want thirty statute acres per holding, then if you have 1,700,000 acres of land &mdash; which you have not because you have to make deductions for demesnes &mdash;you can only deal with 56,000 congests and landless men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me finish.  If you deduct 5,000 acres you can only deal with 40,000.  I think you will have to deduct more.  I leave that figure in doubt, because it will be very hard to get an accurate figure.  Anyhow, it is clear that not more than 40,000 of either congests or landless men can be dealt with under the Act of 1923.  That raises a very big question of policy.  I do not know how many congests there are.  I think we are safe in assuming that there are at least 80,000, and they are mainly in the congested districts. Some are purchased already, some are to be purchased, but that does not alter the problem one bit; they are there; we pass relief grants for them every year, and until the problem of congestion is <Col N="1119" /> tackled in a drastic way we will continue to do so.  That is easily the biggest problem that is before this State agriculturally, because it is partly insoluble, and the question now is whether the Land Commission is to take the heroic decision that it will give practically no land to landless men and that it will deal with 40,000 congests, or whether it will go ahead, divide land in a hurry, as everybody wants it to do, and deal with, let us say, 10,000 or 15,000 congests and 10,000 or 15,000 landless men.  This problem of congestion will have to be tackled in six, seven, or eight years, in any event, and tackled very seriously.  By that time land purchase will be completed, and the State ought not to be in the position in seven or eight years of regretting that land purchase is completed. If we took heroic measures we could deal with about 40,000 congests. If there was plenty of money for migration, if we had the support of every element in the country, if it was a question of national policy which everyone stood over, and was above politics, if there was no pressure from any quarter to deal with landless men, if this was regarded as a big national problem that had to be dealt with and all parties would agree that they were on common ground, and if it was agreed on all sides that only a limited number of landless men would be dealt with, we could eat into probably half of this problem of congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would require that goodwill, it would require that co-operation, and it would require considerable sums of money for migration purposes.  Before we could come to a deliberate decision that that should be our policy we would also have to inquire a little more closely into the exact character of the congest; we would have to make up our minds as to how many of them would exist in other conditions, and we would have to measure the cost of transporting them. It would be very big; I have not gone into it very closely.  It would be an element in the situation which should be fully known before we made up our minds as to what the policy should be. All these questions should be considered, and I suggest that the correct <Col N="1120" /> attitude on the work of the Land Commission, in view of that problem, which seems to me to be almost insoluble, so far as 20,000 or 30,000 congests are concerned, no matter what we do, would be for the Land Commission to go even more slowly than they are alleged to be going, to consider the whole case, to consider the question of whether land should be divided in Longford, Leix, or Offaly, and so on, on the lines, perfectly proper lines, of dealing with congests that are just about there, and dealing with deserving landless men that are about there in a far lesser number. That is a perfectly understandable policy; it is a policy that may in the long run be the right one.  But there is the point of view that there are at least 80,000 congests, and with the best will in the world we can only deal with 40,000.  But we can deal with 40,000, and we can eat into half the problem.  There will be a big enough problem there in eight or nine years, even with 40,000, that we might bring it within a measurable distance of solution if we did deal with half the problem. But the problem is there.  It is one of the biggest problems, in my opinion, confronting the Land Commission or the State.  It is a problem that will mature as years go on, and it will have to be solved some day.</P>
    <P>There are other possibilities in connection with its solution.  They are limited, but there are possibilities on the lines of reclamation.  The point which I should like Deputies to bear in mind is this, that I do not profess to have grasped all the elements of the problem. It is very hard to get a picture in your mind of a big problem like this, and get all the figures and facts necessary in order to envisage it.  But there are sufficient elements in the situation to enable us to come to the conclusion that it is essentially a case which requires full investigation with a view to a national policy on the matter, so as to save us from simply putting through land purchase in a haphazard way and, finding at the end of five years, that we have a problem which is much harder to deal with in view of the fact that land purchase has been completed.  That is all I wish to say on the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN (resuming)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to give a résumé of the work of the Land Commission in connection with the 1923 Land Act.  I have three schedules in connection with tenanted and untenanted land, and I want to go back on the work of the Land Commission in connection with the 25 per cent. reduction. With regard to tenanted land, there is vested in the Land Commission 11,906 acres of tenanted land &mdash; that is, where the thirty or thirty-five per cent. reduction, as the case may be, is given. There is gazetted, and must be vested, in addition to this, a further 183,665 acres, and the purchase schedules have been lodged in respect of 1,351,448 acres.  Deputies will note that gazetting is the stage just before vesting.  The idea of gazetting is to give notice to all and sundry who may have claims against the land.  That is a total acreage of 1,547,019.  That is in respect of about 44,000 tenants.  That is a figure that can be used to check our figures for untenanted land.  You have got that figure for tenanted land.  The fact that there are 44,000 out of 95,000 tenants being dealt with within these figures is something that will enable us to check the figure for untenanted land.  I should say that this return was made out a month ago and that the total area dealt with would now be about 1,700,000 acres.  I have the figures by counties, but I will not delay the Dáil by giving them.</P>
      <P>With regard to untenanted land, there has been actually divided about 10,000 acres.  There is vested in the Land Commission 17,620 acres.  The price has been fixed in respect of 41,520 acres.  A price has been offered, or the lands have been gazetted, in respect of 88,942 acres.  In addition, 172,100 acres have been inspected, and inquiries are being made, with a view to inspection, approximately in regard to 377,900 acres.  So that the Land Commission are dealing, either by way of having vested, or making inquiries, with 708,082 acres &mdash; something about half the figure which I gave for the total area of untenanted land available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I could not.  I will let the Deputy have that information, but it will take a little time.  That is the position in regard to the work of the Land Commission under the Land Act of 1923.  I would ask the Dáil to remember that there is a large number of pending sales in the Land Commission &mdash; land purchased up to the passing of the Land Act of 1923 under previous Acts, and over £1,000,000 worth of that has been dealt with.  In addition to that, I would ask the Dáil to remember that the Land Commission was switched off from its proper functions last winter &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; for the purpose of administering relief grants.  Deputies will remember that we announced these relief grants in the Dáil some time in the early winter, and that Deputies, especially from the Labour Benches, suggested that they hoped that not only would the grants before the Dáil be passed, but that the money would be really spent in time.  On that occasion I pointed out that we had for a long time schedules prepared in the Land Commission, as we had contemplated that particular contingency arising, for works that could usefully be done in connection with estates.  I gave an undertaking to the Dáil that all the moneys voted would be spent.  All the money voted has been spent with the exception that a negligible sum, which will complete existing works within a very short time, has to be spent.  The money was spent within the time.  That is to say, within the winter, between 1st December and 1st May &mdash; the time when relief grants are really needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large portion of the Land Commission staff had to be taken off their proper work of the acquisition and division of land for that purpose.  That applied both to the outdoor and indoor staff, but especially the outdoor.  It was necessary to do the work quickly and, at the same time, to see that it was carried out efficiently.  All during the winter, therefore, a large portion of the staff, which should be doing the <Col N="1123" /> work in connection with the acquisition and division of land, was concentrated on that particular work.  That was necessary, but it is work which in the ordinary way is not within the scope of the activities of the Land Commission. The Land Commission, therefore, was trying to deal with pending sales under previous Acts, had to operate the Land Act of 1923, had to do a considerable amount of work in connection with land coming into the Land Commission, and the clerical staff especially were faced with a very considerable problem in regard to arrears.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to arrears is this: At the present date the arrears amount to £300,000 out of a total collection of practically £3,000,000.  That is a small arrear.  At the same time, it is a very much bigger arrear than used to be there in normal times.  About the year 1922, we found that the arrears, which used to be £50,000, £60,000 or £70,000, went up suddenly to £600,000. I will say that a very large proportion of the people who did come into arrears of that time, who had arrears amounting to £600,000, had to be processed. The extraordinary thing is, that those particular people had to be processed not only for the gale in the first half, let us say, of 1923, but for the second half of 1923, for the first half of 1924, and again for the second half in 1924. Now the arrears are reduced to about £300,000.  It is interesting to note that those arrears were owed, in the main, by the particular people who were always in arrears.  It is also interesting to note that when the Land Commission got complaints about people not getting their receivable orders, about confusion as to receivable orders, those complaints, in the main, come from people who never had their receivable orders, according to themselves, but had been always losing them.  But this arrears problem, in the circumstances that existed in 1922, 1923, 1924, when the Post Office was to a certain extent disorganised, has given the land Commission ten times more trouble than the normal collection of all the rest of the annuities from the tenants who always paid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> Anyway that is what the Land Commission has done in connection with the 1923 Act.  In respect of arrears I would like to say that there must be some misconception as to what the effects of those arrears are, first on the guarantee fund, and secondly, on the rates of each county.  I can read letters in the papers and hear statements made from various sources that the rates are high and are increasing year by year because big amounts have to be stopped from the guarantee fund which should go to the rates in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>I would like to give the following figures to the Dáil in respect of arrears due not only in 1923, but since the beginning of land purchase, that is going back to 1891.  I am giving a figure now which includes all the land purchase arrears since the Land Acts were put into operation.  That is £968,875.  That was drawn from the guarantee fund in the beginning of the year 1924 in respect of the last gale of the year 1923, and all previous gales.  That is the total arrears of Land Commission annuities for all arrears so far as there were arrears up to the beginning of 1924. That arrear is drawn thirty days after the last gale is due.  There was repaid to the guarantee fund by the Land Commission in that year £1,083,492.  The process is something like this.  There is an arrear, say, for the December gale of £200,000.  That is drawn from the guarantee fund within 30 days, but there comes in after the 30 days, and before the next gale, £300,000, which would be a portion of that £200,000 and previous arrears.  That is repaid to the guarantee fund.  Entering January, 1925, there was a balance of £664,379 due to the guarantee fund.  For 1925 there was drawn from the guarantee fund £725,634 for the whole year, but there was repaid to the guarantee fund by way of collection of arrears for that year any money owed for the previous year, £811,295.  This was arrears repaid to the fund in the year.  There is a balance due to the guarantee fund of £578,718.  This total was made out on the 7th May, 1925.  On the 31st January, 1924, there was drawn from the guarantee fund £778,923.  During the year there was drawn from the guarantee <Col N="1125" /> fund £968,875, but there was repaid to the fund £1,000,000.  In other words, there was more repaid to the fund than was drawn from it.  That reached £768,000 at the beginning, but £664,376 was drawn.  That was, at the beginning of the year, drawn from the guarantee fund, and that drawing is in respect of arrears of land purchase.  It is in respect of the last gale for 1924 and any arrears outstanding in 1923 and 1922. Arrears have been getting less and less. There were always some drawings from the guarantee fund, but arrears have been getting less since 1923.  That means that since 1923 there must have been a steady increase in the grants to the county councils.  They may not have been getting all they should get if there were no arrears, but there was a steady increase in the grants to the county councils regarding the counties and the Saorstát as a whole.  That may not apply in certain counties.  I think there are certain counties &mdash; Galway for one&mdash;where there was a slight increase, but taking the Saorstát as a whole, the arrears are getting less.  Therefore, repayments to the guarantee fund are getting bigger and therefore, since 1923, taking the Saorstát as a whole, there should be an increase each year in the grant to the county council.  Therefore, there is no cause for saying that since 1923 rates are increasing because the arrears of Land Commission annuities are increasing and there have been withdrawals from the guarantee fund. If you take the figures again, that is clear enough.  At the beginning of 1924 the total drawings were £778,993.  That year there was a draw of £968,000.  Deputies will be surprised at the size of the draw.  That is due to the fact that there must be a draw from the guarantee fund unless the annuities are paid within 30 days.  A tremendous number of annuities come in after that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>£778,993.  There were repaid to the guarantee fund that year annuities &mdash; which I have spoken of and which came in after the draw in respect of the current year and previous years &mdash; amounting to £1,083,492.  The <Col N="1126" /> result was that the guarantee fund stood with a deficit of £664,379, as against a deficit of £778,000 at the beginning of the year.  That tendency is going on.  The moral of the story is that the county councils are getting increased grants up to date.  There are two counties, I think, in which that does not exactly apply, but they are about line ball.  If Deputies deduct £968,875 from £1,083,492 they will get £114,617.  If you deduct £114,617 from £778,993 you get £664,376.  This is rather complicated, but I think I have made the point that I wanted to make, that there is no case for county councils taking up the attitude that for the last three years, at any rate, the rates have increased, because there is a draw from the guarantee fund.  For the last four or five gales the arrears have been getting less and less, not very much, but for that reason the grants to the county council should not be affected.  That does not apply to one or two counties.  I think Galway is one of these counties.</P>

We remember that one of the most urgent problems that faced this country when we took over our own Government was the problem of land purchase.  Intimately bound up with that problem was the planting of the people on the land.  It was one of the first big problems tackled by the Government. We were told, practically from every platform, in 1923 and since, that it was only a matter of a short time until the people would be planted on the land.

The real problem of planting the people on the land has only been tackled to the extent shown in the Minister's statement.  He said that 10,000 acres have actually been divided amongst the people since the Land Act began to operate in 1923.  We are told that a considerable portion of the land is in course of transfer, that some is vested, that more is about to be vested, and that prices are about to be fixed. Some of the land, we were told, has been inspected, and in other cases inquiries have been made.  I notice that there are six stages before the division of the land is reached.  The fact remains that only 10,000 acres have actually been divided.</P>

Undoubtedly the biggest problem that the Ministry has to face is the giving of land to uneconomic holders and congests. It is surely a disappointment and a disillusionment to know that two years after the Land Act was passed the Minister comes here and in effect throws up his hands and says, &ldquo;This is a problem still, and I have no solution.&rdquo; In effect that is what he says. During the debates on the Land Bill he told us repeatedly, and also made public statements throughout the country, <Col N="1128" /> that under the Land Act he would have power to take land anywhere for the relief of congestion.

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not go into that, because I had gone into that specific question on the Vote for the Department of Agriculture.  I gave the figures for the number of holdings.  They were not exactly correct, but I should say they were approximately correct, and they did not alter the general conclusions. I gave the figures for the number of holdings in the Free State, and showed how I arrived at a maximum of about 500,000 acres of tenanted land that could possibly be resumed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's words on this point were: &ldquo;You can give them 30 acres each if you can acquire compulsorily 500,000 or 600,000 acres from existing tenants who are amongst the 10,000 with over £100 valuation.&rdquo;  I think the Minister did not give the actual area.  He did not say whether these were people with over 100 acres, and did not give any figures from which we could draw proper deductions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with valuations there, but I am in a position now to give the area.  I am very glad to be able to give these figures, as I am anxious to get suggestions for a solution of this difficulty.  The table I have before me is taken from a leaflet issued by the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction, and is up to date to 1923.  These are the figures.  The total number of holdings in the Free State is about 441,663.  That includes demesnes and also tenanted and untenanted holdings.  It includes tenants, landlords, and owners in fee. Of that total the number of holdings not exceeding one acre is, roughly, <Col N="1130" /> 87,189.  I do not think it would be right to deduct the whole 87,000 from that, because, although some of them do not exceed one acre, there are some of them that could, by a stretch of the imagination, be called tenancies.  That leaves you with a figure of 354,844 holdings. Take from that figure the fact that you have about 15,000 owners in fee, and you get the number of tenancies and tenant purchasers.  That would leave you with about 350,000 tenant farmers in the country.  The number of holdings in this connection includes both tenanted and untenanted land, and land which is subject to Land Commission annuities.  The number of holdings in the Free State of between 100 and 200 acres is 20,587.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is an important one because if we had the information it would enable us to know whether the average would be nearer to the 100 acre holding or to the 200 acre holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated in regard to some of these figures that all I could do was to make the best guess I could. The number of holdings of between 200 and 500 acres is 7,461, and above 500 acres the number of holdings is 1,769. That gives you a total of, roughly, 30,000 holdings above 100 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember these 30,000 holdings include tenant purchasers certainly in the category of from 100 to 200 acres.  It includes tenants, owners in fee, and the owners of demesnes.  If I am right, and I think I cannot be far wrong in view of the fact that there are still 5,000 landlords to be purchased, and that there are about 15,000 landlords in the country, you must take off from this figure of 30,000 holdings the 15,000 which are already dealt with in the figure that I gave in connection with untenanted land.  If you take off these 15,000 landlords, you are left with about 15,000 others who are either tenants or tenant purchasers.  You have to <Col N="1131" /> take off a certain number for tenant purchasers. Practically the whole of those with between 200 and 500 acres would be owners in fee.  You have to assume that about 12,000 tenants in the country would be owning between 100 and 200 acres, and that there will be a negligible few above that figure.  Deputy O'Connell can make a calculation himself and see whether I am high or low when I said at the outset that what you hoped to get in that connection was 500,000 acres.</P>

      <P>In any case I say this problem of the relief of congestion will have to be drastically faced even if we have to come to the men who have 150 or 200 acre farms.  The country will have to face the position of the relief of congestion by some such drastic method as that; the problem is too great a one to be allowed to drift on. Great complaints have come to my notice and, I dare say, to the notice of other Deputies, and especially Deputies from the western area, of the great delay on the part of the Land Commission in dealing with the relief of congestion. I think that even the explanation which the Minister has given with regard to delay cannot be taken as sufficient to explain the unwarrantable delay in many cases, especially when we realise the position in which many, and indeed all of the congests find themselves. It would seem as if the figures that the Minister gave us on the last day, when he introduced the Agricultural Vote, were new; at least, that was the first time that I remember their being given to us here.  But from what the Minister has said now they were evidently in the possession of his Ministry in 1923.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the return up to 1923.  Of course the number of holdings in the Free State were known for years: that was not new information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I took it that the bulk of the information, at any rate, which the Minister gave us a few days ago, and again to-day, was in the possession of the Ministry in 1923.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the whole point. <Col N="1132" /> I think it is perfectly plain to everyone who heard my statement that that was information which I could not give were it not for the schedules and the returns in the Land Commission, obtained in connection with the 1923 Act.  I said there were certain figures yet to be obtained, and deductions to be drawn, and analysis to be made, which might make the problem more clear, but these statements and deductions that I made were only possible by the work of the Land Commission in the last year in connection with the Land Act of 1923; I said the duty of the Land Commission was to face and to survey the situation in the light of figures that came into them, and that these deductions were only possible by putting together those figures which came recently into the Land Commission, and by making use of, where necessary, figures published long ago as to the number of holdings in the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite accept the Minister's statement.  I took it he was taking the figures from a return published in 1923.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the main complaint is as to delay.  The Minister told us this time last year, when discussing this Vote before, that the Land Commission would have to survey the whole position to see what it could do, and the impression he left on me, at any rate, on that occasion, was that they had practically the whole surveying done, that they had practically looked over the whole position and realised what the work before them was, and that they were almost ready to begin what was the real work, so far as the congested areas was concerned.</P>
      <P>That was the impression left on me, and, certainly, it was the impression left on the people anxiously looking towards the Ministry ever since the Free State was established, to plant them on the land, and to take them out of the terrible position in which they found themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> Now, I feel that the position in the congested areas is not at all fully realised by the majority of members of this Dáil, or by the majority of the people of the country, that is by those who have not travelled over these areas.  I think it would be one of the best things the Minister could do if he organised an excursion first through Meath to Navan and on to Slane, and through Roscommon and Strokestown, through Tulsk, and then through Swinford, on through Westport, and down through Connemara, and back again through Galway to Athlone.  I think it would be a very good education for Deputies in this House, and they would see some of the things that the Ministry and the country are up against.</P>
    <P>Now, I am speaking with some intimate knowledge of at least two counties.  one the County Galway, which I represent, and the other Mayo, my native county.  In these two counties things have reached a stage that the people are actually despairing almost that the Government is going to do anything to relieve the position in which they find themselves. They have listened to promises of distribution of land.</P>

These promises have not materialised, and they are beginning to wonder whether they ever will materialise.  I would like to give a few instances from the hundreds of letters that I have got pointing out what the position is.  I know the Minister does not set much value upon general statements; he always likes to have particulars.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give him a few instances from the counties of Galway and Mayo.  And there is one feature that I want to draw the Minister's attention to in connection with this matter.  It is that there are untenanted lands in these areas lying in the possession of the old Congested <Col N="1134" /> Districts Board and now in the possession of the Land Commission that for some reason or another have been in their possession in some cases as long as fourteen years.  Still these lands are not divided.  That is one of the general complaints we get, that no division has taken place of land taken over and in the possession of the Congested Districts Board and the Land Commission for a number of years. There is the Foreman Estate, near Clifden. Letters have been written by the tenants, saying that their land is mainly cutaway bog with one acre or so of arable land, and that the condition of the congests there is very bad.  There has been a petition sent up from the parish priest and various people in the district asking that the land should be divided.  Adjoining these holdings, it is stated there is a large tract of land, the Foreman Estate, used purely for grazing purposes and held under a grazing agreement by a man who is non-resident, and they say that it is in the cutaway bog that they have to sow their crops. There is another estate, the Eyre Estate at Kiltormer.  They state: &ldquo;On the Eyrefield property there are 600 acres of land the greater part of which is set for grazing on the eleven-months' system.  The average holding of the sixteen tenants is less than five acres. In July last we went to the two solicitors in Loughrea and got them to write to the Estate Commissioners, but we received no reply.  Most of the tenants have not worked their plots for one-third of the year.&rdquo;  There are two or three other similar estates in Galway. The Louis Estate is one.  In Mayo, especially in the Westport area, the conditions are even worse.  This is a letter from a correspondent who is on the spot and who knows what the conditions are: &ldquo;At Glenkeen there are hundreds of acres to be divided.  The Congested Districts Board, and now the Land Commission, take grazing stock on this farm known as Housten-Boswell's land.  It is vested in the Board for more than fourteen years, and in the vicinity are the congested villages of Cregganbawn, Derryheigh, Altore, and Shraughwee.&rdquo;  I desire to give the <Col N="1135" /> Deputies a picture of what one of these congested villages is like.  Take the congested village of Cregganbawn. There are eleven families, or, in all, sixty-eight persons, with a total acreage of fifty-two acres, most of which is cut-away bog.  The average is less than five acres each.  These are Irish acres. There is in Belclare a farm known as Livingstone's farm, which is occupied by a grazier who has several other farms.  A farm known as Powell's farm is also in the occupation of a grazier who also has other farms.  Here is another glaring instance.  At Westport, Lord Sligo's demesne, containing about 1,900 acres, is in the possession of the Land Commission for a considerable time, but nothing has been done to divide it.  There are two typical villages in the neighbourhood of the Sligo estate, which was vested in the Land Commission in 1913 or 1914. These villages are almost identical with the village to which I have referred, with nine families trying to exist on 69 acres.  There are 76 people trying to live on 69 acres in the two villages.  These people are not, perhaps, in a position to envisage the whole problem, but they see land in the possession of the Congested Districts Board, in some cases for over nine or ten years, while they are trying to live on these little holdings, and they see these lands undivided, and all the nice explanations of the Minister are of little use to these men, who are hungry for this land.  The position in many of these districts now is one in which they are either in a condition of despair or they are bordering on desperation. I am not exaggerating things at all, as the Minister seems to think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There cannot be much difference between despair and desperation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes there is a great difference.  I think that the delay which has taken place is not excusable in the case of these places where things are so absolutely urgent. They should be tackled as one of the first things in connection with the Land Commission.  I say that where <Col N="1136" /> you have conditions such as exist in those districts, it is the most urgent problem for the Land Commission to tackle.  As I am giving a picture of these places, I might mention something which may be new to many Deputies, but which is still in existence in some of these places.  I refer to what is known as the rundale system.  I believe it is a relic of the old tribal times when land was held more or less in common.  It works out like this: no man has all his land together.  He has a little bit of a field here, and another bit of a field half a mile away, and, in some cases, even the fields have become divided by little furrows, each division being about one rood.  It is pitiable to see people going across from field to field trying to get their little bit of crop together.  Teachers tell me that one of the main causes of the bad attendance of children at school is the fact that they are engaged herding, perhaps a cow and a calf, or a couple of calves, in a rood of ground because there are no fences between the ground of one man and that of another.  We often hear of land disputes in the West, but anyone who knows the conditions as they exist can understand why there are these interminable disputes between neighbours over little bits of land of that kind. These are the conditions, and there is certainly cause for the complaint that so much delay has taken place in dealing with them.  I will refer to one other point in connection with the division of lands, and I would like to get an explanation from the Minister regarding it.  It would look as if there was some idea of profiteering on the part of the Land Commission in some of their operations.  I know one or two cases personally where a man left a holding and was migrated.  He was paying a certain amount for the holding which he left.  That holding was divided among two others who remained behind.  The rent which the new tenants were paying on the holding was practically three times what the original owner was paying.  I could quote several instances of that kind. I know one or two of my own personal knowledge.  I have instances here.  A <Col N="1137" /> typical case is one such as this.  There were three tenants in a particular place and one was paying £5 9s. 6d. to the landlord, which was reduced to £4 7s. 9d. under the Congested Districts Board.  He was migrated.  The three tenants, before migration, were paying to the Congested Districts Board £12 2s. 11d.  The three were paying to the landlord £15 2s. 8d., and to the Congested Districts Board £12 2s. 11d.  One tenant was migrated and the land was divided among the other two, who are now paying to the Land Commission £21 2s. 4d.  One of them paid a fine of £21 when getting his land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure.  I will not say that I am absolutely sure, but I do know a case in which there was no house built, and in which the same kind of thing took place.  I do know a case in which some improvements were carried out by the Land Commission in the way of drainage, but it was general to the whole district.  That is one feature that is causing a lot of questioning, to say the least of it, amongst these people.  I should have said, speaking before, that this question of willingness to migrate has often been raised.  I think that there is too much stress laid on the unwillingness of people to migrate in many cases.  I have made many inquiries with regard to this matter and I find that there is not in the greater part of these districts that great unwillingness to migrate that is generally thought to be the case.  In these instances that I have quoted, I made special inquiries as to whether that was the case, and every one of the tenants have signified their willingness to migrate if they are given suitable holdings.  We know that many tenants have been migrated, from Mayo especially to Roscommon, and that they have been successful in their new holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one other matter before I finish that I would like to draw attention to.  That is the present condition <Col N="1138" /> of many of these tenants.  They have fallen behind with their annuities, even small as they are.  It is a peculiar thing that the tenants in these small, little holdings, ranging from four or five to nine or ten acres, have all large families, and they have found it impossible to get anything like a living out of their little holdings.  The openings which they previously had by emigration to the English harvest fields are now closed to them.  The result was that during the bad years many of them fell into arrears.  Quite possibly many of them refused to pay up when they could pay up.  The fact remains that they have fallen into arrears.  They have been processed in the courts and decrees have been taken out against them.  I suggest to the Minister that he should recognise the fact that they are uneconomic holders and that something should be done pending the giving of land to them, something by way of moratorium or something else to relieve the position.  They are not in a position to pay at the present time. You can evict them, of course, and you can take up their holdings, but I suggest that is not the way to deal with the position.</P>
    <P>I would press on the Minister that this question of the relief of congestion is the biggest that has to be tackled, and I have no hesitation in saying that before landless men or any other men get land the position of these uneconomic holders should be dealt with.  I hold that their claims come first, before landless men or anybody else.  It is one of their grievances, when they hear of cases of men who are comparatively comfortable, even though they have not large holdings, getting divisions of land in other parts of the country.  It should be the duty of the Minister, the duty of every Deputy, I hold, with the Minister, to recognise that the claims of these men come first, and that there should not be on the part of any Deputy or any representative man claims for placing landless men on land so long as this question of the congests remains to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I press again on the Minister the advisability of dealing, and dealing immediately, with these districts, and <Col N="1139" /> especially that the Land Commission should give no excuse for discontent by holding over farms which they have in their possession and which can be divided.  That is, as I say, one of the greatest grievances, and when it is said that the Land Commission is waiting to take over this land, or some other land, to relieve congestion, the reply is: &ldquo;Have they not this farm for the last ten years and they have not divided it.&rdquo; That is a thing that should be dealt with immediately.  The whole economic position of the west of Ireland, and consequently of the country generally is involved in this matter of the relief of congestion.  I urge that it is one to which the Minister should first turn his attention, because even though Dairy Produce Bills and Live Stock Breeding Bills are very important, the question of planting the people on the land is the most urgent of all, and it is the first that should be tackled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Vote was on last year I had occasion to congratulate the Minister for Lands and Agriculture and the officials of the Land Commission, in connection with the good work they had carried out in the two counties which I have the honour to represent.  I am in the position to renew these congratulations.  I know the great difficulties that they have to contend with.  I know the great difficulties they have had in connection with the final obtaining of lands for which they are in negotiation.  In the Counties of Westmeath and Longford over 2,500 acres of land have already been actually divided and the tenants put into possession.  At the present time these tenants have started to cultivate and till the holdings they have been put into possession of.  I look forward to the future with regard to the division of these ranches, which in the past were useless to anybody, to see that they will be able to provide homes where these men can rear their families in comfort, because from what I have already seen of the men, and the women, too, who have been put into possession of the lands that have been divided, I have no doubt at all from the earnestness that they have <Col N="1140" /> shown already in the working of these lands, that they will make a gigantic success of them.  There are 3,200 acres actually acquired.  I understand that schemes are being prepared for the division of this land.  I am also aware that 13,000 acres have been inspected, and that at the present time negotiations are taking place for their acquisition, either that or they are the subject of consideration by the Land Commission. I know that the landless men problem is a very difficult one, particularly because there is not enough of land to go round for half or quarter the people who require it.  I do believe that the solution of the landless men problem can be found largely in the provision of cow parks in the various ranches or lands that are being divided. In Westmeath, in the lands that have already been divided, cow parks have been retained &mdash; only 30 or 40 acres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the cow parks I alluded to are possibly three miles from the town.  However, I am only making a suggestion with regard to the possibility of satisfying men who cannot be satisfied otherwise.  I take a considerable interest in these men, and I know they are satisfied if they can get some place where they can put a cow.  The Westmeath County Council have appointed two or three trustees from the council to endeavour to work these cow parks in the different areas where the land is divided.  I have thrown out that suggestion to the Minister as being the only possibility I see with regard to the solving of the landless men problem.  I also suggest <Col N="1141" /> to the Minister with regard to the lands that have been divided, that he should start the work of making roads into those lands as quickly as possible, because, owing to the great unemployment that exists all over the counties, this is a slack time and a suitable time. In a month or six weeks or two months the road work will begin.  At the present time these men are finding it hard to get employment.  In these lands that have been divided, this money is set aside for this purpose, and I would ask the Minister to speed up the starting of this work during the slack time when the men are mostly idle and cannot get work elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I was very glad to hear the figures given by the Minister with regard to the inspection of untenanted land in the congested areas.  I would impress upon him that he should do everything in his power to hasten the work of distribution.  Very few people living on this side of the Shannon have any real idea what sort of lives those poor people live.  We hear the farmers here from well-to-do counties complaining of depression, and rightly complaining of depression. Last year the farmers had very good ground for complaining.  But if those men with 40, 30, or 20 acres complain, one can imagine the position of men living in holdings of from £3 to £6 valuation and trying to rear families on them.  And these farms generally in the West of Ireland, as Deputy O'Connell has said, consist of cut-away bog, the poorest kind of land, and where it is not bog it is rock.  They generally try to eke out an existence, pay the rent and pay the shops by sending their sons to America.  That is the only way they can live.  Is it not a wonder that these people are impatient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who has represented a Western constituency in the congested districts for the last two years must know of the growing volume of impatience that he encounters everywhere he goes, and one cannot help having sympathy with them.  These people feel they have got their own Parliament, they have got their own Government in power, and they are eager for <Col N="1142" /> the distribution of the lands.  Of course their impatience is very often founded on a wrong conception of the time it takes to do that work.  There were several things that occurred that delayed it.  I would urge upon the Minister and upon the Land Commission the necessity of speeding up this work to the fullest extent by every means in their power.  The figures given by the Minister with regard to the land available for distribution are very discouraging, no doubt.  But the Land Commission will not be blamed for not dividing land they have not got.  Those people see around them large ranches and big farms here and there, lands held by the grazier for the last fifty years, held by the grazier last year and held by the grazier this year, and that is what is driving them almost to despair. They want to know why has not that land been distributed.  Of course if they were able to come here and hear the figures and able to hear the Minister's statement they would sit down with some confidence and more hope. But it is hard to bring all these facts home to them.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy O'Connell generally, though I agree with him in every word he said about the state of the people, and the account he gave of their farms and the low standard of living they are driven to. I agree with him in every word he said. But the bulk of the people have full confidence that this Government is going to divide the land.  If you go down to any part of Mayo or Galway or Donegal and tell them that this Government is going to divide the lands&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamSears" hpid="Mr. SEARS Mr. SEARS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I told them that last Sunday, and I told them that I, for one, would come to this Dáil no more if I did not believe the land was to be divided.  I would not have anything to do with the Dáil or with the Government or Party if I did not believe they were going to divide these lands.  I would urge upon them the necessity of speeding up the division by every means in their power, and to <Col N="1143" /> do it by increasing the number of inspectors, by increasing the staff, and not by cutting down the staff or taking away clerical assistance from the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>Another point: there are numerous demesnes with big houses on them.  I hope the Minister is not going to be too tender about dealing with these demesnes.  They have been for 500 years in the possession of these landlord families.  I think that is long enough for them to have them, and it is time for the people to get them now. I am not in favour of giving land to landless men, but if landless men are not going to get it, it should not be left to these men either.  The graziers should not be allowed to come in year after year and make a profit out of these holdings.  These lands should be handed over to the people in the congested villages bordering on these ranches.  Again, I say, that the argument that migrants are unwilling to leave the district should not be used any more, because there is not enough land to give those who are willing to leave.  If every man who is willing to migrate gets a farm I would be satisfied. The people have confidence that the Government will divide these lands, but I would urge them to spare no effort in speeding up the work of distribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking now because I hope that the Deputies on the Farmers' Benches will be able to give fuller attention to and speak with more detailed knowledge on the subject after the few words I have to say. I would like to deal with one or two of the larger issues raised by the Minister's statement.  I think I see in the speech of the Minister to-day, coupled with that of last week, some doubts in his mind as to the wisdom of the policy that is set forth in the Land Act of 1923.  In his speeches during the Land Bill debates there were frequent references to and warnings of the difficulties that might arise regarding the distribution of land, and the shortage of the area to be distributed. Notwithstanding this consciousness <Col N="1144" /> even at that time of the difficulties, the Act contains references to congests, landless men, evicted tenants, and workmen displaced from estates which were being distributed.  All over the country these various classes of men have been buoyed up with the hope and expectation that in due course it would come to their turn to receive the land that was being distributed.  Now the Minister is being faced more closely with the problem.  He sees that according to the figures he has given, probably not more than 40,000 congests and landless men can be provided with holdings.  That will leave another 40,000 or 50,000 congests unprovided for, and many other thousands of landless men, not to speak of evicted tenants and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister then asks, almost in so many words, for a direction as to the policy which the Land Commission ought to pursue in regard to the distribution of land.  He said: &ldquo;Shall the Land Commission take the heroic decision to give no land to landless men?&rdquo; and then shortly afterwards he repeated the sentence in slightly different language and spoke of the minimum number of landless men.  I am not sure what the Minister's position is in regard to this, or what position he desires the Dáil to take in regard to it.  When discussing the Land Bill he pointed out that the position of the Land Commission was rather difficult and peculiar, inasmuch as it was semi-judicial.  So far as the powers are judicial the Land Commission has discretion, he said, and so far as they are administrative they are controlled by the Minister for Agriculture.  Then he said: &ldquo;That is provided for in the Land Commission Bill.&rdquo;  I am curious to know whether the Land Commission is seeking a direction from the Dáil, or the Minister, or the Oireachtas, as to the policy it should pursue in regard to congests or landless men, or whether it has to exercise a discretion and take its own risk, or whether the Minister responsible is to give a direction as to the policy.  It is quite clear that there is going to be a great deal of disappointment. Deputy O'Connell made references to despair and desperation, <Col N="1145" /> which the Minister said were very nearly the same thing.  I suggest that the words denote a different state of mind, despair being rather a passive state and desperation an active state. If the passive is changed into the active we will know the difference between despair and desperation.  But is it to the House the Land Commission is going to look for a direction as to whether, in the distribution of land, it has to adopt the policy of excluding landless men, and only concern itself with congests, and whether congests are to be considered mainly as those who are to be migrated?  The Minister, I think, has rather overlooked that the provisions of the Act assume congests in the area concerned.  We have had no figures, at least I cannot remember having seen any, as to the number of congests in different parts of the country outside the scheduled congested areas.  Possibly the figure was given by the Minister when he spoke of 80,000, or perhaps 100,000, and perhaps the difference of 20,000 indicates the number in the different parts of the country outside the strictly congested areas.</P>

      <P>I am not quite clear whether the Deputy's contention was that within the Land Act the Land Commission had no power to acquire land compulsorily for congests except congests in the vicinity of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not thinking of the power to acquire land compulsorily, or otherwise.  I am rather thinking of the general powers, and the number of congests, and making provision for these congests.  Deputy Shaw has shown us that about one-fourth of all of those who have been settled on the land are to be found in Westmeath and Longford. I take it from his statement that they were mainly holders of five or six acres, that they were in fact congests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well to have that correction made.  It would appear as though the particular counties Deputy Shaw represents had been specially favoured.  However, that is a small matter &mdash; to Deputy Shaw.  A very much bigger question is what is to be the policy that the Land Commission will follow in the future?  What policy will lead to the least amount of trouble?  After all the promises, after all the hopes created, to adopt the policy of migration wholesale, and to place the migrants in districts where landless men have been buoyed up with the hope and expectation&mdash; honestly based upon speeches here and outside &mdash; that they would get their chance to receive a share of land, would not, I fear, make those congests any happier in their new surroundings than in their present surroundings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure that the Minister's figures regarding the number of acres available stand the test of analysis, unless he is contemplating the maintenance of a large number of large holdings of lands, which are at present called tenanted lands.  He said last week: &ldquo;You can raise the holding from 20 statute acres on the average to 30 statute acres on the average if you can acquire compulsorily 500,000 or 600,000 acres from existing tenants who are amongst the 10,000 with over £100 valuation.&rdquo;  The figures he has given to-day show us that, if we make the assumption that all the holdings over 100 acres, numbering <Col N="1147" /> 30,000, average 150 acres &mdash; and, from the figures, I do not think that that is an extravagant assumption &mdash; we have 4½ million acres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is forgetting to deduct about 15,000 holdings which would be fee-simple holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not thinking for the moment of how they are held. I am thinking of the area held by someone.  When the Minister only assumes the possibility of taking 500,000 or 600,000 acres from these large holdings&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary!  Deputy Johnson has to include in the 30,000 holdings over 100 acres, the holdings of owners-in-fee, as well as the holdings of tenants.  If I am right in my estimate, that there are about 15,000 owners-in-fee in the country, then there would be about 15,000 tenants and tenant-purchasers amongst those 30,000.  After making allowance for tenant-purchasers, there would be about 12,000 tenants.  The 500,000 acres of land I referred to was land to be resumed from tenants.  I also gave figures of land to be acquired from owners-in-fee.  But I gave, in addition, 500,000 acres of lands that might possibly be resumed from existing tenants.  I gave it as my opinion that that was a high figure but I put it high deliberately in order to put the case against myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>In reference to this particular argument, I do not think it will matter much to the congest or landless man under what tenure the land is held by the man who has 200, 300, or 400 acres.  What he will ask himself is whether too large an area is held by that man and is not being properly utilised.  The figures the Minister has given &mdash; I admit they may not be complete and that I may be misreading them to some extent&mdash; would allow of a very much wider distribution &mdash; at least covering a larger number of people than the Minister has spoken of &mdash; provided he would <Col N="1148" /> contemplate the smaller holding as the maximum.  I am not altogether enamoured of the policy which would make rigidly uniform a holding, say, not exceeding 100 acres.  I agree with the Minister's statement both last week and in the Land Bill debates that some very useful purposes might be served by having a number of larger holdings.  But I am bending towards the conclusion that the Minister is thinking too much of the existing economy.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke the other day of the importance of a tillage policy and stressed the value of the odd additional acre on the average holding in the country if put into tillage.  He indicated that that policy would not affect the normal economy of the country.  I am inclined to think, from the two or three speeches he has made, he is going to be too tender, as Deputy Sears fears, towards the large holder&mdash; the owner of demesne lands and of other lands which are at present fulfilling their function, in the normal economy of the country, of grazing store cattle and grazing fat cattle. If we are to contemplate the permanence of the normal economy of the country, then the Minister's hands are quite rightly held up in despair at this problem.  I am of opinion that you are not going to go very much nearer a solution of the problem he speaks of&mdash; the problem of the congests and the greater problem of the placing of the second, third and fourth sons&mdash;unless you interfere with the normal existing economy.  I think we ought to face that fact as well as the other facts that are being placed before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal existing agricultural economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I spoke of the larger holdings and I realise the possible utility of the larger holdings.  I am not sure whether, notwithstanding the very deep-seated popular demand for ownership, that considerable easing of the situation of a large number of people &mdash; even present holders &mdash; would not be found by utilising some of those large holdings for intensive tillage on a wage system or joint-ownership <Col N="1149" /> system.  I am not sure that the Minister ought not to adopt the policy, at least in a few experimental cases, of intensive cultivation.  Men who have been very often migrants for a period of the year, might be very willing to migrate for the whole period of the year on similar terms to those which they had in other parts, such as when travelling over to England and Scotland. That is to say, they could go forward on a wage basis, a weekly, a monthly, or a yearly basis, possibly with a share in the takings, or taking a general share in the profits and losses.</P>
      <P>On an assumption that the best gross production is going to be taken out of the large holding, then I think the large-holding policy may be justified. I think the large-holding policy cannot be justified if it is to be maintained as a policy which would aim simply at the largest benefit to the holder, which may mean the smallest benefit to the country.  Failing that intensive cultivation of the large holding, then undoubtedly we must aim at the cultivation of the small holding and sub-division.  I want to hear whether the Minister is suggesting to the Land Commission, by his speeches, that they should hesitate in coming to a conclusion about their policy until the Dáil gives a direction, or until this matter has had a good deal of discussion in the country, or is he contemplating a change in the attitude of the country towards this problem and a solution of it?  I think, in view of the history of the past three years, the Land Act and all that has been said in favour of the Land Act, and the hopes that have been created by it &mdash; the propagandist use that has been made of it &mdash;the responsibility for making the decision which the Land Commission has to make, no doubt with the assistance of the Minister, should remain with the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is to be the heroic policy of deciding that the landless men shall not be given land, though their hopes have been stimulated by the Minister's and other Deputies' speeches, it will have to be decided <Col N="1150" /> upon the Minister's responsibility.  Perhaps, before the debate closes, the Minister will tell us whether there has been any delay on the part of the Land Commission, due to hesitation as to the policy on this matter, which they are to put into practical operation?  The tendency of the speeches that he has delivered so far suggests, at least to me, that the question of policy is a matter of hesitation and doubt, and that they are waiting for a lead from others than themselves.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to have to change the tune of the debate.  I wish to deal with delay, irritation, and the arbitrary treatment of the people in Donegal by the Land Commission and the State Solicitor.  We have heard about men getting 22 and 24 acres, and how they will manage to live on that area.  I can tell you about fellows in Donegal who live on 3½ acres of cutout bog.  I can tell you that they got three processes inside of three half-years; that was to remind them of the benevolent Government that they are living under.  There is a matter in connection with turbary that I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister. The estate in question formerly belonged to Lord Shaftesbury, and was sold to the tenants under the Wyndham Act of 1903.  I refer to the townland of Ballycharry, in my area.  Sixteen tenants bought their holdings in 1904, and were secured in the turbary rights in Ballycharry.  Expensive and ruinous litigation started between the people and a family named Harkin, who purchased a farm on the estate in the year 1919.  Twenty-two processes were issued against these tenants by the Harkins for trespass and cutting turf.  This is a most interesting case. The tenants, through their solicitor, instituted equity proceedings to restrain the Harkins from interfering with their <Col N="1151" /> rights.  The cases were tried before Judge Power, at Carndonagh, in March, 1922, and they were decided in the tenants' favour.  However, from this decision an appeal was made to the Dáil Eireann (Winding-up Courts) Commission, consisting of three judges, who reversed Judge Power's decision and deprived those unfortunate sixteen tenants of their turbary rights, which they purchased from Lord Shaftesbury in 1904.  They were let in for costs, amounting to almost £250.  This may have been cold, academic law, this decision of the Dáil Eireann (Winding-up Courts) Commission, but there was damn little justice in it.</P>

      <Col N="1152" /> Is he known in the Land Commission? That is not the whole of it.  It now comes to another phase of the same case, where MacMenamin, of Donegal, comes into the picture.  Acting on the advice of their solicitors these tenants did not pay the Land Commission annuities during the course of the litigation and processes were served on the 10th and 12th of November.  When these processes were served the people remitted the amounts, some of them to the Land Commission, others to Mac-Menamin, in cheques and money orders, on the 10th, 12th and up to the 18th of November, through the Post Office in Moville and through what was formerly the Belfast Bank in Moville.  The costs of the processes were included in the remittances that were sent to both the Land Commission and to Mac-Menamin. The receivable orders in some instances were returned and the amounts credited to them.  Here they are.  In the meantime, Mac Menamin proceeds and obtains decrees against these people at the Circuit Court on the 12th December, notwithstanding the fact that these seven tenants paid their annuities and the costs of the processes in sufficient time.</P>

      <P>I must pay a tribute to Deputy O'Connell for the speech which he has delivered.  While I do not agree with the conclusions that he arrived at, still, as a Farmer Deputy, I feel bound to mark publicly my appreciation of some of the language used in portraying the conditions under which small farmers live in Connaught. He referred to the rundale system.  I am not going to enter into the question as to whether the economic holder or congest, as against the landless man, should receive priority in treatment.  There was at least one thing in Deputy Sears' speech that I could not identify myself with, and that was bringing this question of land division to the hustings.  I quite appreciate the fact that when the Minister for Agriculture was speaking he said this matter should be above party. I quite agree.  I look upon this as a question of social reform.  Yet, when you go down the country you find that this matter is not regarded in that light.  I have here a report published in the &ldquo;Saturday Record&rdquo; of the 23rd May, which is an effort to boost the coming to Ennis of certain Members of the Government.  The article, which was communicated, I understand, by the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation, says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cumann na nGaedheal, mindful of these things, has especially invited down the one man who can appreciate any losses sustained; who can promise the necessary aid and help, and, what is more important, who can redeem each and every promise he will make, not with empty, idle-sounding words but with something substantial and tangible, that will speak in louder and more eloquent fashion, to the poor distressed farmer than all the fanning tongues that ever voiced themselves in Babel. That man is the Minister for Agriculture. His Land Act is his credentials. There is a prairie of untenanted <Col N="1156" /> land in Clare; there are poor men in uneconomic holdings; there are bogs unevenly distributed; ranches in the hands of the very few. These must be partitioned and divided into lots, to make what was uneconomic economic.  Force and violence will not register them so. There is only one &ldquo;constitutional&rdquo; means, and the people of Clare will do well to bear in mind that in this manner, and this alone, will national prosperity be theirs, for now and all time to come.</P>
    <P>Since I have come into public life, not very long ago, indeed, in the Dáil and in the country, I have consistently refrained from putting forward what I might call a demand for the division of lands, that is making it the basis of a popular &ldquo;stunt.&rdquo;  I repudiate the idea.  I would walk the plank of political life to-morrow before I would descend to such tactics.  Other parties, unfortunately, have not taken that view.  I repeat that I look upon this matter as a measure of social reform&mdash; of amelioration of the position of the poorest classes in the community, and I would think it wrong, and criminal, perhaps, to endeavour to exploit their sufferings and their woes.  Deputy Sears says that he would go down the country still and engage in this.  We must remember that we have to deal with people who, unfortunately, are rather backward.  Their ignorance, perhaps, is regrettable, but it is nothing to fling stones at them for.  Unfortunately, no matter how judiciously you speak to some audiences, they will misinterpret you.  They will take exaggerated and perverse views of the statements you make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Not County Clare. It is all over Ireland.  Deputy Sears is as well aware of the fact as I am.  The Deputy understands very well, when the idea is generated amongst the rank and file, the reaction that it naturally lends itself to.  I can quite appreciate the idea of making this question of the division of land one apart altogether from politics.  I have never endeavoured to incite people to anything like that.  When a case is put up to me <Col N="1157" /> I transfer it automatically to the Land Commission and let them deal with it on its merits.  I would not ask any question in the Dáil about the division of land.  But the thing has come to this pass, that in the country hopes have been so much excited, and the cupidity of the people has been aroused to such an extent, that people already in possession of land must, I fear, in self-defence, organise to resist some of this insidious propaganda about the division of land that is going on.</P>
      <P>I regret to have to take such a line on this.  I know it would be quite a popular stunt, if we wanted popularity, to raise a counter-cry, a reactionary cry, against the dividing of land.  I hope we will not be driven to it, but, if we are, the fault will lie with those people who preach division of land without consideration, without reflection and without regard, I submit, to the economy of the process.  We had the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in Cavan on Sunday.  He spoke on the question of the rancher.  The bullock, he said, must go.  Well, I go part of the way with him.  I say the bullock must go to England.  In the record of last year's exports I find that the value of fresh beef and veal exported was £26,533.  Fat cattle exported amounted in numbers to 707,871, with a value of £7,501,717.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1924. Those are the official figures of the Department of Industry and Commerce. The number of stores exported was 1,413,798, and the value, £8,316,473; milch cows, 52,653, and the value, £861,068; springers, 12,793, of the value of £287,721; calves, 14,893, of the value of £307,734; fat sheep, store sheep and lambs were, approximately, 88,000 and the value roughly would be £1,600,000. Yet, this is the big trade that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs tells us to quit, and he tells us that without having adapted ourselves to another system.  &ldquo;The bullock must go!&rdquo;  But while we are driving out the bullock we are to a large extent to refrain from adapting the land to another system of economy.  I submit that that position is one which should not be adopted by <Col N="1158" /> any responsible politician, not alone one at the head of a Department of State but of any standing or stake in the country, if he values its peace or prosperity.</P>
      <P>I have before me the report of the Commission on Agriculture that referred to the place of ranching and the eleven months system in Irish agriculture. It was part of their terms of reference.  This is what they said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In certain districts of France and Ireland it is well known that the undue subdivision of land, while securing both a large population and intensive production, has failed to produce the best social conditions. A large population crowded on the land may, either owing to excessive congestion, or to depression in prices, or to both combined, be living on the verge of destitution.  Under such conditions a bad season may precipitate a famine.  Ireland has had a bitter experience of this.  Any closer settlement policy must, therefore, be handled with great care or it may produce calamitous results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Wisdom, I feel, is shown in this.  I am not suggesting there is not a land problem in Ireland.  There is a problem of relieving persons in the congested districts, of relieving the uneconomic holdings outside these districts and the problem of the landless men.  I submit it must be handled with great tact, that first and foremost it is a question of social reform and of keeping, at the same time, a steady eye on the economy of the system, moving slowly in the sense of gentle expansion. <Col N="1159" /> Deputy Johnson said the Minister was perhaps thinking too much of the present economy.  I submit the Minister is bound to think of the present economy. It is well worth while to examine the economy of the small farm.  I should say, outside the tillage districts, the bulk of the people are engaged in mixed farming.  Young cattle are kept to one or two years old.  They are then sold off.  They fetch comparatively remunerative prices.  Those cattle are fed as stores for over six or twelve months.  A lot depends on the age at which they are purchased.  The fact remains that it is on those ranches that those cattle are kept to mature. Actually they are put in and stall-fed or sold as stores to be finished in England.</P>
      <P>My view is that in the most of what are called ranches, which you divide, you will automatically diminish the demand for good cattle.  I will prove that.  There is such a thing in economics as the law of supply and demand. Those are adjusted by the operation of trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they are dove-tailed into one another.  You break up those holdings and divide them, and you disturb and throw out of gear often, the economy of the district. You find you have more persons producing that kind of stock.  That is bound automatically to reduce the price.  The worst of it remains, that holdings which are to-day economic will, by this fact, to-morrow become uneconomic, because I hold to the view that a man's economic or uneconomic position is not dependent on the area of land which he holds, but on its productive power.  Therefore, I submit that with this increased supply on the market with the diminished demand, automatically lowering prices, you are spreading the area of the uneconomic holdings, and are bringing under its <Col N="1160" /> scope people who, under another system, would be economic.  Without due regard to this, the land division would make them uneconomic where formerly they were comparatively prosperous. Somehow or other, I rather hold with the viewpoint that land can be broken up too small.  I consider that we have got to a stage at which it is no longer desirable to break up land on small holdings, but I feel bound to put up an alternative to the system.  Take a ranch of 1,000 acres which you are breaking up and that you are putting in thirty to forty families on it.  You may have large fields.  Having regard to the economy of your holding, you are bound to break up those fields and put more fences in.  Every one of those persons migrated there will have to provide themselves with farm implements. It is true, you will get a little by co-operation, but I fear it is very little.  They may pool their resources, but the point remains that that sort of thing is wasteful, that there is duplication of machinery, and that the land is not worked to the best advantage.  That is inevitable where on a farm of a thousand acres you have to put in thirty to forty horses, thirty to forty mowing machines, and thirty to forty ploughs.  There is a great waste of resources on the part of tenants migrated into these places.  As the world works to-day the rule is towards the pooling of resources.  You could get these people to work this thing as a commercial concern, something on the principle of a limited liability company. Let each man be associated; that would be the best way to work such a holding. Let the land be valued, and let these people elect a board of directors, and they will then be able to start agricultural operations on a fairly large scale.  By pooling resources they could afford to work the farm with greater economy of man-power and machinery.  They could put in the most up-to-date machinery and have central farm buildings.</P>

I know that the difficulties are great, but I think they can be surmounted.  I ask the Government to endeavour at least to experiment initially in that way. The experiment may be a failure.  Let those who work such holdings receive wages for the work they perform, based on output and efficiency.  Let them, so to speak, work for dividends on the money they have invested.</P>

      <P>I quite agree.  Remember this is one of the cases we have to deal with.  I think the debate is not quite identified with the existing system, and that other departures have been advocated.  But the point was raised that it would give at least the best chance to those people to make good.  The point at issue is the division of land.  The question is whether we will divide it into small holdings to be run individually with the greatest waste of man-power and inefficiently, or whether, by making a bold venture, we shall endeavour to run it on corporate lines, so that land can be made profitable.  It is only by the introduction of the most modern methods and working on scientific <Col N="1162" /> principles that it can be done.  The small farm offers very little facilities for production on a scientific scale, as compared with a large farm.  The position is one that must be faced with justice. If you separate justice from reform, neither one nor the other is safe. It has been suggested that the Minister should avail himself to the full of the powers of the Land Act, and acquire lands anywhere for the relief of congestion. Is the proposal one to expropriate farmers in possession in order to carry out such a doubtful experiment? I think something is due to those who are in possession.  I will say that each case should be judged on the merits.  The problem, I admit, is a very difficult one to face.  Asking the Minister to exact the full pound of flesh is not a helpful solution.</P>
      <P>I do not know the policy of the Ministry about demesnes.  I submit that it is not a wise policy to break up demesnes.  There are, perhaps, instances where the exigencies of the situation might demand the breaking up of demesnes, but I would suggest that we need cultured classes in this country.  If you break up demesnes you are automatically expropriating a number of our best citizens.  I ask the Minister, as far as possible, to leave the demesnes intact.</P>

In some counties he stated that twelve instalments were due.  If that is so, I think it is unfair to prosecute people who only owe one instalment for perhaps three or four months while others are allowed to be in arrears to the extent of twelve instalments. That means that some people have not paid annuities for 4½ years.  The Minister stated that it is the same people are always in arrears.</P>

      <P>The Department allows the same people to continue in arrear, but prosecutes people who are only in arrears for one or two months.  The policy adopted is, I believe, the policy of least resistance.  The man who pays well is prosecuted, but the bad payer is allowed to drag along.  I have a number of cases to which my attention was drawn from County Limerick.  I have a case on the Dixon estate where a man, whose holding was vested on the 17th July, 1924, got no receivable order and no demand for payment until he got a civil bill.</P>

      <P>Some months ago he was summoned to Rathkeale to meet a demand for payment of an annuity, and costs.  This man received no demand for payment before he got the civil bill.  He went to the Court at Rathkeale on the 29th May, but there was no State Solicitor there to prosecute. He went to the Court the next <Col N="1164" /> day, and again there was no State Solicitor there to proceed with the case.  Is that treating the people fairly?</P>

He went to the Court, but there was no State Solicitor there to prosecute.</P>
      <P>There is another case I want to mention. It relates to a demand note sent to the executor of the late Mrs. Houlihan. The demand note was sent in August, 1922, for the June, 1922, instalment. That instalment was paid in October, 1922.  There were four instalments paid in April, 1924, which should give him a clear receipt up to the 1st December of the same year. Afterwards he got a civil bill for an instalment that was claimed to be due in June, 1924, while he should have had a clear receipt up to the December of that year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No; rather than go to court he sent on the instalment.  There was another case in which the tenant sent the instalment, with costs, to the State Solicitor.  I sent this case to the Department, asking to know why there should have been proceedings of this kind.  The reply I got was a request to know whether he had got his receipt for the December, 1921, instalment. The man holds a receipt for the June, 1922 instalment.  Now they are going to go back to get the receipts for the December, 1921, instalment. That would be six months before the man came into possession at all.  I think that is not a fair way to treat these people.  At the Abbeyfeale Court in November, 1924, there were sixty prosecutions for the recovery of these annuities.  Most of them were dismissed. Thirty-one were nilled, three <Col N="1165" /> or four were dismissed on the merits with costs, some more were dismissed without prejudice, and there were only decrees given in about twenty cases. The District Justice remarked afterwards that it was an unheard-of procedure to have these cases dismissed against the Land Commission, but said that he could not do otherwise.  He considered it was the fault of the Land Commission that these cases should have been dismissed, because some of the parties proceeded against had even paid their instalments in advance.  I ask is that good administration?</P>
      <P>I put a question to the Minister on that matter, and I asked that the Minister for Finance should look into it and see in what way the administration in connection with these land purchase annuities was carried on. The reply I got was that appeals were being lodged in these cases, but I understand that the appeals were not proceeded with.  If there was a deficiency in the Land Commission as regards these instalments and that the people proceeded against were able to go into court and produce receipts in respect of the instalments sought to be recovered, it shows, I think, that there must be inefficiency somewhere. There must have been some kind of deficiency in the Land Commission when proceedings were taken in connection with these instalments.  As the people were able to produce their receipts for the instalments, I would like to know how the deficiency was made up that appeared in the Land Commission books.  We know that in banking institutions deficiencies of this kind have to be put right, and that if there is only a penny that cannot be accounted for it has to be made up by the officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a newspaper here which contains a report of the cases that came into court.  The report covers a whole page of the newspaper. I did not say that the instalments <Col N="1166" /> ranged over a period of nine years. What I did refer to was the proceedings not being taken for the recovery of nine instalments.  That would cover a period of four and a half years, there being two instalments to be paid in each year.  The newspaper contained a report of these cases and gives full particulars of them all.  In some of the cases the instalments sought to be recovered ranged from three to eight. In one case as many as twelve instalments were due.  The non-payment of these annuities means, as far as the rates in the County Limerick are concerned, that relief to the extent of 2/-. in the £ is being held up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>They come under every Act.  All of them could not have been under the 1923 Act.  We are only now in the year 1925, and, therefore, how could proceedings be taken for the recovery of five instalments under the 1923 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not speaking for any particular person on this matter.  I do not wish to be taken either as speaking against all the defaulters.  I know there were some people in default because they had a lot of sickness in their families or because they lost cattle, or had some other genuine reason for not paying up.  I know, however, that some of these defaulters are very well off, and that they should have been made pay up.  They are so well off that they can run motorcars for pleasure all over the country and are able to go to race meetings. Certainly these people should not be allowed to go into arrears.  If the Minister can see his way to go back to the six days' notice to clear off these arrears I will help him to put a penal charge of, say, 10 per cent. on defaulters from the date that the instalment becomes due.  In that way the failure of these people to pay their annuities will not fall on the ratepayers. I think it is most unfair to have the good ratepayers penalised in this way for the default of the bad <Col N="1167" /> ratepayers.  The Minister himself has admitted that it is the same people who are nearly always in arrears.</P>
    <P>My opinion is that in this matter the Department takes the line of least resistance. The defaulters are allowed to escape too long, and the result is that all the burden is placed on the backs of the good ratepayers.  In 1923 the State Solicitor in Limerick stated that he had over 4,000 prosecutions in respect of the collection of these annuities. In respect of some of these prosecutions he got costs which amounted to 7/9 in each case; in others his costs came to 15/9, and in more cases his costs amounted to 21/-.  Before proceeding against these people he gave them no notice whatever.  I know that if a good many of them did get the six days' notice they would have paid up, and there would have been no need to put them to all this expense.  At all events, the prosecutions meant that a sum of practically £3,000 was put into the pocket of the State Solicitor.  I do not know whether all that money goes to the State Solicitor or to the Minister for Finance, but I know that the costs that had to be paid amounted to that sum.  I know, too, that some of my neighbours who were processed would have paid if they had got the six days' notice.  One of my neighbours was put to £5 costs.  He had to travel a distance of twenty-six miles to attend the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>He would if he had it, but the banks would not take the money after a certain day.  As a matter of fact, he had money hid in his house at the time, and he was afraid to let even his children know where he had it. That was during the disturbed times, and his house was more or less occupied by the Irregulars.  I suggest that that was a very bad time to abolish the giving of the six days' notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the distribution of land, I do not think the Government have any policy in regard to that.  The inspectors are given a certain district, and have no power to go outside that.  I know of one inspector who went down to a district to divide up an estate that <Col N="1168" /> had been bought over by a committee some time previous.  The estate was being divided up, and there was some meadowing to be sold.  Adjoining this estate, but in another parish, there was some cragg land, on which there were two or three uneconomic holders. There was a good deal of corcass land on the estate on which the inspector went down to carry out a scheme of division.  This was the Westropp estate. The Committee was trying to carry out a policy of division that would be agreeable to all the parties.  The Committee suggested that two of their neighbours who are uneconomic holders in the next parish, should get some of the land on this estate for meadowing. The inspector took out his maps and had a look at them.  He looked at a farm in the adjoining parish in which these uneconomic holders lived.  He asked, &ldquo;Who owns that farm,&rdquo; and was told that it was a farm purchased three years previously by a gentleman who lives in Limerick.  Then he said these people do not want land when they allow a place like, that to be sold. The result was that the hay on that farm was burnt two months afterwards, all because of the incitement of this man to do that.</P>

      <P>The next inspector comes down and he brings in an individual who lives sixteen miles away &mdash;a man who never had land or house. That is not the policy of land distribution, and it will not tend to peace.  I have heard it said by people that if <Col N="1169" /> that policy is carried out they will break down the tidal banks and flood the place, if the Land Commission is going round and encouraging such a policy.  Another inspector comes around and asks is there any untenanted land up for sale.  There is a policy now to prevent the sale of these places.  Deputy Sears made a statement a while ago that was anything but tending to put down that policy. Such a statement encourages more Bolshevism than anything else.  It surprised me to hear Deputy Sears make such a statement.  The Department are not too scrupulous in coming into demesnes and mentioning that one place is vested, and that people have a right to go to the banks and the shopkeepers, though those people have no title to the lands at all.  I know of one place of fifty acres recently that was up for sale and the local people, because of a suggestion made, went into the auction to prevent the sale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested very much in connection with this question of arrears.  The taking away of the guarantee fund in order to pay interest on land stock is a thing that affects every farmer in the Saorstát, and those of us who, in our own country, are paying our commitments promptly, and as well as we can, find it very difficult to understand the attitude of the Land Commission in permitting men in Limerick to be eight and nine instalments in arrear.  If this statement is allowed to go without contradiction, and I have a resolution from the Farmers' Association of Limerick asking me to bring the matter before the House, and to ascertain why such a policy is permitted, I wonder why men in my area should be asked to pay regularly while their comrades in Limerick default in their payments and are allowed to default.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister takes great credit from the fact that the deficiency taken from <Col N="1170" /> the guarantee fund in 1923 was £728,000, and that this year the deficiency was only £578,000.  The whole amount of the agricultural grant is only £600,000, and when the Minister talks of reducing it down to £578,000 he is in effect saying the whole of the agricultural grant is gone west as regards the relief of those people who are footing their liability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making a mistake.  The amount of the agricultural grant is £599,000 to be exact, The £578,000 is not stopped from the agricultural grant in a year.  It was stopped gradually over a number of years, since 1891, and that is the net total drawn from the agricultural grant during all that period and in fact the amount payable in most counties in Ireland for the last two years has been more than the normal agricultural grant by reason of the fact that arrears have been decreasing in the last two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree that arrears have been decreasing but that does not explain why there is a year's agricultural grant still owing.  If it is peculiar to the last century or to the first Land Act why is it that it has not been settled?  If it is to be paid why are these people permitted to owe this money?  Why not ask them to pay it promptly?  Let us all get this credit if it is to be the practice.  Is there any security by which the Land Commission can realise this payment?  If there is such security why not have it realised?  Why permit people to occupy land if they do not pay for it? A year and a half ago or two years ago, when this new policy was adopted the abolition of the buff order &mdash; the six days' notice &mdash; which the Deputy speaks of contributed to a good extent to the arrears question.</P>

      <P>Or for time.  Certainly not by me or any Deputy I know of.  I know this: if you would reenact this practice of sending out the six-day notices you would obviate the necessity for employing the State Solicitor so frequently, and all those costs which have been quoted for us from Donegal and other places against the tenants would be saved and whatever cost it would entail in the office of the Land Commission would be well worth the trouble.  The system worked well in the past and it would work well in the future.</P>
      <P>Now just a word about the land to be divided.  If Deputy O'Connell would take the number of acres in Ireland as 15 million and allow each holder to have say 50 acres, the total number of holders in Ireland would be 280,000, whereas under the present division we have 441,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Well if you allow 25 acres to each holder you will have 560,000 holders, so that, no matter how you get at it, you will not much improve the position as regards the total number of people living on the land.  I quite agree that in some instances there might be more land taken, but on the whole there cannot be any provision for the landless men or speedy relief of congestion which we were told would take place.  We have the figures now and we can readily understand that no matter how you get at settling this matter you will have congestion in this country.  I am sorry that is so, but the figures point to that very statement.  I was going to raise the question of the difficulty in connection with the cost of the Land Commission.  I hope it is not a subject which will cause friction, but, before the Treaty, the cost of the Land Commission was a State charge on the Three Kingdoms, a charge payable by the taxpayers in the Three Kingdoms. By taking over the functions of the Land Commission we have taken over this tremendous charge, something like £644,000.  By whatever arrangement <Col N="1172" /> we make I hope that that matter will be adjusted because we are merely rent warmers and rent collectors for the stockholders in London.  I hope that in regard to the new Land Bonds the money will not be sent to England and that we will not be perpetuating a system which, in my opinion, ought not be allowed to have got into its present position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one point mentioned, I think, by Deputy Sears, which in my opinion has a good deal to do with regard to the complaints made in reference to the delay in the inspection and division of lands under the Act of 1923, namely, the lack of clerical and inspectorial assistance so far as the Land Commission is concerned. I notice that that staff of inspectors, of whom 28 are only temporary, is, for the year 1925/26, 82, as against 53 for the year 1924-25.  The number of clerical employees, excluding the higher executive officers, for 1925/26, is 494, as against 379 for the year 1924/25.  The reason I want to deal with this point is this.  Six or seven months ago I made inquiries at the Land Commission as to the position in regard to a number of estates in my constituency, and I was informed, I think correctly, that a certain number had been inspected, and one or two estates had been purchased. I think it is the common experience of every Deputy, especially those representing rural areas, that the number of communications received in connection with applications for land is greater than the number of communications received in connection with any other matters in respect of the people whom we represent.  I made inquiries about a week ago as to what was the position in connection with some of the same estates now, and I was told that the inspection work was done.  Inspectors had been down and had suggested schemes of division, but, owing to the delay in completing the work so far as the clerical section of the work in connection with that division is concerned, the schemes of division and handing over had been held up.  I was assured that the number of the staff employed in certain departments concerned with that particular part of the work is less than <Col N="1174" /> the staff in the same department in the years 1909 to 1914.  It must be obvious that the amount of work thrown on the Land Commission, and particularly on the department to which I refer, as a result of the Act of 1923, should call for a greater number of qualified clerical assistants and inspectors if the work is to be done within a reasonable period.  The number of temporary clerical hands for the present year is 120; but, when work of a highly technical nature such as this is being dealt with, one would look for a greater number of permanent qualified clerical assistants instead of a reduction in the number of permanent hands in the departments.  Take the figures of the clerical officers.  The number of clerical officers on the permanent staff in 1924-'25 was 208.  In 1925-'26, when the work for this particular section should be much heavier, the number is 187, a reduction of twenty-one.  There is also a reduction in the number of staff clerks of one.  There is an increase in the number of higher executive officers of two as compared with last year.  The point I want to make is this.  I think it must be agreed that the work of three lady clerks, as I understand there are a number of lady clerks included in the 120, in the best commercial departments in the city is not more than the amount of work done by two junior clerks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been a common experience in commercial circles, in banks and railways, that the work of lady clerks, especially in their earlier services, has to be revised in many cases.  That is the average comparison that has been arrived at.  However, I only mention the point to try to bring home to the Minister that the number of temporary clerks who have been brought in this year, and who undoubtedly have no previous experience in work of this kind, cannot balance the reduction that has taken place in the number of qualified men.  There is a reduction of twenty-two in the qualified competent junior officers in this Department.  If you had to increase the number of inspectors, whether temporary or permanent, from 53 to 82 in this year, one can reasonably assume, from an examination of these figures, that the <Col N="1175" /> clerical staff has not been increased in the same proportion as the inspectors have been increased.  I have no complaint to make with regard to the preliminary work that has to be done by the inspectors, because in any case, where I have passed a communication to the Department requesting inspection work to be carried out where the case is urgent, my general experience is that that has been done inside a reasonable period, but the delay occurs in the clerical section, due to the reasons which I hope I have brought to the notice of the Minister.  I would ask the Minister &mdash; and I think I can give him more reasons than I have already given him &mdash; to make an investigation into that aspect of the administration department of the Land Commission, and to see whether he can satisfy himself as to whether the amount of clerical assistance available is sufficient to cope with the work the inspectors have done in the preliminary stages of inspection and valuation and putting forward schemes for division.</P>
    <P>I cannot congratulate the Minister in the same way as Deputy Shaw has done in regard to the amount of land that has been acquired and divided, and the huge number of acres of land that have already been inspected, for the simple reason that in the constituency I represent there is nothing like the amount of land available for division that there is in the case of the constituency which Deputy Shaw represents. I think, from what I can learn in regard to the operations of the inspectors, whether they be permanent or temporary, that they are not united in their views in regard to the relative claims of landless men, uneconomic holders, and representatives of evicted tenants.  I think it would not be a waste of the Minister's time if he were to summon in his office a general meeting of all the inspectors and deliver to them his views, and in a very clear way inform them of what his intentions are in regard to the division of land.  Of course, if he comes to this House and makes a speech in the way that he has spoken on this Estimate, not making it quite clear as to what he has in his mind or what he intends to do or what <Col N="1176" /> should be done by his inspectors in regard to the division of land, and in regard to the relative claims of the various people who have applied for land, it would be very difficult to ask him at this stage to make this clear at a public or a private meeting which he might address.</P>
    <P>I am a Member of this House who, I think, can claim to be one of the few who have hardly ever put down a question in regard to the acquisition of land.  I can recall one case where I did put down a question which I regarded as urgent.  I have adopted the practice of forwarding to the Department of the Minister or to the Land Commission almost every communication I receive in regard to matters of this kind.  I think the work of acquiring estates in the division I represent might be dealt with more speedily than it is being dealt with at the present time.  In saying that, I want to add that there are exceptional cases which the Minister might take into consideration and deal with more quickly than he has been dealing with the cases I have in mind.  I refer particularly to estates or large tracts of land that have been inspected, and where the men who worked on these estates for a number of years have been thrown out of work. I think the case for the speedy acquisition of land where men have become unemployed is a case that might be taken out of the ordinary run, so far as the work of the Land Commission is concerned.  I have brought to the Minister's notice one or two cases of that kind, and I certainly cannot congratulate the Minister upon the speedy way that they have been dealt with.  I hope he will take particular notice of cases of that kind and try to hurry up the remaining stages of the work in the Department, so that the land, if it is thought advisable, may be given to the men who have been working on these particular estates and who are already thrown out of employment.</P>

      <P>Before the Dáil adjourns, in order not to spring the <Col N="1178" /> matter to-morrow on the President, I want to say that the Local Government elections will take place on next Tuesday, and I want him to consider the advisability of leaving the reassembling of the Dáil for next week over until Wednesday.  It is very vital that everybody should record his vote one way or another.  That is a gospel that has been preached very widely, and I think we have a right to fall into line with it here.</P>
