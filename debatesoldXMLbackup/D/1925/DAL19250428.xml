      <P>Thomas Grainger made a <Col N="370" /> claim under the Army Pensions Act, 1923, only in respect of injury to his left hand.  The Medical Board which examined him did not report any other disability.  A temporary pension was granted, pending the completion of surgical treatment, which was given in a military hospital.  In due course the degree of disability became such that, under the provisions of the Act, a pension was no longer issuable.  On reassessment of the claim, however, it was found practicable to award a gratuity of £30.  I am not aware of any new circumstances calling for a reconsideration of that award.</P>

      <P>This Bill proposes to extend, for another year, the period during which the Commissioners of Public Works may exercise the powers of acquiring premises for the accommodation of the Gárda Síochána which were conferred by the Act of 1923.  The present position as regards the distribution of the Gárda is, that out of a proposed establishment of 850 stations, 822 have actually been occupied.  Of these, in about 300 cases, the buildings now occupied are unsuitable as permanent barracks.</P>
      <P>The compulsory powers conferred on the Commissioners were resorted to only in 71 cases.  In 9 of these cases, the acquired premises were subsequently vacated for permanent quarters, and in 47 cases amicable agreements as to terms have been arrived at with the owners.  In four cases terms have been fixed by the Commissioners in default of agreement, and in the remaining eleven cases negotiations as to terms are still in progress, the policy of the Commissioners being to exhaust the possibilities of agreement before exercising their statutory powers.  In none of the cases in which the Commissioners fixed terms of tenancy did the owner exercise the right of appeal to the referee provided by Section 5 of the Act of 1923.</P>
      <P>The great majority of barracks occupied by the Royal Irish Constabulary were owned by private individuals, and were held on yearly tenancies.  In many of the cases where the barracks were destroyed, the owners are rebuilding or have agreed to rebuild, and to let to the Gárda.  In several cases where the owners were unwilling to rebuild, the Commissioners have secured the site for rebuilding.  In other cases new sites have been, or are being, acquired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimates for the current year for Public Works and Buildings include a sum of £30,000 for the purchase of sites for Gárda barracks, and a sum of £110,000 for the erection of new <Col N="372" /> barracks and the adaptation of existing barracks.  The complete provision of permanent accommodation for the Gárda will, however, take some time. Apart from the negotiations with owners, the investigation of title is often tedious, and, with so many cases to be dealt with, the work of rebuilding must be spread over a couple of years.  In the meantime, the Commissioners of Public Works ask that the Act of 1923, which has assisted them materially in their negotiations, be continued for at least another year.</P>
    <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

    <P>One of the matters to which my attention was drawn very soon after I took charge of the Department of Fisheries was the possibility of extending our river fisheries.  Owing to the position of the Saorstát on the Atlantic border of Europe and owing to the freedom of our rivers from pollution and the suitability of the rivers and the lakes for salmon and trout, those ought to be of a great deal more value to the people of the country than they are at present allowed to be.  Some years ago an attempt <Col N="374" /> was made to estimate the value of the inland fisheries, and a sum of £2,000,000 annually was agreed upon as a fair estimate.  In this estimate an account was taken of the revenue earned by hotels and railways and such persons by reason of people coming to this country especially for the purpose of fishing.  It is my aim, and the aim of my Department, to increase that amount, and to make the inland fisheries of the country worth, if possible, £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 per annum. In considering the subject of inland fisheries, the preservation of our river stock is a matter of supreme importance.</P>
    <P>Salmon spawn only once, as a general rule, and scientists estimate that the female salmon produces in spawning 1,000 eggs for each pound of its weight, so that a fifteen-pound salmon would produce 15,000 eggs.  It is further estimated that only one out of every thousand of these eggs reaches maturity, and returns to its native river when four years' old, to spawn.  That would seem to apply also,, and with certain modifications, to eels and sea-trout, as well as non-migratory fish, like brown trout, pike, and so on.</P>
    <P>The preservation of the stock in rivers is effected in all civilised countries by laws, and in the Saorstát at present there are twenty-four Acts of Parliament directed to fishery preservation. Under that Code the country is divided into districts, and in the Saorstát, as at present defined, there are twenty-one such districts.  In each district there is a Board of Conservators, vested with the necessary power for the protection of the rivers in their districts.  The constitution and powers of these Boards of Conservators were fixed in 1848, seventy-seven years ago, and these have continued with practically no alteration up to the present. Experience in the working of fisheries, within the last few years, have shown that certain contingencies have arisen that could not have been foreseen seventy-seven years ago, and it is necessary now that these should be provided for.  The changes, for instance, produced in the Judicature in the Saorstát have called for certain alterations and modifications in old statutes, and the <Col N="375" /> decrease in the purchasing power of money during that period renders it necessary to review the financial basis from which these Boards of Conservators derive their incomes to enable them to carry out their statutory duties.  The aim of this Bill is to remedy these defects, and thus to facilitate the work of preserving and developing the river fisheries.</P>
    <P>Coming to the details of the Bill, Deputies will see that it is divided into four parts.  The first part deals largely with the constitution and election of the Board of Conservators.  It will be seen that it is proposed in Section 4 of the Bill to hold the new elections at the commencement of the next fishery year after the Bill becomes law.  The object is to create uniformity in the triennial elections.  At present the elections to the Board of Conservators are held in different years in different districts. Power is also sought to alter the number of conservators in the electoral divisions.</P>
    <P>I may explain that each fishery district is divided into electoral divisions according to tidal and fresh water portions of the rivers.  Usually there are two electoral divisions in each district, one the tidal estuary and one the fresh water.  The number of conservators to be elected for each electoral division was fixed at the time mentioned, 1848, and there is no power under the existing law to change that.  The power that we seek to change it is necessary, chiefly, because of the disappearance of the justices of the peace who, in many cases, were ex-officio members of the local Boards.  At present, in order to be eligible for election to a Board of Conservators, one has to be resident in or have real property in the electoral division for which he is a candidate.  We propose by Section 6 to extend that to the whole district.  Thus, if a man is resident in an area, holding real property in the whole district, he is eligible for election in that electoral division in that district.  At present the owner of a fishery of a Poor Law Valuation of £100 or over, is entitled to sit on a local Board ex-officio.  We propose to extend that to bring in persons who hold fisheries the Poor Law <Col N="376" /> Valuation of which is £50 or over.  The proposed alteration in Section 8 as to the number of votes, is consequential upon the alteration of the second part of the Bill by which it is proposed to set up a new scale of licences for rods, nets, eel weirs, and so on.</P>
    <P>We have a provision in the Bill that states when a man takes out a licence in one district, if he goes to another district, he has to pay a further 10/- in order to fish in that district, but that further 10/- will not be counted for a vote.  Such person will not have a vote in that district.  Neither will a person who takes out a fourteen-day short term licence.  These persons are usually birds of passage and could not be expected to take as much interest in the welfare of the district as persons residing there.  We also hope by that provision to reduce the number of proxy votes, a thing I consider very desirable.  The existing statutes do not make any provision for a member of a Board who wishes to retire, or for the filling of casual vacancies.  We remedy this by Section 9 (conservators may resign), and Section 11 (casual vacancies to be filled by co-option).</P>
    <P>Part II is the most important part of the Bill&mdash;Finance.  I have already dealt in general terms with the need for preserving river fisheries.  It will be generally admitted that the position in most districts at present is very unsatisfactory. I am constantly receiving information about illegalities that are going on: illegal netting in rivers; fixed nets in estuaries; bombing, poisoning, ignoring of bye-laws; fishing without licences; fishing during the weekly and annual close season, and so on.  The reason for this is that the rivers are not fully patrolled, even though in most districts the Gárda Síochána have given very great assistance indeed to the Boards' bailiffs.  It is only fair to the Gárda Síochána that I should say I am constantly receiving voluntary tributes from the different Boards of Conservators to the Gárda Síochána for the very excellent work they have done. I might mention one specially&mdash;the Cork Board&mdash;which is a very live Board. In the Lee estuary this year there were 130 nets seized for illegal fishing.  The capture of a big portion of that 130 was <Col N="377" /> due to one sergeant of the Gárda Síochána, and all this was done outside his ordinary official duties.  However, in spite of the help that the Gárda Síochána has given, the illegalities continue, and something must be done to meet the matter.</P>
    <P>We feel that a better type of bailiff is needed.  Those employed at present are for the most part unsuitable, but they are the best that the conservators can get for the funds at their disposal. In the year 1923 the total income of the Boards of Conservators of the Saorstát was £10,000.  Of that £5,200 was spent on bailiffs and watchers.  There were 340 of these employed.  That worked out at something less that £16 per man per annum For that remuneration you will not get a very good type of bailiff. The job will not be so good that he will worry very much if he loses it.</P>
    <P>The financial clauses of the Bill aim at remedying this by putting more funds at the disposal of the Boards and enabling them to appoint better and more bailiffs than they are able to do at present with the existing funds.  The financial proposals fall under two heads (1) increase of the licence duties paid on rods, nets and eel weirs; (2) diverting the rate which is at present payable by private fisheries from the local authority to the Boards of Conservators. The sources of finance of the conservators at present are (1) licence duties; (2) the special fishery rate that I will refer to in a few minutes; (3) grant from my Department and contributions; (4) fines for fishery offences.</P>
    <P>The statute of 1848 which created the Boards of Conservators laid down the maximum licence duty which the Boards could levy on the various forms of implements for fishing.  That maximum duty has now been levied for over 50 years and most people will admit that the purchasing value of money 50 years ago and to-day would justify an increase now in these maximum duties. It was found after a time that the funds of the Boards were insufficient to carry out effectively the important duties entrusted to them, and it became necessary 25 years ago to make State grants.  The amount of these varies from year to year according to the requirements, but the average paid out <Col N="378" /> in this way for the last five years was £3,700 per annum.  The Bill proposes to double the licence duties on salmon rods and eel weirs and increase the duty on drift nets proportionate to their catching area.  In some districts the salmon drift net which is used extends to about 1,500 yards.  The present duty on such a net is only £3.  The same duty is exacted for a salmon drift net of only 130 or 150 yards.  We feel that a net of 1,500 yards should be made to pay more than the shorter net of a less catchment area.  The Bill provides for that.</P>
    <P>For the first 400 yards we propose £4 for the drift net and 5/- for every 200 yards after that.  So that a net of two thousand yards under this arrangement will pay £6, whereas at present it pays £3.  A net of 1,600 yards will pay £5 10s., and so on.  I am also increasing the duty on the drift net from £3 to £4, and on the snap net from £1 10s. to £2 10s.  It is not proposed to alter the duty payable on other forms of engines, such as bag nets, stake nets or weirs and cribs.  The reason for that is that since the maximum duties were originally fixed the duty on these has already been doubled, whereas the duty on the ones I now propose to change have not been touched since 1848.</P>
    <P>I alluded a minute ago to the special fishery arrangement which is at present one of the sources of finance; that is the fixed rate of 10 per cent. payable on private fishery rights.  A private fishery right is valued in the ordinary way for poor law purposes.  It pays its full rate the same as any other property to the local authority.  In addition to that, it pays ten per cent. of the rate to the Board of Conservators. By a clause in the Act of 1848, in which this provision was made, a person liable to pay that rate could deduct any licence duties that he paid.  In this way the rate was, to a great extent, dodged, because the person who was liable for the rate bought a sufficient number of licences for his employees to avoid paying any rate at all, or only a rate of a negligible amount.  In the year 1923 the yield of that rate was only £924 for all districts.  The Local Government Act of 1898 provided that <Col N="379" /> a county district could levy a rate not exceeding a halfpenny in the £ on the rateable value of the district to be paid over to the Board of Conservators for the district.  This was actually never enforced, through indifference on the part of the local councils, and it was never pressed by the Boards of Conservators because it carried with it certain provisions which would practically swamp the Boards with local representatives.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill is to abolish for a period of ten years this special fishery rate of 10 per cent. and to give power to the Boards of Conservators to levy such a rate each year as will be necessary for them to carry on their duties.  The private fisheries thus rated by the Conservators will be free from any rating by the local authorities. The total valuation of the fisheries in the Saorstát at present is only a very negligible amount in comparison with the valuation of the whole Saorstát. The amount is £18,884, whereas the total rateable valuation of the Saorstát is something over £11,000,000.  Therefore, the loss of revenue which will be sustained by diverting the proceeds of this rate from the local authorities to the Boards of Conservators will be negligible.  Going with that I have a provision, in order to ensure that an adequate rate is struck to meet the requirements of the Board in each district, that the central authority will be empowered to supervise and approve of such rates as the Boards may propose to levy in the year, while if there is default on the part of any Board to strike a rate, it may be fixed by the central authority.  If a Board tries to get away without striking a rate at all, I am asking for power to strike a rate myself.  At any rate, I will supervise, because my intention is that this provision will not let private fisheries off any lighter than they would get off if they were still liable to pay rates to the local authority.  That means there would be no less rates on the fisheries under this provision than if they were under the local authority.  As a whole, the loss of revenue makes very little difference to the local authorities. There are a few cases where it will. These are special cases, such as Galway <Col N="380" /> and Ballina, where there are very valuable fisheries, and where, if the rates were taken away, an unfair burden might be thrown on the other ratepayers. In the Bill provision is made to meet that.  Where the taking of the rates for the Boards of Conservators means an increase of more than 1d. in the £ in the local rate, my Department will meet out of grants anything more than 1d. in the £.  The best way to illustrate that will be to give an example. If you take an urban district where the Poor-Law Valuation is £120,000; that there is in that urban district a private fishery valued at £1,000; and that the poundage is 15/- in the £, the rates derivable on £120,000 would be £90,000, and from the £1,000 fishery rate £750.  £750 on a total rate of £120,000 works out at 1½d. in the £. What would happen there is that the first 1d. in the £ would fall on the local people, and the amount over 1d.&mdash;that is the halfpenny&mdash;would be contributed by my Department to the local authority.  That means that £250 would be paid by my Department to the local authority.</P>

      <P>The Bill also provides for the audit of the accounts of the board of conservators by an auditor from the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  That is a matter of convenience, as the auditors will be going around the country and it will save duplicating officials.  Members of the boards will be liable to surcharge in case of improper expenditure just as in the case of any other local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far, the clauses I have been dealing with refer to the machinery for carrying out the work of preserving the salmon rivers, and also the provision of finance.  These measures would, more or less, fail to accomplish the object in view, if some steps were not taken to hit the poacher and the illegal fisherman.  It is not enough to improve the policing of the rivers.  We <Col N="381" /> must, at the same time, try to make it extremely difficult for the poacher to get rid of his catch.  Up to the present there has been no machinery for putting a stop to the traffic in poached and illegally caught fish.  It is well known that on some proprietary rivers, year after year, the quantity of salmon sent to the markets by poachers exceeded the quantity sent by the owners.</P>
    <P>In Part 3 of the Bill, I propose to have all dealers in salmon and trout licensed, and anyone not so licensed who sells, or offers for sale, salmon or trout shall be guilty of an offence punishable by fine or imprisonment. The licence will be issued by the board of conservators on the certificate of the district justice, who has to be satisfied as to the fitness of the applicant.  A person must be of good character before he can get a licence.  A licensed dealer will be required to keep a record of his transactions, and this record has to be available for inspection by authorised persons.  Failure to keep a record or produce it when required is visited with penalties.  In many instances illegally caught salmon and trout are exported to dealers outside the Saorstát in packages which conceal the contents.  Power is sought in Part 4, Section 22, to oblige persons consigning packages of salmon or trout to indicate the contents clearly.  Power is given to search persons, vehicles or packages suspected of containing illegally-caught fish, also premises, docks, etc.  These wide powers were considered necessary to enable us to have a complete check on the traffic on illegally-caught salmon.</P>
    <P>The remaining clauses of the Bill deal mainly with the provision of of machinery by which the Fishery Acts will be carried out.  The Minister is given powers of control over Fishery Boards not provided for in previous legislation, but which experience has shown to be desirable and necessary. These include power to dissolve Fishery Boards which fail to act, to create new fishery districts and alter the areas of existing districts.  This may be necessary owing to the Boundary.  The Minister is also enabled to make bye-laws. At present this power exists only with the Department of Lands and <Col N="382" /> Agriculture.  This permits certain things to be done in the interests of artificial propagation and scientific investigation.</P>
    <P>Section 31 is important.  At present we have no power to prosecute or punish persons who give warning to poachers and others doing illegal acts. On many rivers the bailiffs and Gárda are watched by accomplices of the poachers, who are warned in time to remove all traces of their illegal fishing and so evade punishment.  Now, this clause is intended to get after these persons who act as scouts.  Section 32 remedies a defect in the Act of 1842. That did not impose any penalty for making use of a fixed engine for taking eels in the close season, except in the eyes, the gaps or the sluices of an eel weir.  To remove this defect, Section 32 makes it an offence to fish for eels in the close season by any means except a rod and line.  Section 33 is intended to remove a somewhat analogous defect in the law regarding an offence in connection with having in possession on the banks of a river, etc. a spear, gaff, or strokehaul in daylight.  The existing law makes this an offence only when it occurs at night.</P>
    <P>In this brief outline of the measure it will be noted that the main object is to put the local fishery authorities on a satisfactory financial footing, so that they can do the work entrusted to them in a befitting manner. The main principle aimed at is to make fisheries yield the revenue required for their own preservation.  On the whole, the Boards of Conservators have done their work well in the past. With the increased funds which the Bill will enable them to raise, and with more precise control over their activities by my Department, I look forward to the steady improvement of our inland fisheries with confidence.  I move the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill purports, as the Minister has said, to make better provision for the preservation and the conservation of our inland fisheries.  So far as it does that, it will meet with general approval.  As to the general principle of the Bill, I am sure it would be more satisfactory to all of <Col N="383" /> us if the Minister, when he was bringing in this Bill, consolidated all the 40 Fishery Acts that he talks about, codified them, and put them all in the one Act.  That would be more satisfactory from many points of view&mdash;from the points of view of Deputies and those who will be affected by the administration of the Bill when it becomes law. I do not like this system of legislation by reference, of which there is very much evidence in this Bill.  I did not know, for instance, what Sections 6 and 7 referred to until the Minister spoke, because I did not go to the trouble of fishing out all the old Acts that he spoke of.  It would be more satisfactory if he set down in Section 7 the definite conditions governing the qualifications of those who could be elected, and if, in Section 6, instead of referring to some Act of 1863, he set out definitely the areas from which the member could be chosen.  Similarly, in Section 33, if he set out the old section in full, it would be more satisfactory.  He might have set out those old sections, so that one could gather, by reading the Bill, what was meant to be conveyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I read the Bill, and listening to the Minister's explanation.  I take it that it deals almost entirely with the preservation of salmon and of privately-owned fisheries.  Deputy Corish, when the Minister was speaking, asked how those who owned the fisheries came to acquire their rights in the first instance. The Minister replied that that was an old story and was ancient history. I do not suppose it would serve any useful purpose in going into it. It should be noted, in any case, that in the case of land owners who acquired their land, much in the same way, I suppose, as the fishery people acquired their fishery rights, they were bought out in the public interests.  A somewhat opposite principle seems to be adopted here, inasmuch as it appears we are endowing the owners of those salmon fisheries in order to preserve the fisheries in their own interests, very largely.  Nothing is said, and no definite provision is made, for the preservation of the public fisheries, the free fisheries of the country.  There is no doubt that the free fisheries are, in <Col N="384" /> a great many instances, a great source &mdash;probably the greatest source&mdash;of attraction to the ordinary tourist or angler, the man who comes to fish for brown trout.  As regards the type of person who can afford to come here and pay, not only rod licence duties, but heavy rentals in order to indulge in salmon fishing, the number is very small.  The greater number of anglers by far come to fish for brown trout in what are public and free fisheries, such as can be found in the lakes of Westmeath, Lough Corrib, Lough Conn, Lough Mask and other places.</P>
    <P>It is stated, and it is asserted very strongly by those who are in a position to know, that the boards of conservators in the past have done practically nothing for the preservation of these free trout fisheries.</P>
    <P>They have confined their attention entirely to the preservation of the salmon fisheries, their own privately-owned fisheries, and this has led in some instances at least to the formation of voluntary associations of fishermen and of anglers interested in the sport, and the conservation of the fisheries.  These associations have been recognised to the extent of giving them grants from the Fishery Department, but I am afraid they have not got very much to say on the question of the preservation of the fisheries.  I do not know what representations the Minister has had from them, or whether he has had any from them with regard to this Bill, or whether they have been given any opportunity of making a representation to the Advisory Committee which he has set up in connection with the Fishery Department.  I think it is essential that these associations, where they do exist, should have an opportunity of making their views known to the Ministry.</P>
    <P>As I said a moment ago, I do not see that there is anything being done by this Bill to help to preserve the free fisheries, unless it is that the Minister has power to force the Boards of Conservators set up in the particular districts to look after, not only the privately-owned fisheries but the fisheries of the whole district.  Of course it is doubtful whether he will be successful even if he has power to do <Col N="385" /> that, because it must be remembered that the people who are eligible for election to these Boards, as I understand it in any case, are only people who own the fisheries.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong.</P>

      <P>It is clear from the system of voting and the ex-officio members, that the owners of the fisheries will control the Boards of Conservators, whether others are eligible for election or not.  With regard to the source of revenue, this is derived from the licence duty and it is proposed to increase this licence duty.  As I understand the figures, it appears to me that these increases deserve closer examination. The increase, for instance, on fixed engines or weirs, or rather the rates paid by these, do not seem at all proportionate to the licence which is charged on a rod.  I think there will be considerable doubt, in spite of what the Minister has said, as to the advisability of diverting from the local authorities the rate which is at present derived from these private fisheries.  I think, too,&mdash;but it will be a matter for those who are interested in local authorities to say&mdash;that they will undoubtedly ask what they are going to get in return for this, if anything.  The Minister says it is negligible, but still is pretty considerable from the figures he gave.</P>

      <P>There are many points in connection with this which are matters more to be discussed in Committee than on Second Reading and which I do not propose to refer to at the moment.  I think there will be general objection taken to Section 8, in which the scale of votes is set out.  I think, too, that there will be general objection to the system which has been in practice for many years of proxy votes.  As I say, these are matters which will be more properly discussed in Committee.  I would like to know, however at this stage, what is the Minister's intention with regard to the voluntary associations, whether he proposes to give them any representation on these boards or any right to elect members to the boards of conservators, or whether he proposes to encourage the formation of such voluntary associations and to give them grants as I understand has been the practice heretofore to some extent.  On that I would say, personally, that I believe that such voluntary associations are of the greatest possible benefit in their respective districts in helping to preserve especially the free fisheries.  There is just one other small point.  I think that much more importance than it seems to get in this Bill should be given to the preservation of trout fishing.  It is doubtful if it would not be well that special measures, possibly a special Bill, should be introduced to deal with that very important aspect of our inland fisheries.</P>

      <P>I have, in the first instance, to congratulate the Minister on his opening speech in Irish.  I think it very appropriate that on a question such as this, which is so largely connected with the Irish language, the Minister should introduce a Bill dealing with the fishery laws, in the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Connell has stated, this Bill, on the whole, is satisfactory, but there are some points in connection with it which want to be largely improved in Committee.  I, in common with a number of other Deputies, am strongly opposed to the property qualification for voters who elect the boards of conservators.  In the past, the people of this country felt that these fishery laws were passed in the interests of one particular class, regardless of the interests of the community as a whole. I deplore as much as anyone the amount of poaching that takes place in the winter season, because I realise that these fresh water fisheries, if properly protected, would be a great asset to the nation.  I think, however, that a good deal of the poaching, or some of it at least, is due to the fact that these boards of conservators have not the general support of the people.  I think it would help to a great extent the preservation of fish if those boards were elected on a broader franchise.  There was one question which caused a good deal of uneasiness in County Galway, especially in Lough Corrib district.  On reading this Bill in the beginning and looking over the part dealing with the <Col N="388" /> rating question, where the rates were collected from the owners of privately-owned fisheries, a number of the people were under the impression that money so collected, would not go to the preservation of free fisheries, such as Lough Corrib and Lough Mask, and also Lough Conn in County Mayo.  The money, of course, will be common porperty for the preservation of fishing in all areas, and it would be well if the Minister would make that plain when he replies to whatever criticism may be raised on the Second Stage of the Bill.  As I stated already, the Bill, with certain amendments, can be made acceptable, and some of us at least propose to put down amendments for discussion in Committee, and we hope that the Minister will be able to accept them.  We hope that he will at least accept an amendment abolishing the property qualifications for the election of boards of conservators and that he will get away from those good old days, or, as we might call them, those bad old days, when legislation was introduced in support of one particular class.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major BRYAN COOPER Major BRYAN COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a member of a board of conservators for nearly twenty years, and if Deputy O'Maille does not succeed in abolishing me in Committee I shall be abolished under the Bill for six months' non-attendance, so that I can deal with this subject impartially.  There are one or two points raised in discussion with which I should like to deal.  This is a useful and valuable Bill.  Like Deputy O'Connell, I should have welcomed a complete codification of the fishery laws, but I wonder how long we shall have to wait to get it.  Failing that, some of the provisions are so valuable I welcome them as an instalment. Deputy Corish asked the Minister, and Deputy O'Connell endorsed his query, as to how some of the existing fishery rights were acquired.  I can only speak for the one with which I am connected and for the rights which I own.  An ancestor of mine found himself in possession of a river the mouth of which was closed by a waterfall of considerable height, so that no salmon could get up.  In 1837, I think, he went to the expense of obtaining an <Col N="389" /> Act of Parliament allowing him to construct a salmon ladder at the mouth of that river.  He constructed a salmon ladder at considerable cost, so that a fishery was created where none previously existed.  The salmon then went up to spawn, and have been doing so to the present day.  I admit that there was a very fair dividend on that expenditure, and in the ninety odd years since then we have had a fair dividend, but there has also been a fair amount of expenditure.  Fisheries are not worked for nothing and there is considerable outlay.  In the past, but not in recent times, there was considerable outlay on experiments of various kinds. My grandfather established a hatchery. He brought over the ovæ of Rhine salmon and hatched out Rhine salmon. They did well in the river but were not satisfactory from a sporting point of view, as they could not be got to rise to a fly.  There are certain vested interests as a result of developments and expenditure in the past, and if you are going to try and check developments and expenditure in fisheries you should also try to check development and expenditure in other industries.  In another fishery in which I have no financial interest the rights were bought by a Liverpool firm just in the same way as a British capitalist might buy Pierce's business in Wexford tomorrow, and if you talk about rights, legally held and legally exercised, you will be creating a situation which will be hostile and inimical to the development of industry of any kind.  So it does not do to speak too lightly or too easily the commonplaces of the platform, but in the Dáil we should be spared references as to how property was acquired.  Sometimes it was acquired by purchase and sometimes by development, and there may be cases where it was acquired wrongly and unjustly, but the danger of dealing with those cases and disturbing the sense of established possession is so great I think we would be wise to leave it alone.  This Bill is not perfect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like those Deputies who have spoken, I think amendments will be moved in Committee, and possibly as a result of discussions at that stage the Bill will be improved.  It has valuable <Col N="390" /> features.  I welcome the increased taxation on drift nets.  Before the war a situation had arisen in which there was almost a wall of drift nets off the north-west coast of Ireland.  These nets were supplied to fishermen by English and Scottish firms, who put the fishermen under a contract to sell the salmon they caught at twopence a lb., whereas the firms sold it at 2/- a lb.  The profit, therefore, that came to Ireland was very small, and the harm done to Irish fisheries was very great indeed.  The long drift net can pay the rate stated in the Bill, and possibly even a higher rate.  Part 3 of the Bill is very valuable, and I do not think that exception was taken, either by Deputy O'Connell or Deputy O'Maille, as regards the registration of dealers, but the danger is that poached fish may go to dealers over whom we have no control, dealers outside the Saorstát, as the bulk of the salmon trade is done outside the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>The danger of this is being met by Section 22, in Part IV., but I am not sure that the section is strong enough. The section says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every person who shall carry for reward... any package containing salmon or trout which is not marked in the manner required by this section shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does that apply to the railway and steam shipping companies, because if it does not, it ought to.  There is no use going to the stationmaster or the booking-clerk, as he will not be doing this for personal reward but in conformity with his duty as an officer of the company. Unless the steam shipping and railway companies are liable under that section, it is of no value at all. Therefore, I would ask the Minister to look into this before the Committee Stage, because, as I have said, the stationmaster or the clerk is not doing it for reward.  On the other hand, companies may be persons in a legal sense but they are not persons in a general or individual sense.  I am in agreement with Deputy O'Connell on one strong point he made.  He complained that the attention of the boards of conservators had mainly been given to the protection of salmon.  That is true to a <Col N="391" /> certain extent, though not entirely true.  It is due to the fact that the boards derive practically the whole of their revenue from salmon fishing. Trout fisheries are not rated.  There are no licences for rods to catch trout, and it is not unnatural that they should give the bulk of their attention to the preservation of salmon.  I am entirely in agreement with the view of the Deputy that a system of help should be given to the various local protection associations which have arisen for protecting trout fishing.  These associations have done valuable and useful work, with only voluntary subscriptions to support them.</P>
    <P>When a vacancy occurred lately on the board of conservators to which I belong, I used such influence as I  to get a person connected with a local association made a conservator, and he was made a conservator. In general, I think, local preservation associations are working in conjunction and in harmony with the boards of conservators, but I should like them to be put in a position to do more.  At present they are dependent solely on the revenue they can raise by subscription but they have no power to levy a rate or licence duty of any kind.  The conservators get their revenue from salmon.  The total means at the disposal of the boards is very small, and they are not in a position to help to any great extent.  I am inclined to ask the Minister whether it would not be possible to issue a small licence for trout fishing, at any rate so far as persons not resident in the district are concerned.  At present it is possible for a fisherman to come from Manchester, stay a fortnight in a district, fish every day, have good sport, and do nothing for the preservation of the fish whatever.  Many of these visitors contribute voluntarily, and many do not.  The money they spend is spent on hotels and places of that kind, and the hotels contribute nothing except voluntarily.  I do not think the man who comes from Manchester or Dublin to the west of Ireland would begrudge paying 5/- or 2/6 for trout fishing, while the funds levied in that way would be valuable I have no doubt <Col N="392" /> there would be no trouble in getting the boards of conservators to place these funds at the disposal of the local associations.  That is bound up with the greatest problem of the lot.  The real problem that anyone who wishes to encourage fishing in Ireland, to make sport possible and to get the support of the majority of the people, is faced with is that you must raise enough funds without making sport too expensive for people living in the locality. I have all my life given facilities for trout fishing free.  Recently I have been able to place one day a week free for salmon fishing at the disposal of the local anglers association.  Many of these people who joined the anglers association, and wished to fish locally, would find a difficulty in paying the £2 licence the Minister has imposed.  What we want to do, and it is not by any means easy, is to make sport cheap for the person who lives in the district, and wants to have an occasional day at it, and at the same time to see that the visitor from a distance pays a fair but not unreasonable proportion for the preservation of the fish which gives him sport.  That problem is partially solved in the Bill, and I think if we approach this question without too many prepossessions and do not give way to catchwords in our desire for the preservation of the fish, and to improve the sport of the fishermen, we shall in Committee make the Bill better than it is now.</P>

      <P>I agree with other Deputies that the Minister has made out a very good case for the Bill. To any person acquainted with this subject there is no question of the importance of this measure.  Deputy O'Connell referred to some objectionable features, and these can be dealt with in Committee.  I am glad he rejected the doctrine of ransom which Deputy Corish has endeavoured to force upon him.  Deputy Major Cooper, so far as that is concerned, has given proof that his own fisheries at least were free from that taint, but I am astonished at one of the objections made by such a well-informed man as Deputy Cooper.  He objected to the drift nets, and welcomed the additional restrictions placed upon them. <Col N="393" /> My information regarding this drift net fishing in the north-west of Ireland is fairly intimate, and I entirely disagree with the conclusions of the Deputy on this matter.  In fact, the one blot in the Bill, so far as I have followed it from the Minister's exposition, is the putting of restrictions on the drift net sea fishing, and increasing the licence duty.  Previously the cost of the licence to these men was £3 per year.  Under this Bill for fishing with the Seine net of say 1,500 yards, the licence is doubled.  On what grounds are these men licenced at all?  They are not fishing within territorial waters; they are fishing on the high seas.  We have no more right to control their fishing there than we have to control the English, the Scotch or the European fishermen who occasionally do so.  If the Minister took power to prevent these north-west fishermen from fishing for salmon, he could not prevent those from England, Scotland and the Continent from taking these salmon, in connection with which these men are to be penalised in the Bill.  There is another side of this question.  The main purpose of this Bill, I gathered from the Minister's exposition, is to preserve the inland fisheries.  Anything that tends to lessen that preservation is a matter that should be attended by the Minister. How does fishing ten miles from the mouth of a river affect the amount of salmon put into the river?  We have it indeed on scientific authority that the damage done to salmon in the high seas by a single boat corresponds to the damage done by a single rod fisherman on a salmon river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If these men were making a livelihood from this fishing one could understand that they might be asked to pay for the preservation of the inland fisheries.  But what are the real facts? Salmon fishing takes place for twentyone days practically in every year, from the middle of June, or thereabouts.  The men are allowed to fish for five days in the week between sunset and sunrise. They fish ten miles from the mouth of the nearest river.  They are exposed to the peril of the passing tramp steamers which frequently destroy their nets. The cost of the equipment of the boat <Col N="394" /> is very considerable to these poor people.  A boat that you could buy for £20 to £25 some years ago costs something like £60 at present.  Nets which were easily purchaseable for £40 some years ago now cost £90&mdash;that is, the nets that were used, because they use longer nets now.  For all this peril and adventure, in risking their money and equipment, during many seasons up to last year, these men did not make sufficient out of the salmon fishing to pay for more than their licences.  The average given to me for five years for the best fishing district in the north-west, Gola Island, was £40 a boat, or £10 a man, and when the labour they gave, and the danger to which they have been exposed, are taken into account, that is very poor pay.  But the great feature of this salmon fishing is this, that while for the last ten years, as the Minister so well knows, the occasional fishing, herrings, lobster, or other seasonal fishing which takes place on that coast and furnishes the bulk of the incomes of these people, was so bad that the fishermen could not make a living from it; the three weeks' salmon fishing was able to make the difference in their incomes between downright poverty and comparative comfort.  Last year was probably the best of the past ten years for salmon fishing on the west coast, and I am in a position to say this from my own knowledge, that had the salmon fishing not been so successful last year we would have had to supply these men all round that coast with public money to keep them alive.  It is these men that you ask to pay double the licence.  If it were a question of protecting the inland fisheries I might be inclined to support it, but there is no interference with the inland fisheries. It is true that a net licence of some kind is necessary.  My proposal is &mdash;and I will put it up in Committee&mdash; that a flat rate of £1 or £2 be charged for all salmon nets fishing as these men do.</P>
    <P>If a very large revenue were derived from this tax&mdash;I am talking of the north-west; the conditions are different in other parts&mdash;that would be of assistance to the Minister in the arrangements&mdash;the excellent arrangements, I <Col N="395" /> must say, that he is making, although I shall have something to say on the finance clause in Committee&mdash;I would not raise any objection to the schedule at all, but I find that the average amount derived from these people does not exceed £700 a year.  Yet for this sum, which to these men means the difference between penury and comfort, the Minister is doubling the tax and is depriving them of some of their income.  I question whether in most of these districts where the fishermen are financed in the manner Deputy Cooper described&mdash;their nets supplied by English and Scotch fish salesmen&mdash;whether these men would be able to fish at all if the licence is increased in this manner.  But to the larger number of fishermen in Gola, Tory, and the islands along that coast who own their own boats and gear this will be a greater hardship.  In my opinion it will be an unfair tax, and I must oppose it.</P>
    <P>The importance of this Bill, I think, is realised.  The destruction of salmon and inland fish of all kinds was appalling during the last few years.  We know, and the Minister has made reference to it, that the value of these inland fisheries at present, about two million or two and a half million pounds, may easily be raised with these precautions to bring in a revenue of five or six million pounds, or treble the present revenue.  As a matter of fact, I think that the Minister has been very modest in his estimate.  Lord Dunraven, who published a letter on this matter, calculates that a revenue of at least ten million pounds could easily be obtained from this source.  If you take ten million pounds as the sum we might derive from these inland fisheries with increased protection, and if you develop the potential value of the deep sea fisheries, you will have established for the Saorstát a revenue only second perhaps to that of the great agricultural industry on which it now depends. Inland and deep sea fisheries, which are at present in a state of chaos, would yield an immediate income which would transform the whole face of this country.  I hope that before the Committee Stage the Minister will be so good as to look into the <Col N="396" /> question I have raised regarding the net fishing, and if he can see his way to do so that he will strike out the line in the First Schedule charging for a licence at the rate of £4 for the first 400 yards of net and 5/- for every additional two hundred yards, and that he will substitute a flat rate of £2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>The question which I asked during the Minister's speech seemed to give some people an idea that I had something revolutionary in my mind.  I want to assure the House that there is nothing of the kind.  I asked how did some of these people under discussion acquire their private rights, and Deputy Cooper made an attempt to answer.  The case put forward by Deputy Cooper is an entirely different one from that which I have in my mind.  My interpretation of the case he put forward is the control of what might be considered to be a tributary of a river, or something that was almost a lake.  That is entirely different from what I have in mind.  The case I have in mind at the moment is the river Slaney, which derives its source from somewhere in the Wicklow Mountains, flows through the whole County Wexford, and empties itself into Wexford Bay.  Practically half of the river is controlled and is owned by certain people in Co. Wexford.  The Minister says that that is a right.  I say that it is an alleged right, because I do not think that any private person should control our rivers.  These people acquired certain rights at certain periods&mdash;I have asked for information as to how they did so&mdash;while the people on the banks of this river have to stand idly by in view of this control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are not permitted to use a rod, or net, or anything else to take fish out of the river which is immediately adjacent to their land.  I consider that this is not a proper thing.  I believe that what these people consider to be their rights are not their rights; that is, the confiscation which took place in the times when we had not a Government of our own, and I think the Minister and his Government will agree that it is not right and that he will confess that he believes deep down in his heart that it is not right.  In bringing in this Bill, he is perpetuating these alleged <Col N="397" /> rights, because I do not consider them rights.  Having said that, I want to congratulate the Minister upon bringing in this Bill, because many of its clauses were certainly wanted for the preservation of the fisheries.  In the first place, it is desirable, as he has said, and I agree that it is necessary, to place the different boards of conservators in a position to employ proper bailiffs.  The amount of money that up to this has been at the disposal of the different boards of conservators, functioning all over the country, has not been sufficient to enable them to procure the right kind of man, and in many cases I have heard it said that the wages of some of the people employed as bailiffs were so small that they themselves spend some of their time poaching.  That is because the boards have not been able to get the proper sort of man and to pay for him. I think it can be proved that in many parts of the country the bailiffs engage in poaching.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Doherty, I want to say that I disagree altogether with the increase upon nets.  If you increase the licence upon nets you will strike a blow at the poor man.  The man that uses these nets uses them for only half the year, and he is trying to get sufficient money in that portion of the year to enable him to live for the twelve months.  I think, therefore, it is inadvisable to increase the licence on him. If there is to be an increase at all, it ought to be an increase on the licences of those who use the rivers for sport. The man who uses a net does so to obtain a livelihood for himself and his family, and I do not think it is desirable that it should be increased.</P>
    <P>With regard to the election of conservators, I am sorry to say that the Minister has not brought forward something to do away with the proxy vote.  Under the state of affairs that prevailed up to this and that is still going to continue under this Bill, people who control certain parts of the river issue a licence to people coming across from London, or Manchester, or Liverpool and from other cities across the Channel, and when the election of the conservators comes along these people are able to appoint proxies here <Col N="398" /> and to secure a majority on the boards of conservators in the different parts of the country, to the detriment of people who are dependent upon the fisheries for their livelihood; and the result is that the ordinary net fisherman is not able to secure more than one-third representation on the board and the rivers are worked in such a way as not to be in his interest.  I think, if we develop the fisheries and if we develop them in the interests of the people who are making their livelihood out of these fisheries, it will be more desirable than to develop them in the interests of people who come merely for sport.</P>
    <P>I resent also that portion of the Bill which enables people to become members of the boards as <i>ex officio</i> members. I do not think that is a desirable state of affairs.  I do not think there is anything else I need say on the matter. I intend to move some amendments, especially in connection with the proxy voters, and with regard to the supposed rights upon the river.  I think the time has arrived when this Government should free the waters from landlordism, in the same way as it freed the land from landlordism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamSears" hpid="Mr. SEARS Mr. SEARS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a word about the free fisheries of Lough Mask and Lough Corrib, which are in the very happy position that they are not troubled either by landlords or river-lords or lakelords.  They are free fisheries.  Every man can go down to Lough Mask and fish in it, whether he is from Mayo, Galway, or any other part of the world.  I would be glad to see a great many other lakes in that happy position.  But there are drawbacks to Lough Mask.  Though the salmon come to Lough Corrib they do not come to Lough Mask.  Lough Corrib and Lough Mask are joined together under one board of fishery conservators, and the present income derived by that board is mainly derived from the salmon fishery in Lough Corrib. Consequently the people living around Lough Mask are rather uneasy as to how they will be looked after by men whose income is entirely derived from salmon, seeing that there is no salmon fishing in Lough Mask.  That being the case I would like to get an assurance <Col N="399" /> from the Minister that Lough Mask would be protected.  It is one of the most valuable brown trout fishing places in Ireland, if not anywhere else. It is subject to a great deal of illegal fishing.  The little rivers that empty themselves into the lake are watched throughout the three months of the winter by men who injure the fish to a great extent by illegal fishing, and do a great deal of damage.  In any case there is netting going on, and this netting is illegal.  Eels are also illegally taken.  It is absolutely necessary to have some protection.  I would like to get an assurance from the Minister that he will make provision, and as to how he is going to make provision in this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooper spoke of brown trout fishing, and said that men came from England to places like Lough Mask and Lough Corrib and fished, and that these should pay a licence.  How are you to distinguish between the man coming from Dublin or Galway or Westmeath and the man coming from England?  I think there will be a great deal of difficulty in asking these men to pay a licence.  If you do ask these men to take out a licence, the alternative is to ask every man who fishes for trout to take out a licence.  I think the Minister for Fisheries would find that that would not work in Lough Mask. He would need the services of all the Gárda Síochána to collect these licences.  So I think he will have to drop the suggestion of a licence for these.  He will, under the new arrangement suggested in this Bill, have ample means of protection.  There was a voluntary association of anglers on Lough Mask up to about twenty years ago.  They collected money to pay for a bailiff.  They saw that two or three bailiffs would give adequate protection to the lake.  This little association fell away about twenty years ago and is not in existence.  I suggest that it could easily be revived.  I do not see where the income would come from, and I suggest that an association of that kind, which would appoint bailiffs and look after them as fishery conservators would do, if it got a little assistance from the Minister, could easily give adequate protection to the lake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> I must say that the Bill is welcomed by everyone interested in the inland fisheries.  There is a great possibility of making inland fisheries in Ireland something like they are in other countries.  I think this is a foundation on which the industry can be built up. They must first be protected.  I sympathise with what Deputy O'Connell said about those who are fishery owners. Even if they got the rights like Deputy Cooper's ancestors got them, still a large number of them got the rights in very doubtful ways, and I think the people will never be satisfied until they are bought out.  A lot of the grievance against them is compensated for by the fact that a number of these old owners did a great deal to protect the fisheries. They established hatcheries.  As a general rule that work was not done well by them.  If you compare the work done by owners of rivers in Scotland with that done in Ireland, you will see that the work done in Ireland is poor and inadequate.  I think the Minister should consider the advisability of buying out those people altogether. The people will never be satisfied with the present system.  The rights ought to be bought out and given over to the State or the county councils. The State could have representation on the fishery boards in proportion to the rights they bought out.  I welcome the Bill, and think it will do a great deal for the inland fisheries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Cooper in regretting that Deputy Corish has thought fit to raise the question as to how the fishing rights were acquired by several of the existing owners.  That is a question, as we all know, that was raised with disastrous results in connection with land, and I sincerely hoped, for the good of the country, that we had heard the end of it.  I am sorry it has been raised here again to-day.  Deputy Corish also complained that the fishery rights along many of those rivers were not given to the persons holding the land immediately adjoining that portion of the river.  I am not sure whether Deputy Corish was a member of the last Dáil or not, but in the last Dáil a Bill was passed, known as the Land Bill.  Under <Col N="401" /> that Bill power was taken to purchase a number of large holdings and to divide up these holdings amongst a number of smaller owners.  When purchasing a number of those holdings they purchased with them the fishing rights.  The principle that was adopted in the Dáil, of which, I take it, Deputy Corish and others approve, was that the fishing rights of that property were in the future to be vested in the State, and the State was to rent or deal otherwise, as it thought best, with those rights.  Those rights were not given under that Bill&mdash;in fact, they were refused under that Bill&mdash;to the different owners adjoining.  If that principle were approved by the last Dáil, it is hardly fair to be raising the question again now with regard to the rights of those owners, because, to anyone who has inquired even in a most casual way into the subject, it is quite obvious that no other arrangement could have been made.  Some of those small owners would possibly have a right of less than one hundred yards along a river on one bank and another small holder would acquire the corresponding rights on the other bank, and the rights would be distributed up amongst so many small holders that they would be really no use to anyone. Even looking casually into the question, it is quite impossible to support any idea of that particular kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Maille has referred to the question of the qualifications of voters for the conservators.  As I understand the Bill, votes are limited to those who have an interest in fishing&mdash;that is, to those who make some payment.  I do not know whether I am correct in that, but that is so as I read the Bill.  There seems to be an objection to that principle. In other words, I take it that what is advocated is that the many who have no interest at all in fishing, and who possibly know nothing at all about it, are to be brought in to vote for conservators in whom they have practically no interest.  Even a casual enquiry would have made clear that practically any other than the present franchise would have been exceedingly unwise. The voting for those conservators is confined to those who pay something and have some interest in the industry, <Col N="402" /> and the maximum number of votes, apparently, under the Bill that can be possessed by any one voter is, I think, four.  Quite irrespective of what the payment is, and in some cases it is a fairly large one, the maximum number of votes any such payee can have is four.  I think the interests of what we might call the smallholder have been more than carefully watched in the Bill under consideration.</P>
    <P>While the Minister, in his opening statement, was most lucid as to the different provisions of the Bill, yet there were some aspects that I was anxious he should have touched on. The Bill, as I read it, practically deals with what we might call inland fisheries. I was hopeful that we might have had from the Minister a comprehensive Bill dealing with the whole of this complex question as included in some twenty different Acts of Parliament, as he explained to us.  I hoped we would have had one Bill dealing with the whole of this large question.</P>
    <P>Apparently, it is to be dealt with in sections.  In this particular section we only deal with inland fisheries.  How far it is intended to include in this Bill jurisdiction regarding coast fishing is not made clear.  In connection with salmon along our coasts, there is a great deal of damage done.  I do not know whether salmon fishing along the coast is sufficiently protected by the existing Acts.  It is, I think, a matter that calls for revision.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter on which I would like to offer a few observations&mdash;that is the charges to be made.  I notice in the schedule that the charges for salmon fishing are £2 per rod.  Though it does not say so specifically in the schedule, I gather that that is not a general licence but is confined to one particular river.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a general licence. Where a person goes outside the district in which he gets the licence, he has to pay 10/- additional, under the provisions of this Bill.  Up to the present, if a person came from England to Dublin for fishing, he paid £1 in Dublin and went down, perhaps, to Connemara. He need not necessarily have <Col N="403" /> contributed anything in the district in which he actually fished.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I presume, means that he did not contribute anything directly.  Of course, he contributed indirectly.  The Minister has informed us that the Free State is divided into 21 areas, and I take it that this payment of £2 would simply cover the fishing on one area.  If the person fishing went into another area, it would mean the payment of an additional 10/-, I presume.  That may or may not be desirable.  It is a matter that will have to be considered.  But it is well to bear in mind that, as the Minister has pointed out, a great many visitors come for the fishing, particularly to the West of Ireland.  A number of them stay for no more than a few weeks.  That would be, I think, the average duration of a visit.  It seems hardly fair that a person coming for that period, or for a shorter period &mdash;as many of them do&mdash;should be called upon to pay a sum of £2.  I take it that the licence is issued quite irrespective of the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I read that clause, but I did not quite understand it.  If the applicant for a licence has to submit his application to the authority, then there may not be an opportunity for so doing while the visitor is here.  It does not seem to be an operative clause.  It does not state that, for a period of 14 days, a licence will be issued for the smaller amount without any other formalities.  The provision in that clause is conditional.  In view of the number of visitors who come here for fishing, it would be desirable that we <Col N="404" /> should make the procedure as simple as possible and that licences should be as easily obtainable as possible.</P>
      <P>While it is desirable to get a considerable revenue from these rivers, the Minister should bear in mind that, as he increases the charge for net or rod fishing, he increases the desire to poach. People will try to avoid paying the tax.  I would ask him to consider the question whether it would not be desirable, instead of getting a large payment from a small number, to try and get a small payment from a large number. If that course were adopted, I think the desire to poach would be considerably reduced, if not entirely done away with.  Where fishing is indulged in by what one might call the poorer classes, it is undesirable to make the licensing fee too high and deprive them of what they and their families may have found a source of enjoyment for many years.</P>
      <P>Now that the Minister has introduced a Bill dealing with inland fisheries, I hope that we will not have to wait for the same period for a Bill dealing with the sea fisheries.  I hold that there is a great deal that could be done for the sea fisheries that is not done.  I do not know if the Minister will agree with me&mdash;though I know a little about sea fisheries&mdash;that there is just as much room for development in connection with our sea fisheries as there is in connection with our inland fisheries.  I hope we shall have some measure from him in the near future dealing with this important section of his work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can, I think, congratulate himself upon the satisfactory reception which this Bill has got.  On the whole, it is a very conservative Bill and does not attempt anything very remarkable.  The question of fishery rights was raised by Deputy Corish.  Deputies Cooper and Good defended existing rights.  It is, nevertheless, true, as Deputy Corish stated, that these existing rights are very nebulous in character.  On the other hand, I admit that to hand over these rights to the ordinary riparian owners would be very disastrous to the fisheries of the country.  The right principle, as Deputy Good pointed out, was adopted in the Land Bill, in which <Col N="405" /> fishery rights were retained to the Government.  I hope that in the future that course will be continued and that the Government will obtain more fishery rights in other parts of the country.  On the other hand, I hope that fishers will combine in associations in order to rent those fisheries from the Government each year.  I think that is the only solution, because, in most cases, the rivers are in the nature of being an organised whole and have to be treated as a whole, and it would be disastrous if they were split up amongst a large number of riparian owners.  I doubt if the Minister fully realises or fully understands the effect of his Bill upon boards of conservators. Under Section 7 of the Bill, it is proposed to increase, very considerably, the number of these conservators by reducing the valuation of their fisheries from £100 to £50.  While their number is increased under Section 7, it is more than probable that the Minister will remove them from office in a greater number of cases under Section 10.  I do not exactly know what the effect will be on the personnel of the Boards.  It is more than probable that a very large number of these owners, men like Deputy Cooper, will be expelled for non-attendance.  It is difficult to see exactly what effect the Bill will have upon the Boards as at present constituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Doherty deprecated any increase in the licence duty.  I am afraid it is inevitable that that increase should take place.  The number of people involved in keeping the boards of conservators in being is not very large, and consequently their contributions have to be proportionately so. Deputy O'Connell rather objected to the fact that the existing boards, and the Ministry in general, have done very little for trout fisheries.  I am afraid that is the fault of the trout fishers themselves.  Deputy O'Connell referred to these voluntary associations which have been formed, but they have refused, and have expressed their refusal, to participate in paying their share of the expenses of the boards of conservators.  When this Bill was in the air, these associations began to pass resolutions protesting against the idea <Col N="406" /> of a tax on trout rods.  Deputy Sears suggested that the Minister would never dare to try to impose such a tax, and stated that it would be impossible to collect it.  I disagree.  I think it will be comparatively easy to collect it. There are other taxes which are equally difficult to collect.  There is, for instance, the dog tax, and there are regulations, such as the one to have a light on a bicycle at night, which are equally difficult to enforce.  I certainly think that the Minister, if he wished to be Napoleonic, and it is not easy to be Napoleonic in matters affecting inland fisheries, might have inflicted a tax ruthlessly on these trout fishers and so relieve the burden on the unfortunate salmon fishers who have to bear all the cost of preserving the fisheries. There are various matters in the Bill which can be corrected on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>With regard to Part IV. of the Bill, I wonder if the Minister can give us any information as to the present position with regard to the export of salmon during the close season.  There is an Act, I think, of 1869&mdash;it is not the main Act of that year, but a small Act &mdash;which prohibited the export overseas of salmon caught in the United Kingdom during the close season.  It was stated specifically in that Act, I think, that Ireland or England were not to be considered as being overseas in the relation of one to the other.  I do not know what effect the Adaptation of Enactments Act had on that provision, but I imagine that at present there is no provision prohibiting the export of salmon overseas during the close season.  With regard to Section 33, the Minister explained that the prohibition with regard to holding lights and engines of various kinds on the banks of a river extended to the daytime.  I believe that one of the engines mentioned is a gaff.  Consequently, I imagine it is definitely illegal to carry a gaff on the bank of a river.  How, then, is the ordinary salmon fisher to collect his fish once he has hooked it, if it is illegal to have a gaff?  I certainly do not know.  I do not think there is any provision in the Act of 1842 allowing an angler to carry a gaff, but I am not clear on the point.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister fully explained to the House the meaning of Section 35.  It refers to one-third of the fine as going to the informer, the man who gives evidence at the prosecution.  I am not clear as to the second half of the section, and I hope the Minister will explain it.  With regard to the general purpose of the Bill, I think the debate has shown that it has met with the general approval of the House, and I trust that the results from it will become manifest in a year or two in the improvement of our inland fisheries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess, at the start, that I am more interested in this Bill from the point of view of the people who fish for a living than of those who fish for sport.  In that connection, I agree to a great extent with what was said by Deputy Corish, that we ought to have more water free for fishing than there is at the moment.  I was glad to observe that Deputy Good had become a convert to the State-ownership of the fishing rights of the country.  Most of the points that I had intended to deal with have already been brought to the notice of the Minister, but there are just a few matters on which I wish to say something.  One is in connection with the increased licence duty on drift nets.  This, of course, will affect those who endeavour to make a living out of the fishing industry.  Some ten years ago the cost of a drift net, 230 yards long, was between £6 and £10.  What is the price of one to-day? It is easily double&mdash;at least £20.  The price of salmon, at that time, was much the same as it is to-day.  Possibly the Minister will tell us about it when he comes to reply, but, as I am informed, the cost of salmon has not increased appreciably and in the same ratio as the cost of the nets.  You are putting this increased tax now on people who have to pay it out of that work.  They are in the main scarcely able to scrape <Col N="408" /> enough money to provide them with drift nets, and the cost of providing themselves with nets has gone up, and there has been no proportionate increase in the price of the produce.  Yet you are raising these licence duties.</P>
      <P>If we had anything in the way of compensation for that, possibly we could be satisfied.  What does the Minister propose to do in connection with the destruction of fish, say, in such places as the Shannon?  At Foynes, and further up, we know that seals destroy a large amount of fish.  What protection does the Minister propose to afford to fishermen against this destruction? He states that there is a good deal of destruction done by poachers, and people dealing, illegally, in taking fish at wrong seasons, and that sort of thing.  But has he considered what destruction is done to the fish by seals in these areas?  And if he has considered it, what provision is there in this Bill, and what proportion of the increased revenue that is to be got from these increased licences is to be devoted to the protection of the fish that are being destroyed by seals?</P>
      <P>I am informed that the proper way to deal with seals is just as you would deal with every other thing that is destroying anything, and that is to shoot them.  But the Minister for Fisheries tells us that the proper way is to follow them into their haunts and club them.  But I am told that is impracticable. Practical fishermen tell me that cannot be carried out, and unless some means are given to fishermen to deal with the evil it will ultimately ruin them in their industry.  If the object is to put drift nets out of action, as Deputy Bryan Cooper seems to be anxious for, my information is that where there were ten drift nets working three or four years ago, there is only one now.  Of course, what I am particularly anxious about, and what I would like the Minister to deal with, is: What provision he is making to secure that the increased revenue will be used for the protection of fishermen where seals are destroying the fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Good, I should like to see a more comprehensive measure which would deal with sea fisheries as well.  While we are very anxious to, <Col N="409" /> and very capable of dealing with local poachers, it is very regrettable, indeed, that we do not seem to be as anxious to, or as capable of dealing with international poachers who are doing immense havoc to the fisheries of this country.  If this Bill focusses our attention on the fishery industry, both inland and sea, it will at least have done something.  I should like if the Minister could indicate, in some way or other, what he is going to do in regard to sea fisheries.  I think he might couple that with whatever statement he proposes to make in reply, and if he would do so he would at least ease the minds of those who are patiently awaiting for some time past legislation in that direction.</P>

      <P>I am bombarded by a lot of riparian owners, on the River Blackwater, to find out what their position will be when this Bill becomes law. Hitherto, they say, they paid rent for half the river and have no access thereto, except to see the salmon jumping or, perhaps, to see a gentleman landing one in the middle of their farm and taking it away with him.  There is also a big fishing weir in Lismore.  I believe it is a very difficult problem to solve, whether it would be wise to abolish it or whether it would be economical to abolish it.  All these farmers all along the line are asking me to push their claims forward and to say that they have the best right to the fishing along this particular River Blackwater. I am certain, if it is not too dear a business, that the Minister for Fisheries and the Government, especially the Department of Lands and Agriculture, will try to get vested in these farmers the fishery rights that apparently belong to them.  Having said so much, I will not be afraid to go home and tell those farmers that I have said something for them.</P>

      <P>One section of this Bill which interests the people living on the coast is that dealing with the intended increase in the licence of the drift nets.  I believe that the whole fishing population, especially the deep-sea fishing population, are unanimously against that.  They look on the attitude of the Minister in proposing the <Col N="410" /> imposition of an increased net licence as they would look upon the attitude of a philanthropic gentleman who came along, threw a penny into a blind man's hat, and then stole his dog.  The Minister should consider the fact that these people have to get a living with drift nets, and that they have to go out to sea, properly speaking, in waters not belonging to inland fisheries, or anybody else.  They fish in international waters, and why they should be penalised by a heavy penalty for the inland fisheries I do not know.  If I got a promise that this part of the Bill would be eliminated, I would certainly support the measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I will only deal with one or two points which I understand have not yet been raised.  Section 23 deals with the power of inspection.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Every member of the Dublin Metropolitan Police or the Gárda Síochána and every member of a board of conservators and every officer or servant of a board of conservators&rdquo; may do certain things:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To stop and search any person conveying or believed to be conveying fish of any kind or any instrument used or adapted for taking fish illegally and to inspect any fish and any such instrument which such person is found to be conveying and for that purpose to open and search any vehicle or package in which such fish or instrument is or may be or is believed to be conveyed;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At all reasonable times to enter upon and have free access to the interior of ... any ship, boat, railway waggon, motor lorry, cart, or other vessel or vehicle used for the conveyance of goods.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I want to make is that if you grant these powers to a member of the board of conservators you are putting him in the place of a policeman and granting him powers that he should not have.  It is the most likely thing imaginable that in any little local authority a person who considers himself to be an important person might exercise that authority in a way in which an experienced officer would have doubt and hesitancy about.  The Board of Conservators will be a locally elected body however they may be <Col N="411" /> elected.  The officers and police will have powers of search and inspection. That may be quite justifiable and easily understood, but to give a member of a local authority similar powers is going beyond reason.  One power, for instance, would be to appear before a Peace Commissioner, having detained in his custody fish likely to become unfit for human food, before the matter can be dealt with by a court, and if authorised to do so by the Peace Commissioner, to destroy such fish. This member of a board of conservators may be a little landlord in his way, perhaps an important person in the locality, and the Peace Commissioner may not be at all an important person, may know nothing about fish, and he will defer to the believed extraordinary knowledge that the conservator has of fish and will accept his word that the fish is likely to become unfit for human food.  Then the Peace Commissioner gives a certificate and that certificate, issued on the word of the conservator, is conclusive evidence in every court of all such matters of fact as may be stated in the certificate.  I think that is going beyond the bounds of reason.</P>
    <P>The kind of citizen who would become a conservator may be very useful for his office of looking after fishing in his locality, but he is not the kind of person that should be granted powers of search, so far as I can see, in any part of the country, because there is nothing to confine his activities to his own district.  He may go into any place with an appearance of authority and say that certain fish has been illegally taken.  He may hold it, or he may do anything at all about it.  He is not a bailiff or a policeman, and he has nothing to show he is acting as an officer of the law.  He is merely a member of a publicly-elected body.  It has come to a nice pass if we are to give the powers of policemen to members of town councils or county councils and the like.  I think that that section, at any rate, will have to be drastically amended.  I do not want to repeat any of the other arguments regarding the Bill, but I ask the Minister to consider carefully the proposition <Col N="412" /> that it is undesirable to give powers of this kind to conservators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>Nearly all the points that have been raised can be dealt with more effectively on the Committee Stage.  Just as much as Deputies O'Connell and Cooper, I regret that it was not possible for me to bring forward a Bill codifying all the existing laws.  When I approached the Attorney-General on the matter, he told me that it would take some years to prepare such a Bill, and his office is extremely busy at the moment with other Bills.  I thought it better to go on with this Bill in the meantime.  Deputies O'Connell, O'Maille and others found fault with the Bill in that it does not specifically mention the protection of the brown trout fisheries.  It is the duty of boards of conservators to protect all the fisheries in their districts. It is, of course, quite natural to expect that they will concentrate on the protection of the salmon fisheries, from which they derive the greater portion of their revenue.  When I suggested a small licence fee for brown trout rods. there was a howl of indignation from brown trout anglers in different parts of the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had several communications from the voluntary associations.  One particular association I think did agree, but the majority of them are against imposing a licence duty on the brown trout rods.  In the suggestions that I put before the Advisory Committee, which are mostly embodied in this Bill, I suggested such a tax, but the Committee decided that. it would be inadvisable, and I therefore omitted it from the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is entirely wrong to say that the money is devoted to the preservation merely of the privately-owned fisheries.  There are a great many salmon fisheries as well as trout fisheries which are free.  Once there is preservation of the stock it will affect the whole river, both the privately-owned portions and the free portion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell talked about <Col N="413" /> losses.  I will not go into that, except to point out that they can only occur in two districts, and even in these two districts the loss cannot amount to more than one penny in the pound.  As to the rates which Deputy O'Maille referred to, the revenue will be applied to the district as a whole.  Naturally, the more important portions of the fisheries will have first call on the funds, but the greater powers that we are taking for the central department over the boards will enable us to see that the trout fisheries will have a fair amount of funds set apart for their preservation.  Under the Bill, the boards will get more funds and, therefore, they will have more money at their disposal for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Doherty and others raised a question as to drift nets.  Where a drift net is 1,500 yards long, I think that there should be some provision for taxing that in connection with its catching area.  The drift net men to whom Deputy Hogan referred are restricted to 130 yard nets.  The Donegal men are allowed to have a net up to 1,500 yards and they avail of that privilege.  It is hardly fair to charge the same for a net of 130 yards as for a net of 1,500 yards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcFadden" hpid="Mr. McFADDEN Mr. McFADDEN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McFADDEN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>They may or may not. The persons that Deputies O'Doherty and McFadden referred to are not altogether such lambs as they led us to believe.  As a matter of fact, these drift nets can be used, and have been used, because of laxity in protection in the past, at the very mouths of the rivers where they block up all the salmon trying to get up the rivers.  The suggestion made as to the small trout licence has already been turned down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with a considerable amount of what Deputy Corish said with regard to the proxy vote.  By some of the provisions of the Bill the proxy vote will be considerably reduced.  That is a matter that can be dealt with on the Committee Stage.  I have already promised Deputies privately that I will let every clause of the Bill stand on its own feet.  So far as I am concerned, I am not going to have the Whips put <Col N="414" /> on at all.  If Deputies can put forward arguments in favour of any amendments which would convince a majority of the Dáil as against any arguments I put up to the contrary, be it so.  I am not going to ask for the Whips in this matter.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Good that Section 12 seems faulty in drafting.  I think it should be made obligatory, so that a single salmon rod licence for a period of fourteen days should be available for £1, and that all that will be necessary will be for an angler to walk into the clerk to the conservators, pay £1 and demand the licence.  I can do that on the Committee Stage if Deputy Good does not bring forward an amendment in the meantime.  There is a point in Deputy Good's remarks also that perhaps increased licence duty may involve an increase of illegal fishing. The increased duties are based on the decreased purchasing power of money.  After all, £1 in 1848 would certainly be worth more than £2 in 1925.</P>

      <P>I do not think so.  I do not think there is any legislation necessary for the development of sea fisheries.  That will come from another angle.  A question was raised by Deputy Hogan about the protection of sea fisheries.  I think the Deputy will have an opportunity of raising that on the Estimates the day after to-morrow more appropriately than on this Bill. Deputy Esmonde raised a point on Section 7.  I pointed out already in my opening statement that a number of <i>ex officio</i> members of boards have disappeared with the disappearance of the old J.P.'s The provision in Section 7 will not make up for their disappearance in numbers.  It actually makes eligible as <i>ex officio</i> members a further 35 persons.  Section 35 refers to the provisions of the Act of 1869 with regard to the distribution of fines.</P>

      <P>The Limerick Board of Conservators at present give £2 for every seal killed. Fishermen can, on application in the ordinary way for permits get rifles, and wherever we are requested to do so, we recommend to the Department of Justice that permits be granted.  I still hold to my opinion that shooting is not the best way to get rid of the seal pest. Experience has shown that the best way to do so is to get at them in the breeding grounds or in places where they bask.  Some years ago the Department of Agriculture engaged a Bisley marksman to go down and shoot seals in, I think, the estuary of the Suir. They kept him there for three months, and he expended about 1,000 rounds of ammunition.  When he came back he was honest enough to say that he was not sure if he had killed one seal.</P>

I think there is something in Deputy Johnson's point about the powers proposed to be given to conservators.  I believe the words &ldquo;every member of a board of conservators and every officer or servant of a board of conservators authorised in writing&rdquo; cover the point.  I think authorisation in writing applies to members as well as every officer or servant of a board.  I see certain objections to that provision, and if there is an amendment on the Committee Stage I would be inclined to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Enforcement of Law (Occasional Powers) (Continuance) Bill, 1925.  The existing Act, the Enforcement of Law (Occasional Powers) Act, is due to expire on the 24th June next. The proposal is to continue that temporary Act in force until the 31st March, 1926.  On that proposal two questions arise, the first being why it is necessary to renew the Act at all, and the second, perhaps, why, if the Act is to be renewed, it should not be simply made permanent.  I had circulated to Deputies certain returns showing the position with regard to the execution of decrees in the three last quarters.  These were the quarters ending 30th September and 30th December of last year and March of the current year.  Deputies will see from those returns that there really was a very considerable problem to be tackled and that arrears are not quite satisfactorily wiped off, even up to date.  At the same time it is true that the execution of Court judgments is probably proceeding more smoothly and more expeditiously at the moment than, say, at any time for the last fifteen or twenty years.  That is not an extravagant claim.  This side of administrative machinery was never really satisfactory in the past, and it is not an extravagant ambition to aim at making it very much more satisfactory in future than it was at any period during the past.  Any solicitor in a fair way of practice in the country knows that the execution of Court judgments, and in particular the execution of the <Col N="417" /> decrees of the County Courts, was never in a satisfactory position here.  I consider that a weakness of that kind is a serious weakness in administration, and it inevitably reacts on commercial conditions in a country.  Unless we can bring about a situation in which the decrees of the Courts will be executed smoothly and with expedition, that will be a factor against the general credit of the country, morally and financially, and against its commercial prospects.</P>
      <P>I am asking to have the Act which we passed last year continued until March of next year, because I am not yet in a position to put before the Dáil the proposals which I would wish to make permanent and to incorporate in the permanent law of the country.  In a way it might be contended that the picture shown even in the quarter ending in March of this year shows an abnormal situation, and that it might be better not to pass permanent proposals, until a situation that could be described as normal has been reached.  The Act which we passed last year provided for the appointment of Assistant Under-Sheriffs, not exceeding six in number. That number was, in fact, appointed, but for one reason or another, including the fact that the vacancies had to be advertised and a Selection Board set up under the Civil Service Commission, the appointments were not actually made until the beginning of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III. of the Act which we propose to continue provides for the examination of debtors and the making of instalment orders by Justices of the District Courts.  Before a creditor can obtain that particular relief, the Under-Sheriff must have tried and failed to realise on foot of the judgment.  Part III. of the Act provides a last resort for the creditor and, from the information at my disposal, no provision of the Act has been so fruitful as that providing this system of examination.  I have obtained a return of applications under this part of the Act made in the District Courts up to 31st March, 1925.  The return is not exhaustive, but it is instructive on the working of this part of the Act.  Up to the date mentioned, 576 applications were made to the Justices of the District Courts for the examination of debtors.  In 378 cases instalment <Col N="418" /> orders were made, and in some 20 cases these orders were refused, as the Court was satisfied the debtor had no means with which to pay the debt.  In 364 cases payments have been made by the debtors on foot of their debts.  The remaining 162 cases were still pending on the 31st March, 1925, in that the time fixed for the payment of instalments had not yet arrived, or examination orders only had been made.  The net fact arising from these figures is that 364 Court judgments have been made fruitful which, without Part III. of the Act, would be unproductive, as the alternative remedy afforded by Section 6 of the Debtors (Ireland) Act was cumbersome and costly from the point of view of the creditor, and was rarely utilised.</P>
    <P>I have stated that the execution of Court judgments is at the moment probably as good or even better than it was at any time within the last ten or fifteen years.  I would ask Deputies to remember, when considering that statement, that that position has been reached only by a very considerable expenditure of energy and attention in my Department.  The State is at present paying £73 a week for extra bailiffs under the Act of last year.  Perhaps no part of the machinery of administration in the country has received so much attention, and of necessity has received so much attention, as this question of the execution of Court judgments. The returns which I have caused to be circulated show a certain improvement in the position.  It was a very gradual and a very painful improvement, but, such as it is, it is there. The number of unexecuted judgments on hands on the 31st July, 1924, was 7,063, representing a sum of approximately £126,538.  On 31st March, 1925, the number was 5,712, representing a sum of £107,790, showing a diminution in the number of unexecuted judgments of 1,351, and representing in money value £18,748.</P>
    <P>Before a permanent Bill is introduced we would like to see a considerable improvement in the position, so that we would not be passing permanent proposals on an abnormal set of circumstances.  For instance, in the <Col N="419" /> counties where the assistant under-sheriffs are functioning, you have very considerable arrears situations still to be dealt with.  But, as I say, this question of the execution of court judgments was never very satisfactory in the past and always left a good deal to be desired.  There will need to be considerable changes in that part of the administration, some of which could scarcely be introduced or even considered until the Rules of Court, which are to be brought in under the Courts of Justice Act, have been introduced and, in fact, have been in operation for some time.  Any permanent proposal dealing with the under-sheriffs side of administration would need to fit in with the Rules of Court and with the permanent staff machinery under the Court of Justices Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is due to the fact that the Committees can only meet on one or at most two days a week. The Committees consist of judges and justices who have their week's work to do.  My information is that they are only able to meet for a couple of hours each Saturday.  In addition to that, the work is highly detailed and highly technical.  I imagine all three sets of rules will be probably along inside the next couple of weeks.  As I say, the introduction of any permanent measure dealing with this side must of necessity have to await these rules and their operation, and a period would be needed for observation before we could bring in what we would deem to be a sound Bill dealing with a phase of administration which has never been satisfactory in the past and which, because of its importance and because of its reactions on general credit and commercial prospects, should be brought to the highest point of efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of endorsing what the <Col N="420" /> Minister has said in this matter, and as regards the importance of the work which is being carried on.  We must all recognise that at the present time the difficulties that confront this particular aspect of collecting debts in the country are very much accentuated by the known shortage of money throughout the country.  I think the extension of the probationary period of the Act for another period is a satisfactory feature that the House ought to support. At the same time the introduction of a permanent measure should not be delayed beyond as short a period as can be satisfactorily arranged. I would like to take this opportunity also to compliment the Minister on the very valuable work of his department in this respect.  Undoubtedly throughout the country there is a greater recognition to-day than there has been for a very long time of the necessity of meeting commercial obligations as they arise.  The importance of this attitude cannot be over-stated, because the whole foundation of the credit of the country really lies in the satisfactory collection of debts as they fall due, and the education of the people as a whole into the importance of meeting these obligations as they fall due.  It is very injurious to the commercial interests of the country that the feeling should be abroad that it is necessary to scrutinise closely the reputation and standing of the people before credit can be given, and that elements of doubt should arise not as to the ability of the people to pay an account but as to their willingness to do so.  I think the Minister should be complimented on the firm stand his department has taken in this matter and the good work that it has done, by its recognition of the fact that this is a very important factor in the commercial life of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that commerce is based on confidence, credit is largely a matter of confidence, and that the good name of the country is a big factor when we go across the water or in carrying out international transactions.  It is worth a great deal to the credit of the country that that should be so.  In the past credit, when it was given in the country, was not honoured frequently, and creditors, <Col N="421" /> rather than go to the trouble and expense of collecting small debts, wrote them off as bad altogether.  I claim that any such feeling getting abroad, as regards the stability of this country and the facilities offered by our legal institutions, is very damaging to the country.  Anything that the Minister can do to import honesty into transactions as between individuals and between parties in this country and in other countries in commercial dealings, will be a very good day's work for the country, and for its commercial prosperity, more particularly at present, when we all recognise that the difficulties people have in paying their debts down the country is quite abnormal. I think we do recognise that even people who are willing to meet their obligations find considerable difficulty in doing so, and when we are going to emerge from that situation into, I hope, better circumstances when money will be more plentiful, it will be fatal for the country to get a reputation that while the people are able to pay, either they will not pay, or the law in itself is not going to make them pay.  I hope when the time comes when this extension of this Act expires, that the Minister will not need to ask for any further extension, and that all the machinery of the courts will be in good working order, the Rules of Court included amongst other things.  On that matter the sooner the Rules of Court are issued and put into operation the better, because, I think, the Minister himself recognises that the delay in formulating these rules and putting them into operation is causing a great deal of inconvenience in legal and commercial circles.  I would like to endorse the claim of the Minister for the continuation of this Act, and to recognise at the same time the very valuable attitude which he has taken up in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel myself in a rather awkward position.  I stand and have always stood for the obligations of the debtor to pay his debts.  I regret the situation in the country is such that the Minister for Justice should have thought it necessary to have prolonged this extraordinary legislation for another year.  One <Col N="422" /> would have thought that the ordinary common law would have been sufficient at this date to ensure that those who have given extended confidence to other people would have had the means without this extraordinary law of being able to recover their debts.  I feel that had the Rules of Court been available at the proper time the Minister would have had no occasion to come here for this special Bill. I can readily understand that Deputy Hewat sees in this Bill a very great acquisition.  He, of course, is on the side of those who, like Shylock, want their pound of flesh, but there are other considerations to be borne in mind.  There is, I agree, a want of confidence, and that is especially shown by the bankers and by the restrictions placed on unfortunate creditors who are in the position of being unable to pay their debts.  Therefore the addition of this machinery of the law only means additional unnecessary expense, and will not achieve the purpose for which it is brought forward. The Minister's statement bears that out.  £18,000 has been collected.  It has cost £3,796 of the State's taxable money to collect that £18,000.  I may be wrong.</P>

I would like everyone to pay, therefore you can see the difficulty in which I am.  I do not want to see unfortunate debtors paying huge costs, and I can understand how hard it is when the bailiffs come in on an unfortunate farmer's place.

      <P>We have had two contributions&mdash;one from Deputy Hewat endorsing my statement that the smooth and expeditious execution of court judgments is a very important matter and has very important reactions on the commercial life of the country.  Then we had from Deputy Wilson a contribution which, to my mind, showed rather loose thinking on the whole subject.  He started by waiving Deputy Hewat aside as a man who is naturally on the side of those who, like Shylock, wanted their pound of flesh.  Deputy Wilson presumably grazes cattle, and in his capacity as a grazier of cattle he should be the last man to be on the side of those who want their pound of flesh without paying for it.</P>

      <P>The Bill is simply directed to that end.  In times of economic <Col N="424" /> depression people, of course, find it hard to pay their debts and to answer the court judgments and decrees, but the remedy does not lie in bringing about a situation where court judgments will not be enforced, and as between breaking a man who owes money and a man who is owed money, any decent administration will break the man who owes money.  It is a hard world and that is simply an axiom of it, that people must pay when they can.  When they cannot there is provision for that too.  It would simply be to make a situation, that is not yet a good situation, a fairly sombre situation, if we were to allow any clod or kink to come in the efficient execution of the judgments of the court.  It would have its reaction on credit, and the vicious circle would go on until you had a depressing and hopeless economic situation confronting you in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any remedy for the economic situation that would allow that side of the administration to become clogged and the sheriff's offices to become piled with worthless judgments, which lapse by the passing of time and become simply waste paper, would be a very serious situation.  The Deputy talked about ordinary and extraordinary law.  I would have been very glad to come here and propose that this Bill be incorporated permanently in the law of the country.  I see nothing in it which renders it unfit to be incorporated in that law.  My permanent proposals will be very similar to the Act which I propose to continue up to the 6th March next year.  It is only with regard to certain minor administrative details that I would like to see the operation of the new rules of court.  Our minds are running towards proposals which will put this whole question of the execution of court judgments on a better footing and plane than it was at any time in the past.  I am not ready to make these proposals yet, because I want to see the rules of court, and I want to see them in operation for some time.  This Bill and this side of administrative activity generally are not directed against and are not properly understood as a hardship on any section of the community.  It would <Col N="425" /> be a hardship on all sections of the community if this side of the administration were to weaken and fail, and I think there is growing appreciation of that inter-dependence of all the various elements that go to make up the country. There were dire prophecies when the Act was introduced, and particularly in connection with Part 3 of that Act.  I have shown that the net effect of Part 3 was to make 364 judgments fruitful that would not otherwise have had any result and that would have been written off as <i>nulla bona.</i>  There was some comment on the powers to enable judgment orders to be issued against people who refuse to comply with the orders of the court.  The net effect of that was that precisely two persons found their way into gaol.  One of them was a Wicklow man and the other a Kerry man.  It is well that Deputy Wilson should know that I do not regard this Act, which I now ask to have continued till March next year, as anything very exceptional or anything very abnormal, and the permanent proposals will be very similar to the existing Act.</P>

      <P>These are our permanent proposals with regard to firearms, and I take it there is no particular necessity for me to argue from the point of view of the preservation of peace and order in the country that it is necessary to have the possession of firearms restricted and controlled. I feel certain that Deputies will agree with me in saying that such restriction in the country is of paramount importance.  Deputies are aware that under the Public Safety (Emergency Powers) Act, and then by the Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Act of last year, as continued by the Firearms (Temporary Provisions) (Continuance) Act, 1925, we controlled and restricted the use of firearms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Power was reserved under the enactments referred to to make regulations for the issue of permits or certificates to be in the possession of firearms. These certificates were issued by the police forces throughout the country, and to meet the expenses in connection with the issue, a fee of 5/- for each certificate was charged.  These certificates did not relieve the holder from the provisions of the existing law as to the possession of firearms, in that when a person obtained his certificate from the police he had still to comply with the provisions of the Gun Licence Act, 1870, <Col N="427" /> or, if he wished to shoot game, of the Game Certificates (Ireland) Act, 1842, as amended by the Game Licence Act, 1860.  These statutes are still in force, and the position under them is shortly as follows:&mdash;Under the Gun Licence Act, 1870, every person who uses or carries a gun as defined by the Act, that is, a firearm of any description, has to take out a yearly excise licence at a cost of 10/-, unless he uses or carries such gun only in a dwelling-house or the curtilage thereof.  Certain persons are excepted from the necessity of taking out such a licence, the principal being persons in possession of a game licence; persons carrying a gun for the possessor of a game licence; an occupier of lands using or carrying a gun for the purpose only of scaring birds, or of killing vermin on such lands, a gun-smith, or a common carrier.</P>
    <P>Under the Game Licence Acts a person wishing to use a gun for the purpose of taking or killing game must take out a yearly licence at a cost of £3, or he can obtain a half-yearly licence for £2, or a fortnightly licence for £1.  These Acts are in force at the moment, and from the point of view of the public, who are desirous of possessing or using firearms, two distinct steps must be taken by them&mdash;namely, (1) the obtaining of a certificate from the police authorities, and (2) the obtaining of the appropriate licence from the Excise authorities.  I have thought it better that, if possible, the public should be relieved of having to go to two distinct authorities in this manner, and accordingly the Bill before you for consideration proceeds on the basis of enabling the Gárda Síochána to issue full certificates for the possession and use of firearms.  The Bill at the moment is silent as to the amount of fees to be charged in the various cases.  These fees, however, have been agreed upon between my Department and the Department of Finance, but for convenience' sake it has been thought more desirable that they should be included in the Finance Bill.  However, I think it proper that in considering this Bill you should be aware of these agreed fees which are as follow, namely:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.&mdash;For a firearm certificate for a <Col N="428" /> rifle or revolver, with or without ammunition therefor, 5s. 2.&mdash;For a firearm certificate for a shot gun, with or without ammunition therefor, limited to use for the destruction of vermin on lands belonging to the person to whom the certificate is granted, 5s. 3.&mdash;For any other firearms certificate in respect of a shot gun&mdash;(a) for one such certificate, £2; (b) where two or more certificates are granted to the same person not necessarily at the same time and expiring on the same date, for the first such certificate, £2; for the second and every such subsequent certificate, 5s.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that the net result of these fees is that the farmer who wishes to be in possession of a gun for the destruction of vermin on his own lands is placed in exactly the same position as he is at present, namely, that he has to pay 5s. for his certificate. A change, however, has been effected with regard to the possession of shot-guns by persons other than farmers, in that any such person who wishes to possess and use a shot-gun must pay a yearly sum of £2 for the certificate, and such certificate will entitle them to use the gun for all purposes, including the destruction of game.  In other words, what was commonly known in former times as the 10s. licence has been abolished, and the cost of the game licence has been reduced from £3 to £2.  Many complaints have been made to me with regard to the destruction of game in this country, and it has been pointed out, with a great deal of truth, that with any sort of preservation the game of the country could well become a national asset and a source of considerable wealth.  After careful investigation I have come to the conclusion that one of the chief causes of the unauthorised destruction of game in the past has been the abuse of the 10s. licence. That licence did not entitle the holder to destroy game, yet invariably the possessor of such a licence fired and, with luck, killed any game which he came across.  Not only that, but many possessors of the 10/- licence were foremost in destroying game in the close season.  Accordingly, we propose the total abolition of the 10/- licence, and while doing <Col N="429" /> that, we do not want to put it out of the reach of any man who may not be possessed of great wealth to obtain a certificate entitling him to kill game.  To ensure that, the £3 payable in the past for a game licence is now being reduced to £2, and I think that anyone thinking over these proposals and the effect of them will not disapprove. At this stage it is probably unnecessary to go through the various sections.  Deputies will be conversant with the purport of them.  Sections 2 to 6, inclusive, and Section 8 regulate the possession, use and carriage of firearms. Section 7 enables permits, as distinct from certificates, to be issued in certain specified cases.  Sections 9 to 13, inclusive, provide for the registration of firearms dealers and lay down the conditions to be complied with by such dealers.  With regard to firearms dealers, it might be well to mention that it is the intention to charge an annual fee of £1 in respect of such registration.  This is, I think, a reasonable amount and will help to defray the expenses in connection with such registration.  Section 14 deals with the prohibition of the possession and manufacture of weapons discharging noxious liquids, for instance, flame-throwers, gas bombs and so on. Sections 16 to 18, inclusive, deal with the restrictions on the export, import or removal of firearms or ammunition. Section 19 prohibits firearms being taken in pawn.  Sections 20, 21 and 23 confer on the Gárda Síochána powers necessary for the due enforcement of the Bill.  Sections 22 and 24 provide for forfeiture and punishments.  As I indicated at the outset, the necessity for these restrictions can scarcely be disputed, and I think that the measures of restriction prescribed in the Bill should meet with general approval.  I move the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>The Bill in its main object is accepted.  The object is to see that firearms are kept under strict supervision.  But one would like to know what the Minister means by a farmer, because a particular constituent of mine has written me several letters.  His complaint is that he is a farmer, that he has a farm and is <Col N="430" /> refused permission to possess a gun. He resides near Bray, and he grows vegetables.  He says that he has complied with all the regulations and that still the Minister refuses, on the report of the Superintendent of the Civic Guard, to give him a gun.  What is a farm?  What dimensions of ground constitute a farm?  Then again, this particular constituent seems to think that he is badly used, and he has asked me to bring this question forward in the Dáil.  I presume that any plot-holder in an urban area would not be considered a farmer for the purpose of this Bill and that he would not get a gun for a five-shilling licence.  I also want to ask if the Minister, under Section 24, intends to give a farmer six months' imprisonment for not taking out a licence for a gun.  That seems to me rather an extraordinary punishment:&mdash;&ldquo;Any person who commits an offence under this Act in respect of which no other punishment is provided by this Act shall be liable in respect of such offence on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds or six months' imprisonment.&rdquo; I do not think the farmers will agree to that.</P>

      <P>The Minister agrees that that is too severe.  On the whole we all agree that provisions as to registration and care as to whom firearms are issued is absolutely necessary. But there is one point I would like to bring before the Minister.  I have had a complaint in my district that many dealers who, under the British regime, sold firearms, are now refused certificates to do so.  It seems an injustice that a man who hitherto had the privilege of dealing in cartridges and such things should now be deprived of it, and I would like to know what regulations the Minister is making in that respect and how he differentiates between the various dealers, whether they must be members of the Cumann na nGaedheal or otherwise.  I am not saying that that is the case, but it looks very much like that.  A serious complaint has been <Col N="431" /> made by one dealer that he has been refused a licence, and from my point of view he is eminently suitable to hold a licence.</P>

      <P>The Bill provides for the regulation and use of firearms, and in my judgment it is a very drastic measure.  After all, under normal conditions, the proper use of firearms, that is to say, shotguns, young people going out for an afternoon's sport with a gun, and that sort of thing, is not reprehensible, nor do I think the conditions ought to be made as drastic as they are in this Bill.  We know that down the country there are not too many entertainments for young people and a good many of them have occupied their time and their energy, not badly, in going out with a gun and having a shot at whatever they could come across.</P>

      <P>At one time it was the landlord, but latterly I do not know who it is.  Such a youth as I have described, if he wanted to observe the law in all its forms and ceremonies, took out a 10/- licence and went out with his gun, generally on a Saturday afternoon or on Sunday, and, as the Minister has said, if he had a bit of luck got a bird or two, and if not he came home without one. At all events, he had the healthy exercise of walking about the country, and as a rule he did no harm to anybody. Where there was valuable game it was preserved, and it will continue to be preserved against poaching.  To ask that young person to take out a licence costing him £2, with the additional cost of his ammunition, and possibly car-fare to go to some place where he might be likely to get some game, is, I think, asking too much.  Then, I think the penalties at the end of the Bill seem to be rather drastic.  I think the Minister for Justice is rather sanguine about the law-abiding capacity of the people under the new order of things.  He expects a race of archangels <Col N="432" /> to come along.  Because when he is putting down penalties for a person going out chancing his arm with a gun over his shoulder, he puts down penalties in this Bill whereby a man is sent to jail for six months.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will notice that the penalty is on summary conviction &ldquo;not exceeding £50, or at the discretion of the court to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both such fine and such imprisonment.&rdquo;  These are maximum penalties.</P>

      <P>Of course, the maximum penalty is not generally enforced. In the old times, I remember, as a young fellow, having occasionally gone out with a gun and possibly without a licence, and possibly I would have thought it a very great hardship to be put into jail for doing that.  At all events, even if it is a maximum penalty, it is putting a reading on what might be considered less heinous than the sentence would seem to indicate. I suggest to the Minister, at all events, that if a man is going out to shoot game, it is right and proper that he should pay for a game licence.  To enact that everybody who uses a gun should pay £2 for a licence is too much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I might venture to suggest to the Minister that in the case of the farmer who takes a 5/- licence to shoot over his own land, it is expecting rather much of human nature to say that he is to confine himself to his own land, or anything like that.  I think it is a loose definition of what a man may <Col N="433" /> do.  It certainly will encourage the taking out of 5/- licences, and I also think it will not at all mean that a man is going to stay on his own land with his gun.  Even so, I think that differentiation between a farmer and an ordinary man is rather extreme, because it certainly seems to me that 5/- licences will be very prevalent over the country districts, and that £2 licences will be scarce, and the men who will have the 5/- licences will use them for shooting game.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MICHAEL DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with what Deputy Hewat has said.  I consider that a sum of £2 for a licence is actually driving the farmer, or the farmer's son, from using a gun, except on his own land, and that this 5/- licence, as the Minister for Justice has told us, gives him no right to shoot anything except to scare crows, or to protect his crops from vermin.  Heretofore, that privilege was allowed to farmers without any payment whatsoever.  Under the old regime, the farmer could use his gun on his own farm, to protect his crops, scare crows, and destroy vermin, without the payment of anything whatever.  Now, there is an additional tax of 5/- put on him for carrying a gun at all, on his own farm.  With that licence he cannot shoot.  He can only scare crows, or destroy vermin. It prohibits him from shooting a bird of any sort, except vermin.  I believe that £2 is entirely too much, and I believe that there should be something intermediate, a sum between £2 and 5/-. I say that because, in some districts, there is no game whatever, or practically none.  In my own district there is very little game, and it would certainly not pay anyone to pay £2 for the game that he would be likely to get. This Bill deprives the farmer of taking a shot at anything unless he first pays £2.  This thing of paying 5/- for shooting on your own lands does not allow the farmer to shoot.  It only allows him to scare crows and kill vermin.</P>

      <P>Well, you cannot shoot a wood pigeon.  You can only shoot a hawk.  I am not talking about pheasants, which are game.  This licence of £2 is all right where game is plentiful.  By this Bill the farmer or his sons, who have not much means, are prevented from carrying a gun.  They could not afford to pay £2.  You are giving the benefit to the big man who is to shoot game.  You are reducing what he had to pay by 20/-, and increasing what the other man had to pay.  I hold that you ought to have some intermediate fee whereby a man could carry a gun and shoot birds without having to pay anything as high as £2.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (1) after the word <Col N="436" />&ldquo;Act,&rdquo; line 23, to add the following words: &ldquo;provided however that no pension can be revoked on the grounds of lawful political activities of those receiving a pension, or entitled to receive a pension.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would remind the Dáil that the men most likely to be affected by this amendment are men who came into the national movement from what I may describe as political or patriotic motives.  They played a big part in bringing around the Treaty, and by their actions they did much to establish the Saorstát.  It is largely due to them that the Dáil is meeting here to-day to discuss those matters.  Those men may join any of the existing political parties which support the State, or they may, if they wish, form new parties.  I think no one will contend that they have not a legitimate right to do so.  I think that is admitted by everybody.  On the Second Reading, the Minister for Defence gave us an assurance that there would be no victimisation or interference with legitimate politics.  I fully accept that assurance, but I wish to remind the Dáil that we may not always have the same Executive Council or the same Minister for Defence, and I think it is necessary to guard against victimisation in the future in political matters. It is because I am anxious for the safety of the State that I want to put beyond all doubt the proposition that men of this type have a right to go into a constitutional movement.  I believe, if this amendment is accepted, it will make for the safety and security of the State, because it will remove any misapprehension these men may have.  If they go into constitutional politics they should know that they will not be penalised in any way. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment, for the reason that there is no necessity for it. Neither this Government nor any other Government will penalise a man for carrying on lawful political activities. But it is only right that the Government should have some control over the pension of a man guilty of unlawful <Col N="437" /> acts.  As far as this section is concerned, and as far as the Bill as a whole is concerned, the Government never had any intention of imposing penalties for lawful political activities. If they were to impose penalties for such activities, they would not be doing justice to themselves or to the individuals concerned.  Every man entitled to a pension under the Act has ample safeguards.  If the Government were to take any action by which a person in receipt of a pension would feel aggrieved, this House is always available to him to have his grievance <Col N="438" /> ventilated.  I do not think there is any necessity for this amendment, and it would not add to the usefulness of the Bill if it were incorporated in it.</P>

The Dáil would have no opportunity of knowing whether a <i>prima facie</i> case for victimisation had been <Col N="440" /> established unless they had some information as to the nature of the charge, and the answer that was given by the person whose pension was about to be revoked.  For that reason, I suggest it would be a simple matter to get some information in each case&mdash;that the charge and the answer given should be supplied to the Dáil in order that it might have an opportunity of judging whether, in a particular case, there was ground for believing that there had been victimisation.

The safeguard is the same as that given in the case of an officer in the Army whose services are proposed to be dispensed with by the Executive Council; that is to say, he is given an opportunity of putting in writing, before his dismissal takes place, any observations he may have to make against such dismissal.  Further, whatever the decision, it must be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  I think, myself, there are sufficient safeguards already to guard against any act of harshness that might be committed against any individual.  He will have the same safeguard that an officer in the Army has.  From the arguments put forward, I cannot see my way to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's answer rather inclines me to support the amendment.  The Minister brings forward the analogy of the officer who is to be deprived of his commission: that this provision in the Bill would give the pensioner similar rights in the case of a proposed revocation, and that the reasons stated will be printed in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  What are the reasons stated: &ldquo;That the officer has been guilty of conduct unworthy of his office.&rdquo;  That is the kind of reason that is printed in the official gazette, and that is the kind of reason that is going to be stated for the information of the Dáil when you are depriving an ex-soldier of his pension.  If that is the <Col N="441" /> mind of the Minister, and it is quite borne out by the language of the section, it makes me realise the importance of having the facts presented to the Dáil&mdash;that is to say, the reasons, not merely a formal phrase such as is given in the case of an officer who has been deprived of his commission.</P>
      <P>One would have imagined that the reasons stated and referred to in sub-section (1), which had to be printed in the Order, would have been something in the nature of a detailed statement of reasons.  But now we are to understand that that is not the proposal at all.  It is merely to give a formal phrase, such as &ldquo;conduct unbecoming an officer,&rdquo; or some other kind of formal phrase, which gives no reasons whatever.  The proposal in the amendment is to have presented to the Dáil not merely that kind of a formal reason, but a copy of the statement which was sent to the pensioner indicating the reasons why the Executive Council were proposing to deprive him of his pension, as well as the answer that was received.  Let it be borne in mind that this proposal to revoke pensions by a political executive is something not normal, not usual, and when we are going to specify powers, as we are doing here, it is necessary to make some provision against the possibility of abuse of those powers.  I think that the proposal simply to state in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> the reasons in the same manner as is done in the case of an officer deprived of his commission, is not at all sufficient.  We ought to ask for further information, and that the facts relating to the case be stated with some detail.  I think that on these grounds the amendment is worthy of support.  I think, too, that the Minister in his statement rather revealed a weakness in the Bill as it stands.</P>

      <P>It is not usual to publish correspondence in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  What is done is to publish the findings and the results and how they were come by.  I think it would be very foolish and a very bad practice to lay down that correspondence between the pensioner and the Government should be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, and I do not think that it <Col N="442" /> would lead to good order or to anything else.  If the Government cannot be trusted to do justice this House should see, and will see, that justice is done.  I do not know any Executive Council that would be put into office, now or at any other time, that would take a pension from a man justly entitled to it, on account of political spleen or spite.  It could not happen that any Executive Council having the confidence of the country would do such a thing.  If an Executive Council could not be trusted to that degree they would not possess the confidence of the House; therefore, publishing correspondence of that kind in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is not what the House or the country would demand.</P>

This merely will be a routine matter entirely, and there would be no executive action required beyond the mere fact that a man had been guilty of some serious crime against the State before any such action could be taken.  The Executive Council would have to have very good evidence that a man was guilty of that crime before they deprived him of a pension given by an Act passed by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The Minister has contented himself by saying that no Ministry would do such a thing.  But Ministries do these things.  Ministries have been known to do them in the past in many countries.  Yet, if a soldier or a person who has had a pension <Col N="443" /> granted on certain grounds, is subject to have this pension revoked, his only remedy is to come here and persuade the majority of Deputies in the Dáil to bring the matter before the Dáil, and get a majority to prevent that revocation.  It means that that person must be an exceptionally able advocate and lobbyist. As to the reasons given for revoking the pension, bear in mind the person has not to be guilty of an offence.  It is presumed by this Bill that the offence the person has to be guilty of is not one that will bring him within the law.  It is not an offence that is capable of being punished or which can be proved against him.  It is some dereliction not criminal, not of a kind for which he can be punished, but which, in the mind of the Executive Council, is sufficient to warrant the withdrawal of his pension, and the only protection the pensioner would have, is that formal reasons should be stated in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  I think the amendment, put forward by the Deputy, that reasons, not of a formal character, but reasons set forth in the communication to be made to the recipient, should also be laid on the Table of the House, and that his reply should accompany that communication.  Then there is the duty devolving upon Deputies to raise the matter if they think an injustice has been done, and that is the only protection that the pensioner has.  I think the proposal is quite a reasonable one. It is not going to do more in the way of formal publication than is done every week in the year.  We see communications of the kind, which are not printed in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, laid upon the Table, and which are capable of being raised and dealt with by Deputies. That is proposed to be done here, and I think it is of some protection to the pensioner against the possibility of the Executive Council revoking a pension without the opportunity of the facts being properly stated before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure for revocation is not a usual one, and, therefore, there should be unusual safeguards in the matter.  I ask Deputies to bear in mind the central fact, which is this: <Col N="444" /> that this is not for an offence that is punishable.  It is giving power to the Executive to revoke pensions for derelictions of some kind for which those charged with are not brought to court. I think the least that could be done is to have the facts laid on the table of the Dáil, so that Deputies might see them and take action.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that the case upon which a claim can be made for passing this amendment falls under two heads&mdash;One, to preserve the rights of persons who are entitled to get these pensions, and two, to give an opportunity to the Dáil of perusing correspondence.  That is, the reason given in the one case and the answer in writing, if any, in the other. Now compare what is requested by this amendment with what is the practice in the case of persons holding office in the Civil Service or holding commissions in the army.  You have here a claim for an advantage for persons who are getting military service pensions over and above either the civilians or the military under the control of the Oireachtas.  It does appear to me that this makes a claim of putting these other two sections in a less favourable position, and placing, as it were, a sort of criticism or judgment upon the Executive Council in respect of its administration of this particular Act, the Military Service Pensions Act, which does not pertain to the other cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons having pensions under the Military Service Act have no claim to be in a better position than an officer having a signed commission from the Executive Council.  There does not appear to me to be a case for it.  The only case that could be made for the acceptance of the amendment is the conviction that the Executive Council will not discharge its duty justly.  No matter what political changes there may be, I have no doubt in my mind than an Executive Council charged with its responsibilities, would not deliberately rob a person, entitled to a pension, of his rights&mdash;because it would be robbery.  Members of the Executive Council, no matter what party they belong to, must discharge their duty according to their conscience in matters of this kind.  I mentioned <Col N="445" /> when introducing this Act that it was intended to provide compensation for the interruption of the lives of these men.  Is it thought likely that an Executive Council will consider depriving men of pensions to whom compensation is due?  I think it is most unlikely. In view of the peculiar times we have lived through, however, I think that corrective authority must be given to the Executive, and I am satisfied that it will never be abused.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Duggan, I beg to move:&mdash;&ldquo;In page 4, before Section 9, to insert a new section as follows&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
      <P>9.&mdash;(1)  For the purpose of advising and assisting the Minister in the performance of his duties under this Act, there shall be established an advisory committee (in this section referred to as the committee) which shall be styled the Local Supplies Advisory Committee and shall consist of five persons to be appointed from time to time as occasion requires as follows, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  two persons, being elected members of county or county <Col N="446" /> borough councils in Saorstát Eireann, by the General Council of Irish County Councils, and</P>
    <P>(b)  two persons, being elected members of urban district councils or commissioners of towns in Saorstát Eireann, by the Association of Municipal Councils of Ireland, and</P>
    <P>(c)  one person by the Association of Chambers of Commerce of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>(2)  The several members of the Committee shall, unless they previously die or resign, respectively retain their membership for such period from their appointment as the Minister shall prescribe, but shall be eligible for re-appointment.</P>
    <P>(3)  Three members of the committee shall be a quorum, and the members of the committee shall at every meeting elect from amongst their number the chairman for that meeting and such chairman shall have a second or casting vote.</P>
    <P>(4)  The committee shall have a secretary who shall be nominated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(5)  The committee shall meet whenever summoned by the Minister and also on such other occasions as the committee may from time to time determine.</P>
    <P>(6)  The committee shall consider and advise the Minister on all matters which shall be referred to it by the Minister and the committee may also at its discretion consider and if it thinks fit report to the Minister on any other matter relating to or affecting the supply of commodities to local authorities under this Act.</P>
    <P>(7)  Payments may be made by the Minister to members of the committee, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, in respect of repayment of travelling expenses and payment of subsistence allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The objection I have to the new section is to paragraphs (a) (b) and (c).  I asked whether the General Council of <Col N="447" /> County Councils was a statutory authority, and the President thought it was.  I take that as being satisfactory, if it is.  Is the Association of Municipal Councils of Ireland a statutory body?  If it is, I am satisfied.  I am quite sure the Association of Chambers of Commerce is not a statutory body.  Therefore, I think it is quite unwise to put in names of associations which may be temporary, which may have no representative authority in a year, two years, or five years, and do not mean anything within the law. They are not recognisable.  It would be far better to leave the matter of the selection of these persons in a somewhat general form to the Minister&mdash; you can say &ldquo;representatives of commercial interests&rdquo; if you like&mdash;rather than put in the name of an association which may be representative to-day, but possibly may not be representative to-morrow.  It is not recognisable in any way, because it is not an incorporated body, and, therefore, cannot be recognised in law.  To put that into a statute of this kind would, I think, be informal and unwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I am not in a position to answer Deputy Johnson with regard to (b).  I do not know whether that body is a statutory one.  I do know that it holds meetings and that I was a member of it on two occasions.  I do know that it is keenly interested in housing and that it concerns itself with matters affecting the general business of local authorities.  In connection with this Advisory Committee we want to have members from urban districts, as distinct from members of county councils, and it was thought advisable to have representation for them.  I would not bind myself to the particular distribution of representation as it stands here, but it was put down with a view to meeting the case that the Minister ought to have some such body advising him.  Certain representatives from various local authorities have been occasionally in touch with the trade department, and the trade department got a good deal of valuable information and advice in connection with this policy of combined purchasing.  It <Col N="448" /> would be advisable to have some representation from the County Councils General Council, but as the needs of some of the smaller urban districts might not be so prominently before the minds of that council, we thought it advisable to bring in this association. If it should happen that this particular body did not meet, I should say that the Minister ought to have power to nominate, or to get advice from the County Councils General Council as to the nomination of members of urban councils on this advisory body.  There is a departure in the appointment of a member from the Association of Chambers of Commerce, but as the commodities in the majority of cases are commercial commodities, and as these people are experts in that matter, after advising the Minister for some time it might convince them that this Department was run on business lines, and the resultant confidence will be of immense benefit.  While it may be that the Association of Municipal Councils is not a statutory body, it is advisable to get representation from urban councils upon this advisory body.  As I said, I am not committed to this particular distribution of membership.</P>

      <P>The proposal is to embody in the Bill that two persons be nominated by the General Council of County Councils.  That, I have no objection to, because I understand from the President that that Council is a statutory body, and therefore can be identified.  We are not so sure whether the Association of Municipal Councils is a statutory body.  If it is, it can be identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt.  We are to put it in a statute, and if non-representative next year, if it becomes a council to which only two urban councils send representatives, that is the <Col N="449" /> body you must, under this statute, give power to appoint these nominees.  My objection is even greater to paragraph (c), the Association of Chambers of Commerce.  That body exists to-day, I believe.  It may not exist to-morrow. It may break up like other associations. It may have a split and the smaller body may retain the name. Two bodies may retain the name and each may claim to he the Association of Chambers of Commerce.  Who is to decide?  The formal point is that there is no such body which can be recognised, which will be permanent, and the name of which should be put into a statute.  There would be, at least, as much claim to put in the Irish Trades' Union Congress.  There has been a steady refusal to name a body like that which is not statutory, may not be permanent, and by the time this Bill comes into active operation, may be defunct. There may be two bodies calling themselves the Irish Trades' Union Congress. Someone has to decide.  The naming of bodies in this way is, I think, undesirable, unless they are statutory and can be identified.  I would suggest to the Minister to withdraw the section and have it remodelled and introduced in the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Deputy tell us, even if we had a body formed in the way he mentioned, would that give any greater guarantee than this section gives of its existence?  None of us can guarantee the continued existence of any body, no matter how formed.  The objection the Deputy makes in this particular case might be applied generally to any body.  Doubtless, the Deputy is judging other bodies from the standpoint of those with which he is more closely an touch.  I do not know that it applies with the same force.  While there may be considerable difference of opinion in some bodies, I do not know that it is fair to apply that argument to other bodies. I do not want to go into details of that nature, but I think I have said enough to show, possibly, what is the guiding spirit in the mind of the Deputy.  I can speak with some authority on this subject, as I happen to be a member of a council, the object of which was to give advice of a particular character <Col N="450" /> to the Government of Great Britain. The Government of Great Britain found that that body, by reason of the interests it represented, was most useful. The particular body the President has mentioned in this amendment stands in exactly the same position with regard to the Saorstát Government as the other body did with the Government of Great Britain.  I know that the British Government found that body of the greatest assistance, and I am sure that if our Government seeks to get the same information, or brings this body into its confidence, they will get equally helpful information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope whatever the President does he will not change the wording of the amendment.  The Association of Municipal Councils has been in existence for, I think, over ten years, and was recognised by the Local Government Department to an extent that no other association was recognised. For instance, I know they recognised it as far as giving the councils authority to send representatives to the meetings and to pay their expenses. The auditors also always recognised anything done in that way.  Short of an Act of Parliament establishing it as a council, everything that the Government could do to recognise this body was done.  It gave very useful information to the Local Government Board in connection with housing, town-planning and things like that.  I think representatives of such a body would be very useful on an Advisory Board of this kind, as its members know exactly what is wanted by municipal authorities. The representatives of county councils know exactly what is wanted for county homes and for rural areas. There are things wanted in urban areas that these people are not capable of giving advice on, and for that reason I believe it is essential that urban councils should be represented on this body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection is a <Col N="451" /> formal one.  It is an objection of a legal form and I think I am right that to put into a statute reference to an association which would have to be the subject of all kinds of legal decisions as to what it consisted of, and what was its composition is informal, and that we should not bind ourselves to it under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has me at a disadvantage.  The principle is to give representation from these two bodies.  If it subsequently transpires that it would be advisable to make the Association of Municipal Councils of Ireland a statutory body I will certainly put that view before the Minister. I do not know whether it is statutory.  I think it is not.  I think the General Council of County Councils was a body that might have been more largely used than it was during the last twenty years.  I think there were only one or two meetings in the year, perhaps quarterly, but that it should have a very useful function was evident when I was Minister for Local Government.  I would undertake to consult the Minister for Local Government as regards the other point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister, apart from the Bill itself which I object to, that this particular section is one that we should not, in its present from, tie ourselves to, because I think it makes us look rather foolish, and that the Minister would, on obtaining advice, bring that proposition forward in, say, the Seanad, if he does not want to delay the further consideration of the Bill.  For my own part I do not think if it were brought up again, even next week on the final stage, it would delay the Bill any longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a good deal of dissatisfaction in some councils against the provisions of the Bill, and by putting in that provision it will give them representation in an advisory capacity, and will allay many of the fears that they entertain about it.
