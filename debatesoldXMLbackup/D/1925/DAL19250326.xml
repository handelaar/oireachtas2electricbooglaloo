      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present Government has guaranteed the sum of £50,000 for the development of the Wolfhill Colliery, this amount being advanced by the National Land Bank, which received 100 debentures of £500 each charged on the Company's property as collateral security.  The advances were made as and when required from the 5th September, 1923, until the end of July, 1924; including a sum of £25,500 paid by the National Land Bank to the National Bank on the 30th October, 1923, in repayment of an advance made <Col N="1466" /> by that Bank to the Company on 2nd February, 1922, on the guarantee of the Provisional Government.  Of the latter amount £25,000 represented capital and £500 accrued interest.</P>
      <P>The conditions under which the Government guarantee was given were that the Company should lodge debentures with the Bank to the amount to be advanced.</P>
      <P>It was represented to the Government that the money was required for the installation of modern machinery, etc., and for meeting losses on working until the company was in a position to work at a profit.</P>
      <P>No repayment has ever been made of any of the sums advanced.</P>
      <P>The security held for the money outstanding is the debentures charged on the company's property.</P>
      <P>No figures are available as to what amounts of the sums guaranteed were paid out for (1) salaries and wages, (2) machinery and stores, and (3) royalties; but according to the documents available in the Department of Finance, it appears that the following sums were spent on the purchase and erection of machinery and road-making in the mine.  Year ended 31st March, 1922, £10,502; year ended 31st March, 1923, £6,051; 14 months, ended 28th May, 1924, £2,793; total, £19,346 apart from a sum of £1,500 approximately spent on the miners' huts and the manager's house.  During the same periods the losses in working were respectively, £25,647, £17,813, and £14,539, totalling £57,999.</P>
      <P>No exact details are available in my Department as to the average number of men employed in the period stated in the question, but it is understood that the figure is less than 170.</P>
      <P>The only figures available in the Department of Finance as to output of coal, are as follows:&mdash;Year ended 31st March, 1922, 15,163 tons, of which 9,899 tons were disposable commercially, the remainder being waste or used in the boilers in the mine; year ended 31st March, 1923, 14,835 tons, of which 7,931 tons were disposable commercially; eight months ended 28th May, 1924, 13,000 tons, of which 7,926 tons were disposable commercially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the above advances, <Col N="1467" /> an advance of £12,000, free of interest, was made to the company by the Commissioners of Public Works in respect of the price of coals contracted to be supplied by the Company to the Commissioners. The contract was for the supply of 20,000 tons at 30/- per ton. As security for the advance the company charged their property with repayment of the advance.  Only 7,000 tons were delivered under the contract, but the advance was cleared, taking into account the freight charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DÁVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to assure the House that all the money advanced for the development of the Wolfhill Colliery was actually spent upon that particular work?  Or is he in a position to give details of the losses referred to in the answer he has given to show that such is the case, and that the money has not been used or set aside for any other purpose but the purpose of actual development.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that a similar answer was given over 12 months ago, will the Minister see that the work of the Committee is hurried up, so that some decision of some kind is come to in the matter, especially as, in the case referred to in No. 2, the gun taken from the individual has been the means of earning a living for the individual concerned?</P>

      <P>William Howe claimed benefit at the Droichead Nua Branch Employment Office on the 23rd May, 1924, and in respect of this claim he was entitled to 8 days' unemployment insurance benefit at the rate of 2/6 per day.  According to the records of the Department, Mr. Howe was paid the full amount of benefit due to him on the 11th July, 1924, but as Mr. Howe has denied receiving any payment, the matter is under investigation by the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to make a statement with reference to the Civil Service Service Regulation Act, 1924. When moving the second reading of the Bill, I stated with reference to appointments under Clause (b) of Section 6 of the Bill that the Civil Service Commissioners would have to be satisfied that it was in the public interest that such appointments should be made without examinations.  I do not, now, think that statement was accurate.  The <Col N="1481" /> question of the construction of that section has recently been raised and the Government have taken advice as to its legal construction.  The advice which they have received is that the question of public interest is one entirely for the Minister for Finance, and the Minister in charge of the particular Department concerned, and that the Commissioners are not competent to decide or entertain any such question. When the two Ministers have decided the question of public interest, the function of the Commissioners arises.  That function is to consider the qualifications of the person proposed to be appointed as to age, health, character, knowledge and ability, and to grant their certificate of qualification to him upon such evidence as they may consider satisfactory.  The Commissioners, under the section, have a discretion as to granting the certificate, but in exercising that discretion they are confined to considerations of the qualifications in respect of age, health, character, knowledge and ability of the person proposed to be appointed.</P>
      <P>The Executive Council are considering whether in the circumstances the section should be amended and, if so, in what way.  I think it only fair in view of my specific statement on the Second Reading of the Bill that I should inform the House of the position.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Fisheries, I ask leave to introduce a Bill to amend the Fisheries (Ireland) Acts, 1842 to 1909, and the Fisheries Act, 1924, to make provision for the control of dealers in salmon and trout, and to provide for other matters relating to the preservation of the fisheries of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill consists of four parts.  The first deals with certain defects in the existing law regulating Fishery Boards. The second part deals with the Finances of those Boards and provides for increased revenue.  The third part aims at the control of dealers in salmon and trout, and the fourth part deals with minor matters of detail.  I ask leave to introduce the Bill. <Col N="1482" /> Leave given.  Bill read a first time; ordered for Second Reading on Thursday, April 2nd.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendments. Amendment 2 proposes to delete all the words after the word &ldquo;treason&rdquo;; that is to say, that after the words &ldquo;shall be guilty of treason&rdquo; there follow the words which I propose to delete, &ldquo;and shall be liable on conviction thereof to suffer death.&rdquo;  I take it that the effect of the amendment, if carried, would be to leave the penalty for treason exactly as it has been.  What that penalty is I do not know.  I do not know whether the judges under the present law have an alternative.  I think they have, because though I have not had an opportunity to refer to the matter, my memory suggests that people have been adjudged guilty of treason but have not been hanged, drawn and quartered.  They have sometimes been transported, sometimes they have been admonished, but as I read this section, once a person has been adjudged guilty of treason, there is to be no alternative but to kill him by hanging.  The obvious intention of the section is to treat that person guilty of that offence with the same ignominy as a person guilty of murder. I think everybody will agree that there is a very great difference between the character of the offence of murder, which is too often aggravated by covetousness, pure malice and evil <Col N="1483" /> thoughts, and treason, which very often has been the offence of men and women of sincere and honest purpose, whose object was to bring about a political change.  It may be considered obvious by those people who believe in capital punishment as a regular system that the offence of treason is rightly punishable by death, but the offence of treason may be declared punishable by death, and I think, probably in the majority of cases, if the trial takes place, when people's minds are hot and antipathies have been aroused by political agitation, that the death sentence would follow and would meet with popular approval.  Usually, however, there are regrets after the death sentence has been carried out, and these usually find expression in poems, laudatory notices, and all kinds of poetical references to the nobility of character of the man who is adjudged guilty of treason. Those expressions of view usually only follow when death has been the penalty imposed and carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it possible that there shall be no change in the direction of harshness by the enactment of this Bill in respect of punishment for treason. If it is within the competence of the present law that treason may be punishable by death or some lesser punishment, such as transportation, imprisonment, fine, or anything less than death, I want to have no change. The position under these four sub-sections clearly is that if a person is adjudged guilty of treason he shall not only be liable on conviction to suffer death, but that there shall be no alternative to the death sentence.  Therefore, my purpose in moving these amendments is to leave the sentence as it prevails at present, under the law that exists, without alteration.  The phrase &ldquo;shall be liable on conviction to suffer death,&rdquo; occurs in sub-sections 1 and 2, and that is obviously related to sub-section 4, which says:&mdash;&ldquo;If such person is found guilty of treason he shall be convicted and sentenced in the same manner as if he had been convicted of murder.&rdquo; That is obviously designed to create the same atmosphere regarding a person convicted of treason as though he had been convicted of murder, and there is <Col N="1484" /> no alternative but death by hanging. Then, I take it, the prerogative of mercy may be invoked, and if it is not within the judgment of the administration of the time, the Executive Council of the time, that any mercy should be shown, then death by hanging must take place.  I think&mdash;I am subject to correction in this&mdash;that the absence of an alternative is a harshening of the law in the matter.  Judges heretofore had an alternative, partly depending on the attitude of the jury.  If the jury recommends to mercy, or makes certain suggestions, I think the judge may sentence to something less than death. That, as I say, I am not confirmed in, as I have not had an opportunity of making sufficient references.  I desire to delete these lines respecting the sentence, so that there may be no change in the law as regards the treatment of a man or a woman adjudged guilty of treason.  It may be said that the letter of the law at present prevailing is that a person guilty of treason has not only to be hanged, but has to be drawn and quartered.  If that is the case, I still desire that there shall be no change in the sentence.  Whatever the present law is regarding the punishment for treason I desire to retain it until the day comes when we may all be able to look on this question with a little more detachment, and when there may be Ministers in authority who may not have had quite the same intimate experience of treason and traitors.</P>

      <P>The effect of the acceptance of the Deputy's amendment would be to make Section 1 merely declaratory&mdash;to set out certain offences, and to say that those offences are treason and leave them there&mdash;providing by this Act no penalty for such offences.  The Deputy is again like Mrs. Gummidge, thinking of the &ldquo;old un.&rdquo; All through the debate on this Bill he has been insisting that there is in existence a law which gives all the powers we need, and is urging us back to that law, to rely on it and to have recourse to it.  He urged that on Second Reading; he urged it again persistently in Committee; and now on the last ditch of Report he says, &ldquo;Well, <Col N="1485" /> if you will not rely on it for general purposes at least rely on it and resort to it only for your penalty.  Let this Bill be merely declaratory; let it define certain things as offences, but do not rely on legislation passed by this Parliament for the preservation of this State for your sanctions&mdash;for your penalties; rely rather on Acts passed in 1814 and at intervals between this and then for the penalties by which you will punish the offences which are set out in the Bill.&rdquo;  That course does not appeal to me, and I do not propose to accept the Deputy's amendments. The Deputy is wrong in thinking that the course he advocates would leave it open to the judge to impose any lesser sentence than the capital sentence, and consequently even the grounds which the Deputy himself urges in favour of his amendment disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's comparison between treason and murder was very interesting. He suggested that murder was a low crime committed only by debased and degraded characters, and it was eminently fitting that the death sentence should be imposed for that offence. He thought that treason was in some way the monopoly of high-should people, and that it was rather a shame that people of that description should perish from the earth under the sanctions of any Bill.  There is, of course, another point of view in all that, and that is the consequences of the offences, the reactions on the general <Col N="1486" /> welfare of the community, and, applying that rule and standard, I am afraid the Deputy's comparison between the two offences would scarcely hold.  As between taking the life of one individual and precipitating a state of affairs in which the lives of many individuals will be taken, and in which great suffering and privation will ensue to many individuals, there is no real comparison.  It is merely academic to talk otherwise, and I am surprised that the Deputy should talk otherwise in the light of the recent experiences which we have all had.  I do not want to go again into the arguments which were worn threadbare on Second Reading and on the Committee Stage, but I simply ask the Dáil to reject the Deputy's amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;&ldquo;In page 3 to delete Section 2, lines 1 to 12, inclusive.&rdquo;  The amendment proposes the deletion of a section which imposes a sentence of five years' imprisonment for felony.  Any person who refuses to inform the authorities of what he believes to be a treasonable act is liable to imprisonment.  &ldquo;Every person who, knowing that any act, the commission of which would by virtue of this Act be treason, is intended or proposed to be, or is being, or has been committed, does not forthwith disclose the same together with all particulars thereof known to him to a Justice of the District Court or an officer of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, or the Gárda Síochána ...shall be liable... to suffer penal servitude for any term not exceeding five years...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A person who overhears a conversation in a publichouse is expected to understand the intentions of the conversers. He is expected to know the minds of people whom he may think are conspirators.  If you can inspire the people with sufficient fear of the law, those people at one time or another, say during periods of political excitement, will be prompted to write to the authorities to the effect that such and such a person or group of persons intends or intend to commit treason.  I think the section ought to be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the amendment.  I would ask the Dáil to delete this section.  So far I have not said anything on the Bill, as I had not recognised the Bill, to start with.  I thought the State was quite safe without the introduction of such a Bill as this.  We want peace in this country; we do not want to agitate the minds of those who may be likely to commit crime and lead them to think that we are completely against them.  It would be much better if we tried to coax them and show them the right road upon which to travel. They might then probably recognise that this is really the Government of the people; they might recognise that more quickly than if the Government introduced such a measure as this, with its death penalties and its sentences of <Col N="1489" /> five years' imprisonment if one does not become an informer.</P>
      <P>This section is inserted, I presume, for the purpose of making an informer of every loyal citizen of the State. Take, for instance, that in a football or a hurling field, or for that matter in any place of amusement, three or four people speak to one another, and they say something against the Minister for Justice, the President, or any officer of the State.  To the mind of a loyal citizen, what they say may be injurious to the welfare of the State, and it is then necessary for that loyal citizen to get in touch with the District Justice or some other official of the State and give information that those people had said certain things, and that in his opinion they were going to commit an act of treason. Surely, we do not want to make informers of every man and woman in the Saorstát.  Surely, the Government has sufficient employees within its clutches going around seeking information.</P>
      <P>There is a Secret Service corps and also a Detective corps.  The members of those bodies are paid, and it is their duty to find out information.  But, apparently, the Government is not satisfied with that.  It wants to make informers of every citizen of the State who happens to be loyal.  If there is any sense of responsibility in any of the elected representatives of the people, they will realise fully that they cannot go back to their constituencies and say that they want every man and woman who voted for them to inform and to do their best to find out, and give information against, persons prejudiced against the Government or the Constitution of the Free State.  There is not, I am sure, a Deputy who would ask his constituents to do such a thing. Take the case of men who may be in clubs.  They may be playing billiards, cards, dominoes, dice, or other games. Some individuals may probably get a drink or two too much, and when the Irish spirit becomes elevated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>The genuine Irish spirit that is not in those who drafted this <Col N="1490" /> Bill.  When that spirit becomes elevated those individuals may say something they would not really mean.  The next day they may be sorry for what they said; but that would be no excuse. The loyal citizen who heard them saying it would give information to the District Justice.  Those people would be arrested and, possibly, they might be sentenced to five years' penal servitude.</P>
      <P>Surely if the Government wants to show its ability&mdash;and I personally recognise that Ministers have shown ability for the last three years&mdash;it will not ask for such measures as this.  They say to the people: &ldquo;We want to do good work for you; we want to show that we are democratic and we want to prove to you that we are here in the interests of the Irish people.&rdquo;  But we are not acting in the interests of the people by passing such measures as this, to make an informer of each individual in certain circumstances. I ask the Dáil to vote in favour of Deputy Johnson's amendment because we may have thousands of people in the Saorstát who will refuse to give information or become informers, although they may be loyal citizens of the State.  Then because they refuse to become informers and voluntarily to give information, they are liable to be arrested and to be sentenced to five years' penal servitude.  Would any Government under the sun to-day, elected as the Saorstát Government is, by the people, introduce such a measure as this?  To my mind it endeavours to turn all the citizens of the Saorstát into a band of informers.  The Government says to them: &ldquo;If you do not become informers we will punish you, because we are the Government.&rdquo;  I ask the Dáil to support the amendment and to have this section deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot share in Deputy Lyons' faith in the coaxable capacity of people who have taken action in this State against the State.  I do not share in any way his horror of the word &ldquo;informer&rdquo; in present circumstances, because I agree that the circumstances have entirely <Col N="1491" /> changed and that the evil odour that rightly attached to the use of that word in the past is an odour that should not attach in the circumstances to which we have now come and that it is the duty of the citizen to inform if he is aware of action that is going to be taken against the State.  I want to make that clear because I am in favour of Deputy Johnson's amendment and against this section on other grounds altogether.  I think the manner of its drafting is such as to introduce dangers for the future of a very considerable kind.</P>
      <P>The first danger that occurs, to my mind, is the power it will put into the hands of one citizen against another. If only a reasonable colour can be given to that other being made aware, or being aware, of action likely to be taken against the State, you will get not merely information in respect of treasonable offences, but you will get information in regard to people who are to be charged as informers.  You will get, that is to say, not some person informing the responsible authorities, whoever they may be, that A. B. is about to commit a treasonable offence. You might get that, but if that was all that was to be got, so far the section would have achieved its purpose, and would have kept within reasonable limits, but you will get more.  You will get a person informing the responsible authorities that A.B. was aware of other persons about to commit a treasonable offence.  It will range far more widely in its effect, according to the drafting that appears here, than the original intention had been, as I imagine that original intention to have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point that occurs to me is this: If it has been found that a certain person belonging to a committee purports to have acted on behalf of that committee in some treasonable or seditious act, at once every other member of that committee will, under this section, be brought in because they will all automatically, even though no actual conspiracy might otherwise be provable against them, come under the inference that they were privy to that man's act and did not inform.  I hardly <Col N="1492" /> think that the section was intended to have been put forward in substitution of what ought to be a charge of conspiracy, but I suggest that the actual effect of the section will be that instead of the State having placed on it the responsibility of proceeding against certain persons in respect of a conspiracy, to prove the conspiracy, it will be able to proceed against those persons under Section 2, if it be embodied in the Act, and bring them in by inference where direct proof of conspiracy might or might not be obtainable.  I think the effect of the section goes very widely indeed, far more widely than it should if it had adhered to its original intention, if it could have been so drafted as to have kept within that original intention.</P>
    <P>So far as the general idea of the section goes, I am in favour of it because I here state that I believe it is the duty of every citizen to put in the possession of the State any information that may come in his or her way in regard to action being taken against the State.  I do not think it should be the intention of any Bill, while achieving that right purpose, to go so widely as to bring within its scope purposes that should not be included but that in this section, I believe, are included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is of course, a drastic measure from beginning to end, but if there is any one thing in it more drastic than another it is perhaps this section.  We find that any person who does not disclose the fact that somebody harbours, comforts or shelters a person engaged in levying war is guilty of a serious offence and is liable to the terrible sentence that this Bill imposes.  I do not know whether the Minister considers that equitable.  I do not think that any person who really considers the mentality of the Irish people will think that they will accept that punishment as being equitable, that you are supposed to stand and watch your neighbour to see what he is doing, and if you find that he is harbouring, comforting or protecting a certain person you are to go immediately and make that fact known to the proper authorities. <Col N="1493" /> I suppose it would be rather a foolish thing for a son to go back to his mother for protection, because it is there that the authorities would be likely to look for him, but suppose it did happen that a mother thought it was right to comfort her son, is it right that a neighbour would immediately go and make that known to the proper authorities?  Is it likely that the mentality of the Irish people will accept that as equitable or just?  It may in a score of years time be possible to bring the Irish mentality round to appreciate that point of view, but does the Minister think that after the past eight years, people will accept that viewpoint that you are going to override every human law, not even in the interests of the State, but in the supposed interests of the State?  Are you going to say to the mother or father, or sister or brother: &ldquo;You are not going to comfort or succour or support your son or brother because you are A., while B. is on the hill-top watching to give information to the State?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>They are not declared to be such.  On the general <Col N="1494" /> question of the abolition of Section 2, I have really very little, if anything, to add to what I have said on this point in Committee Stage.  The section imposes upon a citizen of the State the duty to disclose particulars of any attempt to overthrow the State, and for the dereliction of that duty imposes a penalty.  Deputy Johnson said it renders the person liable to five years penal servitude.  It is, of course, just as true to say that it renders him liable to one week's imprisonment.  The maximum sentence in the section is five years' penal servitude.</P>

      <P>It is quite what I am saying, but it is what the Deputy ignored, because the Deputy pointed out that there may be varying degrees of guilt under the section, but that the person convicted under the section may be sentenced to five years' penal servitude. He may, and he may be sentenced to a fortnight, or a month, or six months, according to the judge's conception of the degree of guilt.  Deputy Figgis quite rightly admitted the duty on the part of the citizen.  He said he had no sympathy with this juggling with the words &ldquo;informer,&rdquo; and carrying on into the present situation the mentality which has its roots in an entirely different set of circumstances. He admits the duty on the part of the citizen to inform the State authorities of any impending danger to the State, or any impending menace to the State, <Col N="1495" /> of which he may have knowledge. Deputy Figgis, moving on from an admission of the duty, rather demurs to the infliction of any penalty for the dereliction of that duty.</P>

      <P>I am afraid, sir, I do not appreciate the Deputy's point. The section deals only with a person who has knowledge of a challenge, either an actual or a future challenge, to the State, and keeps that knowledge to himself, refusing to impart it to those responsible for safeguarding the State.  Now that would, of course, be a matter of fact.  It would be a question of proof before a Court.  But if the evidence can be adduced, if proof can be established, I take it that the Deputy does not demur to the imposition of the penalty.</P>

      <P>If I may be permitted, once again, I will try to make it clear.  We will now bring it down to present day conditions.  There are certain persons who belong to an organisation that lately was conspiring against the State.  They have an Executive at their head.  Now if one of these persons was taken in some act against the State, the Minister, under this section, automatically includes every one of these persons who belong to that Executive without the necessity of proving a conspiracy.  Is not that a fact?</P>

      <P>They certainly should.  The Deputy is quite right there, but the onus would be on the State to prove the knowledge.  If a prosecution were brought under this section there would certainly be the onus on the State Counsel to prove actual knowledge on the part of any and every person charged.  But, in fact, I submit to the Deputy that cases of that kind are more likely in practice to be dealt with and covered by the new section which amendment 7 on the paper is proposing to have inserted, simply on a general charge of belonging to an unauthorised military association.  I am asking the Dáil to reject Deputy Johnson's amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 4, before Section 6, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every person who takes part or assists in the formation, organisation, or maintenance of any association or other body which purports to be a military or police force, and is not established and maintained as such by law, and also every person who is a member of any such association or body, shall be guilty of a misdemeanour, and on conviction thereof shall be liable to a fine not exceeding two hundred pounds, or, at the discretion of the court, to penal servitude for any term not exceeding five years, or imprisonment with or without hard labour for any term not exceeding two years, or to both such fine and such penal servitude or imprisonment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have some information from the Minister as to the effect of this amendment and as to what it is intended to embrace.  I <Col N="1499" /> quite understand the desirability of not allowing to exist any military or police force, or any body purporting to be military or police, except the forces established by law.  To some degree, I welcome the amendment, because I foresee the consequences of the present tendencies, if worked out as they have in other countries&mdash;the formation of private detective forces and police forces, bodies purporting to be police forces, but perhaps not calling themselves such nominally, engaged in the protection of private property for the benefit of the owners, but actually engaged in other work. We have had experience at different times, more particularly in other countries&mdash;America, for instance&mdash;where private police forces have been the order of the day in industrial concerns. We have all heard of Pinkerton detectives, and I can see that the passing of this section would, to some degree, prevent the development of such forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how this will affect railway police.  It will be an offence for a railway company to appoint a policeman after this amendment becomes law.  I am sorry I do not see the Minister for Telegraphs here.  I would like to have his view of the effect of this section, because I take it it would be impossible henceforward to organise a body of people which, in fact, is a police force not appointed by the Minister, to protect a public meeting.  I do not know what weight to give to the term, &ldquo;purports to be a military or police force.&rdquo;  May a body be organised to act as military or police which does not call itself such, or is the term to be understood as being a body which does those things, whether it calls itself a police force or a military force or not?  I think we are all aware of the existence, in recent times, of organised bodies, purporting to keep order and armed to some degree&mdash;armed, at least, with batons or sticks, or knuckle-dusters or sand bags or other weapons of offence.  They will henceforward be illegal and any person&mdash;even the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or the Minister for Justice&mdash;who takes part or assists in the formation, organisation or maintenance of any such organisation, <Col N="1500" /> even though it be by a subscription to a political body which has such a force, comes under the section.  I can imagine the most recently elected member for North Dublin becoming liable to the penalty of imprisonment or penal servitude for a term not exceeding five years, if he subscribes to an organisation which organises a body purporting to be a police force, which is intended to keep the law and to enforce order at a public meeting.  I can quite see interesting developments from this section and, on the whole, I am inclined to support it, partly from the possible entertainment one would derive from the strict enforcement of this section.</P>

      <P>The statement of Deputy Johnson has opened up wide vistas as to the ramifications of this particular amendment.  There is something in the suspicions that in the past, when there was such a thing as a strike, the Farmers' Union might readily have been brought under the terms of this amendment.  It was necessary for the protection of property to organise certain people to protect property.  The Government could not do it.  Under this amendment, we would be liable to a fine of £200 and other penalties.  Would it be possible for the Minister to insert some words, so as to leave it optional with him not to prosecute when he knows the cause of those people is a good one and not leave it to the interpretation of the legal people, who are outside our control and who will necessarily go on the lines of the law as we now propose to make it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this amendment.  It follows upon the actual wording of the Constitution, by which the regulation and maintenance of armed forces is subject to the control of the Oireachtas.  This amendment is merely a consequence of that provision in the Constitution, with certain penalties attaching.  It has certainly received a wide range of interpretation at the hands of Deputy Johnson, and with that wide range I am equally in emphatic agreement, even though the result be injurious to the new body the Farmers' Union have enrolled <Col N="1501" /> for the protection of their property. In all seriousness, I think that any defence required at political meetings, or meetings of that kind, should be undertaken by State forces and not by anybody outside.  Even the regulation of ordered political meetings should be undertaken by State forces. The regulation of order by outside forces might easily develop into the regulation of disorder.  If one political party is at liberty to organise a pseudo police force to keep order on its behalf, another party will claim to be equally entitled to organise a similar body to keep order.  These two bodies might interpret differently the meaning of &ldquo;right order&rdquo; in respect of their own adherents, and the regulation of order might become, in course of time, the regulation of disorder.  I am reminded, by a conversation which I have just overheard, that if this amendment be adopted, without change in any other place, one development that has been seen in other countries will become impossible in this country&mdash;that is, the development of Fascism.</P>

      <P>I would like to know from the Minister what the position would be if a state of affairs occurred such as was experienced during a labour strike in Waterford some time ago.  At that time, upwards of 100 farmsteads were burned out and neither the military nor the police forces of the State were able to afford the farmers in that area the protection that was necessary.  The rural residents there took upon themselves the organisation and protection of their own homes, and, in a crude way, organised a sort of police force.  What position would members of such an organisation find themselves in in the future if such a state of affairs were to recur?  I hope there will be no recurrence of such trouble, but there is a possibility that it might occur again, and I would like to hear the Minister's view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Baxter's question raises another question.  By this new provision, the right is denied to any labour organisation to use their forces in picketing during a time of strike.  If you extend facilities to the Farmers' Union for the establishment <Col N="1502" /> of a police force, you must give the same facilities to the Labour Union.  I would like to know whether the provision which is to be added to the Bill will apply to detectives employed by large firms in the cities and towns to protect their property.  They are really a police force, employed by these firms to protect them against robbery.  If this provision be inserted, those firms and the men employed as detectives will be liable to the penalties set out in the Bill.  The amendment is too wide altogether.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice said, during the elections, that allowance had been made in the Bill to enable Deputies to remove some clauses.  In my opinion, the amendments made during the early stages of the Bill are now coming back to us in different words.  No improvements have been made in the Bill at all. The Bill will go through in the identical form in which it was introduced. I would urge upon the Minister that traders and manufacturers should be permitted to have their own detective and police forces.  That does not mean that I accuse the people of this country of being robbers, but there is a lot of people who came into the country for no other purpose than robbery, and these precautions are necessary.  I think that there should be an alteration made in the measure to facilitate the Labour movement and the Farmers' Union and to enable traders and business men to employ their own detectives to protect their property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the general enthusiasm for the amendment, I need not say very much, beyond dealing with one or two points which have been raised about private persons taking steps to protect their own property. Deputies know that the ordinary unofficial citizen has substantial power for the protection of his person or his property. I suppose it is scarcely expected that I would seek to give a lecture on that matter.  Deputies know, for instance, that a man, in defence of his house, may assault a person who breaks and enters, and may arrest him and, in the last resort, may kill him.  Equally, Deputies know that, in respect of certain offences, the civilian&mdash;the unofficial person&mdash;has powers of arrest. <Col N="1503" /> Action taken by the individual, or action taken by individuals in combination, for the defence of their property, does not constitute the &ldquo;formation, organisation or maintenance&rdquo; of a police force.</P>
      <P>The meaning of this section is.  I hope, plain enough.  It is to prohibit and proscribe unlawful, unauthorised military associations, and to make membership of any such associations an offence in itself, so that if membership can be proved, if evidence can be adduced showing that a person is a member of an unauthorised military association, or for that matter an unauthorised police force, that is an offence for which the court can impose a penalty.  It is a section, like so many other sections in the Bill, like all the sections for that matter, for defending and protecting the ordinary citizen who cannot shoot, or who does not want to shoot, restricting the right to interfere with him to the authorised State forces.  Any interference with his liberty, any menace to his personal rights can be prohibited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out in dealing with one of the amendments in Committee that the right of the State to give protection to its citizens goes just a little further than merely intervening to ward off actual physical onslaught, actual physical danger, that it goes at any rate to the point that it is the duty of the State, in so far as it can humanly effect it, to see that citizens are not constrained to live their lives in fear, that there is no constant menace preying on them or worrying them, and an unauthorised, subterranean military organisation would unquestionably be such a menace.  If, as was sought to be effected in Committee, men could go cut openly through the country, drill and parade as an army, acknowledging no responsibility to the Government and, through the Government, to the Dáil and the people, that would be a state of affairs which ordinary people as taxpayers and citizens would be entitled to resent. It would be a menace and challenge, and they would live their lives in fear.  We want to create the feeling in the country that the organised <Col N="1504" /> military and police forces are absolutely responsible to and controlled by a Government which answers daily to the people and that there shall be no other organised military or police force.  We want also to make it quite clear to all the citizens that this State stands of its own strength and not by grace or by permission of any minority within its borders, not by the fact that citizen &ldquo;A&rdquo; is managing to keep his temper, but of its own strength and of the strength of the majority of the people who uphold it.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say whether he has considered the necessity, the desirability at least, before this Bill becomes law, of defining in some way the term &ldquo;military force.&rdquo;  The question was raised on Section 6, and I think he will see that it becomes more important that the term &ldquo;military or police force&rdquo; should be defined in some way, otherwise you may have a body which has a form of organisation copying a military organisation, but having no purpose except physical exercises.  Under Section 6 the Minister is entitled to give permission for such drill to take place, but under this section, unless the term &ldquo;military force&rdquo; is defined, any person will not be able to form such a body, even though he may get the permission of the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1505" /> I do not know whether the Minister will save me some trouble by saying that he proposes to accept this amendment. Perhaps not, because on the last day we were discussing this section we had a definite challenge from the Minister to table an amendment or a resolution which would raise the whole question of the existence of secret societies in the Saorstát.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I make the suggestion that whoever the expert is in the Dáil on secret societies, whoever has the biggest dossier, whoever knows most about these things, should put down a resolution to the effect that the prohibition which applies to members of the Army and members of the police forces, should be extended to embrace all State employees if you like, members of the Civil Service and members of the judiciary, or, better still, to embrace all citizens of Saorstát Eireann, and there can be full discussion and all the dreadful facts can be hauled out into the daylight...</P>
    <P>At another moment in the same discussion the Minister said that he was quite prepared to leave this matter to an open vote of the Dáil.  I am not an expert on secret societies.  I do not know any of the horrible things that have been said about secret societies and their active influence upon the State or upon the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>I do know that secret societies have existed, and have been instrumental in bringing about, sometimes very disastrous, and sometimes in other minds, very beneficial changes in the law and government of the country.  The Minister himself has been a most eloquent and persuasive opponent and critic of secret societies.  He has attempted in several Bills to bring secret societies into disrepute. Undoubtedly a very great majority of the public is opposed to the existence in the State of secret societies. I suppose if it were possible, assuming that this amendment is not acceptable to the majority of the Dáil or the Seanad, to refer the Bill as it passes the Dáil to the country for a plebiscite or referendum, or if it were possible to <Col N="1506" /> refer this particular proposal to make secret societies illegal, then I think we should have an overwhelming vote in favour of that prohibition.</P>
    <P>I do not want to discuss the merits of any particular class of secret society.  There may be some societies or bodies which have been popularly called secret, believed to be secret, which the Minister suggested on the last occasion were not in fact secret, or may not in fact be secret, but we have had presented to us by the Minister himself a definition, and it may be that some of these organisations popularly called secret, would not come within this definition and therefore will not be affected by the section if it is amended as I desire it to be.  The prohibition then will be against the existence of societies coming under this definition.  That is to say:</P>
    <P>The expression &ldquo;secret society&rdquo; means an association, society, or other body the members of which are required by the regulations thereof to take or enter into, or do in fact take or enter into, an oath, affirmation or declaration not to disclose the proceedings or some part of the proceedings of the association, society or body.</P>
    <P>Of course the definition was amended during the Committee Stage.  It is much more definite now and the words &ldquo;entering into an undertaking&rdquo; have been deleted and it is quite clear now that before a society or an association would be called a secret society the members are required to take an oath of affirmation or declaration.  I think it is quite unanswerable to say that quite nine-tenths of the people of the country would favour prohibition, shall I say, the illegalising of secret societies.  I am not going to pretend that it will prove that no longer secret societies shall exist.  The kind of secret society that has been active in political affairs has been of a kind in which the members quite clearly and deliberately went into illegal activities knowing when they were taking upon themselves these activities they were doing illegal things and were prepared to take the risks.  Although this amendment may be carried, and although we may make secret societies illegal, it will not prevent <Col N="1507" /> the existence of secret societies, provided there are sufficient people who believe that a certain cause must be carried through and that it can only be carried through by the aid of secrecy.  If there are such, and if they are prepared to take the consequences no enactment of this kind will prevent them.  We would, however, be making it known that in the view of the lawmakers secret societies ought not to exist in the country, and that they are in fact illegal bodies.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary&mdash;I doubt whether it is desirable, and certainly it would not go any distance towards attaining my end, which is quite a serious one&mdash;if we were to try to bring to the notice of the Dáil proofs of the malignant activities of secret societies.  On the last occasion the Minister rather suggested that it was necessary to prove that secret societies had in fact been committing acts which were to the disadvantage and which were detrimental to the best interests of the country before you could legislate against their existence.  There is a good deal to be said for that, but there ought to be some general understanding that men are free to act provided they are not committing acts that are detrimental.  Without endeavouring to bring definite proofs in regard to any particular society, or any particular class of society, we have it on the testimony of the Minister that secret societies have been organised to do acts which were detrimental to the stability of the State.  I would say that it should be accepted more or less as a proof that the purposes and intentions of the body were dark and evil if they thought it necessary to make affirmations, take oaths or make declarations binding members not to disclose the proceedings.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is stretching the powers of the legislature or going beyond what the canons of liberty would lay down to say that a secret society ought not to be allowed to exist, because it is a fair assumption that the fact of secrecy implies dark deeds. Whether that is actually the fact or not, we are now faced with this general belief.  As I argued on a previous occasion, <Col N="1508" /> the existence of a very widespread belief that secret societies exist, and that the oaths and affirmations which the members of these societies take are held in greater veneration and reverence than the oath of loyalty to the State service or their obligations as citizens is sufficient to damage very considerably the stability of the State, because of the fact that confidence in public administration is shaken.  I think there is no Deputy who will not agree that there is a cynical kind of attitude amongst men very generally, that so-and-so is all right; he is a member of such-and-such an organisation. His friends are going to look after him, they are bound to look after him.  The existence of that state of mind, very widespread, is detrimental, and I believe there is no Deputy in the House, or at least very few, who will assent to the proposition that an oath taken secretly&mdash;the terms of which may not be known, and the persons who take it are also not known&mdash;is liable to be held in much higher regard perhaps out of fear than from the ordinary sense of obligation that every citizen is entitled to hold towards the State.  The effect of the amendment, if it were carried, would mean that the section would read as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Every person who shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  form, organise, promote or maintain any secret society, or</P>
    <P>(b)  attempt to form, organise, promote or maintain any such secret society, or</P>
    <P>(c)  take part, assist, or be concerned in any way in the formation, organisation, promotion, management, or maintenance of any such society,</P>
    <P>and so on</P>
    <P>shall be guilty of a misdemeanour.</P>
    <P>The secret society is then defined in the terms which the Minister himself has set before us.  On the last occasion when this matter was under discussion the form of the amendment was challenged by the Minister on the grounds that it attempted to make it penal for judges and civil servants to enter a secret society, because judges and civil servants had not, up to date, been prohibited from being members of a secret society.  The Minister's <Col N="1509" /> view on that matter prevailed.  As I have said, he then challenged Deputies that the matter should be brought forward in such a form as would embrace every citizen; not merely judges and civil servants, but that we should take the sense of the House on the question whether secret societies should be allowed to exist, and whether any citizen, judge or otherwise, civil servant or non-civil servant, should be allowed to be a member of a secret society.  The amendment that I am moving takes up that challenge.  I want to remind the Minister and the Dáil that this is to be an open question, and that every Deputy is free, according to the Minister's promise, to vote on this issue as his personal judgment would dictate.  I, therefore, move my amendment, and ask that it shall be taken by the country as a definite decision of the Dáil that, so far as we are concerned at any rate, we desire to make secret societies illegal bodies in the Saorstát.</P>

I said that this was a matter which I was prepared to discuss, but I wanted to hear a case: I wanted an expert with the biggest dossier to come to the Dáil with a resolution and establish his case for this further restriction, or this extension of an existing restriction.  Deputy Johnson has made no case.  I have attempted to keep in mind throughout this Bill that it is a Bill for the protection of the State, and that it is a Bill to define certain offences as treasonable and to impose penalties for such offences. It is not mere social legislation, The Deputy and other Deputies may be quite right in their view that secret societies, in general, are an unhealthy factor in the State; but this is a Treason Bill, not mere social legislation, and keeping that in mind I have contented myself simply with providing penalties for any person who shall attempt to form within the army or within the police forces secret societies, bearing in mind that members of the army and of the police forces, under the Acts regulating their organisation, already take <Col N="1510" /> a declaration against membership of any such societies.  There was a question of extending that prohibition to the judiciary and the civil service.  I did not criticise that proposal on the ground that it was outside the scope of a Treason Bill.  I did not criticise that proposal on the ground that we were considering a measure for the defence and the preservation of the State, and that such an amendment was scarcely in keeping with the general picture, but I asked the Deputy moving it to show that there was some case, some abuse, some general state of affairs calling for the extension of the prohibition beyond the two disciplined bodies to which it applies, beyond the army and beyond the police.  Now, despite the considerable cry we have had, or had some time back, no attempt whatever was made to show that, and the Dáil, apparently satisfied that no sufficient case was established, rejected the amendment. Deputy Johnson proposes now a general prohibition embracing all members of a secret society.  The A.O.H.&mdash;</P>

      <P>And the Railway Clerks' Association and other bodies. Seriously, if the Deputy wants to discuss the general question whether social legislation should be introduced to prohibit absolutely for all citizens membership of secret organisations, then he should do that.  He can do that by means of a resolution, or by means of a Private Bill prepared possibly in collaboration with Deputy Esmonde, but it scarcely comes within the scope of a Bill like this, a Treason Bill, to <Col N="1511" /> take that broad range and say, generally, that you intend to impose a prohibition on all citizens against belonging to any body that takes an oath or a declaration that they will keep their proceedings, or any part of their proceedings, private.  You can scarcely claim that in doing that it was of a piece with the Treason Bill, that the safety and preservation of the State demanded it, and that you were justified because of your concern for the preservation of the State fabric in imposing these restrictions.  The Deputy himself, I imagine, agrees that it would be simply social legislation.  He might argue that these things are bad and unhealthy in the body politic, that we would be better off without them, and that there is a case for prohibiting them, just as he might argue for some other piece of social legislation.  But he has not argued, and he will scarcely argue, that the amendment he has proposed is of a piece with the Treason Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not any evidence in my dossier.  Just as you say, you can take the broader range suggested by Deputy Johnson, and say to all your citizens that this is something so evil, or containing possibilities of evil, that you prohibit them by law from being members of such societies. A Treason Bill is not the place to do that.  If we want to introduce legislation prohibiting secret societies of any kind then social legislation should be brought in and brought in in the form of a separate Bill from this.  You are <Col N="1513" /> going wider than the range of simply protecting and preserving the State fabric and the challenge, as Deputy Johnson choose to call it, stands.  I do not accept at all that it is rightly lifted on this particular measure.  But if the Deputy thinks that we here ought to have social legislation, and that abuses exist that warrant or call for prohibiting absolutely secret societies in the State, and prohibiting every citizen in the State from membership of such societies, then he should do more than introduce a mere amendment on the Report Stage of a Treason Bill.  He should bring in a private Bill with the assistance of Deputy Esmonde and thrash the whole matter out.  I am not accepting this amendment.  I take it that the Deputy will have no objection to amendment No. 9 being taken with this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is consequential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister rightly claimed to-day, as he did on a previous occasion, that this was a Bill for the protection and preservation of the State and that consequently he felt bound, with the knowledge which he had at his disposal, as well as from personal experience, to include in this Bill, a barrier against membership of secret societies by members of the army and police force.  Now I am not in a position to name societies in this House which are, or which are alleged to be, secret, or whose members are called upon to take an oath or affirmation or declaration, but it is fairly well known to the public generally that there are organisations in this country whose members either take an oath or affirmation or declaration and whose membership it would be no exaggeration to say extends to 250,000 or thereabouts.  If secret societies are considered undesirable associations and institutions for soldiers or policemen to be associated with, simply because the Minister responsible, or the head of the police, or the army, cannot find out what they are doing inside these bodies, surely the same argument applies, with a certain amount of truth and justice, to all other State employees, if not to the citizens as a body.  The Minister issues <Col N="1514" /> a challenge or an invitation, very graciously, but in such a form that makes it impossible for any man to come to this House and prove the things he asks to be proved.  He himself, as I said on the previous occasion, admitted in this House that he was a member of a secret organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy say, had been a member?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, that he had been a member of a secret society. Evidently, as far as one can judge, and to be generous to the Minister, he now seeks to secure power through the Treason Bill to see that that organisation of which he had been a member will no longer exist, or that soldiers, or policemen, can no longer be associated with such an organisation.  That is because he himself believes from his own experience, as a member, that that secret organisation and every such organisation is bad and demoralising for the individual, and dangerous to the State. The Minister, on his own admission, makes a case for the extension of this principle to other State employees.  We are told on political platforms, especially during the period of elections, that the plain people are the people who rule this country.  If you have 250,000 privileged people who will be tolerated to go into meeting-places unknown&mdash;some of them may be known&mdash;and go behind closed and barred doors, and carry on certain discussions and decide and determine certain things, which may or may not menace the existence of the Government, or the State as a whole, surely the Government of the country is not secure and is not in the hands of the plain people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson referred to the suspicion aroused in the minds of plain people who do not belong to secret societies because of the powers, activities and responsibilities of those associated with such societies.  I have been working in a circle where the influence of a society supposed to be secret, or a society of secrets, as it has been described, has been powerful.  We hear it said, with what truth I do not know, that because so-and-so is a member of the inner circle of this alleged secret society he will not, because of <Col N="1515" /> his ability, knowledge or experience, find himself eventually at the top of the ladder, and if he has to fall he will not fall with the same effect as other people who have sinned.  That position exists in most of the big public concerns as well as in the Civil Service. If you have 1,000 employees in a certain department of State, and if the head of that department, on his own admission and because of his public advertisements outside, belongs to that secret organisation, it is rightly presumed that when promotion comes along for the under-dog he will favour a man belonging to his own organisation. That is human nature after all, but it creates distrust in the minds of ambitious and conscientious public servants, and it tends to destroy the efficiency of the public service by reason of its existence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently it does not revolve as smoothly as the Railways Bill so far as the mind of the Minister is concerned.  On the last occasion on which this Bill was discussed the Minister, as reported officially, said:&mdash;&ldquo;I make the suggestion that whoever the expert is in the Dáil on secret societies, whoever has the biggest dossier, whoever knows most about these things, should put down a resolution to the effect that the prohibition which applies to members of the Army and members of the police forces, should be extended to embrace all State employees if you like, members of the Civil Service and members of the judiciary, or, better still, to embrace all citizens of Saorstát Eireann, and there can be full discussion, and all the dreadful facts can be hauled out into the daylight, or into the lamplight, but, at any rate, can be hauled out and discussed and analysed.&rdquo;  I think that invitation, coming from the Minister, can be accepted by the Minister himself in so far as he from his experience would be most likely to hold the biggest dossier containing all those things which he demands from members of the Dáil. He has at his disposal, in addition to that experience, the secret agents of <Col N="1516" /> his own Government, for whom this House has to pay £35,000, which was voted last year for the secret service. I am not quite clear as to the duties of the secret service agents of the Government, or whether they are limited in their every-day work to any particular class of work, but the Minister has the benefit of their experience, and the files are available at Government Buildings, but they are not at the disposal of members of this House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde may be an expert on this question, and I am sorry he is absent; but he asked the Minister if a resolution of that kind was brought in on the invitation of the Minister, would there be a free vote of the House.  The Minister graciously said, &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;  Deputy Johnson accepted the challenge, and it will be regrettable if more members come in to vote as a result of this discussion than are listening to this discussion now or who listened to it on a previous occasion. The unfortunate fact is that when the division bell rings Deputies spring from nowhere and come in and vote on things about which they know nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>No; when the Minister speaks.  There is one thing I would like to know.  If the Minister is unwilling to accept this amendment, is he prepared to hold over the further stages of this Bill until the resolution has been brought in, which he invites some member to bring in, and will he have it discussed and allow a free vote of the House upon it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is so urgent that in principle it debars members of secret societies as being undesirable.  I do not think that it would be outside the scope of this Bill, seeing that it seeks to do these things, to have that principle extended to other employees of the State and the citizens at large. Whether the Minister agrees to do that now or at a later stage, there is one <Col N="1517" /> thing evident, and that is, that until the Irish people so instruct their representatives to declare as illegal institutions which have to rely on their business being conducted in private behind the backs of the people, the citizens will never be the free people they are told they are at election times.  Secret organisations are supposed to be, on the one hand, patriotic if they stand for the achievement of some great national object; or, on the other hand, they may stand for the achievement of some selfish motive.  If the people associated with these organisations are members of them because they seek to achieve some object which is in the national interest as a whole, or if their objects are purely charitable, why should they not be prepared to come out in the daylight and let the public at large know the great patriotic and charitable work they are performing?  The Minister stated in effect that he is unwilling to hold up the further stages of this Bill until a resolution such as he demands comes along.  May I put a further question: Is he prepared, if such a resolution is brought in in the near future, to allow Government time for its free discussion?  And will he do so, if not before, immediately after the Easter Recess?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I do not know what Deputies behind the Minister <Col N="1518" /> may be feeling, or what they would like to do if they got the chance; but the Minister himself, I believe, has inserted this clause largely because of the experience he and the country have gained from the dangers in the army, the police forces, or in the State of secret organisations, over which the Dáil, or the people as a whole, would not have control.  In his Treason Bill he has prohibited the existence of these societies in the army or police forces. He says that such organisations or societies are a danger to the State.  Can the Minister conceive a situation where the secret organisations might exist, and while not really existing in the army or the police forces, might have very many sympathisers in the army or police forces, or in the Civil Service? Is he prepared to admit that none of those who a very short time ago were supposed to be members of a secret organisation were not members of the civil population and were not in the army?  I think it is generally recognised that the secret organisations that have existed in the past included not only military men, as we might understand them, but men who are amongst the civil population.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, perhaps civil servants included.  The Minister thinks that was a danger in the past, and he is trying to a certain extent to rectify it, but he is not going all the way, and why not?  If things were wrong six months ago, and certain organisations were a danger, what about the future? I certainly feel that there is every justification for Deputy Johnson's amendment. After all, as Deputy Gorey stated on the last day, when a thing is not good enough to come out in the light of day and bloom in the open air, there must be some reason for keeping it concealed behind closed doors.  We have, perhaps, two or three secret organisations in the country, and we do not know how many more we may have in the future.  It is all right for the Minister to say that it is only in the army or the police forces that these secret organisations are a danger.  You can inculcate a spirit among the civil population through the medium of secret <Col N="1519" /> organisations that might be as great, and perhaps a greater, menace to the State at times than a secret organisation within the military or police forces.  If the Minister thinks it is right to permit secret organisations to exist, and to continue to work regardless of what ends they seek to achieve, and that the Deputies feel that there is no danger to the State from them, that perhaps they are an asset to the State, the Dáil will, I suppose, support the Minister in his attitude to this amendment. But I think that an action like that on the part of Deputies will make the country feel that the influences of <Col N="1520" /> secret organisations are so strong in this State that they dominate the actions of Deputies in the Dáil who declare by their votes that they are afraid to say that secret societies ought to be interfered with, that no inquiries ought to be made about their status, rules or anything else, and that they are prepared to let them run their way. That is not an attitude I am prepared to take up.  I think the Minister should leave the Deputies behind him to their own free wills and consciences to do what they think is best in this matter.</P>

      <P>On the main question I suppose there will be a certain number of Deputies in the House who will have compared the Bill as originally introduced with the Bill that has now reached its Fourth Stage.  I am reminded of the story of a certain young man who was introduced, from a distance, in the garish lights of a music-hall, to a lady handsome and beautiful, as he thought.  He was captivated by her appearance and before he knew where he was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, and glass eyes. He found, too, that her beautiful bust had been padded.  When all the appurtenances thereof had been removed, he had a different impression.  The same applies to this Bill, and one can observe all that has been removed from it as compared with what it contained when introduced.  The young man of my story was quite prepared to go before his friends, though he was a modest man, and boast and brag about his lady.  I do not know whether he was prepared to boast and brag about her after he had seen her dismantled.  Similarly, I do not know whether the Minister is prepared to boast and brag about this Bill now.  What Bill is it that he is prepared to boast and brag about?  Is it <Col N="1522" /> the original Bill, or the new Bill that he is prepared to brag about?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Many of the teeth have gone; a wooden leg replaces the original one.  Considering that the Minister was prepared to boast and brag about the original Bill, I have no doubt that he looks with sorrow at the decapitated, trunkless, and heartless residue.  The Minister, notwithstanding all his bragging, has brought in a Bill which is unnecessary.  I do not think anyone will accuse the Minister of being possessed of liberal ideas in respect to legislation affecting personal liberty.  I think that, by the way we are moving, we shall see the Minister leading a body of public opinion back to pre-Victorian years, or at least back into the Bismarckian era.  We shall probably see the Minister aiming at being a budding Bismarck, with his views as to the relations of the State and the individual&mdash;that loyalty to the State and good citizenship are going to be induced by repressive legislation, and that what one has to do is to make an offence and to make the punishment heavy enough and thereby you will produce good citizens.</P>
      <P>It seems to me the Minister's mind is moving very rapidly in the direction that you have to legislate and invent offences, making the punishment heavy enough, and with very little further procedure, such as education and public influences, you will be expected to produce good citizens.  We have had very definite evidence in this Bill that that is the mind of the Minister and that he is seeking to bring about a state of loyalty and good citizenship by the mere passing of repressive legislattion. I think that is a wrong conception. It is a very bad proceeding to endeavour to bring forward legislation of this particular character at a time when there is a receding wave of excitement, ill-will and bad blood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe there is any necessity for the Bill.  I have said that from the beginning, and the Minister reminded me to-day of having said it before.  It is quite unnecessary.  The mind of the Minister evidently was looking back to the early years of the <Col N="1523" /> 19th century, and it is with great doubt and hesitation that he has been able to get away from that state of mind. Under his guidance, as I see it, we are likely to get back to that stage when the country will feel bound to go through the regular processes of political agitation, social and political combinations, criticisms of the powers that be, denunciations of the powers that be, conspiracies against the powers that be, repressions and revolutions, and then we shall perhaps arrive after a series of such actions on the public mind at a stage perhaps of the Ireland or the England of 1914.  I look with sorrow upon that prospect.  We all hoped a few years ago that we would be entering upon a period of personal and social liberty and that kind of acknowledgment of social obligations that would be induced not by repression, not by fear, but by actual positive loyalty and love for the country and the organisation of the country.  I think that we are entering upon a downward, retrogressive path, and I am sorry to think that the Minister is acting as the leader and the spokesman of that group of politicians, that body of opinion, which is looking in that direction.  Of course it is all done to save the State; it is all done in the public interest.  I have no doubt of the sincerity, not the slightest, but I am persuaded from all the evidence that the direction of the Minister's mind, and the minds of those who were content to support him, is to produce a kind of Tory Junkerism, a kind of Prussianism, Bismarckianism in this country which conceives that the State is something above, beyond, and independent of the citizens, and that loyalty to that State is going to be induced by repression and the fear of punishment. That, I think, explains this Bill.  As a consequence of that view, and because I believe that the Bill in its general tendency gives form to that state of mind, I am asking the House to oppose this reading of the Bill.</P>

      <P>After the very able analysis of my point of view which Deputy Johnson has inflicted on <Col N="1524" /> the Dáil, it would be rather superfluous for me to add very much.  I will not attempt to analyse&mdash;it would be a considerable task to analyse&mdash;the Deputy's point of view.  Perhaps the word &ldquo;point&rdquo; scarcely applies at all in connection with the Deputy&mdash;his circuit of view, I should say.  He approaches Bills of this kind with just a vague feeling that he has a sacred and indefeasible right to be at all times and in all circumstances treasonable, and that it is in jeopardy, and that a protest from him would be becoming.  He makes a protest in a formal, mechanical way like a man talking in his sleep or a gramophone record turned on&mdash;&ldquo;Let me see the Treason Bill; what should I say in connection with this? Well, I should denounce the Minister. It is always a good principle and a safe thing to denounce the Minister.&rdquo;  We have been for three years performing the function of drawing the lightning, so to speak.  We have been passing legislation that is necessary, sound and advisable, in the interests of the State, and the people of the State, and when we have drawn all the lightning, stood up to all the abuse, borne all the taunts, all the jibes of Prussianism and Junkerdom, and all the rest of it, there and then Deputy Johnson, Deputy Gorey, Deputy Figgis or some other Deputy will come along and will rule in peace, piously, justly and freely, without doing anything so terrible as introducing a Bill declaring certain offences treasonable and imposing penalties for these offences.</P>
      <P>I am not a betting man, but I will take long odds, or short odds, that there is one thing that Deputies will not do when they come into office.  They will not repeal this Bill and trust simply to the good-will of the citizens to avoid bashing the State.  Not one of the Deputies, not even Deputy Johnson, will do that.  He will just let well enough alone.  &ldquo;It is a very good thing it was done, but it is a very good thing also that it was that ruffian so-and-so who did it.&rdquo;  Now the Bill that was introduced in the Dáil was a good Bill.  This is a better Bill.</P>

    <Title>LAND BOND BILL, 1925&mdash;SECOND STAGE.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill, as I stated on the First Reading, is mainly to enable us to avail of the proffered guarantee by the British Government of the bonds to be issued under the Land Bill of 1923.  I do not know whether it is necessary to dilate on the advantages of having these bonds guaranteed.  There will be an issue of something like £30,000,000 of Land Bonds bearing a rate of interest of 4½ per cent.  Those bonds will be in process of issue over a number of years. If we were not to have this guarantee and the bonds were to be backed solely by the credit of this State, I have no doubt that in the circumstances they would sink to a very considerable discount. The result of one particular issue of ours sinking to a considerable discount would be that our National Loan would be dragged down, and would stand at a price very much below the price at which it stands at present.  The price at which the National Loan might stand at any particular moment is regulated almost automatically by the issue price of any further National Loan.  So that I have no doubt at all that failure to avail of this British guarantee would result in our paying considerably increased sums in interest for any borrowings that we may have to make.  No point of principle is involved; it simply puts the fag-end of land purchase on the same plane as the main portion.  We undertake no responsibility in connection with the matter to which there can be any objection.  We undertake to make this a charge on the Central Fund, giving priority over any other charges that did not previously exist to the repayment of any sum that may have to be paid out of the British Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of this particular matter dates back to before the establishment <Col N="1528" /> of this State.  When the Act of 1920 was being passed, certain pledges were given by the British Government with regard to land purchase.  Ever since that time they have in various forms undertaken that they would guarantee or assist any issue of bonds that might be necessary for the completion of land purchase.  It is, I suppose, certain that the British Government's interest in doing that was the interest of the landlords who are being bought out.  There is no doubt that the guarantee will be of great advantage to those whose lands have been bought under the Act of 1923.  It will mean that their bonds can be put on the market and can raise a price considerably greater than any price they could get without this guarantee.  But it means that not merely the landlords will benefit, but other people who had charges on lands and who would be paid off, not in cash, but in bonds, will be able to get on the market by sale substantial sums which they would not get if there were no British guarantee.  There will be a benefit on our own borrowings.  I might say that bonds issued to the extent of £30,000,000 without any British guarantee would be very largely confined to the Irish stock market, or would tend to come into the Irish market to a very large degree, and would lead to the absorption of loose capital available for investment to an extent that might have a very deleterious effect on industrial development here.  You would have stock without a Government guarantee getting a fair rate of interest, having regard to the discount at which the bonds would be sold.  Money available for investment would tend more and more to go into this stock, and would not be available for industrial activity of various kinds.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the Dáil provides specifically that payment of principal and interest shall be made in British currency.  Deputies will see at once that that is an arrangement which must of necessity exist if the British Government are to guarantee the bonds.  I have little doubt that very long before the eighty years over which these bonds will be in process of redemption we will have a national currency, but it would be impossible for any guarantee to be given in terms of a currency that <Col N="1529" /> does not exist.  When we come to have a Free State pound, or dollar or franc, or whatever we might decide on having, the value of the pound that we adopt might be considerably less or greater than that of the British pound. At any rate it might be different at times from the British pound.  It would mean then if it were not specifically laid down that these bonds were issued and were repayable in terms of British currency the British guarantee might easily be a snare and a delusion for people who buy bonds.  One of the values of it is that people know exactly what they are to get in interest, and they will be able to realise according to the interest that they will get.</P>
    <P>There are various minor points in the Bill which I do not think I need deal with at the present stage.  We have made specific arrangements for redeeming the entire bond issue within a period of eighty years, and certain small adjustments are being made in regard to interest and Sinking Fund. They are minor matters.  The main provision in the Bill is that which enables us to take advantage of the offer of the British Government.  I do not know what arguments may be put up against it, but I think that there can be no substantial argument against our agreeing in the first instance when we are issuing bonds to charge against the Central Fund the payments that have to be made in connection with these bonds; and, secondly, if the guaranteeing party is to make any payment on our behalf that we should charge against the Central Fund any amount that should be necessary to repay the sums that they may pay on our behalf, and to repay them at a rate of interest which may be fixed or, in default of being fixed by agreement, at a rate of five per cent. per annum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamSears" hpid="Mr. SEARS Mr. SEARS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in supporting this Bill, because it proposes to make better provision for the finances of the principal Act, and that Act was rightly regarded by most of the people concerned with land in Ireland as a very satisfactory, just and far-reaching measure.  I believe, also, the finance of the principal Act was very good business.  A fundamental feature of the Act, as a whole, is that <Col N="1530" /> it is very sound business.  If a man working a business of his own found that he could employ not alone his own capital but some of his neighbour's in the working of his business he would regard it as a wonderful boon.  There is no business man in the world but would accept and welcome it.  We are doing something like that.  The Bill is also good business on account of the terms it gives.  We are in a very good position to see whether those terms are good or bad.</P>
      <P>Since the Act was passed our neighbours in the Six Counties have introduced a similar Act, and we can compare their terms with those of our Act. They say they are the richest part of this island and can draw more easily on the capital of their wealthy neighbour than we can.  If we do as well as they, we are doing very well.  As a matter of fact, we are doing a great deal better than they are, from the point of view of the tenant and of the State, and we are not doing too badly for the landlord either.  The tenant of one class under the Act, which we are supporting in this Bill, only pays 13 years' purchase; in the other class he pays 15 years' purchase.  When we compare the Northern Bill, we find that for the first class of tenant mentioned the average number of years purchase is 17½, and for the second class 19½.  The tenant that buys in the Six Counties, when he compares his position with the position of the tenant in the Free State, is not satisfied.  He has raised a considerable agitation in the Six Counties and has given an amount of trouble, and has a great deal of reason for his agitation.  The tenants both in the Six Counties and in the Free State are roughly divided into two classes.  If you take those who purchased before August, 1911, and those who purchased since August, 1911, and compare them, you find that the Bill in the Six Counties proposes a reduction of only 3/3 to 4/- in the pound, while similar tenants in the Free State enjoy a reduction of 7/- in the pound.</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling, but I am trying to show that the finance is sound and that it is good business for the State.  It is good for the tenant, the State and the landlord, because owing to the guarantee of British security for the bonds, the Free State is in a position to give terms a little better.  The three classes concerned in this Bill are being dealt with as advantageously as it is possible to deal with them while giving fair play to all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astonished to hear Deputy Sears.  I thought that he would have been tempted, of all men, to oppose this Bill.  I was really surprised to find that he was the first member of the House to praise it, and to justify it on the ground that the Land Act is a good one.  The Land Act is an Act, and we are not called upon to amend it, by Sections 1 or 2 at any rate.  The Land Act is the law and the landlords are getting the advantage of the law as laid down in the Land Act. Why paint the lily?  They ought to be satisfied with the Land Act, surely. Why come along now and offer them further security?  Why are we asked to come along and say to them: &ldquo;You have done very well, but we are going to make you a further present; we are going to ensure that not only will you receive the stock and bonds created under the Bill, which you have accepted, but we are going to add to the guarantee of those bonds by placing ourselves under an obligation to another State&mdash;all in the interests of the landlords.&rdquo;  That surprises me when it comes from Deputy Sears.  Perhaps I am going a little too far in saying it was all in the interests of the landlords. The Minister for Finance has pointed out, and Deputy Sears supported his contention, that it is good business and that it will enable obligations the State may enter into to be entered into on more advantageous terms.  Looked at from a purely financial point of view, I think that is quite sound.  I dare say it would be possible to float the next loan with the guarantee of another State on terms which would be better perhaps than we could ourselves give.  But when you consent, by a deliberate Act of the <Col N="1532" /> Legislature, to enter into an agreement that another State should guarantee your debts, that is a palpable and definite invitation to that other State to make quite sure that the finances, the economy, the Government of this State shall conform to their desire&mdash;that it shall not take risks of which they do not approve for fear of lowering our credit or hindering our capacity to meet our obligations.</P>
      <P>That is the proposition in this Bill&mdash; that we should not merely consent, but invite the British Government to back our bills, to guarantee our creditors that we will pay our debts.  The argument runs that there was a kind of obligation entered into at the time of the introduction of the Government of Ireland Act of 1920.  The Minister who used that statement in support of his argument, on two or three occasions within the last two or three weeks, emphasised the necessity for recognising the continuity of this Dáil with the Dáil established in 1919. Now it appears that we are to recognise certain obligations that were entered into by private persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Government could promise any holder of Chinese stock that it would guarantee Chinese stock and the Chinese Government could not interfere.  We, no doubt, would be quite powerless and helpless in the same event.  We might put in a formal protest, but we would have no remedy against the British Government promising to pay any debts we failed to pay our creditors. They might do that and we could not prevent them.  We might say that they had no right to interfere in our affairs, but we could not prevent them.  As between the British Government and the holders of that stock&mdash;the landlords were the first recipients&mdash;that would be a contract between those two elements.  But they entered into that contract on condition that we did something.  We are now asked to do <Col N="1533" /> that something&mdash;to make it more satisfactory for the British Government to enter into this obligation with the recipients of land bonds.</P>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that this is going to be an immediate financial advantage to the State.  I am sure that Deputy Good and Deputy Hewat and other Deputies, and many people outside, would argue that it would still be a financial advantage if we entered into closer financial relations with the British Government.  I am sure that we would do better with all our flotations if we could secure the backing of the British Government for that stock.  I am quite certain that for a considerable time to come the credit of the British Government will be higher than the credit of the Irish Government. But are we, for that reason, to consent to enter into this kind of obligation? First of all, it is to the advantage of the landowners.  They are going to get a better price in the market for the stock issued.  After all, what we did, in passing the Land Act, was to buy their rentals, and their rentals were annual.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not confined to untenanted land.  They did not receive lump sums for their rights in the land.  They are to receive annual sums, and I submit that this State will be in a position, and will fulfil its obligations, to pay those annual sums that it has contracted to pay and that we have no reason whatever to consider what the desires of the holders of those bonds may be in respect of offering them for sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question on the business side arises as to whether we ought to enter into this obligation and put ourselves into the hands of the British Government for the sake of being able to float future stock at a better price.  I think we ought not.  I think it is likely to be damaging to the best interests of the country.  Though the immediate financial interests might not be best served, the best interests of the country, in the long run would be best served, I think, by relying on our own exertions <Col N="1534" /> and our own ability to pay and making people believe, when they are taking up stock or when they are lending money, that it is Irish credit&mdash;not Irish credit backed by another State&mdash;that is at stake.  I do not know whether the Egyptian bond holders of old were all private persons.  I think they were not.  But I do know that one of the reasons most often given for interference by imperialistic powers with the affairs of smaller nations has been that citizens of the imperialist powers had holdings in the smaller State and that they were induced, by one reason or another, to protect the financial interests of their nationals.  Therefore they interfere by force and otherwise with the internal economy of the smaller State.  We, in this, are inviting Britain to do that.</P>
    <P>I am under no delusions in this matter. Old land stock would probably lead to the same kind of intervention if the necessity ever arose, as land bonds under the last Act would do, whether backed or not by any Bill of this kind.  But I think that we ought at least to save our own sense of respect and we ought not, deliberately and with knowledge, pass an Act of Parliament which quite clearly and definitely asks the British Government to come to the assistance of our Government in this matter; to say to them: &ldquo;Our creditors do not trust us; they do not believe that we can pay our debts in full, or, at least, if they do not go so far as that, they say there may come a time when the Irish Free State will not be able to meet its obligations, and we ask the British Government to make quite sure that they will come to our assistance by backing our bonds.&rdquo;  I think that that is simply craving for financial protection from another Power.  Once you have done that in regard to these land bonds, I do not see any good reason that could be adduced against any body of people who would say: &ldquo;Invite, or ask, or enter into negotiations with the British Treasury to back any future flotation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It has been said that the British Government has not ever hitherto guaranteed any debts of its Dominion Governments, and that was put forward as an objection in the British <Col N="1535" /> House of Commons against the passing of this Bill.  They have broken the ice; they may be invited again.  Other States within the British Commonwealth may not have the same feeling in regard to these things as the Irish Free State has.  I can conceive a very insistent demand on the part of certain people that we should endeavour to get the backing of the British Government for any future flotation, and this will be adduced as a precedent and a very good reason why we should continue in this way.</P>
    <P>Then comes the question that the Minister has touched upon, that we are bound to pay the annual interest in British currency.  Again, that is asking us to confess that Irish currency will be of less value than British, and that Irish credit, even for 80 years, is going to be somewhat lower in value than British.  It may not be a barrier against the establishment of an Irish currency.  It is rather like it.  At least it will be a strong influence against it. Again, it is telling ex-landlords that they have got out at a very good price; that they have done very well; that they have got the security not only of the Irish State but of the British State, and that they are to be paid in British currency.  That again, I think, is a backhander against the good name of the State and our belief in its future.  I think it is unfortunate that we should be asked to put our seal to any such proposition.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is very little use saying much about it.  The matter has been more or less before the country for a long time.  It is supposed to be the fulfilment of a secret treaty and has been urged upon us as an obligation because of a secret arrangement or, shall I say, an arrangement made by private persons to secure the support of the landlords to allow them to pass the Land Act without too strong an opposition.</P>

      <P>That is another matter. Who urged as a defence of this measure that it should be accepted in order to persuade the landlords to accept the Land Act?  That was the point the Deputy made&mdash;that is the real point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that I made that point.  Certainly I did.  I cannot say who made the particular reference, but it was made.  I am quite clear as to having read it. That is a minor point.  If it is of no value, then again I am on stronger ground, because the Seanad, which contains representatives of the landlord interest, accepted that Act and passed it without any reference to British guarantees or currency.  So that we may say that we are quite voluntarily, without any obligation, asked to enter into this legal compact with the British Government.  I take it from the Minister's intervention that we are not in any way bound to the landlords in this matter.  There is no obligation to the landlords.  So that the only question which arises is as to whether it is in the financial interest of the State or the political interest of the State.  I would ask the Minister whether in his reply he is going to argue that it is for the political, economic and social interest of the State, as well as the financial interest of the State, that we should ratify this compact between the British Government and the Free State Government. I say it is an unfortunate development. It does, in fact, mean, as I said before, putting the Free State into pawn with the British Treasury. We are inviting the British Government to keep a perpetual watch over our conduct of our own affairs and to make quite certain, so far as they can, that we shall not outstep the line of safety.  They do not want to be called upon to pay the holders of these bonds, but if they are called upon to pay they want to make sure that we shall be in a position to repay them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1537" /> I do not suppose it will have any practical effect except on the stock market.  It will have some effect, no doubt, because it will raise the price of stock and enable holders to get more when they sell.  That is the case the Minister has put forward.  I put forward against that that it would be just as logical, just as profitable, and just as beneficial to the financial interests of the State that any other financial obligation should be put in the same position. I wonder will any member of the Ministry, at this early stage of the history of the Free State, put it forward that we should invite the British Government or any other Government to guarantee our debts.  It is the reverse of Sinn Fein.  It means not self-reliance but reliance upon another Power. I hope the Dáil will not accept the Second Reading motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>In the opinion of those for whom I speak, this Bill is unnecessary, will give them no advantage, but will tend to lower instead of helping the credit of the State.  What advantage will the State derive from the passing of this Bill?  In that connection let us ask who is the State?  In this case the State will be the majority of the people, the tenant farmers.  What advantage will tenant farmers derive from the Bill?  None.  They have got to pay their debts.  They think, having agreed, and the Dáil having passed a Bill guaranteeing payment of the money, that ought to have been sufficient, and that those who will get the bonds ought to have been satisfied that the bonds were worth their face value. The Land Act of 1923 involves an immense amount of money, something like fourteen or fifteen millions.  To blot out a rental of one million we had to pay fifteen millions.  That money will be paid by the tenant farmers.  If it is not paid it will be taken from the Local Taxation Account and placed to the credit of these land bonds.  Having agreed to pay off what was a tremendous amount&mdash;sixty-seven and a half per cent. of a rental which, possibly, would never have been paid at all&mdash;we have, in addition, agreed to allow the Guarantee Fund to be drawn upon for payment of the interest every <Col N="1538" /> half year.  We consider it quite unnecessary at this time to be asked to back that up.  This Bill is in fulfilment of an agreement made by the British Government some time ago, before the Free State came into being, and we have nothing whatever to do with it. We stand by our own agreement and we want no help from anyone else.  We have got to pay and we are paying, and I wish the Minister, who is so solicitous for the interests of those who hold land bonds, would rather think instead, of the people who have to pay two and a half years' compounded arrears of rent, who during the past season have had their lands waterlogged, their sheep dying, and their whole condition worsened, and not talk about bolstering up people who have every safeguard that it is possible for Dáil Eireann to give them.</P>

Let us be beggars and masters but do not let us have luxury in chains.  I hope the Minister will not consider that rhetoric.  It applies in this case.  We did not ask for any help.  We agreed to pay our bonds.  We do not consider this Bill is necessary, and we look more or less with sorrow on the fact that it has been considered necessary by those people who receive our money, to go to a foreign State to help us to pay our just debts.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson, I think, has stated the case against the Bill very fairly.  We can at once clear our minds on this question of agreements. The Dáil, of course, as everyone here knows, is supreme.  The Dáil can agree or disagree.  There is no question of an agreement in the past, or in 1920, 1921, or 1922.  The Minister for Finance is perfectly entitled to state the facts but I doubt if there is anyone in the Dáil who does not know that the <Col N="1539" /> Dáil is supreme, is sovereign, and can at this stage act as it thinks fit on this matter.

I am rather interested in knowing who are the farmers for whom Deputy Wilson speaks, when he says it is not an advantage to the credit of the country to get a guarantee for thirty millions.  I do not think that is a doctrine that would be subscribed to by many farmers.  We have to be hard-headed in these matters.  We can all indulge in a certain amount of rhetoric and in a certain amount of a cheap oratory.  We have to tackle this in a business-like way.  We have to tackle this problem in the light of the considerations put forward by Deputy Johnson.  As responsible people we have to consider whether the advantages of this guarantee are so great as to counter-balance any possible disadvantages.  The situation is, let me repeat again, that we are perfectly free to do as we like in this matter.  No one need have any delusions on that point</P>

      <P>It would be wrong to give the impression that we are doing something on this occasion which has not been done before.  Deputy Johnson asked, why not go and look for an English guarantee to the next loan; why not go and look for an English guarantee for the money required to finance the Shannon Scheme, or the money required to finance the various schemes that this country will have to finance during the next ten or fifteen years?  That is not putting the position correctly.  The position is the exact opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1540" /> Before Deputies can really make up their minds as to whether the game is worth the candle in this case, they must get the exact facts.  The position, as Deputy Johnson and Deputy Wilson know, is, that already we are liable for the interest on a loan of £130,000,000 for land purchase.  That is a charge on our Central Fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy does not want me to go over the various steps which led up to that state of affairs, but that is the fact&mdash;that the Guarantee Fund is liable for any deficiency in land purchase annuities. These land purchase annuities are paid to the British Government, and the British Government have to pay them to the stockholders.  The fact, therefore, is&mdash;and nobody suggests that any other arrangement is possible&mdash;that at the present time there is a charge on our taxation in favour of the British Government for the interest on that sum of £130,000,000 for land purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest it is necessary to clear up the position in regard to that.  There is a projected financial re-arrangement or understanding, or a clearing up under the provisions of the Treaty.  The obligations under the Land Acts will be part of that re-arrangement, and when that re-arrangement is made we shall not necessarily be bound to pay interest on land stock directly to the British Exchequer. It will depend on any re-arrangement that is made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevancy of it is quite clear.  The Minister made the point that we are bound to the British Government for a continuous annual payment of land stock interest.  We are, until a settlement takes place under Article 5 of the Treaty.</P>

      <P>I am not going to enter into the question of what we can prove or what we cannot prove when the financial settlement takes place, because that has really got nothing to do with the point that we are now discussing.  I hope that we will be able to prove that the British Government owes us £130,000,000.  I am perfectly certain, at any rate, that we will be able to bring a good bill against them, but, as I say, that has nothing to do with the point we are discussing now. The fact to be considered at the moment is, that the interest on that sum of £130,000,000 for the purpose of land purchase in this country is a charge on our taxation.  The real problem which we have to consider is, whether having regard to the admitted financial advantages&mdash;financial advantages which even Deputy Johnson himself admitted&mdash;we should go ahead and extend that to £160,000,000.  That is the real problem, and it is wrong to state that you are doing something now which you have not done before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it was, but what has that got to do with the point? Surely we are not all a lot of children. This is a very serious and a very important transaction which we should weigh up carefully, and it is really not a matter for debating purposes.  The position we find ourselves in is&mdash; and nobody suggests that we could be in any other position at the moment&mdash; that there is a charge on our taxation for the interest on £130,000,000 for land purchase.  The way in which we have to consider the thing is, whether it is good business, not from the point of view of the landlords or the tenants or the Labour Party or the farmers, or the Cumann na nGaedheal, but from the point of view of the State as a whole; and, remember the landlords belong to the State and have the same rights in it as every other class, and the real problem is, whether there are any serious objections to extending this guarantee to cover not <Col N="1542" /> £130,000,000, but £160,000,000.  It is incorrect, and it is wrong, not to put "6"&gt;,,the problem in its proper perspective. To say that you are doing something new, that you are creating a precedent, and that you are doing something for which you may say next year, &ldquo;Why not accept a British guarantee for any other scheme you like, any of our national loans?&rdquo;&mdash;that is not the position. You are asking now to extend a loan which already exists.  That loan amounts to £130,000,000, and you are asking to extend it to £160,000,000 to complete the work for which the £130,000,000 was borrowed.  You have to ask yourself are there any conditions attached to the guarantee which make it inadvisable to accept it, having regard to all the admitted financial and economic advantages to be obtained under it.</P>
      <P>There would be, and should be, a very different debate if the Minister for Finance came forward here and asked for a British guarantee for an ordinary State loan.  I am not going into the question of what the national debt of this country is, or will be in twenty or thirty years' time.  It will probably be a lot more than £10,000,000.  A very large sum of money will be required for a great many purposes, and it is probable that we will find ourselves in the same position as every other State, and that we will require all the credit we can possibly muster for the purpose of meeting the various charges that are always to be met when a State is being built up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You cannot compare, and it is unfair and hardly correct to compare a large loan like the National Loan, or any similar loan that will be issued in the future, with a loan of this sort.  There are good reasons for accepting this.  It is in a different case and is in a totally different set of circumstances, let us say, to a new issue of £10,000,000.  I suggest to Deputy Johnson and to Deputy Wilson and to others who think there are good reasons for not accepting this guarantee, that the onus is upon them to show why we should not accept this loan rather than that it is on us to show why we should.  I want to know what economic, political, <Col N="1543" /> social, or any other stranglehold you like, that this addition to our indebtedness will effect.  That is the real question. If, at the present moment, we are indebted in the same way to the tune of £130,000,000, how will this make any real difference?  I repeat that the onus is on Deputy Johnson and Deputy Wilson and others to show that.  It would be our duty to examine the whole problem from that point of view.  It would be a very serious matter indeed to accept any loan which would put this State in pawn, and I suggest that using the words &ldquo;in pawn&rdquo; in this connection, in view of all the facts which I have stated, is absurd.  I want to hear from Deputy Johnson and Deputy Wilson how it is that this particular addition to our indebtedness will have all the consequences which they foresee.</P>
    <P>I know that there is to be a financial settlement later on.  The settlement that can apply to £130,000,000 can apply to £160,000,000.  I cannot discriminate between the conditions that can apply to a land purchase loan of £160,000,000 or £130,000,000 either at the present or in the future when a financial settlement takes place.  At any rate I think it is quite clear that this loan is on a special basis.  It is on a special basis because the British Government offered it voluntarily. They made no secret that they have the interest of the landlords at heart. That is quite natural.  It is an obvious interest for the British Government, but we have to consider it not only from that point of view but we have to consider it from the point of view of the tenants and the country as a whole.  We can see, and every Deputy here present can see, a big advantage in having the guarantee of the British Government on such an enormous loan as £30,000,000.  It is an enormous loan, when compared with ordinary development, say, with the development of the Shannon, a gigantic scheme, but at the outset which is only going to cost about five million pounds.  Thirty million pounds for land purchase is a very expensive matter, very much more expensive than any other, and it is an obvious advantage.  The advantage <Col N="1544" /> must be obvious even to Deputy Wilson, as to every farmer, to have a British guarantee for such an enormous loan as thirty millions.  Nor can I see any disadvantage in the fact that we are to have a financial settlement in the future.</P>

It is not a precedent at all; it has occurred already.  His main argument was addressed to the precedent aspect, but, as I pointed out, this is not a precedent.  It has already occurred and there will be a definite limit to it.  As far as the Deputy made the point that this is a precedent, that argument might apply to other loans, but that is a point that is met by the circumstances of the case.</P>

      <P>I say that Deputy Wilson is the only farmer in Ireland that does not see the value that the guarantee of a thirty million loan by the British will be&mdash;a loan that will come upon the market, I think, in the next two or three years.  I would like to know who it is that the Deputy is speaking for.  He is not speaking for Deputy Johnson, because Deputy Johnson admits that there would be an obvious financial advantage in having a British guarantee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have it clear, as we have it now, that the Farmers' Party are above financial considerations. Deputy Wilson is above all financial and all monetary considerations. I suggest this is a serious matter.  There may be something to be said on both sides, but it is obvious to every Deputy, as Deputy Johnson said, that there are certain financial advantages to the State in accepting this guarantee.  The Minister for Finance outlined these advantages.  I suggest that when considering Deputy Johnson's point that a guarantee of this sort <Col N="1546" /> gives a certain amount of financial control, we must remember that this, in fact, has obtained, that we inherited a much larger liability of the same sort already, and that the question we should ask ourselves is as to whether we should forego this obvious advantage of accepting this guarantee, in view of the fact, whatever the disadvantage may be, that we have inherited this disadvantage already for a very much larger sum.</P>
      <P>Now, with regard to currency.  The Deputy has admitted, and he is quite right, that this does not prevent us changing our currency.  We can change our currency any time we think fit.  I hope we will give that problem also adequate consideration.  I do not suppose it is proposed by anybody that we should change our currency merely for the purpose of changing.  You cannot play monkey-tricks of that kind with these important matters.  But if we change our currency, this loan does not prevent us.  It makes no real difference. It certainly makes no difference from that point of view, but we would be in an awkward position if we changed our currency and our currency was not on a par with British currency. If that day comes, well we may be in an awkward position, not because of this Bill, or because of the fact that we have to pay interest on this loan, amounting to about £200,000 a year, but because we may be doing a financial business with England to the extent of about £200,000,000 a year. From the point of view of the change of currency, this loan makes no difference whatever.  It was necessary, of course, to state British currency there because our currency at the present moment is British currency.  I never heard of a loan issued in a currency that did not exist; the currency has to be specified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, with regard to the landlords, this will do a good turn to the landlords, but it will do a good turn to the State and to every citizen of the State. I deprecate the point that the landlords are not entitled to their rights.  They are entitled to the same rights in the State as the Labour Party or the Farmers' Party, and they will get no more or no less, and I protest <Col N="1547" /> against the God-forsaken point of view that because people are landlords they are not entitled to get 20/- in the £.  If the Dáil decided that a person has to get 20/- in the £, then whether that person is a tenant or a labourer or a solicitor, or belongs to any other class, he will get it.  I agree with Deputy Johnson that the landlords would get their pound even if this guarantee had not eventuated.  However that may be, this matter will cost about £30,000,000 for land purchase.  About half of that will go direct to the landlord, half of it will go to mortgagees and others, but the greater part of it will come upon the market in two or three years.  It is a very big sum of money to go on the Irish market and there is no doubt that the Irish market will find it difficult to absorb. There is no doubt, if it went on the Irish market it would be difficult for the Minister for Finance, whoever he may be, to get money for various schemes which, I am sure, the Farmers' Party, the Labour Party, and other parties will rightly ask for in time to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>The one point which I think the Minister has made, apart from the statement of the Minister for Finance, is that because we have inherited a certain liability from the past there is no reason why we should not add to that liability now.  That is the one argument which the Minister tried to make and in support of which he produced figures&mdash;why should we not increase our liability to the British Government from 130 to 160 millions? I agree with the Minister that we have inherited a liability, but that liability was not incurred by this Dáil, nor by the elected representatives of the Irish people assembled in their own country. It is true that the responsibility and duty may be on us to pay our lawful debts, but the conditions which existed when that liability was contracted and the conditions which exist to-day are entirely different.  I do not see how the Minister tries to apply the argument that the conditions which dominated certain actions in the past are comparable to the conditions at present, and that the status of this <Col N="1548" /> country has not changed and that we have not certain obligations now which we had not to shoulder then.  I think we have.  I think the State has a responsibility to see that, so far as possible, its credit is maintained, but, at the same time, it ought not take action, like that which is now being put up in this measure, to give certain guarantees on behalf of this State and which gives certain other people not of this State rights here which they could not have, or which, certainly, we have not conceded to them before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Because in every country, and in this State to-day, the <Col N="1549" /> financial interests within the State have a power and influence which sometimes cannot be seen but which, nevertheless, exist, and if the action of this Dáil gives guarantees to the British Treasury the influence of the British Treasury will make itself felt here.  Beyond doubt it may be of benefit to the credit of this State.  I am prepared to go a certain length in that argument, but, on the other hand, the possible danger at some future period, perhaps not in the immediate future, and perhaps longer away than we can see, but, nevertheless, likely and possible to exist, is something which we cannot dismiss from our minds.  If our State is the sovereign state which we claim it to be, I think, and I am with Deputy Wilson in this, that we ought to go along on our own legs.  A bargain has already been made between the landlords and the tenants in this country, and it has been passed by the Dáil.  There was no suggestion then that such a measure as this would be necessary to supplement that bargain. The landlords got their shares and the tenants got their bargain. Both ought to be satisfied and, as Deputy Wilson says, the tenants will have to pay whether this measure passes or not.  It may, to some extent, affect the value of the bonds, but, after all, is that so much our business?  The law has enacted that bonds of a certain value will be given to the landlords, and I do not think that there is any necessity to amend that law in favour of the landlords.  If the Minister were coming along at the same time to amend that Act in favour of the tenants as well&mdash;and it requires amendment&mdash;we would be in the position to say that it was a <i>quid pro quo.</i> It is not such in this case, and I do not feel that Ministers have made a case good enough to make it possible for us to assent to the passing of this measure.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture said that we should be hard-headed.  To that sentiment I quite agree, and I also say that we should be hard-headed, particularly in <Col N="1550" /> view of the fact that our Ministry is weak and vacillating with regard to our financial relations with Great Britain.  That may appear to be a farfetched statement, but let us look back over the events of the past few years. Every Deputy and the Minister will recognise that under the Home Rule Act of 1920 certain funds were laid aside which the Parliaments of Northern and Southern Ireland could use as their own.  They had complete and absolute control over that money. Those sums were sums accruing from the Land Purchase Acts.  There is no doubt whatever that that was the law when the Treaty was signed.  Yet, what do we find to-day?  To-day we find that the annuities are collected from the tenants and are transmitted to London, and in the event of some tenants refusing to pay, the Government, in order to meet some obligation which has not been brought to the knowledge of the people, go first to the Guarantee Fund, that is the Agricultural Grant.  Should that be insufficient, they go to the Central Fund of Saorstát Eireann as a first and primary charge on its resources and make good the difference.  That is the actual position. It used to be said in the old days that the British Empire was a common heritage.  To some extent I am prepared to agree.  If it was a common heritage while we were part of Great Britain, we had a certain share in its assets, and, therefore, it could not be said that Great Britain alone owned the Empire.  We had a certain share in its material resources.  We had a common Exchequer, and we had a share in the funds issued from that Exchequer. They were issued indiscriminately to England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales from that common fund.  Yet what is the position?  We have not heard that the Irish Free State has any power in the control of those sums at present. Certain advances were made for productive work.  Sums were given from the common Exchequer in Great Britain.  It is not a fair proposition pending the settlement of financial relations necessitated by Article V of the Treaty, that each side would stick to what had been lent in their country. That has not been done, and remember <Col N="1551" /> that if the Government at that time had held closely, and they had the law in their favour, they would have secured that position.  But they must have carried out some engagements behind the back of the Dáil or by which they voluntarily consented to transfer the sums to London accruing under the head of the Land Purchase Acts in Saorstát Eireann.  There is no doubt of that.  I should like to have the history of those negotiations, and the relevant papers laid on the Table of the Dáil, and I should like to know why those engagements were entered into.  Take it this way: If we had held on to the land purchase annuities under the Act of 1920, and if there had not been a radical departure in the implication of the Act, while it is true we certainly would bear the responsibility for paying stockholders we would, pending the financial settlement, be permitted to retain and to devote these sums as we might choose.  Of this money which accrued under the sinking fund for the redemption of stock, 1¼ per cent. is used in Great Britain to redeem the stock in any way the British Treasury desires. That would not have come to pass if we had acted strongly on our legal rights in 1920, and it might have helped in solving the political tangle in the North to-day.  We certainly would have a very great advantage in the financial settlement under Article V.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are informed that this will benefit our credit.  Well, I am not aware that for land purchase we are actually going to the market for money.  Is it not scrip we are issuing, and giving that guarantee of a certain percentage bearing 4½ per cent.?  It ought to be a security which can be negotiated on the money market.  I submit that 20/- is the same in Ireland as it is in Great Britain, and that a Treasury note in my pocket has the same purchasing power as a Bank of Ireland note, say, in London.  While the tenants contribute&mdash;and I hope there will be no refusal, and I will not hold over any repudiation of our obligation to meet land purchase annuities&mdash;I say it is scarcely fair, and is lowering the prestige of this State to ask us to accept a British Government guarantee, when <Col N="1552" /> we have the financial means of giving effect to the bonds issued.  The question was put by, I think, the Minister for Agriculture as to how this particular indebtedness acted detrimentally to our credit.  I submit that if the State is a sovereign State, and we have not heard that contention yet denied from the Government benches, the mere fact that another nation is guaranteeing its debts does not in itself redound to its credit, and it could not possibly do so.  How, then, can we accept this proposition to-day?  Look at the small nations of Europe that did not engage in the Great War, and see how high their credit stands.  I have yet to learn that their loans were guaranteed by any of the great Powers. Look at the exchanges, and see the strength they display.  The Spanish nation, for instance, is not very mighty, but look at the rate of its exchange with Paris, or any of the great central nations, or Holland or Switzerland. These nations, standing on their own, have not had their credit lowered, even in the absence of a great Power guarantee. There is no reason why this State, if it does not outlaw itself from the financial international policy, should not hold its own.  This Bond Bill is in no sense helpful to our credit, and as a mere commercial proposition it can be of small help to the persons who hold land in bonds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>For the last 40 years the British Government have been concerned with pushing forward land purchase, and guaranteeing the proceeds thereof with great advantage, I think it must be allowed, to all sides, and it has placed the country in a different position from what it was in 1885.  I think it is only reasonable that the nation that undertook this gigantic work ought to complete it.  In fact there is no doubt whatever that time after time in all the papers some years before there was any talk of the Treaty, the British Government had arranged to complete land purchase.  That was a matter what was thoroughly understood, and I think I am not wrong in saying that considerably before the Treaty was thought of or negotiated, there was a Land Purchase Bill in the hands of the British Government which <Col N="1553" /> they were about to launch, and why they did not proceed with it was, I suppose, because their attention was directed to other matters.  They intended to launch a measure for the completion of land purchase that would have dealt with the whole of Ireland. It is possibly better for the tenants who have now bought that that measure did not come into operation.</P>
      <P>Under the Act of 1923, passed by the Dáil, I think they have not done very badly.  I think it will be generally allowed that the Act has been and will be of great advantage to the State and to all concerned, both landlords and tenants.  I maintain that it is to the advantage of everybody concerned in this country that the people who undertook this great financial responsibility should carry it through and complete it.  In fact, it is their duty, and I think they would be very culpable if they did not carry it out.  They have proposed to do this themselves.  Someone suggested, I think it was Deputy Johnson, that the British Government were probably asked to come to the assistance of the Irish Government in this matter.  Well, I am quite positive that there are no grounds for that suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the 1923 Act, I think the actual number of years' purchase a tenant will pay is 13½.  To bring it up to 15 years, which is the full amount, or otherwise an additional 10 per cent. a guarantee is given by the Irish State.  Comparing this Bill with the Northern Land Bill, I think the tenants have not come off very badly. They will have to pay 13½ years' purchase as against 17½ in the Northern State.  That is greatly to the advantage of dwellers here.  I think that Deputy Wilson said it is lowering the credit of the Free State to have a guarantee from any outside country accepted.  I really cannot see that.  It seems to me that it would considerably enhance the credit of this State for future borrowing purposes if this <Col N="1554" /> country is, as it will be, free of the guarantee.</P>

It seems to me that it should make matters very much easier in any future money transactions we may have on the market if we have this guarantee off our shoulders.  I think that is no small advantage to us and it cannot be considered otherwise. Taking all these matters into consideration, and the advantages that will accrue from the extra credit that we will have, I think that we should be great fools if we do not accept this guarantee which we have not asked for, but which the British Government have themselves given and which they have considered they are in duty bound to give.  Certainly, to judge from references in the papers, or from what one has read hitherto, they are undoubtedly bound to carry out this guarantee and they realise that.</P>

I consider, as the British Government believe they are bound in equity to give this guarantee themselves, that it would be the acme of folly if we refused to accept it.  I hope and I believe that the Dáil and the Oireachtas generally are not so destitute of sense as to refuse to accept this guarantee, which will put us in an immensely strong position financially, when we go on the market for future money to carry out improvements or to do whatever we may want.  I am quite certain that as a result of it we shall have very little difficulty in borrowing money for drainage, the relief of unemployment or for whatever purpose we may need it.  I believe that matters will be made very much easier for us in that respect as a result of this guarantee and I hope most sincerely that the Dáil will give its consent to this Bill.</P>

      <P>Unless large landholders have some guarantee that they are going to be paid there is no possible chance of handing over the land to the tenants.  The British Government have guaranteed land bonds to the value of £30,000,000 and that is to my mind a great encouragement to the uneconomic landholders and the landless people of the Saorstát.  They are looking forward to the time when the Land Commission will act in a really generous manner by handing over the land that is at present vested in the Land Commission. You have a very large number of landowners in the country who never believed in the industries of the country or who never believed from a financial point of view in the country, and they would not like the idea of disposing of their land to the Land Commission without some guarantee of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission have the power to acquire land whether it is <Col N="1556" /> tenanted or untenanted for the relief of congestion.  According to Section 24 of the Land Act, in the case of any land that has been purchased, and where annuities are being paid to the Land Commission, if the Land Commission require such land for the relief of congestion they must compensate the owners of these holdings by giving them holdings of equal value elsewhere.  I am against that section completely.  To my mind the landowners of Ireland have got too much profit already out of the land&mdash;</P>

      <P>I quite agree they got it years ago, but if the Deputy were here when the Land Bill of 1923 was considered and heard the arguments put forward by the Farmers' Deputies at the time, he would find that the landlords were the people looked after and not the tenants.

      <P>They recognised the Land Act as a measure that would create employment in the country.  The Farmers recognised it as an Act that would improve the position of the class they represent, and the Labour Deputies recognised it as an Act tending to relieve unemployment and improving the position of the worker in general Now, when we come to have a guarantee <Col N="1557" /> for the people who are going to hand over the land, it is suggested that we should object to that guarantee. Why?  Is it because we now recognise that the Land Act passed in 1923 was not really in the interests of the State, or is it because it has taken such an awful length of time to put its sections into operation?  Possibly that is the reason.  If that were the argument against this Bill, probably I might have something to say with reference to the Land Act.  But that is not the argument. The argument is that we do not need outside assistance.  I put it to the farmers here that if they are prepared to guarantee thirty millions in land bonds through their organisation, I will be prepared to vote against the Bill, but not until then.</P>

      <P>I have heard some very curious economic doctrines from the Farmers' Benches this evening.  In effect we are asked by the Farmers' Party to believe that by having an additional guarantee to a financial obligation, we are going to be worse off. Deputy Wilson said he would be very annoyed if he gave a cheque to a person and that person wanted someone else to guarantee it by putting his name on the back of it.  I would ask Deputy Wilson to put himself in the position of the person getting the cheque.  For instance, if Deputy Wilson were to offer me a cheque, and I did not know very much about Deputy Wilson, and that subsequently the Minister for Finance was to put his signature on the back of the cheque, I certainly would sleep very much more easily in my bed that evening before I lodged the cheque.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. EGAN Mr. EGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to the tenants in a moment.  The burden of Deputy Wilson's speech was that the tenants were not being dealt with at all and that it is no use to them.  Surely to goodness any action which helps to complete land purchase is of benefit to the tenants.  It obviously must be. <Col N="1558" /> Another point about the matter of the British guarantee is that I do not see how the British people, having initiated this system of guaranteeing the money, did not complete the operation. That would mean you would have one part of the transaction in a different category from the rest of it, and I do not think it would be good business. Deputy Wilson also appeared to think that all this was being done for the benefit of the landlords; that the tenants would gain nothing by it.  I maintain, contrary to that, that anything at all that adds to the security of an Irish investment, lifts up the whole credit of the State.  It is practically obvious it must do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say at once that I am discussing this matter purely as a matter of hard business.  I am not swayed to the slightest extent by any sentimental, rubbishy talk about British interference or about a British stranglehold.  That sort of thing cuts no ice with me.  Deputy Wilson did think there was too much being done for the landlords, and that the security of their bond was being made too good for them.  These land bonds are negotiable. In years to come they may be spread over half the world.  If they have the guarantee of British security behind them, it is not going to make them anything the worse.  It would be a difficult thing to get any responsible body of businessmen to understand that by having a British guarantee to any security you are making that security worse.  You may find some sentimental theorists who will say that the addition of a British guarantee would make them worse; but no body of hard-headed businessmen in this country, or in any other country, could be got to subscribe to the suggestion that the addition of a British guarantee to any security is going to make that security worse.  I quite fail to follow that line of reasoning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Baxter and Wilson do not appear to be in perfect agreement.  It is not the first time I have noticed a little difference of opinion in the happy family party sitting over on the Farmers' <Col N="1559" /> benches.  Deputy Wilson started off by saying that this transaction of having the British guaranteeing those bonds was absolutely going to worsen our credit and lower it in the eyes of the world.  I think I have dealt with that point.  Deputy Baxter, on the other hand, in the course of his remarks, said he did agree it would maintain the credit of the State and that he thought there was a great deal of force in that suggestion.  He then went on to deal with what he described, or what has very often been described, as the stranglehold of England.  He developed that kind of sentimental objection. I think I have dealt with that sufficiently.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hogan also worked himself up into a certain state of sentimental objection to the British stranglehold.  He gave a rather unfortunate illustration when he referred to the British Treasury note.  He said the Land Bond was simply scrip.  But then the scrip has got the security behind it.  It is not the face value of a piece of paper that counts; it is the stuff you have behind it.  As regards the British Treasury note, which the Deputy considers worth 20/- to the £, if it had not the security of the State behind it, it would not be worth a farthing to the £.  I really think the objections to this guarantee are utterly frivolous, and I propose to vote for the Bill.</P>

      <P>I expect that the Second Reading of this Bill will be put to a vote.  I do not know what has been said by my colleagues on those benches. I was not present when they spoke, and I do not know their views.  We have not discussed this matter in our Party. I feel I am at liberty to express the views I hold.  I believe it has been said <Col N="1560" /> that mistakes have been made, and it has been suggested that it would be a mistake to avail of this guarantee.  The only mistake I could ever recognise in the passage of the 1923 Act was that we gave too much to the owners of the land.  We gave too much of a price, and as regards the question of arrears and money in lieu of rent, we were too generous.  That was a mistake.  I do not recognise that this Bill is a mistake.</P>
      <P>We know that the British Government, that in fact a series of British Governments, have been under a pledge to the Landlords' Convention to guarantee, either through their own Parliament or through this, the money or bonds in connection with land purchase. This was the promise that was given to the landlords by the Government of England.  It does not concern us at all.  Already we have asked for and floated a £10,000,000 loan.  This is a bond issue of £30,000,000.  We are not going to stop national development. Judging by what we have heard in the Dáil and outside it, we will be asked, I am told, for a loan for the development of this country.  For that purpose considerable sums will be required, and just enough, I think, for this nation to be responsible for.  We, of course, are responsible to the British Government for this.  Bearing 4½ per cent. interest, and with only the credit of this State, in view of the times that we have passed through, I fancy that those 4½ per cent. bonds would be sold at something less than £90.  I do not think that that is the best possible thing for the national credit.  I think that the fact that the English Government is guaranteeing these bonds will help national credit in this country, and for that reason I am prepared to accept the Bill and vote for its Second Reading.  I do not know what the position of this country would be in three or four years' time if some of the people who are at large and who are preaching the doctrine of &ldquo;Pay no annuities; pay nothing.&rdquo; had any following in the country, and they have a following.  Most of the votes cast for Irregularism to-day are Bolshevik votes, a vote that says, &ldquo;Pay nobody.&rdquo;</P>

No change is being made in the financial clauses of the Land Act of 1923 by this Bill.  It is merely bringing certain clauses of the Land Act of 1923 and their implications into one or two sections.

      <P>I find myself in the unfortunate position of not agreeing with Deputy Johnson in his views on this Bill.  As a Deputy who is interested very much in the question of the acquisition and division of large tracts of land throughout the country, and in the placing thereon of very many landless men and increasing the size of uneconomic holdings so as to make them economic, I must say that I am in <Col N="1562" /> favour of this Bill.  I want to make it clear that I am not concerned with the political development of this country. What I am most concerned with is the industrial development, and I believe that by the passing of this Bill we will be doing far more good for the country and for the people in general than by holding it up and delaying its passing, and thereby ultimately delaying the putting into operation of the many good clauses contained in the Land Act of 1923.  In this matter I am mostly concerned with the welfare of the people who are dependent on the operations of the Land Act of 1923.  As a result of the passing of this Bill I feel that great benefits will accrue to these people.  I can say that the people have been watching this Bill for a considerable time past.  I come from a county where there is more agitation about land than in any other county in Ireland.  The people there are watching this Bill and praying that it may be put through speedily in accordance with the general wishes of the people.  For this reason I am anxious to see this Bill passing into law.</P>

      <P>Not a single acre.  But the Minister for Finance and the President are, of course, absolutely right. It is obvious to any business man that things would go somewhat more quickly if the Land Commission had not to invoke the compulsory clauses of the Act at every hand's turn, and so far as that is concerned it will affect land purchase to a small extent in the future.  So far as the holding up at present is concerned, it has not affected land purchase to any extent, for the reason that most of the sales that have taken place up to the present have been voluntary sales.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson inquired as to whether we would not ask the British Government to guarantee a loan, for instance, for the Shannon scheme, and he said that if we accepted the guarantee for the land bonds we might just as well ask the British Government to guarantee a loan for the Shannon.  The position is quite different. We came into being with the British Government pledged to guarantee these bonds; we had not to offer them any inducements to do so; we had not to go with our hats in our hands and ask for a guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>They made certain conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>They made quite <Col N="1564" /> ordinary conditions in connection with the giving of the guarantee.  But if I were to go to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in England to-morrow, and ask him to guarantee a loan for the Shannon scheme, it would be quite legitimate for him to say, &ldquo;Yes, provided all the materials and engineering stores are bought in Great Britain.&rdquo; If we were to ask anybody to guarantee a loan, it would be quite right for those who are asked to do so to impose conditions.  They might be onerous conditions.  If we had gone to Great Britain to ask for a guarantee for our National Loan, we would postpone the day when we would be relying on our own credit, and it would be more difficult in the case of a future loan to get the money without a guarantee.  If we were to ask for such things, undoubtedly we would be liable to have conditions imposed.  No conditions have been imposed on us other than natural and proper conditions, conditions that are not onerous in any respect, that we shall repay any sums that may be paid on our behalf.  I think that nobody can claim that it is putting the State in pawn to say that if sums are paid on our behalf we will repay them, or to say that our credit suffers in any way from that.  Deputy Wilson spoke in a most frivolous and irresponsible strain.  A man who is a public representative, and who can say that farmers will not benefit by this Bill, really cannot have spoken with any thought, because farmers, as he said himself, represent a big portion of the community.  If big charges are imposed on the State through the rejection of this Bill, which need not be imposed, they will suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have succeeded heretofore in borrowing money at 5¼ per cent.  I think that it is not at all unlikely if we are issuing a loan in future, and if we had these land bonds on the market without any guarantee and selling at perhaps 80, or less, that we might have to issue our loan at a price that would mean paying 6 or 6¼ per cent. interest.  It is suggested that we will borrow for the Shannon scheme some £5,000,000, in the first instance, at any rate.  If we are to pay an extra one per cent interest on that we would have <Col N="1565" /> an additional £50,000 a year to pay. In addition, if we only get £80 for every £100 stock we issue, when we are paying off the loan there would be a further heavy liability on the State. There is no doubt at all that stock, such as land bonds, issued without a British guarantee, would sink very low. Our Five per Cent.  Compensation Stock was very low for a long time, although it was a stock that if it were sold at its value at present, assuming that 95, or whatever the National Loan stood at, was a fair price, should be selling at three or four points more. Instead of that it was almost steadily lower than the National Loan, although it is redeemable at par in ten years, and the drawings might give people £100 for what they had bought at £90 or £95.  But because it has been issued in small quantities it was depressed.  These bonds, if issued without a guarantee, would undoubtedly sink very low, and if we had one of our stocks down to eighty, or thereabouts, it would bring down any other stock we had.  Then when we issue new stock we would have to <Col N="1566" /> do so at a low price, and undoubtedly it would mean a very heavy and unnecessary burden on the State.  When Deputy Baxter spoke about the power that it would give the British Government over this country he was talking complete nonsense.  We are not doing anything that will give any sanctions to the British Government.  It is simply a pledge that we will pay if necessary anything that they may have paid, but it does not give sanctions of any sort, and to talk about the power it gives to the British Treasury is complete nonsense.</P>

      <P>I am aware that Mr. Milligan has applied for the return of a gun received from him by the military. It cannot be traced at the moment, but efforts to locate it are being made.  If they are not successful, the question of compensation will be considered.</P>
