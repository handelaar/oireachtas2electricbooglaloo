      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if a claim for compensation by Thomas Ryall, of Barona, Clonmel, Co. Tipperary, was heard at Clonmel on December 18th, 1923, for losses sustained owing to the seizure of cattle by Irregulars; if a report for £56 was made by the Judge; whether the amount of the report has yet been paid to Mr. Ryall, and, if not, whether he will have payment of same expedited.</P>

      <P>Payment of £50 with the costs and expenses recommended by the Judge will be made in this case at an early date.  The reduction of £6 represents the amount recommended by the Judge in respect of sheep alleged to have been commandeered in October, 1921; I am advised that this loss could not properly be made the subject of a Report under Section 15 of the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923.  I will, however, refer this portion of the claim to the Committee established under the Indemnity Act, for consideration.</P>

      <P>asked the <Col N="1545" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention has been called to the fact that ex-members of the Army disbanded since June, 1924, whose claims for unemployment benefit have been allowed by the Court of Referees and subsequently by the Umpire, have been refused payment at the Dublin Labour Exchange; in particular if his attention has been called to the case of Henry Free (Serial Number 103445), of 4 Holles Row, Dublin, coach body builder, who joined the Army in 1922, and who, prior to joining, had, it is stated, ten years' stamps to his credit, having only drawn three weeks' unemployment benefit; if he is aware that he left the Army in March, 1925, and has signed the Unemployment Register since the 25th of that month, but has not yet been paid insurance benefit, and whether he will state the reasons for non-payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the cases to which the Deputy refers. A point of law arose as to whether the particular question on which the cases depended&mdash;namely, whether contributions were payable in respect of any soldier who was still in the Army after June, 1924, was properly referred to the Umpire and was within his jurisdiction. I have been advised that the Umpire has no jurisdiction to determine whether contributions are payable in any particular case or not, and have received legal opinion as to the interpretation of the relevant sections of the Unemployment Insurance Acts which is being applied to the circumstances of each of these cases.</P>
      <P>In the case of Henry Free, the claimant was entitled by reason of his periods of Army service to contributions in respect of the 1922-1923 and the 1923-1924 insurance years.  He consequently is not disqualified under Section 8 (4) of the Act of 1920 during the present insurance year, and, subject to satisfying the conditions for the receipt of benefit, will receive it in proportion to his unexhausted contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister explain how it is in the specific case of Henry Free the applicant has not been <Col N="1546" /> paid anything from March this year, although he has been signing the unemployment register since that time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That arises out of the complication with regard to the particular matter to which I have referred. It is a very involved and complicated question.  Some Unemployment Insurance officials apparently thought this was fit matter for the Umpire and the Court of Referees to decide.  The cases were allowed to go before the Umpire and his decision was, in fact, obtained in some cases.  Afterwards it was discovered that the question as to whether contributions were, in fact, payable or not, for particular cases, was not for the Umpire.  What the Umpire is to determine is, contributions having been legally paid, when is a man entitled to draw benefit? Quite a number of these cases have been held up pending the legal decision as to who is entitled to say when contributions were payable and when they were not.  Henry Free happens to be one of these cases, in general with the rest. That one question has been determined in his favour, as far as one item is concerned, and, subject to satisfying other conditions, he will get his benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect to the general question, does it not appear clear to the Minister that, as far as the insured persons are concerned, the whole procedure seems to be that one party to the dispute can make an appeal to a court, and when the court has decided against the appellant, then it is found that the court has no jurisdiction, and the applicants for benefit are ruled out?  It seems to be a case that if the Department cannot get out of it one way, it is going to get out of it the other way.  That is how it appears to the insured person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It might appear so, if too wide an interpretation were put on what I have said.  The fact of the matter is that the Attorney-General had to be consulted in these cases, and we got a ruling.  If anybody challenges that ruling, it is a matter for the applicant to bring the case into court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>In other cases the Minister has always said that the Umpire's decision was final.  In this case the Umpire's decision was not final after the appeal was made to him, and the applicants are deprived of insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Umpire's decision is final on matters properly referred to him.  This was a matter improperly referred to him.  It has been decided that it was improperly referred to him, but there can be an appeal against that to the ordinary courts. We have got our opinion; that opinion can be challenged and overturned if the facts are otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister say it has been decided as improperly referred?  By what court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Not by any court.  Possibly I should not have used the word &ldquo;decided.&rdquo;  It has been given to us as an authoritative ruling of the Legal Adviser to the Government that the cases should not have been referred.  The applicants in these cases have still the right to go to the court and challenge that opinion.  We are acting on that opinion, and our action can be challenged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister guarantee to pay the expenses of the application to the court?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously not. If the advice we have got is so obviously wrong as to lead the court to give costs against us, then we will pay, but not in other cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>One Department of State apparently says that this is right and proper.  Another Department says: &ldquo;No, it is not,&rdquo; and the second Department appeals against the first, and the decision is against the applicants for insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is hardly a correct interpretation.  One Department of State, at one time, inadvertently sent to the Umpire a matter which it afterwards decided itself was not proper material for the Umpire, and that afterthought of the Department <Col N="1548" /> was backed by the opinion of the Attorney-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Umpire is always the final appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not right to put that too far.  He is not always the final appeal in matters improperly referred to him.  If an appeal made under the Workmen's Compensation Act were referred to him under the Unemployment Insurance Act, the Umpire's decision would not be final. I am not in any way weakening the statement that the Umpire's decision is final, in saying it is not final in a matter outside his scope.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>He was called upon to decide the question of whether contributions should have been paid for these men or not.  That is the matter that it has now been decided was not proper for him to have any say in.</P>

      <P>May I say, in respect to this amendment, that I am not binding myself to defend or to advocate, with insistence, either the phraseology, the form of the amendment, or the proportion of the amounts set out in the amendment.  I realise the difficulties of construction; I never realised them so much as when the consideration of the form of this new section was before me.  If there is to be any further discussion, I would like that that discussion should be on the principle involved; that is to say, the State, having contributed sums which may amount to £2,000,000 in ten years &mdash;it may be less and it may be more&mdash; should, at the conclusion of that period of subsidy, be entitled to part ownership of the property that has been created by virtue of the subsidy.  There should be this proviso, which is contained in sub-section (3), that the share holdings of the original shareholders, the investments of the original shareholders, will be guaranteed, or will at least be entitled to call for five per cent. of the value of the share holdings before State holding would come in for any share of the profits.  As to the rate of interest, and the amount of holding or the proportion of the subsidy, those are matters for consideration if the general purposes of the section were found acceptable.  I do hope that the Dáil will be prepared to face the proposal that, having paid out in the course of an experimental period of ten years a sum of money which, in effect, is capital expenditure, the property created by that expenditure will, at least in part, be that of the State that contributed the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this amendment moved by Deputy Johnson.  I think the principle he has laid down there is a perfectly fair and equitable one.  I have in mind the fact that a document has been distributed in Dublin&mdash;it has been quoted by the public Press, and therefore, I think, no privacy can be claimed for its contents by M. Lippens, whom we are helping with this industry, because that is virtually <Col N="1551" /> the position&mdash;indicating that it is expected, under the terms of this Bill, to be able to establish the factory and keep it continuing for ten years, and at the end of that period to be able to amortize the entire sum with which it was capitalised at the beginning. Now, obviously, I am not going to pay an excessive amount of attention to any documents that are circulated with a view to getting capital.  These are always very fully coloured, necessarily, under the facts of the case.  But there is a statement, the figures are worked out, and it would appear there is a very fair justification.  Although I am not going to pay an exaggerated attention to prospectuses of that kind, I do know that a much more conservative type of mind made a similar calculation that was distributed to Deputies in this House, very fully substantiating those figures.  Those figures were calculated by Deputy Johnson, who, I think, is, strictly speaking, so far as finance is concerned, whatever his tenets are, a very conservative person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention Deputy Johnson's figures merely in substantiation of those that have been circulated.  They do support the figures and claims there made, that under a scheme it should be possible that the concessionaire&mdash;because M. Lippens is a concessionaire under this project&mdash;should be able, at the end of a ten years' period, to redeem, to amortize, the entire initial capital expenditure. If that be the case, it means quite clearly that the State contribution will, in that event&mdash;I am only suggesting this by way of hypothesis&mdash; have been a very generous contribution indeed.  It might not be proved to be so.  That happy, fortunate forecast made in the prospectus might not prove justified.  If it is not, in any case the calculation allowed for in this amendment will not injure the position at that time.  I suggest that, in the State's interest, we ought to look forward to what will happen at the end of the ten years' period.  The industry might prove justified, it might be an admirable concern.  If it is so made, it will be made mainly and largely by virtue of what the Government and the people of the Free State have put into it. <Col N="1552" /> Then it will be the right time to enter into a calculation of this sort in order that, whatever might happen in the intervening period, the State might be able to claim its share in the enterprise which its contribution has established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Figgis, with his customary ingenuity under cover of the amendment moved by Deputy Johnson, has contributed to the debate on the question: Is the subsidy too large?  Deputy Johnson's amendment, to my mind, has a peculiar value.  That value is not that, if accepted, the amendment would improve the Bill.  It is resident rather in this, that at the basis of his amendment is a doctrine, and the doctrine, I think, taken by itself, is an admirable one.  He declared, in the speech before the last one, that a subsidy is, after all, a contribution of the people's money to the realisation into success of a company's project; consequently, when that success has been achieved, a measure of its result is attributable to the contribution of the people's money, and that, if a valuation could show to what extent the people had contributed to the earning of dividends, these dividends should, in some proportion, be distributable as on the popular capital.  I do not think that Deputy Johnson denies that that statement which I attribute to him is a fair paraphrase of several statements he made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Deputy to understand that a preliminary to the payment of dividends is, in my proposition, the fact of ownership by virtue of the expenditure of capital in the form of a subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy Johnson's argument was peculiarly like the argument I put forward in the long and tedious speech with which I bored the House some time ago.  I argued then that a subsidy, particularly this subsidy, is an investment, and I contended, and I was egotistical enough to believe that I had established what I contended, that the dividends that would flow from that investment could be raised under a variety of heads which I set out, and that the results were measurable in terms of cash and <Col N="1553" /> in terms not cash.  Deputy Johnson's doctrine is, in substance, what I advocated on more than one occasion here; consequently, I speak in favour of it when I hear it again.  The subsidy is, as Deputy Johnson says, a grant of the public money.  The concessionaire company receives the public money.  It works to success, thanks to that receipt of public money.  Now, this argument is altogether unaffected by the truth of the doctrine advanced by the Minister for Finance, a truth which I accept, that apart from the form in which the aid is given to this enterprise, there is practically no difference between the case in regard to beet and the case for the sugar factory if the tax on sugar had been left at the figure at which it stood last year; in other words, whether you give a protective tariff, or whether you give a subsidy.  But what you are really doing is, you are bringing the funds of the State to the aid of industry, an industry carried on inside the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is more palpable, more obvious, that the State funds are being contributed to the industry when the form of the aid is that of subsidy.  The important point which I think Deputy Johnson has, with all respect, overlooked, is that while his doctrine in this regard is a sound doctrine, namely, that where the people's money is contributed to the advancement of an industry, and that industry is carried on by a corporation, the State is entitled to look for some accruing advantage from this investment, he departed from my line last evening when he spoke of what I enumerated as the dividends in this case as direct advantages.  To me it does not matter whether an advantage that comes by way of enrichment of the State comes to it obliquely or comes to it directly.  If, as we have been able to show, there will be no industry of this type, no creation, and no carrying on of a sugar factory, unless we can induce a sugar-producing company to begin its operations here, and if that inducement is to take the form of some such bargain as this to which we are giving legal effect, then the State investment really is the procuring for the State and for the people of this community of a sugar factory properly <Col N="1554" /> equipped, and properly conducted by men who know how to conduct such a highly-specialised business.</P>
    <P>The first gain of the subsidy is that we have the factory as a going concern, and we have the specialised workers there keeping it and maintaining it as a going concern.</P>
    <P>That, I allege, without any pretence at &ldquo;word-spinning,&rdquo; as Deputy Gorey would call it&mdash;when I use the words &mdash;is a dividend, and it can be calculated. Why should it be regarded as not a dividend, merely because it does not come into the coffers of the State by virtue of a vote made at a meeting of shareholders?  It is an addition to the wealth of the nation.  Without the subsidy, no industry; with the subsidy, there is the industry.  If it be not of the proper amount, it is no subsidy at all for practical purposes.  Therefore, the subsidy to be decided upon here, and the terms of which it is a part, must be such as will induce this firm to take up the work we wish to see taken up.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for Deputy Figgis to quote from prospectuses about handsome profits.  He knows a great deal more about how these prospectuses are coloured than any other Member of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Like that of a famous character in Dickens, his experience is &ldquo;extensive and peculiar.&rdquo; He is entitled to say that it is customary in issuing prospectuses to colour them highly.  But we, who are advocating the creation of a sugar industry in Ireland, are not privy to these prospectuses or to any editorial comment on them.  They are absolutely external.  The point is: Could the setting up of a sugar factory be secured on lower terms?  On lower terms, &ldquo;no.&rdquo; Surely, to begin to talk about what is handsome and what is not handsome, is to miss the essential point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite agree with Deputy Johnson in the doctrine he has propounded; so does the Minister, I think, when it is taken out of all these proceedings and set out as a doctrine.  Those of us who <Col N="1555" /> are advocating a subsidy are advocating the doctrine that it is legitimate, and that it is wise to employ funds from the Exchequer to secure the creation of industries that otherwise would not be secured and which, if secured, will flourish in the land.  To put an arbitrary limit on the amount that is to be earned is to assume, as Deputy Johnson has assumed in those figures that Deputy Figgis finds it advisable to eulogise, that the profits in this undertaking are going to be huge profits.  They are not.  Most decidedly they are not.  I am speaking now on the authority of an expert in the sugar business, who is not to be questioned as regards length of experience or breadth and depth of experience.  I quoted to the House on a previous occasion the offers from the Van Rossum group.  The minimum terms upon which they agreed, in their tender to the Government, to set up a sugar factory and work it here, were terms arithmetically higher than the terms of the M. Lippens group.  Accepting the criticisms set out by the Van Rossum experts as sound, and justified by experience, I believe the Government have made a wonderful bargain in extorting terms that are similar as regards the amount of subsidy per cwt. of sugar, and in respect of the terms during the first three years that are to be paid to the farmers for their beet.</P>
    <P>The figures I gave showed that when allowance was made for depreciation on this elaborate machinery&mdash;the installation and equipment running to between £200,000 and £250,000&mdash;when allowance had been made for the huge body of expert workers that would be required, whether dealing with 5,000, 50,000 or 100,000 tons of beet, and when various other items had been provided for, the total earnings, with income tax calculated as it was calculated on the 19th January last, when these figures were put in&mdash;at 5s. in £&mdash; are only something like 7 per cent. or 7½ per cent.  That is really the situation. Not only that, but it is clear to everyone that in the first two years there will be a loss on this undertaking.  During the period of tutelage, in which the Irish farmer all round&mdash;not the Irish <Col N="1556" /> farmer of a favoured district where he is already expert, having experience of the crop&mdash;is gaining experience, there will be a loss.  I say that to propose to handicap the company, as Deputy Johnson proposes, at the very moment when we are trying to use seductive measures to get the sugar factory established, would be to contradict and combat our own professions.  If we say we will limit arbitrarily the amount to be earned on this industry, why should it be worth while for a firm to come over here and set up a factory at all?  The difficulty we had with the Van Rossum group was to induce them to make a tender, and when they had made a tender, to adhere to it, and not throw up this country in despair.  The solid fact in all these negotiations is&mdash;it was emphasised repeatedly by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture&mdash;the extreme difficulty of getting foreigners to come over here and work this thing for us. If, at the very moment that we are in process of legalising the contract, we are to proceed to insert in the measure, introduced to that effect, limitations on the earnings, when all the time we are alive to the difficulties of the enterprise, are we not saying to them in effect: &ldquo;We really do not want you; what we have given with the right hand, we will take away with the left&rdquo;?  Anybody who is in earnest about the addition to Ireland's sources of wealth of an industry of this kind, would be much better pleased if, at the end of the ten years, it could be shown that this company had done well, because we look to the erection of other factories&mdash;and not one factory or two factories or three factories.</P>
    <P>Unquestionably this is an industry that would suit this country, and when the fruits of it will have become common knowledge in every district, as in the district around Thurles at the present moment, which is clamouring for a factory, every district in the country will be clamouring to have a factory set up and to have its share in the prosperity which this industry will give.  If we are going to frighten off now, in the initial stage, the company which is taking its courage in both hands to establish the industry, I think we are acting very foolishly, and I am not at <Col N="1557" /> all sure, though I am an optimist by conviction, that we will find it easy to set up factories later.  I have already pointed out what the conditions are that must be satisfied in order that a factory should be secured.  Nothing less, remember, in point of capital than between £300,000 and £400,000 is worth while.  Add to that the character of the locality, an ample supply of water, easy transport, and all the rest.  Unless this scheme we are adopting is an unexampled success, unless at the very earliest stage it exhibits itself as a great success&mdash;well cold water will have been thrown upon any other effort <Col N="1558" /> that might be made at a later stage to increase the number of factories.  I am glad to have it on the records of this House that Deputy Johnson is in favour of subsidies, for the reason that a subsidy is what he declared it to be.  I applaud his doctrine.  It is my own doctrine also.  But I oppose the amendment, if no no other grounds than that it is prejudicial to the whole enterprise, and that if, in a weak moment, we were to accept that amendment, we should really have jeopardised the whole thing for which we are contending.</P>

    <P>This amendment is really for the purpose of filling in the blanks that are left in the Schedule.  At the time the Bill was handed in we had not time to make all calculations.  Of course, it is necessary, just as Customs duty is charged at a low rate on sugar which is not of the same purity as sugar over 98 degrees, on which the highest Customs duty is charged, that the subsidy be graduated in the same way.  It is not intended in this factory that there should be any sugar of less than 98 degrees produced.  It may happen that through some accident in the manufacture, outside of the control of the people conducting the factory, that sugar of a lesser degree would be turned out, and the subsidy must be paid for that type of sugar at the appropriate rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, in the opinion of the Dáil, the object intended by the Dáil in the resolution of the 11th February, 1925, would not be achieved by the resolution adopted by the Seanad on the 12th June, 1925, and that a message to this effect be sent to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I might, perhaps, refer to portion of the statement which I made when introducing the original motion as showing the necessity for these Standing Orders. I am quoting from columns 157 and 158 of the Reports of 11th February.  I stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time there are no Standing Orders in the Saorstát relating <Col N="1565" /> to matrimonial matters.  This does not prevent the introduction of Private Bills dealing with such matters. On the contrary, it leaves it open to persons to introduce such Bills without complying with the formalities and safeguards which such Standing Orders would require.  It is, therefore, essential that Standing Orders on this subject should be prepared. In order to enable the Joint Committee satisfactorily to prepare the necessary Standing Orders, it is necessary that the House should come to a decision on the question of divorce <i>a vinculo matrimonii.</i>  On this subject there are different points of view, but I have no doubt but that I am right in saying that the majority of people of this country regard the bond of marriage as a sacramental bond which is incapable of being dissolved.  I personally hold this view.  I consider that the whole fabric of our social organisation is based upon the sanctity of the marriage bond and that anything that tends to weaken the binding efficacy of that bond to that extent strikes at the root of our social life. For these reasons I move the motion in the form in which it appears upon the Orders of the Day.</P>
    <P>It may be that in the future, and possibly the near future, legislation may be introduced to confer upon the Courts jurisdiction when granting decrees of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro,</i> to make provision for the children of the marriage and in respect of property. Such legislation would probably have the effect of relieving the Oireachtas of all matrimonial business, but it would not obviate the necessity for some Standing Orders to provide for cases in which such decrees are given from the date of the establishment of the Saorstát down to the date when such legislation may come into effect.</P>
    <P>The resolution adopted by the Dáil contemplated that the Standing Orders to be drawn up would prevent the introduction of Bills of divorce <i>a vinculo matrimonii.</i>  The Seanad, on the other hand, in the message which has just been read, propose that the Standing Orders will prevent Bills of this nature <Col N="1566" /> from being deemed to have been introduced under Standing Order 55, and will provide that such Bills must be read a first time in each House before they are further proceeded with in the Seanad.  I do not think the object of the Dáil would be achieved by the adoption of the suggestion of the Seanad, nor do I consider that suggestion a suitable alternative for the proposal put forward by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The matter is one of outstanding importance, and should be dealt with logically. Standing Orders constitute the machinery by which the Houses operate in considering and dealing with legislative proposals.  They are a means to an end, and their form must be determined by the end in view.  It therefore becomes essential at the outset to consider whether or not divorce <i>a vinculo matrimonii</i> will be granted in this State.  Until that question has been settled you cannot properly determine the question as to the form of your Standing Orders.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to speak for the Seanad, but I think I can speak for this House and for the vast majority of the citizens of this country.  Their attitude is expressed in the resolution passed by this House on the 11th February, and nothing has happened since to change my view that facilities for divorce <i>a vinculo matrimonii</i> would not and ought not to be granted.  If the House is in agreement with me on the foregoing, I would ask it to approach the question of Standing Orders from that point of view.  If it is not intended to grant divorce, surely the proper form of Standing Order is one which will prevent the introduction of such Bills.</P>
    <P>There are at least two objections, I think serious objections, to the alternative course suggested by the Seanad. It proposes to make provision for such Bills, and to that extent implies that the Bills may be dealt with and relief granted.  This will undoubtedly encourage persons to promote such Bills and to incur considerable expense in so doing.  It seems to me to be wrong to encourage or countenance such expense if there is no intention of granting relief, and this is the first ground on which I think this House should refuse <Col N="1567" /> to accept the suggestion put forward by the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The second objection is more serious. Under the Standing Orders contemplated by the Seanad a Bill for divorce <i>a vinculo matrimonii</i> may be introduced in either House.  Having failed to deal with Bills of this nature on principle, the Houses will be forced to deal with them individually.  This will or may involve the discussion and consideration of the particular facts of each individual case with all its unsavoury details.  I do not suggest that the House should refuse to consider or discuss any subject, however unsavoury, when the occasion really demands it.  I do, however, suggest that to do so when there is no intention of granting relief would be an unjustifiable waste of public time, and would serve no useful purpose either in the Oireachtas or in the country.</P>
    <P>I desire to say just one word as to the nature and effect of Standing Orders.  I have already referred to them as part of the machinery of legislation. They are rules of procedure which may be changed at any time by simple resolution.  It has been alleged that the Seanad proposal has the advantage that if in the future a complete change should come over the country, and both Houses, by a majority, were prepared to deal with and pass Bills of divorce, their powers to deal with them would not have been prevented. It is only necessary to consider the matter for a moment to see that there is no substance in this argument.  If in the future both Houses of the Oireachtas are prepared to pass such Bills, I do not apprehend that they will have much difficulty in changing the Standing Orders for the purpose.  A simple resolution passed by both Houses is all that is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not able to say whether this motion does express the opinion of the Dáil, as contained in the resolution of the 11th February. I do not know whether the object intended by the Dáil in that resolution could or could not be achieved by the adoption of this resolution from the Seanad; but I am confirmed in my view <Col N="1568" /> that the method of achieving the end which the President seeks, and which I am prepared to support, is a bad one; that whatever it may do regarding the effecting of a purpose, it is striking at Parliamentary rights, the rights of Deputies, and as I think, the rights of citizens in approaching the law-making authority.  The proposal of the President, which was adopted by the Dáil and which he re-affirms here to-day is that an officer of the two Houses shall be given the discretion of saying whether any Deputy or any citizen shall be entitled to approach the law-making authority in regard to certain matters of legislation.  I say that that is putting an obstacle in the way of members of the Oireachtas doing their duty, and it is putting an obstacle in the way of citizens approaching the law-making authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Seanad proposal would meet all the practical requirements of the case.  I admit that it will not meet the case of those who say that the House has no right, that it should be deprived of the right if it has it, to legislate upon a matter of the Sacraments.  The President has referred to the sanctity of the marriage bond, and in pursuance of the contention that the marriage bond is indissoluble he seeks to make it impossible for the legislature to consider a proposal to alter the legal status of married persons.  I submit that the whole contention is not in regard to the dissolution of the marriage bond, but in the alteration of the legal status of married persons.  I argued on the introduction of the original motion that it was a matter which affected an insignificant number of persons, and was a social matter, a matter mainly of property rights that was affected in the views of those who were seeking the dissolution of the legal marriage. But my main consideration in discussing this question is as to the rights of Deputies, the power of the legislature, and the rights of citizens to approach the legislature through their Deputies. The President has argued that Standing Orders are the means to an end, and the mere machinery; that is perfectly right, and that is what I desire to emphasise, the machinery for facilitating <Col N="1569" /> the passing or the consideration of legislative proposals, not as a means of preventing the discussion of legislative proposals.</P>
    <P>We have no right to consider this matter of Private Bill legislation as something essentially different from public legislation.  As far as we are concerned as a legislature, we are dealing with legislation, and it is purely a matter of convenience that we say that a certain procedure shall be followed in respect of private matters, matters for the particular interest or benefit of any person, or other matters of a much wider and more public interest.  It is purely a matter of convenience that we choose to have a separate set of Standing Orders to deal with private matters as distinct from public matters, and I want to impress upon the House that we have not to consider this matter in the light of Private Bill legislation as distinct from public legislation.  I think I am right in saying that it has been an axiom of law in these countries for several centuries that the citizen has the right to approach the law-making authority, to go past the Executive for the time being to the law-making authority, and the Dáil and Seanad, the Oireachtas, is the law-making authority.  We are here acting as Deputies for the citizens, and they approach the law-making authority, which is the collective body known as the Oireachtas, through the Deputies. We are Deputies for the citizens, and I hold that we must maintain this right to propose legislation upon any matter.</P>
    <P>Let us forget for a moment the particular question of divorce.  It is equally true to say that theft is a sin. Many times it is alleged that certain legislative proposals are confiscatory, are theft in other words.  It is a very short step from this proposal to throw upon an official of the House the responsibility, shall I say the privilege, of declaring whether a particular legislative proposal brought in by a Deputy or a Senator, as the case may be, is in order, if he deems it to involve the sin of theft.  It is necessary to state clearly how this matter strikes me. Last year there was passed an Indemnity Act.  At present there is lying <Col N="1570" /> under sentence of death a man for the crime of murder&mdash;not merely the crime of murder&mdash;in this case crime and sin are words that fit one into the other. Had that offence, or crime or sin, been committed&mdash;assuming guilt&mdash;in certain circumstances before a given date set forth in the Indemnity Act, it was quite possible, under the provisions of that Act, that the civil authority would have declared that that sin was not a crime, was not a civil offence, that it had never been committed, that it was never believed to have been a crime, because it was done in special circumstances.  It is a matter of civil legislation affecting what was believed to be the well-being of the State as a civil institution.  The Oireachtas, wisely or unwisely, passed an Act practically indemnifying persons from risk of prosecution for many offences&mdash;sins shall I say&mdash;which were and would have been deemed to be crimes, committed in other circumstances and at other times.</P>
    <P>This is not so far from the subject under discussion as it may seem, inasmuch as it shows that in respect to civil affairs the legislature has been free to legislate and to remove from the individuals concerned the onus of guilt, without saying anything at all about the sinfulness or otherwise of the act.  We have not been precluded hitherto from legislating in respect of crime, in respect of offences against order and good government.  I maintain that we are committing a very grave wrong to the principle of popular and representative Government if we deprive the citizens of the right to approach the law-making authority through Deputies on any subject whatsoever.  I think Deputies would be bound, if they have any regard for maintaining their rights and privileges, to introduce legislation to maintain that right, not as Private Bill legislation, but as public legislation. They would be bound to force the legislature to declare itself as to whether a Deputy is to be deprived of his right as a public representative.  I ask the Dáil not to consider this matter as Private Bill legislation, as distinct from public legislation, but as law-making, irrespective of how many or how few people it involves.</P>
    <P>It is on these grounds that I believe <Col N="1571" /> the Ministry is making a very grave mistake in standing by the resolution of last February.  Far better would it be to propose an amendment to the Constitution making it impossible to introduce legislation dealing with divorce. It would be infinitely better to do that than to try to rob Deputies of their rights through a Standing Order dealing with Private Bill legislation.  On these grounds I oppose the motion, although I must say it is a difficult motion to oppose, inasmuch as, if one opposed the original motion by speech, it is impossible to understand whether the resolution from the Seanad does give effect to the object intended by the Dáil in that resolution. Of course, it will be quite understood that in this matter I am speaking wholly and solely for myself, and I am opposing it on the constitutional ground of the right of the legislature to legislate.</P>

They have no right to come here if they infringe certain regulations that we lay down.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for permission to change the date of the selection by the Dáil, in Rule 11, from the 9th to the 8th July.  As to the points that were raised by Deputy Johnson on the last day, I have given very careful consideration to the discretion of the Returning Officer in this matter.</P>

      <P>The proposal is that on page 3, Rule 11, 9th be deleted and 8th inserted, so as to make it read: &ldquo;The voting shall take place <Col N="1573" /> at the sitting of Dáil Eireann on the 8th day of July, 1925.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have an understanding that the voting would take place early on that date, say from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m.&mdash;four hours.  If 10 a.m. is considered too early, I would be agreeable to make it 11 a.m., or whatever other hour would be considered reasonable.  I would ask that the voting be not carried any later than 2 p.m.  Deputies will know in a short time the reason why I am making that request.  It appears that quite a number of people will be coming here to the Pan-Celtic Congress, and there will be some function on the afternoon of that day.  I would like that the two things would not conflict.  I imagine that from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. would be a reasonable period.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil will have to assemble here.  It will then be a question as to how we can manage.  I think it would be better if we did the work in an hour.  Deputies cannot come in and vote merely.  Deputies must vote in the Dáil.  Postal votes cannot count.  There must be a meeting of the Dáil, and Deputies must attend.  The ballot papers are collected during that meeting.  One hour would really do. If it were agreed that we would sit from 12 noon to 1 p.m. it would suit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal is to amend two rules.  One of them is Rule 11, which would now read: <Col N="1575" />&ldquo;The voting shall take place at the sitting of Dáil Eireann on the 8th day of July, 1925.&rdquo;  That is substituting 8th for 9th.  There is a consequential alteration in Rule 14, which would now read: &ldquo;At or before the adjournment of Dáil Eireann, but not later than 2 o'clock in the afternoon of the 8th day of July, 1925, each Deputy shall deliver his voting paper to the returning officer.&rdquo;  I have to put the amendments separately, but as they are dealing with the same thing, more or less, I want both to be understood before I put the first.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest we should give consideration to the period of time which will be required by Deputies to mark ballot papers, under the P.R. system, with intelligence, where there may be 50 or 38 names.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  The adoption of this, if we agree on 2 o'clock as being the latest hour, would not prevent us adjourning, say, some day next week until 10 a.m. on the 8th July, or 11 a.m. on the same day.  I presume if a sufficient number of Deputies did not attend the Ceann Comhairle would probably adjourn the sitting until 12 noon, and then reassemble to see if a sufficient number was present.  We would then have two hours, and that period would be quite sufficient in which to mark ballot papers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it may be. I suppose on the assumption that the voters in the constituencies will not require two hours in which to mark their ballot papers, we ought to be content with less.  They may need two hours, but they will not get that time.</P>

      <P>According to Rule 7, the names of the persons nominated will be sent out not later than 7th July.  The voting will be on the 8th July.  By what method will the names be sent out?  Is it certain that they will reach Deputies in time?  If they are not sent out until the night of the 7th July they may not reach Deputies in time and Deputies would then be without the full list when it comes to the matter of voting.</P>

      <P>Nominations will be received as from the time of the passing of this Resolution. The nominations received will be sent out from day to day and Deputies will be kept up-to-date in regard to nominations. On the 7th July Deputies will not be in the position of not knowing anything about the nominations; they will know the persons nominated up to, say, the 3rd July.  The nominations made on the 7th July, the last nominations made, will have to be sent to the Dublin addresses of Deputies.  If a Deputy were not going to attend the <Col N="1577" /> Dáil, the list would be of no use to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>The President remarked that we might meet at 11 a.m. on the 8th.  That would mean that the country Deputies would have to travel up on the 7th July.  If the meeting were not held until 2 p.m. on the 8th we could come up that morning, and that is a consideration.  It is a matter of convenience that will apply to all country Deputies of different parties. We ought to arrange a sitting at 2 o'clock on the 8th.  Country Deputies can then come and get through this work of voting.  There is no reason why we should be here two days to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>This is Thursday, the 25th June.  We shall sit tomorrow, presumably, and we shall have, in the ordinary course, four days next week on which meetings will be held.  We are dealing with a Bill to-day which has yet to have its final reading.  Then it has to go to the Seanad and will possibly be amended. It will then come back to the Dáil. There are other matters of very great importance that have not yet been <Col N="1578" /> touched upon.  I do not know how long we will take to discuss them.  We are assuming too much if we think we shall be able to get through all the business in the next five days and that we shall not require to have a meeting on the 7th or 8th July or any day subsequently. We are assuming too much if we think it will be easy to get through the business in so many days.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputies prefer to leave this matter over for a couple of days, and have it put down for Tuesday, I am quite agreeable.  We would then be better able to judge whether we would have business for that week.  I do not anticipate we will.  I thought we would finish next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be perfectly in order, but I think the House generally would see the futility of a performance like that.  One Deputy could nominate a dozen candidates, but what would be the use?  It will take, practically, the support of three Deputies for any candidate to get nominated on the panel.  If five <Col N="1580" /> Deputies nominate ten candidates, those five Deputies will only be able to secure the return of two candidates on the panel.  Therefore, they are wasting their own time, as well as the time of the Dáil, by putting up a greater number.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>A difficulty may be found in getting four Deputies for different nomination papers.  It might facilitate some Deputies if it was understood that separate names were not required on each paper&mdash;that four Deputies, say, could deal with all the nomination papers that a party might think of sending in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the point.  The same four Deputies could nominate all the candidates for a party of, say, fourteen.</P>
      <P>Amendments put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Motion made&mdash;&ldquo;That the Dáil agree with the resolution as amended.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the President if there is to be a period of several days between the receipt of the first nomination and the day of election, whether it is intended to make public the names of the candidates which are received day by day, or whether it is intended that the electors &mdash;in this case the members of the Dáil&mdash; will be informed when the nominations are made, and only then, of those who have been nominated.  If that were the procedure it might save a great deal of log-rolling and canvassing and waste of public time.  If nobody knew who was nominated until the nominations were closed then, as I say, we would be saved a great deal of time, and the public would be saved a certain amount of curiosity and the pains consequent upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That cuts two ways.  Under one paragraph of the rules nominations, directly they are made, are to be circulated to Deputies. That has an advantage.  Take it that certain Deputies are interested in seeing a member of the medical profession <Col N="1581" /> nominated.  Several Deputies may have that in mind.  If they see that there is a doctor nominated and they are satisfied about the nomination, they need not trouble further.  As to keeping the matter secret, one can just picture how a secret will be kept by a hundred persons, each of whom will have a number of friends who will require to know the type of person nominated.  It would inevitably get out that certain persons had been nominated.  I think it is almost certain that directly nominations are handed in the names will appear in the Press.  I see a good deal of force in having the nominations sent to each Deputy once they are made. Say, for instance, a man is interested in the banking business.  He would like to see some prominent banker in the list of nominations, and there is a difficulty in his approaching other Deputies to see if there is any intention of nominating such a person.  He gets the return of nominations on a particular morning and he finds that there is such a person nominated.  That relieves him of trouble.  I think from the point of view of information, and from the point of view of the various institutions and interests in the country, that it is advisable to have information regarding the nominations published without delay.  I also think that once the information goes out to a large number of members of the House, it is inevitable that it should become public.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Should the returning officer make a representation to me or to the Executive Council that he needs legal assistance, I do not see any difficulty in the Executive Council acceding to a reasonable request of that sort.  But in view of the plainness of the electoral law on the question of disqualification of candidates for election to the Seanad, I cannot conceive any great difficulty arising or any matter arising which the returning officer would not himself be able to settle to the satisfaction of practically everybody. As regards one particular matter <Col N="1582" /> mentioned by Deputy Johnson the last day I am satisfied that no possible difficulty can arise in that connection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I still think that there is a flaw in this paragraph.  I realise that a returning officer must be able to say whether he accepts or rejects a particular nomination, but the phraseology of the paragraph is very definite and gives that returning officer not only power, but very grave responsibility to interpret not only the electoral law but the Constitution, and the disability or incapacity of any person according to the Constitution or the law.  Then it is provided that the decision of the returning officer as to whether the nomination paper is valid or invalid &ldquo;shall be final for all purposes.&rdquo; I do not suppose that it could be held that the returning officer's decision, on the authority of a resolution of the Dáil, would be finally above the law, but it may be argued that this is so very definite and conclusive that it involves more than would reasonably be looked for from the returning officer's position.  I do not understand the implications of the phrase &ldquo;shall be final for all purposes.&rdquo;  Why not, &ldquo;shall be final for this purpose?&rdquo; would like to have explained the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;shall be final for all purposes.&rdquo;</P>

So far as the phrase &ldquo;shall be final for all purposes&rdquo; is concerned, that is used in connection with the nomination by the Dáil and the formation of the Dáil panel.  To that extent, it really embraces &ldquo;all purposes&rdquo; and is final and conclusive.</P>

      <P>Amendment 1.&mdash;In Section 11 the words &ldquo;any such casual vacancy shall be filled at or before the second meeting of the Board after such vacancy occurs,&rdquo; added at the end of sub-section (1).</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 2.&mdash;In Section 16, before sub-section (3), page 8, a new sub-section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No person not being a licensed fisherman may sell anywhere on the public street or highway any salmon grilse, or trout except as a licensed vendor from premises rated or from any public rated market, municipal or corporate as the case may be.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee disagree with amendment 2.  The effect of this amendment would be to prevent, in the first instance, the brown trout fisherman from selling fish of his own catch.  That was a point that was discussed here in the Dáil, and we amended the particular section in the Dáil so as to permit the brown trout fisherman to sell fish of his own catch. It would also prevent the hawker from plying his particular trade.  In reference to those two particular points that I made in the Seanad, the Senator who put down this amendment said with regard to the brown trout business: &ldquo;I had not thought of brown trout.&rdquo;  And in connection with the point I made about the hawker, he said: &ldquo;When he put down this amendment it never entered my head that it was calculated to deprive hawkers of their means of livelihood.&rdquo;<Col N="1584" /> In spite of those admissions by the Senator who put down the amendment, the Seanad passed the amendment.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 3.&mdash;In Section 16, before sub-section (3) a new sub-section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any person who shall, after the expiration of two months from the commencement of this Part of this Act, buy any salmon or trout from any person whom he knows or has reason to believe to be selling the same in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding ten pounds.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in this amendment.  Amendment 3 really goes with amendment 6.  It provides penalties for the purchase of salmon from persons whom the purchaser knows, or has reason to believe, have no licences to sell salmon.  Amendment 6 provides that the licensed salmon dealer will display his licence so that the ordinary person will have every opportunity of knowing that the person is licensed.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in these amendments.  It was pointed out that the penalties were rather severe on these licensed dealers in salmon and trout and that therefore the notice of withdrawal of the licence should be given in writing, and be not merely verbal. This is the effect really of both amendments 4 and 5.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 6.&mdash;Before Section 21 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" />&ldquo;(1) Every holder of a licence or renewal of a licence issued under this Act for the sale of salmon or trout shall cause such licence or renewal to be displayed prominently in the place or one of the places to which such licence or renewal relates during business hours, and where such licence or renewal relates to more than one place shall cause a copy of such licence or renewal to be so displayed in all such places other than the place in which such licence or renewal is so displayed.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 6.  I pointed out before, this is a corollary to amendment 3, providing that the licensed dealer shall display prominently in his place of business his licence to sell salmon and trout, and also providing for the putting up of lists of licensed dealers in a prominent place to be specified afterwards by the Minister, in agreement, probably, with the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment 7.&mdash;In Section 21, before sub-section (2), a new sub-section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment 7.  A point was raised in connection with Section 21 that in the examination of the invoices of these dealers some of the officials might take an unfair advantage of the dealer by getting to know his prices, and after some discussion I agreed to put in some provision on the Report Stage in the Seanad, which would exclude the prices paid by the holder of the licence or renewal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Could not that cut two ways?  It may be often very desirable, especially in the case of trout, that the dealer should be forced by law to disclose the prices he paid.  As a general rule poached trout could be bought at the dealer's own price.  I think you might accept that as a principle, that the prices paid for trout killed by net, explosives or anything else are the dealer's own prices.  A number of these amendments are meant to safeguard the recognised licensed dealers at the expense of perhaps the less fortunate people engaged in the same trade.  I rather think that this amendment ought not to be accepted.  I do not think it will serve a very useful purpose. What could be wrong, if the officers of the Fishery Board are worthy of confidence at all, in disclosing the price the fish had been purchased at and the price that it is to be sold at? What hardship is inflicted on the dealer?  As I say, it leaves a loophole and it serves no purposes that I can see.  I would like to hear what reasons can be advanced in favour of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as keen as Deputy Gorey is on preventing any loopholes, but the point is that it may not be fair to a person in the ordinary course of his business to make him disclose the prices he is paying for his commodities. A man has a licence.  He has to show from whom he has bought the stuff, and it can be very easily found when he has the name on the register whether the person from whom he has bought is a poacher or not.  I think we are almost perfectly safeguarded from that point of view.  I admit that there was a point in what was put up in the Seanad, that it was not fair to ask a particular merchant to disclose his prices.  Of course, I hold that officials would not disclose the information.  At any rate, it might not be fair to ask them to disclose the information to officials who might use it for the benefit of friends who are rivals in the trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out that that is a very unlikely thing to take place.  You contend that you have the right to demand from whom the dealer gets his fish.  That is all right with regard to salmon, but I say it is <Col N="1587" /> not quite right with regard to trout. A series of names could be on the register with regard to trout, but nobody could tell whether the trout were taken by rod or not.  Trout fishermen are not licensed, and you have no means of dealing with them.  You are not safeguarded, and I say that this amendment, for all the good it will do to dealers, should not be accepted.  It leaves a loophole that is not guarded against.  I admit that there is sufficient care with regard to salmon licences. People who sell salmon can be traced, but the poacher with regard to trout cannot be traced, and I think the Minister knows that.  A dealer could have the name of half a dozen people in a district on his books, but these people could say that they caught the trout with rods, when such might not have been the case at all.  I say you have no protection, and the amendment ought not to be accepted.  The price does not give you very much safeguard either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill introduced to preserve fish in the rivers and not <Col N="1588" /> to deal with trade.  While it may be very necessary and very helpful to have a list given by the dealer of the people he bought fish from, of course the question of price could be arranged.  When asked about the price of fish he could say he bought it at a certain price, which may be the price he actually paid for it, but the chances are that that would not be so.  But, if an official of a public board can be charged with or suspected of giving away confidential information supplied in connection with a matter like this, I say there can be no confidence in any of your boards or departments.  What could be said of this department could be said of others&mdash;the Department of Justice, the Department of Agriculture and other departments.  It knocks the whole idea of confidence in the officials of public boards on the head.  If Deputy Good objects to that we will argue out that question.  Why exception should be taken to the officials of this department on the grounds of conveying information is a matter I cannot understand, and I cannot understand Deputy Good's point of view on it.</P>

As a matter of fact, I expected that it would have been ruled out of order in the Seanad.  Section 27 provides machinery for the making and repealing of bye-laws.  Bye-laws are made really to deal with local matters rather than with general matters, taking the country as a whole, and the procedure in the making of bye-laws is something like this:&mdash;Certain persons feel that they are aggrieved; they send a request to the Department for an inquiry, and a public inquiry is held in the locality, due notice of which is given in the local papers and by means of notices posted up at Gárda Síochána barracks and post offices.  An inspector of the Department holds an inquiry, hears evidence <i>pro</i> and <i>contra</i> and makes a report to the Minister.  The Minister reads the report, if necessary referring to the evidence, and decides whether or not the bye-law should be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to correct a statement that I made in the other House, in fairness to the Senator who put down this amendment. I said there was an inquiry in 1902, but I should have said that it was in 1910.  It was then proposed to substitute two or three new bye-laws for the existing bye-laws.  The proposed new bye-laws were appealed against by, amongst others, the riparian owners on the Lee, a number of net fishermen in Cork, the Blackrock and Cork Workingmen's Salmon Anglers Club, the Cork Harbour Commissioners, the Macroom Rural and Urban districts, and subsequently the Admiralty.  It went to the Privy Council on appeal and the bye-laws were rejected.  I feel that if an injustice has been done or is being done by the existing bye-laws in Cork the way to deal with it is to hold a public inquiry and go through the <Col N="1593" /> ordinary procedure for changing bye-laws. As a matter of fact a considerable time ago I promised the Senator who put down this amendment that I would have an inquiry held there and that if a just case were put up to me I would modify the existing bye-laws or make new bye-laws to meet the situation. I think that would be a better procedure than the putting of this into a statute.  After all, a case might arise later where it might be necessary to have another bye-law, and I do not really know what the position would be; it would be extremely awkward for me to make a bye-law if a provision of this kind were made by the Oireachtas. That is a matter regarding the general principle of the thing.</P>
    <P>Apart from that of course the amendment as it stands would require a great deal of re-drafting.  It refers to a bye-law of the conservators of No. 5 area.  There is no such thing as a bye-law of conservators in this country; bye-laws are made by the central fisheries authority.  In the second place there is no place defined by law as No. 5 area.  At the end of paragraph 1 licensed fishing boats are referred to. There is no provision for licensing fishing boats; so that there are a great many defects in drafting, apart altogether from the general principle of the amendment.  There are other defects also, but these are the glaring ones in the drafting which I did not advert to in the Seanad because I thought on the ordinary general principle that the Seanad could not agree to the amendment.  It was asking a body to decide on purely local matters of which it could not possibly have sufficiently local information with which to make a decision.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the Minister has asked the Dáil to reject this amendment.  Of course I quite see the Minister's point with regard to the holding of an inquiry as an ordinary principle, and it would probably carry some weight.  But an inquiry has already been held, as the Minister pointed out, and it cost a considerable sum of money.  The greater portion of the cost of course fell on the backs of the poor fishermen, who cannot possibly afford another similar inquiry. <Col N="1594" /> The cost, I understand, ran into hundreds of pounds, and senior counsel were engaged.  The opposing parties mentioned by the Minister are far removed from this particular area.  Some of the interested parties who opposed the fishermen's case, the fishermen who lived in the area in question and who made their living there, lived in Cork and outside Cork, certain sections who were interested in angling, perhaps for sport.</P>

      <P>They never fish in this area at all; their work is confined to Blackrock, which is, I suppose, at least eight miles from the area that we are discussing.  They went further. When the case was going against them and when the inspectors of the Department of Fisheries had held this inquiry and reported, it was then that these people, the conservators, went out, one must assume, and pulled in all these parties who had no interest at all in the matter, and finally they had to approach the British Admiralty in order to defeat the ends of justice. The British Admiralty put up the case that drift nets would interfere with the periscopes of submarines entering the harbour.  Until the European War I do not think we saw a submarine in the harbour half a dozen times in a dozen years, but it was on that point that they scored.  The British Admiralty protested that these drift nets, which Deputies will realise are light in weight, would interfere with the periscopes.  But we must not forget that much deeper and stronger nets, draft nets, mackerel nets, have been used continually day in and day out all along the coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular by-law is peculiar only to Cork Harbour.  There are drift nets all round the coast and even in Youghal there are eighty-six drift nets working inside the harbour, and they are in every other harbour in the Saorstát.  We merely ask that the by-laws be amended, and if the Minister <Col N="1595" /> gives us an assurance that even now, on the report of the inspectors who reported favourably on this case in 1910, he will amend or modify that by-law in favour of these particular men without putting them to any further expense, I will withdraw my objection, but I think we should get such an assurance.</P>

      <P>I cannot give any such assurance.  I have already promised to hold an inquiry.  I do not see the necessity for any costs in connection with it, except the cost of witnesses coming to the inquiry.  This is not the kind of inquiry where it is necessary to bring a good many counsel.  It is a question of fact.  If an inquiry is held, and these persons come along, make an ordinary plain case, and state the facts before the inspector, a note will be taken of them and a decision will be given accordingly.  There is no British Admiralty now that Deputy Hennessy or the Senator who put down this amendment need worry about to defeat the ends of justice.  The report of the inquiry will be brought before me.  I have already promised that the inquiry shall take place as soon as I can make an inspector available, and I have no doubt, if the justice of the case merits it, that some provision such as is outlined in this amendment will be the outcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a case where local knowledge must have considerable weight.  I am curious to understand why it should be necessary to legislate to give the powers defined in this new proposed section.  If there is a by-law preventing fishermen, who are licensed to fish with drift nets in No. 5 area, from embarking the same from any public strands, shore, pier, jetty, slip or stairs, and preventing them from carrying their nets to the fishing ground and returning with them, then I think it is <i>prima facie</i> at all events, desirable that the by-law should be cancelled.  It is desirable that these liberties should be granted to the fishermen.  They are licensed to fish with drift nets, but apparently they are prevented from carrying their nets in their boats to <Col N="1596" /> and from certain places, and that is all due to the operations of a by-law. If it requires a section to be put into an enactment to ensure that this liberty will be allowed, then we ought not to oppose the Seanad in inserting this section, notwithstanding any faults of construction.  If the Minister proposes to amend the phraseology for the purposes of construction, I am sure there would be little difficulty.  If the by-law has been framed in such a way as to prevent the exercise of these liberties, then I think we will be justified in disagreeing with the Minister's motion, and agreeing with the section inserted in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Speaking in general terms, I think it is desirable to give certain consideration to the claims of the fishermen who are working for a living at the mouths of the rivers in preference&mdash;if there is to be a preference&mdash;to anglers who are angling for sport.  I imagine that the genesis of this bye-law is that the conservators have been conserving anglers' rights, rather than fishing rights.  If the local knowledge of Deputies supports the Seanad proposal, I am prepared to support them, if they divide the Dáil on the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's viewpoint, that the question of bye-laws should not be touched in the Bill.  It is outside the province of the Bill.  By-laws have always been dealt with by the boards of conservators and should not be dealt with in a Bill Representatives from a particular district, who are subject to local influences, cannot be said to take an impartial view of these matters.  Individuals living within a certain area where the privileges are sought, could not be expected to have an open mind in the matter.  Nobody could be more competent to come to a proper decision in the matter than the conservators of the area.  Fishery laws cannot be made to serve the interests of one particular section.  They must be made and framed to serve the interests of the whole district.  It must be remembered that there are people who are absolutely dependent on fishing for a living above this particular point that is in <Col N="1597" /> dispute, and that they have equal rights with those who are living below them. I know nothing about the circumstances of this particular case, but I can quite easily visualise a position in which more people are earning their living from fishing above this particular point than below it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HENNESSY Mr. HENNESSY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>It is reasonable to assume that some years ago we had more autocrats on the boards of conservators than we have now, and that they framed the bye-laws in their own interests, rather than in the interests of the ordinary fishermen.  I contend that that is what has taken place in this particular case.  The fishermen in this area, going out to sea, which is ten miles away from them, are not allowed to take the nets in their boats.  They can row the boats out, but they must carry their nets overland, a distance of about fifteen miles, before they can reach the fishing ground.  If they catch fish outside, they must send the fish and the nets back by land, and row their boats back empty.  Why should that be?  If the people of Youghal and the adjoining port are fishing in this particular area, there are no by-laws framed to prevent them doing so, but if they have to run from bad weather into the harbour of Cobh, they run the risk of forfeiting their boats, fish and nets owing to this by-law.  Formerly there was an important fishing industry in that area, but this by-law has killed it.  Numbers of men, with their families, have been deprived of their livelihood because of this by-law, framed in the interest of a particular section of the community.  It is time that the Dáil took cognizance of that, and I ask the Minister to modify the by-law in the interest of those who fish for a livelihood.</P>

Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that what the Deputy said was correct, that these by-laws were framed by people who had no right to frame them.  In this Bill we are remedying that.  Under the Bill new by-laws are going to be framed by different bodies altogether, <Col N="1598" /> bodies which the Dáil has had a voice in the creation of.  These new bodies will frame the future by-laws, so that we are not dealing with by-laws made in the past.  We should let the new boards of conservators frame these by-laws.  There is no use talking about the past.</P>

The aim of this amendment is to override that power.  If the case put up by Deputy Hennessy is a good case, and if the facts he states are true, then I have no doubt what the result of the inquiry will be.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DOHERTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to ask the Committee to reject this amendment. On two occasions, before the Bill went to the Seanad, this question was fully discussed in the Dáil, and on a division the Minister was worsted.  The main ground on which, I think, the Dáil should not accept the amendment is that the Senators were absolutely unaware of what they were doing.  They were talking of draft nets, of fixed nets and of weirs, but the question of drift nets was entirely misunderstood.  Draft nets are the trouble in fishing.  They are used at the mouths of rivers by the owners of the fisheries.  Drift nets are <Col N="1599" /> used by the fishermen who fish on the high seas.  To compare these, or to mix them up, one with the other, is to prejudice the unfortunate fishermen on whom this additional tax is being put. I happened to see in the <i>Irish Times</i> some days ago a letter from a conservator in Limerick who appears to have understood this question thoroughly. It is a tribute to the Minister and I hope he will accept it.  The letter reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The new Fishery Bill is as welcome as the flowers in May, and, if properly enforced, should open a new and mightier page for the salmon industry of Ireland.  There is one fatal mistake in it&mdash;and one only, as far as my opinion goes&mdash;and that is leaving the draft or seine net duty at £4. Certainly 60 per cent. of salmon are captured by draft nets, and a whole river can be, and often is, cleaned out of fish by these nets, which surround the fish and draw the whole lot ashore.</P>
      <P>Fish must mesh in drift nets, and, in fact, they have a sporting chance in every kind of net or engine except alone the draft or seine nets, from which there is no chance of escape. Salmon are scarce all over the country after three years of lawlessness, when they were killed for twelve months in the year by every known means.  They should get a chance now that law and order obtain once more.  I doubt if any drift net (for which £4 licence duty is also proposed) has ever captured 100 salmon in a day.  I have personally seen 386 fish taken by a draft net in a single haul of twenty minutes' actual fishing, and I have taken 426 salmon myself with one draft net from 6 a.m. until 10 a.m.&mdash;four hours actual fishing.  I believe that as many as 1,700 fish have been taken by one draft net in one haul or draw in the Moy, at Ballina.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That letter was sent by Mr. George F. Hewson, of the Limerick Board of Conservators. I think that gentleman knows what he is talking about.  I know that in the rivers in Donegal where these draft nets are used by the <Col N="1600" /> owners of fisheries, there is great destruction of salmon.  Salmon are caught in great numbers by these draft nets at this particular time of the year, when salmon fishing is going on.  The fish go up the rivers with the high tide and, finding the river low, they rush back with the ebbing tide again.  A draft net is drawn across the mouth of the river, and outside that draft net the fish cannot go.  They are caught in hundreds, and even in thousands.  The drift net fishermen, the poor men for whom fishing means part of their income, have to fish five and ten miles from the mouth of the river.  Probably not one of the fish get out of the river at all, These men have to pay a heavy licence duty and their catch is not at all comparable with what can be done by the men owning the draft nets.  It is an abominable shame.  The House before recognised that there was no legal right to enforce a licence on the deep sea fishermen, but acting in conformity with the Minister's wish, because we all support the purposes of the Bill, we agreed that any person handling salmon in any way should be registered in some direction, and we agreed that a £2 registration licence should be placed on the drift net salmon fishermen. That was a proposal that went to the Seanad, and the Seanad, without stating any grounds, and merely as a compromise out of a difficulty which they did not quite understand, imposed a licence of £3.  I would ask the House to reject the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I would rather be inclined to say that this House passed the amendment not quite grasping what they were doing.  Now, Deputy O'Doherty has attacked the draft net men as against the drift net men.  He has endeavoured to allege that the persons who use draft nets are fishery owners.  As a matter of fact, there are more ordinary working fishermen employed using draft nets by the owners of draft nets than there are employed in the matter of drift nets.  With all respect to the conservator whom the Deputy has referred to, I would say, if I would not be accused of using a vulgarism, that he was talking through his hat when he mentioned that 60 per <Col N="1601" /> cent. of salmon are captured by draft nets.  He had only experience as a member of the Limerick Board of Conservators. He is, I believe, actually a Kerryman.</P>

      <P>This is an attempt to reduce the existing licence duty on drift nets from £3 to £2.  On the Committee Stage of this Bill the licence duty was reduced to £2.  The Seanad is really bringing the matter back to the original position by suggesting £3. The object of the Bill, which Deputy O'Doherty affects to laud, is to provide funds for the conservation of fisheries. This has always been in the past, and we hope it will be in the future, the chief source from which the conservators derive their funds&mdash;the licence on fishing engines, whether they be rod, net, weir, or any other type utilised in the catching of fish.  Instead of providing more funds for the boards of conservators, or even leaving the funds as they are, with a licence duty of £3 on the drift net, Deputy O'Doherty wants to reduce that amount to £2.  I hope the Dáil will not accept Deputy O'Doherty's views and will, instead, accept the Seanad amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support Deputy O'Doherty's view, but for somewhat different reasons.  I want to ask the Dáil to insist on retaining authority <Col N="1602" /> in respect to the imposition of duties or taxes upon the people, or any section of the people, under their own supervision.  I am not alleging for a moment that the Seanad has gone outside the letter of its authority, but it has been insisted that the imposition of taxation should be retained in the hands of the Dáil.  Now, the Dáil quite explicitly and quite clearly, by formal vote, decided that it was not prepared to impose upon fishermen of a particular kind a greater licence duty than £2. When the Dáil set that forth clearly and by formal resolution, after proper consideration and after division, then I submit to the Dáil that we should insist on retaining that authority in our hands and we should not encourage the Seanad to attempt to raise taxes or duties that are being imposed upon the people.  The Dáil decided that £2 was enough.  Now the Seanad comes along and says: &ldquo;No, we disagree with you; we propose to increase the tax upon the people.&rdquo;  I think we ought to resent that proposition and we ought to maintain our authority, if it is only as an indication to the Seanad that we are very jealous of our privileges in that respect and we are not going to encourage the Seanad to limit to any degree those privileges.  It may be that this is a small matter to raise a high point of constitutional rights upon; but it is better it should be raised on a small point and I hope the House will insist on maintaining the rates of duties to be charged for licences as the Dáil decided.  It should not allow its original decision to be deflected in this particular instance at any rate.</P>

      <P>As to the other point &mdash;that we should stiffen our necks and not allow ourselves to be overridden by the Seanad&mdash;let me say that the Seanad could retaliate by holding up every piece of legislation passed here.  If the Seanad chose to do so, it could hold up <Col N="1603" /> all legislation for nine months.  If every amendment coming from the Seanad is met in that type of spirit, and if every suggestion of ours in the Seanad is met in the same spirit, it will not tend towards the ease with which work should be carried on.  I think Deputy Johnson's suggestion should not commend itself to the Dáil.  It is a very bad suggestion.</P>

      <P>Does Deputy Johnson raise a constitutional point as to the right of the Seanad to make any such amendment?  My conception of the relationship between the two Houses is that if we send a Bill up to the Seanad we cannot analyse every detail of that Bill to ascertain if the decision of the Seanad is only to be taken on certain clauses of that Bill.  We send the Bill up as a whole.  If a Bill is declared to be a Money Bill, then, of course, the Seanad have no authority in the matter. But to lay down a regulation that because certain sums of money are incidentally mentioned in a Fisheries Bill sent up to the Seanad, the Seanad is to have no voice regarding that measure is, I think, stretching the relationship between the two Houses to an absurd point.  I could not express any opinion on the merits as to whether £2 or £3 is the right sum.  We originally specified £2.  The Seanad, on further consideration, suggest £3.  That comes down to us with a recommendation from the Minister that he thinks the Seanad is right in the figure.  That is all the guidance we have got, and we have to make up our minds.  To raise a constitutional point between the two Houses on a matter of this kind is to do what the Minister for Finance suggested in my case at one time&mdash;trailing our coats before one another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCULLOUGH</NameTxt>
      <P>Let it not be forgotten that the Dáil has already agreed to the fixing of a sum of £2 as a tax on these nets.  While I do not want to deal with Deputy Johnson's point, at the same time it is the prerogative and privilege of this House to deal with matters concerning money and taxation.  I do not think the Minister would bring too much pressure on the House to alter the decision already taken, after full consideration, especially in view of the fact that this taxation is going on fishermen who go out to sea&mdash;the men who use drift nets. It must be remembered that the fishing industry has passed through a very thin time during the past few years. To increase the initial charges upon the <Col N="1605" /> fishermen who have to go out to fish with drift nets, is to make it more difficult to get the fishing industry going properly again.  At all events, the incidence of this taxation falls upon the poorer class of fisherman and I think this House would be doing an unjust and an unwise thing if it revoked the decision already come to and altered the taxation by fifty per cent.  That amount does not seem large as regards the number of pounds, but the change represents 50 per cent. increase on the amount fixed by this House.  I hope the Committee will not agree to the amendment.</P>

      <P>With regard to the constitutional point raised by Deputy Johnson, I think he has stretched his doctrine rather too far.

      <P>It is a very important point.  The amendment was moved at a comparatively late hour in the evening.  It was carried, if my recollection is right, by a very small majority, and it would not have been carried by any majority if Ministers had not seized the opportunity of the Fisheries Bill to take a night off.  The majority was a very slender one and the division was taken rather late at night. Does Deputy Johnson contend that the Seanad has no right to appeal from&mdash;I shall not say from Philip drunk to Philip sober because that might be offensive to the dignity of the Dáil&mdash; but from our rather hasty judgment to our more mature judgment.  Even on a Finance Bill the Seanad has the right to make recommendations.  This Bill not being certified as a Money Bill, the Seanad was forced to send up its amendments in this form.  They could not send them in the form of recommendations. I look upon these amendments as recommendations from the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The Dáil has not stood by its decision in the past in matters of finance.  Last year, on the Finance Bill, the Seanad made a recommendation and the Dáil adopted that recommendation.  So far as I remember, Deputy Johnson voted with the majority against the Government in adopting that recommendation.  I am quite sure that we could not have carried it against the Government without the help of the Labour Party.  I think it is setting constitutional doctrine on altogether too high a pinnacle to say that the Seanad should not have the right to suggest reconsideration of certain provisions of a Bill.  In this case, they have suggested a compromise between the rate of £4 and £2, which was Deputy O'Doherty's amendment.  I think that is well within their function, and I cannot see why it is assumed to be necessary to our prestige, or anything of that kind, to throw the amendment back in their teeth.  If there are good arguments for the amendment let us weigh those arguments, but do not let it be put to us that we must simply, to prevent the Seanad interfering in matters of finance, refuse even to listen to their suggested amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>In listening to the debate, I learned for the first time that this licence was fixed by the Dáil at £2.  I knew that the Bill contained a provision fixing this licence duty at £4, and right through that Bill, from top to bottom, the raising of duties obtained. An Advisory Committee put up recommendations for the provisions of this Bill.  All sections had representation on that Committee.  These drift and draft net fishermen had representation on it, and it was agreed by all those interested that this should be the scale.  The scale was adopted in every instance except this one.  I am wondering when this happened, because I have no recollection of being present when <Col N="1607" /> this arrangement was come to by the Dáil.  It is not treating the people who are responsible for the Bill&mdash;the body of fishermen&mdash;fairly, to adopt this attitude of reducing the licence to £2. Under the old method, it was £3.  It was agreed to raise all the other licences.  It was also agreed to raise this licence from £3 to £4.  Now, they are grumbling at having it fixed at £3. Deputy Johnson raised a constitutional point.  He is trying to pit the Dáil against the Seanad, absolutely regardless of the ethics of the case or of what is right or wrong or sound or unsound. He is trying to pit our pride against the pride of the members of the Seanad and <i>vice versa.</i>  That would be all very well if it would have any effect on the judgment of Deputies here.  I would have stood for the £4.  When I cannot stand for the £4, I certainly would stand for the £3.  Some advantage must have been taken of the Dáil here.  I would agree with Deputy Cooper that it must have been very late altogether when this division was taken.  Perhaps that explains the decision.</P>

As regards the point made by Deputy Johnson, he does not dispute the right of the Seanad to put this amendment in, but he does suggest&mdash;and I agree with him thoroughly&mdash;that this is a type of decision that the Dáil, having come to once, should stand by.  The Minister, in his Bill, put £4 forward as the proper tax to pay on this particular type of net.  After full and careful consideration and after every Deputy had an opportunity of debating the matter, a division was taken and the Dáil deliberately declared that the tax should be £2.  Nothing has taken place since, and no new arguments have been put <Col N="1608" /> forward, as far as I know&mdash;I read the debate that took place last time&mdash;to convince one that the figure should be changed.  The Dáil took a decision on that occasion.  Is there any reason why the Dáil should go back on that decision? Is it to go back on that decision simply because the Seanad fell in with the views of the Minister upon the matter?</P>

      <P>I leave it at that. On the important point raised by Deputy Johnson, I think it should be declared as a principle that this House has the right to fix taxation and to fix the duty that should be paid by the people by way of taxes.  Apart from that, I think the case made by Deputy O'Doherty on the merits now, and on a previous occasion, is a case that is worthy of support.  The type of man engaged in this class of fishing, and the particular place in which he fishes, go to show that the decision come to by the Dáil was correct.  They are of the very poorest type of fisherman and they come from the Gaeltacht, which it is the object of everybody to help economically.  I think it would be a very unwise proceeding, on the part of the Dáil, to depart now from the decision which they came to on a previous occasion, especially as no new arguments have been brought forward except the argument of Deputy Cooper, that the Dáil on that occasion came to <Col N="1609" /> a decision which they should not have come to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HENNESSY Mr. HENNESSY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the high constitutional doctrines introduced into the debate, I think we, Deputies, can face the simple facts and deal with them.  We are anxious to encourage the fishing industry or we are not.  Do we advance that industry by inflicting undue hardships on the men engaged in it?  We do not.  In this particular case we have men going out five miles in the open sea with drift nets from 1,200 to 1,500 yards long.  We know exactly what the 1,500 hundred yard drift net is in the open sea and the chances there are of catching fish in that net.  Our own common sense will come to our aid in considering these matters.  Take the chances of the man with the draft net at the mouth of a river.  Deputy O'Doherty has pointed out to us, and any of us who ever went fishing can realise it, that he has all the chances on his side. He catches all the fish going out, because his net blocks the estuary, and even if he does pay a £4 licence he can pretty well afford it, whereas the men who go out in the deep sea, five, six or seven miles, are getting a very small percentage of fish and they should not be asked in equity or justice to pay the same licence as the man who has a net stretched across an estuary meeting fish as they go out.</P>
      <P>Surely if we wish to encourage the fishermen around our coast to go in for deep sea fishing, as we have been trying to do; we are not going to do it by raising the cost of the licence by £1 or £2, as the case may be. We know perfectly well that for some years past the fishing industry is in a decaying condition and that the fishermen are not going out to sea for many reasons.  Surely we ought not to give them an excuse for tying up their nets and boats by increasing the licence. These are simple facts that we ought to face and decide on.  I am certainly not in favour of increasing the licence on these men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can relieve his mind.  We are not increasing the licence.  As has been said, at least half a dozen times, this is merely leaving it as it has been.  Three pounds is the <Col N="1610" /> licence on a drift net and the proposition of the Seanad is that it remain the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>For fifty years.  And if it was equitable to inflict a £3 licence 50 years ago I would like to know what would be equitable to-day.  At any rate the proposition before the Dáil is that we should leave things as they are as far as the licence is concerned.  The Deputy tries to weave a web around the question that is before us.  He brings in the question of encouraging or discouraging fishing.  He talks about the open sea, as if in Cork as well as in Tirconaill these men fish in the open sea.  For the information of the Dáil, they do not.  The only place in Ireland where drift fishing for salmon takes place is in Tirconaill. That is why they are allowed to have a net of 1,500 yards.  Most of the men affected by this amendment are men who do not go to the open sea at all.  In all other parts, including the Shannon estuary, draft nets are used and because of the fact that they are used in these places they are limited to a much shorter area than they are at Tirconaill.  I would like that Deputies would not get away from the idea behind the licence duties, that is fishery preservation.  The salmon rod at the moment is taxed by this Bill to the extent of £2.  The poor angler that many Deputies were speaking about has to pay £2, and £3 is the licence for a 1,500 yards drift net.  Deputy O'Doherty says that a salmon rod kills as many salmon as a 1,500 yards drift net.</P>

      <P>If I had the Official Report I could prove it.  Deputy O'Doherty said that in Tirconaill a 1,500 yards drift net, nine miles out from the coast, did as little execution &mdash;I think that was the word he used&mdash; as a salmon rod in the upper waters.</P>

      <P>You are slightly improving.  From scientific information&mdash;I am sure the Minister's staff will be able to find it&mdash;it has been proved that the damage done in catching salmon by drift nets in the high <Col N="1611" /> seas corresponds to the damage done on the river by a salmon rod.  That is a very different thing to what the Minister tried to impress the Dáil with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see it.  At any rate, my scientific information does not bear out what Deputy O'Doherty says. I think this is a fair proposition, that at least when we increase the licences on all other fishing engines, as they have been increased in recent years&mdash;the salmon rod, the draft net, and so on&mdash; the licence on this particular engine should not be reduced.  I repeat that the person who uses a drift net&mdash;the ordinary working fisherman&mdash;is no poorer than the man who uses a draft net.  Except in Tirconaill they all fish in exactly the same type of place&mdash;in the estuary&mdash;as the draft net men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DOHERTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is only fair to the Minister that I should reply to some of his statements.  He referred to this fishing in the estuaries.  As a matter of fact he produced figures on the Second Reading showing that 95 per cent. of the salmon fishing was done in Tirconaill, where they all fished on the high seas.  He has not told us that now.  The few salmon caught in Kerry, Limerick, Clare and around there are only 5 per cent. of the fishing that is done in that particular industry. Five per cent. of the fishing is done inshore and at the estuaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon.  I said about 95 per cent. of the catch, which is a different thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephODoherty" hpid="Mr. O'DOHERTY Mr. O'DOHERTY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DOHERTY</NameTxt>
      <P>It amounts to the same thing.  Ninety-five per cent. of the catch corresponds to 95 per cent. of the destruction of the salmon.  I do not accuse the Minister in any way of having any personal feeling in this matter, but I could not help thinking, as I heard him both here and in the Seanad delivering himself against these drift net men, that he was playing the part of the devil's advocate.  The Minister for Fisheries should display at least some paternal care for these people.  What is the care he has shown for these drift net fishermen in the North-west of Ireland?  He strained <Col N="1612" /> every point against them both here and in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooper referred to the interference with the salmon.  I was present at that discussion.  About twenty years ago, when I was listening to a religious discussion in Hyde Park, a man asked one of the orators, on the question of eternal punishment, was he likely to be condemned to the pit?  The lecturer told him that he might escape on a clause called invincible ignorance.  I never knew what precisely invincible ignorance was until listening to the Seanad the other day discussing the question of drift net fishing.  There was not a single Senator&mdash;and I am not saying this in an offensive way&mdash;who spoke on the Bill&mdash;I am aware that there were two or three who understood the question, but they did not speak&mdash; who knew precisely what he was talking about in relation to drift nets. They were mixing drift nets with all kinds of nets, and the real position was not understood.</P>
      <P>The Earl of Kerry, who spoke with some knowledge, said that these men fished in the estuaries.  He was thinking of Dingle, which the Minister probably knows pretty well; but the fishing which I am appealing to the House for is the fishing that is done on the high seas off the West Coast of Donegal, where 95 per cent. of this fishing is done.  To permit the Seanad, without knowledge and without any particular reason to change the deliberate view of this House in fixing a licence at £2 is a thing that I ask the Dáil not to do.</P>

      <P>We have heard of the woes of these particular fishermen.  As regards draft nets and drift nets, I do not know the difference between them, but I know the difference between a landing net and a drift net.  The man who uses a single rod has got to pay £2.  He agreed to change the old licence from £1 to £2 in order to find funds for a common object, namely, the preservation of fish.  The whole of them agreed that it was necessary to increase this common fund.  When Deputies talk about rod men being sportsmen, I say they are out for a living, and the returns will show that. It is a misstatement of the facts to say <Col N="1613" /> that they are sportsmen.  They are poor people, just as poor as the people who go out in those boats that Deputy O'Doherty speaks of.  He said that very seldom did he hear of more than 100 fish being killed in one haul.</P>

When men sit down at a table and come to an agreement, and when they break away from that agreement, they are called rats and scabs.  Evidently somebody on behalf of these men created a discussion here, and I am inclined to believe that it was with their authority somebody in their behalf took them away from the position they agreed to accept, that is, to increase the common fishery fund of this country. When it is right for other classes of fishermen voluntarily to agree that the licence duties should be increased 100 per cent., why is it suggested that this particular class of licence should be decreased 50 per cent.?  I would like that that particular aspect of the case be considered.  I think the whole principle of this reduction in this particular case is wrong.  If there was an agreement&mdash;and the fishermen and their representatives afreed to a certain thing &mdash;it is not right for any of them to break away from it, and it is not right for any of the Deputies to scab on their behalf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gorey or any other Deputy who argues for maintaining the licence at the former figure does so because the amount has been increased in the case of other fishermen. What one has to consider is that the conditions in the areas where these fishermen live, the conditions in the congested areas on the north-west coast of Tirconaill and the conditions of men who fish for salmon and trout in inland rivers are entirely different.  We all know that the case of these men in the congested areas is terribly difficult.  It was the problem that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture had before us a few days ago, the problem of what was to be done with the congests on our western seaboard.  We cannot separate that from this problem; these are the people we are really discussing.  If men are to pay a certain tax before they can go to sea to fish I think we have heard enough of the fishery conditions <Col N="1615" /> to understand that we cannot get men on these coasts to do so; they are not equipped, and because of that fact they are a drain on the finances of the State.  Deputies from these counties have to plead for relief schemes to give employment to them.  There is no question whatever that that is the situation, and it is not fair to make a comparison between the remnant of the Gaelic population, the people dwelling in the congested areas, and the people who can fish with rod and line on the Shannon or other rivers, partly for pleasure and partly for profit.  I do not think it would be wise for this House to make that comparison and to put people living on the north-west coast of Tirconaill on the same plane as the men who fish the Inny, the Shannon, and other rivers, and that because the tax is raised for them the men in Tirconaill should pay a higher tax too.  We ought to encourage these men to go to sea more.  I do not think we will do that by compelling them to pay a tax they are not able to pay.  I am in agreement with Deputy O'Doherty in saying that the Dáil would do the right and fair thing by giving these people every facility to go to sea, but it will not do that by compelling them to pay a tax that they are not able to pay.</P>

      <P>I think that this is also another attempt to cloud the issue. The draft net men are just as worthy of consideration as the drift net men, and the draft net men have just as old a Gaelic civilisation as the drift net men to whom Deputy Baxter referred. As far as putting a tax on their going to sea is concerned, I repeat once more that it is not a tax; it is money for the preservation of the fisheries.  If we take a shortsighted policy and do not preserve the fisheries or provide money for that purpose, these men will have nothing in four or five years' time for which to go out.  If the fish are not preserved in the spawning beds, and if there is no money to pay for their preservation, these people will feel the effect in the open sea and in the estuaries just as much as in the rivers.</P>

Every one voluntarily entered into an agreement and every interest was taken into consideration.  If it is suggested, for the sake of one particular interest, that that agreement must be scrapped, then I say scrap the lot.  This is not playing the game, and if you think you will have the fishery laws enforced properly and fishery funds subscribed to, I say you are looking for failure.  If it is not to be done honestly, and this is not doing it honestly, it is better not to do it at all and to scrap the whole Bill.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is attacking the Minister for his proposal and his attack has no more validity upon Deputy O'Doherty or upon any other Deputy supporting Deputy O'Doherty than upon the Minister himself; he is equally the culprit, so that we may allow them to cancel themselves. A suggestion was made that the decision of the Dáil was come to without anybody knowing anything about it, more or less as a slip-through <Col N="1617" /> arrangement when the Minister was not looking.  But this is not the fact. There was about two and a half hours' discussion, and there was a larger vote on this issue than on very many more important issues.  Twenty-two supported the decision, against sixteen who supported the Minister, and I think if Deputy Gorey and Deputy Cooper will look through the records, or just help their memories a little, they will find that a large number of very important decisions have been taken by smaller votes than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, smaller minorities.  But is it the doctrine of the Deputy that a majority must not prevail unless it is an overwhelming majority?  A majority of twenty-two against sixteen is not to have effect because it is not twenty-two against fifteen, or against fourteen, or thirteen, or twelve.  This new doctrine of Deputy Cooper's is quite interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a doctrine. I was merely pointing out that there was a considerable balance of opinion in favour of the contention of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly.  The Minister strongly advocated the matter by most eloquent arguments and the production of figures, which confounded him.  I cannot remember the figures, but undoubtedly the figures which the Minister produced showed conclusively the iniquity of the proposal even to maintain the existing <Col N="1618" /> rate.  Let me say here that the proposals of the original Bill, under the alleged agreement that Deputy Gorey speaks of, assumed the equities of the relative positions in the past of the classes of fishermen named in the Schedule.  You are not justified in assuming that those rates of duties were equitable and just.  As has been pointed out by the Minister, 95 per cent. of the fish caught, and therefore presumably of the income derived, from drift net fishing was by drift net men who fish in the open sea from the coast of Donegal, and we may take it, therefore, that we are only dealing in effect with drift net fishing in respect of Donegal.  Deputy Baxter's contention in this matter is quite valid, even on the Minister's own showing.  The drift net fishermen in the estuaries of other rivers are also of the same section of the population as the Donegal fishermen, the Gaeltacht; but at any rate the Minister says they only represent 5 per cent. of the drift net catch, and 95 per cent. are Donegal men.  So that we are really considering a Donegal question, and I maintain that the duty of £2 for drift net fishing in the open sea, running the risks of bad weather, running the enormous risks that men fishing in the open sea in small boats have to run, is a tax on an industry such as none of the Deputies on the merchants' benches should support, and I hope that the House will stand by Deputy Doherty's proposition that the duty should not exceed £2, and that the Dáil's decision should be maintained by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>When progress was reported, I was speaking about the question of the remuneration of the Government consulting engineer.  The question was raised as to what other charges there were in respect of the work done by the consulting engineer in addition to the figures that I mentioned with reference to the years 1923-24 and 1924-25.  Strictly speaking, the money paid to the consulting engineer, in addition to remuneration, covers the travelling expenses to and from London of the engineer or his partners, and it covers office expenses in London and considerable work done in London. The consulting engineer had the assistance of a staff provided and paid by the Government here.  At present the staff consists of two engineers and a typist.  The salaries of the engineers are borne on the Board of Works Vote; they are lent by the Board of Works. There is also the cost of an office involved. About £1,125 a year is the cost at present.  In the year 1923-24 the cost was much higher and it reached the figure of £3,092, which Deputy Johnson indicated.  There has been a very great amount of work cast on the consulting engineer to the Government. The total amount paid to him so far is £8,150.  The amount of money that has been paid out on his certificate, or as a result of his examination, amounted to £834,186.  The percentage is not by any means a large percentage. As a matter of fact, the consulting engineer and his partners have saved very great sums to the Government. <Col N="1621" /> The remuneration falls into various categories.  There is £1,050 of a general fee for advice and general service to the Government.  Then there was payment at the rate of 3½ per cent. on costs in connection with the erection of railway bridges.  There was a fee for other railway work, and there was a percentage, which was generally a percentage of 1½ in most cases, on purchases.  In certain cases it was 1 per cent., and in other cases it was 2 per cent.  The total amount paid in respect of percentages on purchases amounted to £2,038.  In connection with that there was a considerable amount of staff work involved in the London office of the consulting engineer.</P>

      <P>I could not give the precise information at the moment. The work of the firm in connection with the settlement of railway claims was very considerable; of course they had the assistance of the staff provided by the Government.  There is no doubt that as a result of the method in which the work was done very great sums were saved.  The Government first became aware of the value of the assistance they might expect from the consulting engineer comparatively early, in connection with a bridge which was erected near Dundrum, in County Tipperary.  The irreducible minimum suggested by the engineers to the Railway Company was £1,825.  The work was carried out directly by the Government under the supervision of the consulting engineer, at a cost of £788 15s. 0d.  That one instance had a very great effect on our relations with the Railway Companies in connection with compensation, and it enabled fair bargains to be struck in a way that perhaps would hardly have been reached if we had not had such a <Col N="1622" /> striking instance of the efficient way in which these matters could be handled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The firm was responsible for the preparation of plans and the construction of seven viaducts.  These viaducts were Mallow, Ballyvoile, Carrig, Taylorstown, Monard, Belvelly, and Douglas. In addition, the firm, on behalf of the Government, collaborated with the Companies in preparing plans and specifications and placing contracts for other works.  For instance, the Great Southern and Western Railway, thirteen station buildings and eight bridges; Midland Great Western Railway, seven bridges; Great Northern Railway, three station buildings and five bridges; Dublin and South Eastern Railway, two station buildings and two bridges; London Midland and Scottish Railway, two bridges; Cork and Muskerry Railway, one station building and one bridge; Cork, Blackrock and Passage Railway, three station buildings and four signal cabins; Timoleague and Courtmacsherry Railway, one station building; Listowel and Ballybunion Railway, two station buildings; West Clare Railway, one station building. On behalf of the Government they examined and approved or modified, as the case might require, the plans for various works which were carried out by the Railway Companies with their own staffs, for the payment of which the Government were responsible. These included items like the following: Great Southern and Western Railway, sixteen stations, seventy eight bridges; Midland Great Western Railway, three stations, twelve bridges; Great Northern Railway, three stations and seven bridges; London Midland and Scottish Railway, one bridge and one signal cabin; Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway, eight stations, six bridges, three piers, nine signal cabins; Cork and Macroom Railway, one station, five signal cabins, two bridges; Schull and Skibbereen Railway, two stations and one bridge; Tralee and Dingle Railway, fourteen stations, one cabin, four bridges; the South and West Clare Railway, eleven stations, two cabins, eleven bridges; County Donegal Railway, two stations, one cabin: Sligo <Col N="1623" /> Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway, one station, one cabin.</P>
    <P>The firm, therefore, on behalf of the Government, had responsibility in connection with re-construction and preparation of plans and costs of 358 bridges, 197 station buildings, and 123 signal cabins.  They had to deal with claims in connection with several hundreds of carriages, wagons and engines, which were damaged or destroyed had to be repaired or replaced, and for which the Government had to pay compensation. There were large numbers of cases of small repairs which were done by the Railway Companies on a time and material basis.  There were about 2,000 such small repairs, which involved examination of the books and the taking of precautions to see that nothing was charged up by the Companies to the Government that was not due to be charged&mdash;that no consequential items were brought into account. The amount of Railway work which was paid for by the Government on the certificate of the firm was £480,556. There were various other claims investigated on behalf of the Department of Defence&mdash;the fitting up of armoured trains by the various Railway Companies, advice on matters like ammunition, searchlights, and so forth.</P>
    <P>There were great numbers of compensation cases unconnected with railways in respect of which settlement has not yet been reached with the firm. These were compensation cases in which engineering considerations came into account; for instance, a claim by the &ldquo;Cork Examiner&rdquo; for destruction of machinery; claims by the &ldquo;Cork Constitution&rdquo;; claims by Slievardagh and the Arigna coalfields; claims by saw mills in County Sligo; Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company, Clifden; the Mahon Printing Works, in Dublin; various saw mills in County Galway, and claims in connection with creameries.  A big mass of all sorts of matters of an engineering type was dealt with by this firm, and dealt with in a manner that gave us every satisfaction. We felt that, with less efficient treatment, costs amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds more might easily have been heaped upon <Col N="1624" /> the Government.  I could not say exactly what sum is still due to the firm.  It certainly would not be less than £1,000, and it might be more than that.  The position, as I have said, is that the firm have, up to the present, received £8,150, and there has been paid out by the Government on their certificate the sum of £834,186.  The cost of staff which assisted the firm might run to £6,000 or £7,000 additional.</P>

      <P>I want to support Deputy Johnson in raising this matter of the Government consulting engineer. I am quite prepared to accept the statement of the Minister that value has been given for the £8,000 odd that was expended on commission and office in one financial year alone. I think value was rendered.  My only comment would be that it seems to be very much better from the point of view of the individual to be a consulting engineer to the Government than to be Minister for Finance in the Government, and if the Minister was not so modest he might have boasted that he and his predecessors had saved even greater sums than the Government consulting engineer, and had been very much less adequately remunerated. I am accepting what the Minister has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two points I want to make in connection with this matter.  One is that it is unwise for the Government to tie itself to any one firm for advice on a commission basis.  For instance in this case, the Government consulting engineer, as the Minister has told us obtained £870 commission on purchase of some trawlers for the Ministry, of Defence.  An ordinary civil engineering firm is not qualified to advise on the purchase of ships; it is altogether outside their beat.  They either have to engage some persons specially for this job, or else they tackle it on the principle of a ship-broker.  It is not within the ordinary knowledge of a civil engineer as to whether engines and so on are in working order or not.  We might have made&mdash;I am not saying we did make, I do not know the details of the case&mdash;a bad bargain. The second point I want to make, with <Col N="1625" /> more emphasis, so far as my voice is capable of making any emphasis at all, is that in all cases where commission is payable to any individual, and especially in cases where commission is payable to an individual who receives an official salary, that fact should be clearly shown on the Estimates.  Until this Estimate was discussed a week ago, the majority of the Dáil were quite ignorant of the fact that this gentleman, who was in receipt of a modest salary of £1,050 a year, had also in the financial year 1923-24 received over £5,000 as commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in addition.  The £5,000 included his salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept that at once.  In addition to £1,050, this gentleman received £4,200.  I suggest to the Minister that that is not good accountancy and not good policy; that we ought to know if we are to have, as I believe we have, a financial administration that will bear investigation. There should be no loophole left by which people could say: &ldquo;You know the salary he got, but you do not know the commission he got.&rdquo;  I do not think in this case there was anything wrong.  I accept the Minister's position that the services rendered were adequate, but I think the Dáil should have been informed on an earlier date that this gentleman, or this firm, was receiving commission, commission scattered among a number of Votes, at least two Votes, some on the Army Vote and some on another Vote.  That commission should have been made clear to the Dáil, so that if there was anything wrong it would have been open to us to criticise it.  Those are my two points in regard to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now want to turn from sub-head (a) to another matter affecting a constituent of mine, a matter with which I think the Minister is familiar, because I have written to him about it.  That is the case of a Mrs. Byrne who owned a house in Henry Street, adjacent to the General Post Office which was burned down in 1916.  This lady made a claim for compensation under the Dublin Reconstruction Act.  She found then that she was unable to proceed with her claim because she was a tenant of <Col N="1626" /> a house on a lease that then had about twenty years to run.  The landlord had sold her interest over her head to the British Postmaster-General.  Eventually, she brought an action, being advised thereto by Counsel.  I have the opinion of Counsel in my hand.  I will not quote it because that Counsel has since been elevated to a more exalted sphere and it might be <i>lese majeste</i> to quote that opinion.  The opinion was that though there was not a case in law under the Act there was a case in justice and equity, and that the Judge might make such remarks as would induce the British Government to pay some compensation&mdash;<i>ex gratia</i> grant.  I do not want to repeat the whole report of the case.  It will suffice to say that when my attention was drawn to the matter, I wrote to the late Lord Chancellor who tried the case. The late Lord Chancellor writes to me: &ldquo;I tried the case, a unique case.  The claimant has a great grievance.  I did all I could by private letters at the time but in vain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the opinion of the Judge who heard the case against the British Government.  This lady received injustice from the British Government. She then, when the Saorstat came into being, applied to the Minister for Finance for an <i>ex gratia</i> grant.  It is admitted that there is no legal claim. She sought justice in the Courts of the Saorstát.  The British Government denied that.  The Judge who tried the case admitted that it was a hard case and one in which an <i>ex gratia</i> grant should have been made.  But the Minister has followed precedent.  He has hardened his heart and refused to make an <i>ex gratia</i> grant.  I urge him now in public, as I have urged him in private, to reconsider the matter, to realise that this lady is being deprived of valuable property owing to the refusal of her head landlord, first the British Postmaster-General and now the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, to allow her to rebuild.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters that will require to be dealt with under this sub-head.  I want to hang on for a little while to the Vote, which includes £1,050 for a Government <Col N="1627" /> consulting engineer.  The position was not fully stated by Deputy Bryan Cooper.  The year 1923-24 Estimates contain no provision for payment of a salary to such an officer, and the sum, I think, of £3,092, appears in the accounts afterwards as having been paid, and the attention of the Dáil was directed to the fact in the Appropriation Accounts.  In the following year (1924-25) the sum of £1,050 is recorded as being provided for the same engineer, when it appears to have been within the knowledge of the Minister that a much larger sum was likely to be called for during that year for the remuneration of this officer.  And so it is in this year £1,050 is placed in the Estimates for the Government consulting engineer, and the Minister thinks that £1,000, at any rate, will be required to be paid this year, whether as salary, commission or payment of fees we do not know.  I would like to have it quite clearly set out that this is a salary, if it is a salary, or is it an allowance, and are we to understand that we are providing for an officer at a salary of £1,050, for this year?  If that is not the position, and the desire of the Minister is to make provision for a payment for engineering services, I suggest that it ought not to appear in the Estimates as a salary for a consulting engineer, especially as the Minister seemed to suggest the other night that it was questionable whether such an officer would be required at such a salary for the ensuing year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister read a very long list of work done for which the consulting engineer, or his firm, had some responsibility. I hope it is not suggested that we should imagine that all the work in connection with the engineering side of these operations was done by the firm or the engineer in question.  That would be a sad reflection upon the other engineers already in the service of the Government who, I believe, did a very considerable portion of the work which is credited by the Minister to the consulting engineer.  I have no doubt that had there been no such engineer the State would have been involved in considerably more expense, but one wonders whether it would have been possible <Col N="1628" /> in any case for any individual to supervise all the work that the Minister read out as having been done. Take the instance of the trawlers, for which we are told there was paid £870 as commission.  Is it suggested that full consideration was given to the purchase of the trawler by this engineer, and that that purchase was a satisfactory one?  I am very doubtful whether any work was done by the engineer in question in respect of these trawlers.  There may have been a pretence of work being done, there may have been a general supervision of specifications sent out by the brokers, but if the information that has been pretty common knowledge with respect to the purchase in question has any foundation at all, the £870 was very badly-spent money.</P>
    <P>Trawlers were purchased and were sold again at a very heavy loss, indeed, and I do not think the services that they rendered gave anybody any satisfaction. I wonder whether the services rendered in the purchase of these trawlers, for which £870 commission was paid, could be paralleled by other services rendered by the same firm in the same way, whether it was not rather a general supervision, and an automatic commission paid in respect of purchase and of work done of an engineering character which happened to go through the office, and that the commission was charged automatically. I have no doubt that on the larger and more important work a definite service was rendered, and I have no doubt that the Minister can make a very effective case to show that the State was rendered good service in the matter of financial saving with respect to these works.  But I am inclined to think that the Minister is giving credit where credit is not due, and has paid money which need not have been paid, for which no effective useful service was rendered.</P>
    <P>I would like to know whether it is the fact that the consulting engineer is to be provided with a salary or a retaining fee amounting to £1,050 for this year, or is this sum an Estimate of possible payment, of whatever kind it may be, to the engineer for services rendered in the past, or to be rendered in the future?  In this form it would <Col N="1629" /> appear to be a definite fee or salary&mdash; £1,050 inclusive.  If it is not intended to be a salary, I submit that it ought to appear in a different form.  If it is intended to be a salary, I think the Minister will require to justify it, and in view of his statement a few days ago, that it was doubtful whether he would be required this year, that it ought not to appear.  I will leave the matter of the consulting engineer, and sit down if I am free to raise another matter of importance on this sub-head as soon as this particular question is disposed of.</P>

      <P>I only want to ask one or two questions, at the moment, in connection with the matter under discussion. The Minister stated that £480,566 was paid out to the railway companies under the certificate of the consulting engineer, representing the damage done to their property during the period of internal strife.  I want to know if that represents the final settlement for all outstanding claims by the companies against the State in connection with the damage and everything else.  I do happen to be aware of the fact, and the Minister knows it quite well, that a great deal of the work of investigation, and as a matter of fact, the final settlement of the smaller claims made by the railway companies against the Government, was done under the supervision of the Army Finance Department by the clerical and technical staff associated with the Railway Maintenance and Protection Corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happen to know the majority of the officers who were associated with that particular corps, for the reason that they were all drawn from the ranks of the Irish railway service.  I know that for months negotiations were going on, and I was informed by officers, who were previously in the service of the railway companies, that they were empowered to make settlements in regard to certain claims.  I am not now referring to the big bridges.  I know, too, of course, that whatever they agreed upon, as representing the Army Finance Department, had eventually to be agreed upon by the Army Finance officer.  The point I want to get information on is this: are we to understand <Col N="1630" /> that fees and commission were paid to this consulting engineer for work which, in reality, had been negotiated and settled by the Army Finance Department?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the question of the trawlers, I really have very little knowledge or information about it.  The purchase of them occurred before I was Minister for Finance. I think that perhaps it was a mistake to have bought the trawlers. It was not possible to get service out of them, and in any case the struggle was drawing to a close before they were in a condition to do anything.  I really could not, at the moment, give any information to the Dáil in respect of the trawlers directly, but I do think that it was one of those mistakes which, I believe, occurred in warlike operations where it is desired to bring new weapons or new forces into play, and which do not always turn out to be of any particular value.</P>
      <P>As to the figure of £1,050, I think I explained the other night that, at a certain stage an offer was made to the consulting engineer of a fee of £1,050 for general work and general advice in connection with the Government service and Government departments generally.  That figure of £1,050 then appeared in the Estimates of last year. As a matter of fact, it never was accepted by the consulting engineer, who asked for, I think, a fee of £1,500.  The offer remained open until a few weeks ago, when the consulting engineer was written to in the sense that I mentioned to the Dáil.  Certain matters still out were dealt with, suggestions were made with a view to arriving at a settlement, and there was also the opinion expressed that we now had come to the conclusion that there was not going to be any work that would justify the payment of this fee or salary as a standing retainer, shall I say, and that in our opinion, for the future, arrangement should be that a consulting engineer would be paid a fee whenever his services were re-required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly am very clear that, contrary to the expectations we had at the time that this offer was first made, there will not be any very frequent or <Col N="1631" /> continuous work for a consulting engineer, and I think that the position now is that we will have to reach a settlement in regard to the past with regard to the consulting engineer. Some final payment will have to be fixed for services already done, and an entirely new arrangement will have to be entered into for the future.  There is certainly a substantial sum due, because there is an amount of compensation work not connected with railways, in regard to which a settlement has not been reached.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact I think that there is probably a good deal in the point that Deputy Cooper did make: that no one engineer can cover the whole field of the requirements of the Government. There is something unsatisfactory in having one engineer who selects his partners to do various works and where the Government is really dealing with, as it were, a corporation, and where it would be much preferable to deal with an individual in each case, and in that way have somebody responsible. I could not say at the moment whether the sum of £480,000 is the last figure due to be paid or not.  I should say that if there is anything to be paid it cannot be any very great sum.</P>
    <P>The work in connection with the railways, except the bridges, was not paid for on a commission basis at all. There was commission for the railways, but the other work was not paid for on a commission basis.  I have no doubt that every item was dealt with, but the responsibility for the whole general policy and for the check was with the Government's consulting engineer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with a matter which has arisen within the last few days in connection with the Local Government elections.  The Department of Finance sent a circular to certain Departments of State, possibly to all Departments of State, to this effect:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The attention of the Minister for Finance has been called to the fact that there is a likelihood of some civil servants becoming candidates for membership of local bodies at the forthcoming elections, and after due <Col N="1632" /> consideration he has decided that such candidature is not desirable in the interests of the Government service. In view of the foregoing, no civil servant can be allowed to become a candidate at these elections and any individual civil servant who wishes to do so must resign his position in the service.  The attention of any officer who is a candidate at the elections in question should, accordingly, be drawn at once to the terms of this circular and a report made if necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That circular was brought to the attention of a number of candidates in different parts of the country on Monday last.  In some cases it was only brought to their attention on Monday morning of this week; in other cases on Monday evening, and in some cases on Tuesday, the day of the polling. The nominations took place, as we all know, a week ago, but the attention of candidates was only called to the existence of this circular on Monday of this week, and in some cases, as I have said, on Tuesday, the day of the polling. Now I do not know whether it was by any oversight or not that this circular was issued and the attention drawn to it of postal servants in many parts of the country.  It is from postal servants that I have had the facts&mdash;by 'phone, letter and by personal inter view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears from the staff rules in operation in the General Post Office that &ldquo;an officer in the Post Office may become a candidate for or serve on any municipal or local council (Rule 619), provided that the duties involved in such candidature or service do not conflict with the officer's duties to his Department.  If the duties are found to conflict the question of requiring the officer to retire from the council will arise and the postmaster should consult the surveyor.&rdquo; That is the rule which is contained in the general staff rules, and a similar rule is contained in the smaller book of rules, which is the guide of the postal service.  It is well known, as a matter of fact, that postmen, <Col N="1633" /> sorters and postal servants have been allowed hitherto to serve on municipal or local councils.  Now, quite apart from the question that is involved in the lateness of the notification, I can only think that this circular was sent out to postal officials by mistake.  I think it is fairly well recognised in the Civil Service generally, and particularly the postal service, that officials are not expected to take an active part in controversial political subjects or parliamentary questions and parliamentary elections, and I think, in the main, except for an occasional lapse, that general rule has been observed.  But I do not think it could be justified that a direction of the sort sent out last week and brought to the notice of postal men, should apply to such men in the case of local governing bodies.  Surely, if it is desirable that local governing bodies should be manned by men of character, it is unwise to limit the choice by removing from the area of choice a body of men who, by the very fact of their being in the public service, is some evidence at any rate of character.  We ought not to allow it to go out that you can deprive citizens who happen to be public servants of their rights which have been understood and recognised and set down definitely in the rules of the service by a mere circular issued on the eve of the elections, and only brought to the notice of the people concerned, in some cases after the elections had taken place, and in other cases on the night before the day of the poll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite obvious that in the case of such postal servants, the order could not be obeyed, because the elections had already been entered upon and the evil, if there were an evil, had been done.  I think the only explanation that is likely to fit this case is that the Ministry, fearing the possibility of higher officers in the Civil Service entering into political activities, thought to restrain that desire, and that by inadvertence a similar direction was conveyed to the Post Office, and through the Post Office to men in all parts of the country, who possibly by accident happened, in the majority of <Col N="1634" /> cases, to belong and to be representative of the party in the community to which I am glad to give my allegiance.</P>
    <P>That is an unfortunate circumstance, but I am not going to stress that.  I think the only explanation can be that this circular was sent by inadvertence, and was not intended to apply to postal carriers, sorters, auxiliary postmen and the like.  What harm possibly could happen to the public service in a postal official serving his town or county or district in the capacity of a councillor?  It is dangerous, I think, to allow to pass, the incident of depriving postal servants of rights which they have clearly set out in their statutes by a stroke of the pen in this fashion.  I hope that we shall hear from the Minister that there is no intention of enforcing this order in the case of postal servants, and that it was sent out to them by mistake.  In any case, it surely is not to be contended for a moment that an order of this kind, sent out on the eve of the elections, as I say, in some cases after the actual polling has begun, can be sustained or enforced.  I hope the Minister will give us an explanation which will clear the air in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to admit at once that the complaint that Deputy Johnson makes in regard to the lateness, is justified fully and, I think, because of the lateness of the circular, some modification of it will have to be made.  This matter was considered some considerable time ago, and the feeling then was that definite steps would have to be taken to pre vent civil servants becoming members of local bodies, but, as no election was in the offing at the time, it was decided to issue no circular, or take no steps at the moment.  The result was that the matter was dropped for the time being, and when eventually the elections came upon us, action was not taken in reasonable time, and I believe I can say that we must modify the circular, because of the fact that men had already become candidates, and in some cases, had perhaps even been elected, before the circular reached them.  I accept the position at once that it would not be fair, or practicable, to enforce it against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1635" /> On the general question, however, it is very difficult to see how you could exempt any grade of civil servants.  It will be clear to Deputies, I think, absolutely clear, that dealing with the higher grades, it is most undesirable. For instance, you cannot have a position where an official of the Local Government Department is a member of the local council, and perhaps carrying on a wrangle with his own Minister or, in his capacity as a councillor, defying himself in his capacity as a civil servant.  You cannot have an auditor of a Local Government Department a member of a local council.</P>
    <P>You could not have employees of the Department of Agriculture members of, say, the county committees of agriculture. It is obvious where you are dealing with officers of a certain grade they could not have a dual capacity.  It then becomes a question of drawing a line, and it seems almost impossible to draw a line.  I considered the matter myself in connection with an individual case that came before me recently where a girl who was, I think, a temporary clerk or typist&mdash;I am not sure which&mdash;was secretary of a Cumann na nGaedheal club.  In her capacity as secretary to the club, she was writing in very strong letters to various departments. She was told that she would either have to leave the secretaryship of the Cumann na nGaedheal club or the Government service.  It was argued that she was only a typist or a temporary clerk, and what harm was it?  I felt myself that really the position was one that could not be tolerated.  You could not have&mdash;I do not say it happened in this case&mdash;a girl who was, say, in the Department of Justice writing stiff letters to the Minister for Justice or the Secretary of the Department about some incident in prison.  As a matter of fact, I think this particular girl was in my own Department.</P>
    <P>When you come down to consider the matter, it becomes clear that it is practically impossible to draw a line.  If you permit a civil servant in a particular grade to do a thing, it becomes extremely difficult to say, &ldquo;Here is the line, so-and-so may do it, but a person one grade above may not do it.&rdquo;  I realise <Col N="1636" /> that there is less harm and less danger &mdash;there is not a positive type of danger &mdash;in having civil servants in lower grades of the service in these positions. There would be, of course, positive danger to the public in having people in the higher grades.  For instance, it would be undesirable to have the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance a member of an urban council which might be formulating demands for relief grants.  It would be undesirable to have people even two or three grades down in the Ministry of Finance, who might be handling these problems, who could not look at them solely from the point of view of the Department of Finance, if mixed up with local bodies and having a double responsibility, responsibility to the Department, and responsibility to their constituents.  If you have a lower type of officer obviously they could not influence things very much.  It is impossible to deny to the higher officer something you grant to the lower officer.  The position seems to me, while the argument could be made for exempting from such a rule certain grades of the Civil Service, that in practice it is impossible to draw a distinction between one grade and another.  I have thought it over and I feel that you really must have one uniform rule for the service.</P>
    <P>With respect to Parliamentary candidature, as a matter of fact, the rule applies not merely to higher civil servants but to working men in the Board of Works who are not dealing with clerical or administrative work at all. It applies to all sorts of employees of the State that when they become candidates for the Dáil they must resign. With respect to this matter of local bodies, I feel that it is impracticable, if not impossible, to make a dividing line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says it is impracticable, but fortunately there is experience to go on, and the thing has been found quite practicable. There are certain definite rules regarding the entry into Parliamentary elections of civil servants, that on announcement or, on deciding to go forward, they will cease to act; they will be in suspense and if they succeed will resign.  I think that is the rule. <Col N="1637" /> The Minister says you cannot draw a definite line.  I do not think you require to draw a line, any more definitely than has been drawn hitherto. As the rule says, you require of public servants that they should maintain a certain reserve on political matters.  That is in respect to Parliamentary elections.  The Minister has indicated certain possible difficulties that would arise in certain Departments and instanced the lower grades.  The rule we are quoting makes it clear where a decision of justice, equity and reason lies.  If the duties of the officer who is elected on a local body and the duties of his Department are found to conflict, the officer will be required to retire from the Council.  That is a rule which is quite reasonable and is accepted by everyone.  Let us wait until we see whether they do conflict. Undoubtedly if they are found to conflict there has to be withdrawal or resignation.  Let us find out whether they do conflict before we issue a general order that there must not be any service to the community.  Surely it is desirable to encourage voluntary public service, on the part of officials of the State, on local bodies.</P>
      <P>I feel confident that this matter can be left with the Ministry to consider with reason and with due regard, not only to the interests of the service but the interests and rights of the citizen, and that we shall not be retrogressive in this matter, and go back upon a position that has been attended with a great deal of satisfaction to the service, which has been recognised as reasonable and right, and has not done harm to the service.  On further consideration of this matter I hope that no decision will be arrived at of a rigid kind, which will cause difficulties, and that the Minister will take into account all the circumstances, and, at least, leave men who are serving the State in a public position some rights as citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has given a number of hypothetical cases.  Let me suggest another to show how matters would be if a rigid line were drawn.  Haulbowline may conceivably be, or may have been, a centre of shipbuilding repairs, and engineering, and having a large <Col N="1638" /> number of public servants.  The town of Cobh was populated to a very great extent by public servants, and a rigid rule of this kind would have prevented the majority of the intelligent citizens of that town from taking any part in the administration of the town services. That position is not as strong to-day, because of an accident, but it is a hypothetical case as illustrating the arguments on the one side, just as the Minister's hypothetical cases are illustrative of the arguments on the other side.  I put it forward to show that it is impossible, with due regard to the circumstances, to draw a rigid line. I suggest the line that has been drawn hitherto, and that is in operation up to date, is quite fine and sharp enough, that where the duties of the civil servant are bound to conflict with the duties of public councillor then is the time to ask for a withdrawal, and not to prohibit civil servants from serving their fellow-citizens in a public capacity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the force of the argument Deputy Johnson puts forward. I believe that if the State had very large numbers of industrial employees, especially if they were concentrated, it might become necessary to seek some way out, but on the question of a general rule restraining civil servants from entering these bodies I have very little doubt.  In recent years we had a considerable amount of trouble, and we had civil servants suspended because of their actions on public bodies, and they actually lost a considerable amount of pay in consequence. We had one, I think, a postal official, who was dismissed from the service because of his actions on public bodies.  It produces an extremely difficult situation if you allow a man to become a member of a body on which there is a certain amount of political or semi-political activity going on, and then ask him to resign because you do not like his political thought.  It is hard to avoid imputation of unfairness, and a belief on the part of some people that there is something like political discrimination or persecution of civil servants.  It is desirable to prevent such a situation arising.  I think that <Col N="1639" /> for some years, even on the local bodies, we are likely to have a conflict of one sort or another.  On the question of whether in certain individual cases permission might be given to people to go on public boards, I am prepared to look into that, but I think we must stand for the general position, and the rule must be that they do not go forward.  If we except a particular individual it is as much as can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister realises that permission to individuals would be much more dangerous than permission to classes or bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not press the matter further at this stage, for I have faith that the Minister's good sense will decide his future action, but I will ask him not to assume that the conduct of affairs in the future has to be based on the likelihood that the conditions of the past four or five years are to be permanent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take advantage of this vote to ask for information in regard to a certain matter which was brought to the Minister's attention by a question on the 18th instant.  I regret that the Deputy who asked the question is not in the Dáil, but as this will be the only opportunity I will have of raising the matter, and as I have been asked to deal with it, I must take advantage of this opportunity. An award for compensation was made to the owners of the Irish House, Tipperary.  The award was made for damages caused to these premises by British forces.  The case was heard by the Shaw Commission, and an award for £43,244 was made some time in 1922.  It appears that £11,000 of this award was conditional on rebuilding.  The inhabitants of Tipperary town have remained under the impression that this rebuilding clause still stood in the award, and that at some future time the owners of the premises would start rebuilding, but recently, as a result of inquiries made by me, it was found that this conditional award of £11,000 had been commuted <Col N="1640" /> for a cash payment of £7,000.  I would presume that as the destruction of the premises was caused by British forces that the amount of the award would fall on the British Exchequer, but on that point I am not quite clear, for it would appear from the answer made on behalf of the Minister for Finance that the charge would partly fall on the Free State.  How that arises I cannot see.  But apart from that, the original award was considered by everybody who knew anything about it to be altogether excessive.  The question arises whether the Minister has a right to commute the conditional award by the acceptance by the person who has received the award of a lesser sum in cash.  I think it was not the intention of the Compensation Act that people who had business premises should get possession of a lump sum, clear away with that sum, and do what they like with it, and leave the premises partly derelict, an eyesore, useless from the point of view of business, and a great injury to the town from the point of view of disimproving its appearance, and having a bad effect as regards tourist traffic.  There is no prospect of rebuilding, and there is a great deal of unemployment in the town.  Thousands are unemployed, and there is a great demand for work.  I suggest that the commutation of the conditional award is, if not illegal, certainly quite unfair to the town.</P>
      <P>It certainly is a bad precedent for other people who know if they come to an agreement with the Ministry they can get out of their rebuilding clause. I would ask the Minister if he could give any explanation of this matter, because there is a great deal of feeling about the case in the town in question. The people of the town feel that they have been very unfairly treated.  There is also the question of rates.  Naturally the town loses the rates, and in its present condition there is no prospect that the town will gain any advantage out of the rates for that site for the future. There is another matter I wish to raise also, but as it is rather late I will not refer to it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I do not know this case so well that I could <Col N="1641" /> trust my memory with regard to the facts.  I have not the papers with regard to it here.  I understand that there was some complication in the business in connection with the arrangements with insurance companies which the Government entered into earlier in our dealing with that question of compensation; and that actually by agreeing to the elimination by the Wood-Renton Commission of the rebuilding clause some £6,000 or £7,000 was saved to the Government.  There is also, I understand, in the lease a rebuilding condition, and, if my memory serves me right, I have been informed that legal proceedings have been started for the purpose of enforcing that condition in the lease, and, apart altogether from the reinstatement conditions in the award, lessees are bound to rebuild. I believe the house will be rebuilt.  My attention was drawn to this particular case by the Deputy, but I would not like to say for certain that I remember the facts accurately at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given notice to the Minister and also to his Parliamentary Secretary that on the Vote providing for salaries under this estimate, I would ask for some definite statement in regard to matters for which the Department of Finance is responsible. The matter to which I am going to refer has been already a matter of question and answer and the subject of discussion in this House.  As this is the only opportunity which we will have for endeavouring to secure some kind of definite statement, I hope the notice I have given will enable the Minister and his Secretary to meet the demand. In the first place, I referred to the question which was asked on two occasions in the House, and in reference to which on the last occasion an additional promise was given by the Minister in regard to the setting up of a Banking Commission.  I would not support the demand for setting up a Commission of this kind if I thought that its recommendations, after a long inquiry, were likely to be shelved in the usual way. But rely on the statement of the Minister himself when he made a speech on the last occasion which held the view that that would not happen in this par <Col N="1642" /> ticular case.  The Minister stated, roughly, that he realised as a result of the separation of our connection with England that the relationship of the State, as it now exists, should be defined and properly defined, as between the State and whatever banking institutions are in the country.  If the Minister is not in a position to make a definite statement in the matter now, I hope he will be in a position to make such a definite statement before the House adjourns for three or four months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other question is in regard to the statement made by him in his Budget statement, when he said it may be necessary to introduce a No. 2 Finance Bill in relation to the alteration of the existing methods of taxation on motor lorries and on motor cars.  Statements were made in the Dáil a short time ago, or at least answers were given to questions in relation to the position of the railways, which made one feel that all the blame for the existing state of disorganisation on the railway and the alleged consequential losses were due to the Railways Act.  I do not by any means subscribe to that view. but I do hold, and I think it is very largely shared, that unless there is some limitation placed on the weight of the motor lorries plying over the roads, that there is a serious danger from that point of view to the existence of the railways, especially under the regulations laid down in the Railways, 1923. Act.  The reason, however, that I want a statement on the matter is this&mdash;the Minister for Local Government and Public Health stated, when the estimates were under discussion, that proposals for the construction of trunk roads and the expenditure of an amount of money exceeding £1,000,000 would be laid before the Minister for Finance inside one month.  That month has now expired, and the Minister, if he is going to raise or spend a large amount of money, exceeding £1,000,000, must have his mind made up as to what method of raising that money he is to take, and if he has his mind made up, and if he is in a position to make a statement upon that matter, I think we are entitled to have that statement before the House adjourns.  This is the <Col N="1643" /> only opportunity that can be afforded to enable the Minister to make a pronouncement on the matter.  The other question is in connection with the River Barrow.  We have had placed in our hands a report by Professor Meyer-Peter, where he criticises the previous scheme by two different parties for the drainage of the Barrow, and where also he makes certain recommendations indicating that the preliminary work can be carried out without legislation. I want to say, in connection with this matter, that before the Christmas adjournment a Bill was promised, in connection with this particular work, and that that Bill, up to the present, has not been put into the hands of the printer, or at least it has not been put into our hands.  I realise that until legislation is introduced, which will give the Government the right to enter the lands, that no work involving any great expenditure of a useful kind can be undertaken. In this report by Professor Meyer-Peter, and in a statement made by the Minister outside this House some time ago, it was indicated that £50,000 was to be spent during the present financial year.  If the Minister would only ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to what are the numbers of unemployed in and around Athy, Monasterevan, Portarlington and the whole are covered by the Barrow, he would see the necessity for undertaking that particular work at once, because no work of any kind that will do any benefit in the area can be carried out during the flood season of the year.  In the Athy No. 2 Rural District at the present time there are over 500 men unemployed.  Most of these men are not entitled to unemployment insurance benefit.  They will have to wait a long time if they are to wait for the benefits of the good weather of the past five or six weeks, and the employment that may be created as a consequence of that.  I think that will probably carry them over the winter period.</P>
    <P>One reason that has been given to me for the delay in connection with the carrying out of the work was the doubt that existed in the Minister's mind and in the minds of his advisers as to whether <Col N="1644" /> the people living in the area concerned would be in a position to bear a certain portion of the charge.  I happened to be a member of a deputation that, with a number of other Deputies, waited upon the late Minister for Industry and Commerce, who was accompanied by the chief officials of his Department and of the Department of the Board of Works eighteen months ago.  At that interview a statement was made by an official of the Board of Works that plans and schemes were in the pigeon-holes which would enable that work to be undertaken shortly. An offer was made on that particular occasion on behalf of the largest ratepayers in the locality that they would put up pound for pound.  I expressed doubt at the time whether these people would be in a position to carry out that offer, and I may say that that doubt has increased since, because in the interval these people have gone through a very hard period.  I think that the Government and the Minister should deal with that matter in the same way as they intend to deal with drainage affected under the Shannon scheme.  In a clause in the Shannon Bill it is laid down that if the Minister is satisfied that lands are improved by drainage work, he may make, in this particular case, a charge on the people who own the land or who live in the locality. One does not yet know what it may mean, but I think that some such method should be adopted in regard to the drainage of the Barrow, and if that is the excuse of the Government it should not be the reason for holding up the Barrow scheme.  This has been discussed for a hundred years, and we ought to have arrived at the time when the Minister for Finance, after his three years' careful study of the matter should be in a position to make an announcement.  I have reason to realise and understand the conditions in the locality, and I have reason to know the benefits that would be conferred on the unemployed, especially in the areas of Kildare, Leix and Offaly, and if the Minister has any statement to make, I can assure him that it will be welcomed by the unemployed workers who are in a state of privation in the particular areas to which I refer.</P>

      <P>Before the debate proceeds I desire to say that I allowed Deputy Davin to ask the Minister, or the Parliamentary Secretary, a number of questions.  There is a rule which I am afraid seems to lie very deep in forgetfulness at the moment, that in discussing estimates Deputies cannot advocate legislation.  I am afraid that a good deal of legislation would be required to do all the things which Deputy Davin has asked the Minister to make a statement upon. We cannot, on a Vote for the salary of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, have a discussion on banks, the expenses of railways, and the relations of the expenses of railways to the taxes on motor-lorries, the drainage of the River Barrow, and all that that implies.  Seeing that Deputy Davin has only touched on the fringe of the subject, I feel that there are a great many other Deputies who have a great many other things to say from a great many other points of view, and I am sorry they cannot get an opportunity of saying them.  The best I can do, having allowed Deputy Davin to say these things, which are undoubtedly important, is to allow a reply, but I cannot undertake to have a discussion on banks, railways, motor lorries, the drainage of the Barrow and other subjects on a vote for the Ministry of Finance.  Deputies will realise that, on such a system we would never get to the end of the Estimate, which involves the salary of the Minister for Finance, whose authority is required for every expenditure of public money.</P>

      <P>On the point on which Deputy Davin is most anxious to have an answer, it would, I think, be better if Deputy Professor O'Sullivan would speak.  As regards the other matter, the question of the selection of the <i>personnel</i> of the Banking Commission is proceeding.  I am not yet in a position to give names to the Dáil, but I may possibly be in a position to do so before the Recess.  I am not sure.  We have to get men from outside the country and careful inquiries have to be made before any one of these men can be approached, and no announcement could be made until people consent to act.  As regards the Finance Bill No. 2 <Col N="1646" /> Bill to deal with vehicles, it has got no further.  It will require serious attention by the Ministry for Finance, the Ministry of Local Government and the Ministry for Industry and Commerce.  I do not think I indicated anything further than that, I hoped that we would be in a position to effect a change by the autumn.  We, and certainly I, have not been in a position to give the time necessary to the consideration of what is really a difficult problem, and I think Deputy Davin will realise that it is a very difficult problem.</P>

      <P>In replying to this point, it is not to be taken that I am admitting responsibility, seeing that there is no legal responsibility on my particular Department in this respect.  I quite realise, however, as Deputy Davin realises, that this is a very serious problem, and I think that that is the point of view not merely of my particular Department but of the Government generally.  Some people refer to it with, perhaps, pardonable exaggeration, especially those living in the neighbourhood of the Barrow, as a national problem, but that feeling is less strongly shared the further you get away from the Barrow.  There is a certain amount of truth in that description, and those who live near the Barrow might regard it rather as a national scandal.  One writer to the Press, with whose views on other matters I generally disagree, rather picturesquely described the lot of the farmer who lives on the banks of the Barrow, and said that he had a sporting chance of a crop of natural meadow, but it was merely a sporting chance.  The improvements that could be carried out and the benefits that would result from the proper drainage <Col N="1647" /> of the Barrow are very considerable. Palpable improvements, such as the improvement of the land, I need not mention, and some lands can be made very good.  The improvements may not, however, perhaps be as great as some members of the deputation, to which Deputy Davin referred, expect. Other portions of it would probably continue to be poorish land.  There are other benefits that might be effected. Some of the towns also suffer considerably from periodic flooding from the Barrow, and it is probable that the general health of the neighbourhood, not merely of the flooded areas but of other areas would be improved, and it has been suggested, I think with truth, that as a result of the drainage of this area and of the drainage of other areas in Ireland, the climate of the country might be improved and that we might have less rain and that the rainfall would be carried off more quickly. That is undoubtedly one side of the problem, but let us face the fact that there is another side, to this particular problem, that I should like Deputies from the different portions of the House and the country as well as the Deputies from the Barrow region to bear in mind, that is that the costs are undoubtedly very heavy. I do not say that the latest estimate of a proper scheme of drainage for the Barrow which amounts to £1,130,000, in the report of Meyer referred to by Deputy Davin would be sufficient to deter the Government from going on with this particular scheme, but remember the expense is a serious factor and the fact that it exceeds £1,000,000 is also a serious factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Roughly speaking, if you take money at 5½ per cent. and allow 40 years for redemption the sum paid back on the capital would amount to £70,000 a year. I doubt if the improved value of the land would amount to more than £20,000 per annum.  As we are on this subject perhaps I might remove certain misconceptions that are in the public mind, that appeared in the public Press and that apparently, to a certain extent, are shared by Deputy Davin. He says that an official of the Board of Works present at those particular deputations <Col N="1648" /> said there was a scheme ready at hand in the pigeon-holes that could be worked out.  I cannot find any record of that in the Press reports or in the official reports.  Any way, the fact remains that statements of this kind are made&mdash;that plans are available and are in existence, and that it is some inherent cussedness of the Government Department which prevents them being carried into effect.  All that has no foundation in fact.  The Board of Works are not a kind of museum where excellent schemes are presented and are kept in glass cases for admiration and not for use.  The report of Professor Meyer-Peter shows that there was a wealth of material in the sense that there was a lot of material in it. There was not a wealth of material in the sense that it was not valuable for immediate use, at all events.</P>
    <P>There were two main schemes.  They are 40 years old now.  One was due to an eminent Irish engineer named Manning.  On the whole, that was an incomplete sketch.  There was not a scheme that could be taken up and worked out.  But great hopes were based on the fact that there was a lot of material mainly from the investigations of another engineer named Gamble who had been employed to carry out a certain scheme propounded by the Allport Commission.  He did a great deal of detailed work but never finished the work.  The scheme was never completed.  How incomplete it was we are now in a position to know after it has been investigated in the last few months.  He was not a Board of Works engineer.  The plans were simply given to the Board of Works after he had carried the business out.</P>
    <P>I might refer to the costs.  Manning said his scheme would cost £470,000 roughly.  Hassard, an engineer member of the Castletown Commission, said that was insufficient.  He said you would have to pay £560,000.  In that there was to be no work below Athy, the assumption being that the drainage of the Barrow above Athy would do no damage, and would not cause flooding below Athy.  Manning strongly argued for that view.  The latest investigator we had on the matter entirely disagreed, <Col N="1649" /> and how entirely the Deputies can gather if they refer to Professor Meyer-Pter's report, where a great deal of the cost of the work is attributable to the work necessary below Carlow. Gamble's scheme was too much tied up. It is not radical enough and I am afraid the general purpose was to cut down expense as much as possible.  He was carrying out a scheme not his own. This must be said in his favour.  But the scheme was imposed upon him by a Commission, on which you had two engineers from across Channel.  An examination of the documents he left behind him shows that not merely was the scheme incomplete, but that the costs of the scheme were cut altogether too fine.  You will find undoubtedly the costings for taking out the material from the stream of the Barrow, and putting it on the banks, but there is no separate estimate for the making of that into embankments.  In every possible way there was a decided effort to cut down the cost of the scheme.  We determined to have those documents which are at our disposal thoroughly examined.  We got one of our own engineers to examine the scheme, and he suggested we should employ an engineer whose reputation was above cavil to give it a thorough examination.  He did; the report has been submitted to the Dáil, and presumably the Deputies have read it.  The general results of the report were by no means favourable to the idea that we had anything to start working on.  I may read out one or two passages relevant to this scheme. First, with regard to Manning's:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards the working out of the two schemes it must be mentioned that Mr. Manning's scheme, except for a very short report, consists chiefly of an outline longitudinal section. Nothing is shown regarding the details of the manner of determining the new course of the river. Mr. Gamble's scheme is worked out more fully, as detailed plans on a considerable scale are available for the stretch from Clogrennan to Monasterevan. These plans, however, are radically incomplete.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise the last sentence. &ldquo;There are several alternatives ... Hence it is absolutely out of the question <Col N="1650" /> to carry out at the present time either the Manning or the Gamble scheme without studying afresh the whole problem from the beginning.&rdquo; On page 5 we have &ldquo;Direct water measurements do not exist.&rdquo;  Then he points out the actual cross-sections prepared by Gamble really only deal with the bed of the river, and do not extend beyond the river banks, and, therefore, do not take into account the immediate neighbourhood of the river.  It was one of the features of the Gamble scheme that back drains would have to be built and so it was necessary to know the contour of the land beyond the banks of the river.  That is not done.  The cross-section is stopped at the river bank. Also borings were not carried out.  In river construction a great deal will depend on the existence of rock.  That affects not merely the regulation of the river as an engineering problem but still more seriously it affects the question of costs.</P>
    <P>There are undoubtedly places where rock exists, but there may be other places, and we are in this position, as a result of the works carried out forty years ago, that we do not know whether rock exists in these other places. Consequently we are recommending borings in the different parts of the river and wherever it is proposed to put new canals.  This refers to the unsatisfactory nature of the estimate of the cost by Mr. Gamble. Then you will find at the close of the report, or practically at the close, at the end of Chapter 5, various things that have to be done before works of this kind can be undertaken, pages 38 and 39: &ldquo;It is always a risk to attempt to regulate a river before all the necessary data have been ascertained beyond doubt.  The longitudinal section suggested might require to be altered according to the result of the borings.  On that account it is to be recommended that all the preliminary investigations should be carried out during the summer of 1925.  These consist of:&mdash;The completion of the ground measurements in the district, contour lines showing levels from foot to foot will be required for the whole flood zone, cross sections should be checked. <Col N="1651" /> The river axis should be divided up into miles with a starting point at Duke's Weir as the zero point.  Determination of the depth and character of the foundation of the bridges.  Completion of the bridges, plans, completion of detailed side plans at all bridges; exact determination of the present water power conditions at all the mills so as to be able to meet possible claims made later on,&rdquo; and, finally, in No. 7: &ldquo;Elaboration of the detailed scheme based on the present general scheme and the surveys suggested above.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the engineering side of the problem we have to face, but in addition there is the question of valuation. That was the rather disconcerting result of the examination of the very considerable mass of documents we had at our disposal, that in reality there is no plan that at the present moment can be carried out.  One of the first things that would have to be done is the drawing up by a body of engineers of a proper plan based on proper surveys, borings, and so on.  As regards the other side of the scheme, the financial side referred to by Deputy Davin, for the modern history of the scheme we need not go back a couple of hundred years.  We have been in charge of this for the last three years, but fifteen months is quite sufficient to refer to.  I will refer to the deputation which was received by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the 3rd March, 1924, and to an account given in a paper that, unfortunately, is no longer with us.  &ldquo;Barrow floods.  Influential deputation meets the Minister.  Spirited offer.  £1 for every £1 of Government grant.&rdquo;  So far as any deputation could be described as representative at the time, it was a representative deputation.  It was introduced at the Government offices by Deputy Conlan and Senator McEvoy, and comprised Messrs. Conlan, T.D.; H. Colohan, T.D.; G. Wolfe, T.D.; W. Davin, T.D.; Senator MacEvoy, clergymen of both denominations, various professional, business and manufacturing gentlemen, and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the really interesting point of real departure comes.  As I say, the modern history of the Barrow scheme dated from that visit and the interview with the Minister.  &ldquo;Senator MacEvoy informed the Minister on behalf of the Barrow Drainage Committee representing the upper reaches of the river, that the Committee would be prepared to pay £1 for every £1 granted by the Government, and the Minister replied that, so far as he knew, this was a considerable improvement on previous propositions.&rdquo; I want to take that quite seriously.  If a work of this kind is to be undertaken by the Government it is reasonably certain that people will expect a grant from the Government. Such an expectation on the part of the people affected might not be unreasonable.  There is also what Deputy Davin has suggested, people whose lands benefited should be asked to pay to the extent of the benefit they are expected to get from this particular scheme.  In addition to that, however, it is quite fair, as the deputation suggested, that besides the Government grant to bridge over what might be a reasonable offer from the Government, and what the improved lands should fairly bear, that the other lands of catchment area, as suggested by the deputation, or the counties affected ought to bear their share.  That is, if the Government representing the country as a whole, is going to contribute money to a scheme of this kind, if people in Tirconaill, Mayo and Kerry are to contribute in a special way to this particular scheme, that is all the more reason why a special contribution should be made in the counties affected and directly benefited, and from the counties in which the money will be spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the offer of that deputation, that is, the fifty-fifty proposition put up by the deputation, is a practical one to suggest as a basis for going on with it, a Government grant, a contribution by the land benefited and a contribution by the rates of the different counties in which the benefited lands are, or in which the money is spent. That is a fair proposition.  The amount, of course, to be borne by the <Col N="1653" /> county rate as distinct from the rate on improved land will vary in the case of each county.  It might go up to 7d. in some places.  In other places it might be much less.  The first step, however, we will have to consider is the necessity of putting forward a workable scheme. We will have to set our engineers working and get them to draw up a scheme, a particular kind of scheme that will be carried out, that will rest on detailed measurements and valuation.  That is the first step, and we are quite willing to take that preliminary step.  I think that is the principal matter I have to refer to on this question.</P>

      <P>I said that amount was available, and as a matter of fact we were advised that probably it might be quite usefully spent or that a considerable sum might quite well, safely and economically, be spent prior to the completion of the plans.  I understand, however, that doubts have been thrown on that and a suggestion has been made now that very little can be spent with the certainty that it would be usefully spent.

      <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a few questions.  In the first place I would like to know the qualifications of this engineer and the experience he had in the drainage of rivers.  One would <Col N="1654" /> think that the last place in Europe that the Government should have gone to for an expert in drainage would be Switzerland, a country of impetuous torrents quite the opposite to the Barrow, which is a sluggish river, with, in some places, a fall of 12 inches to the mile.  This gentleman, except he made excursions into Holland, I am sure never saw a river like the Barrow before. The Parliamentary Secretary's speech will be very disheartening to people looking for relief from the flooding of the Barrow.  Early in the Session a Barrow Drainage Bill was included in the Government's programme of legislation.  It was very near the bottom of the list, but we expected that before the close of the Session that Bill would have seen the light.  It is a great disappointment that it has not been introduced.  With regard to the finance of the scheme, I would not advise the Parliamentary Secretary to rely too much upon the fifty-fifty proposal as a basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another proposition. In all the schemes that have come up there were three areas of charge fixed: first, the lands immediately benefited; secondly, the lands partly benefited, and third, the catchment area.  That was considered a very fair proposition.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would like to go outside the catchment area, I am sure the people inside would have no objection.  The question of the Barrow drainage has been discussed for the last 40 years but we have never got any forwarder.  In the upper reaches of the river there are obstructions which could be removed at very little cost, such as fallen trees, and weeds which have been allowed to grow in the bed of the river.  If there is money available that preliminary work <Col N="1655" /> might be done.  We are told that £50,000 is available, and that preliminary work would give considerable relief from abnormal floods.</P>

After the water has subsided the houses remain damp and cold for a long time. One can imagine the effect that must have had upon the health of the people, especially young children.  Some years ago there was a very extensive factory in that town, but, owing to the encroachments of the Barrow, the business had to be given up.  I join with Deputy Davin in appealing to the Government to do something soon to relieve the great hardship which exists all along the Barrow.</P>

Is any work being done, or what benefits have come to the State since it was passed?  What are the intentions of the Government with regard to the administration of that Act?  Some time ago certain necessary works in my constituency were brought to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary, and inspectors or engineers have gone there and made reports. Was there any intention, when that Act was being passed, of carrying out any work under it?  I suggest that it is time that some work should be done.  Conditions at the moment permit of the doing of this work at perhaps a lower cost than might be possible later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rivers are considerably lower than they were at any period since the Act was passed; that in itself makes it possible to do work that could not have been done as well at any other period, and there is the possibility of receiving better value for any money spent.  The Parliamentary Secretary is well aware of the conditions that exist in my constituency. He knows the need that exists in regard to certain works. Those works ought to be undertaken at the earliest moment.  We want to know the intentions of the Parliamentary Secretary.  To a certain extent we are getting tired of thinking that the work is going to be done.  There is no sign of any practical effort being made to commence the work.  If the Act is <Col N="1657" /> going to be of any service it is time that its provisions would be put into operation.

What functions are carried out by the Government stockbroker?  What appertains to this office?  Does this gentleman get, in addition, any fees in connection with the purchase of stock?

      <P>He buys and sells stock for the Government.  We attempted to get an arrangement made whereby the Government stockbroker, who does a very considerable amount of work for us, would do it at half fees. We could not get the Stock Exchange to adopt any rule that would enable that to be done.  They did agree to a rule which would enable a fixed fee or salary to be paid, in lieu of the ordinary fees, on every transaction.  I think the salary comes to about half of what the amount of fees would be.  Not only does the stockbroker deal with National Loan, but he invests any funds that may be in the hands of the Government. For instance, we have now over £2,000,000 in the Post Office Savings Bank.  Some of that is advanced, in the form of Ways and Means advances, into the Exchequer; but some is invested.  It would be preferable that all would be invested.  For convenience sake some of it has been used by way of Ways and Means advances. There are various funds that have been invested from time to time and investments have to be changed.  All these things are done by the Government stockbroker for the remuneration that is set down here.  The amount is considerably less than if the work were done on the system of paying the usual commission.  It was an arrangement arrived at for the purpose of economy.</P>

During the last few years very large areas of land were submerged; in some instances people were obliged, by reason of the heavy floods, to use boats.  It is very necessary that something should be done to have the area subjected to flooding properly drained; work of that nature would, to a great extent, relieve the unemployment in the country.</P>

      <P>A question was raised in regard to Professor E. Meyer-Peter.  Unfortunately, I have not got a full list of his qualifications here.  When experts were being sought for the Shannon scheme and people from different portions of Europe were considered, Professor Meyer-Peter was chosen as an hydraulic engineer.  We found that he was a man whose experience was considerable in this matter, and a man on whose judgment, on whose hard work, and on whose capability of presenting an unbiassed statement we could absolutely rely.  He has had wide experience of embankments and the drainage of rivers.  We did consider that we would get the best satisfaction from him, and we felt that, on the whole, we would get better value from Professor Meyer-Peter than from anybody else.  Not merely has he had experience in Switzerland, but he was in Italy and France as an hydraulic engineer.  I am quite sure I could satisfy Deputy Conlan with Professor Meyer-Peter's qualifications.  Whatever may be said about not carrying out this scheme, the qualifications of the engineer are certainly above question. It is quite possible that he may never have seen a river like the Barrow&mdash;not actually the river itself but the way in which it has been neglected, and the fact that the problem has never been tackled properly.  That is a fact that would strike any continental coming to this country.  He would be impressed. not merely as regards the drainage, but as regards various other matters as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Conlan described my speech as very disheartening to people looking for relief from flooding.  I had to face <Col N="1659" /> the facts.  We could introduce a Bill, but we had no scheme.  Until we received Professor Meyer-Peter's verdict, we had hopes that we could use some of the material we had in hand with some modifications.  Now his description is that any investigations and schemes prepared before were radically incomplete.  Deputy Conlan struck one note which was very serious and disheartening. He suggested the Government should not take too seriously the pound for pound offer made.  If the Government is undertaking this scheme, it is undertaking it on that basis.  It would be unfair to ask the rest of the country to undertake what, if the counties concerned did not give assistance, would amount to, roughly speaking, about four-fifths of the cost of the scheme, the rest to be paid by the improved lands.</P>

      <P>I was merely going to point out that there is no analogy between the two cases.  In both cases there will be lands that will benefit and they will have to pay, but it is quite clear that the lands benefited cannot pay anything like the whole cost, and it is equally clear that the Government should not be asked to meet the rest of the cost in a scheme of this kind.</P>

      <P>There was another point as to the work that could be done this year.  Professor Meyer-Peter issued a very strong preliminary note of warning.  I have not the report <Col N="1660" /> at the moment, but he does issue a warning as to the danger of undertaking any work before the scheme is fully worked out.  Having done that, he suggests that certain work is, perhaps, possible.  The precise point referred to by Deputy Wolfe was the clearing away of certain rocks between Monasterevan and Athy.  Professor Meyer-Peter says that if the rocks at Bert and Monasterevan are removed, it commits you to the longitudinal section being possibly determined, which you may change.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, there is the question of the depth, how far down you are to go in removing the rock.  Until you drain the waters lower down, the removal of the rock will cost ever so much more. The proper thing in the case of a river is to start below and work upwards. It is quite possible that there are obstacles and obstructions, such as trees lying across the river at Mountmellick and places like that.  These could be usefully removed.  I do not say that this work ought not to be done or will not be done, but the question of the staff at our disposal has to be borne in mind.  If we set men apart to do this work, then we shall have complaints not merely from Deputy Baxter but from other Deputies about the work in their areas&mdash;work of maintenance under the Act of 1924.  They will naturally protest and say that there is work of this kind to be done and why not do the work which the Department is entitled&mdash;not to say required&mdash;to do before tackling this other work which will naturally form portion of the general scheme of the Barrow drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the point raised by Deputy Baxter.  It is not a fact that we have not done any work under the Act of 1924.  We have done work in various counties.  We have put up various schemes.  Various schemes have been put before the Ministry of Finance and have been approved of by the Ministry of Finance.  We have sent down our engineers to see when the work could be started and, in many cases, we have started the work.  Notwithstanding the recent fine weather, in many cases in the West of Ireland, owing to the excessive rains during the <Col N="1661" /> winter, work could not reasonably be started.  But work has been started in Kildare, Galway, Mayo and various other parts of the country.  In all, about twenty schemes have been put up.  Deputy Baxter complains that in his particular county no work has been undertaken.  Deputy Baxter has the misfortune, or perhaps good fortune, to represent Cavan.  Cavan furnishes an extremely difficult problem.  The points that Deputy Baxter dealt with are extremely difficult.  The Deputy is particularly interested in the drainage of the River Rag.  That river raises not merely a difficult engineering problem but, as I pointed out to the Deputy, almost an international problem.  The River Rag belongs to an existing drainage district on which the whole rate has not yet been paid back.  As a result of that, that portion of the river is liable for the existing drainage rate for repayment of the capital sum on the Lough and River Erne drainage district, of which seven-eighths are in the Six Counties.  That is a problem in which Deputy Baxter is interested and I am interested.  It is a problem that I would be very keen on getting settled but it is extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>Where you have one drainage district imposed on another drainage district, with a double drainage maintenance rate for the inside district such as in the case of the two drainage districts&mdash;Loughs Gouna, Oughter and River Erne and Lough Oughter and River Erne&mdash;the problem is difficult to deal with.  How to do work within the limitations of the Act of 1924, and not put an unfair burden on the people of the inner area, which has to bear a double charge, is a problem that has, up to the present, baffled us.  But I am not without hope that we may be able to do something in that particular district. As regards the Awbeg, I cannot help the Awbeg at present.  I have no responsibility for the Awbeg flooding roads in County Cork.  It is not an existing drainage district.  Therefore, the Board of Works cannot go in and do anything to it.  I have often wondered how such a sluggish river got into the County Cork.  It is not what I would expect from that county. <Col N="1662" /> Apart from the engineering question, which is rather difficult, we cannot deal with the Awbeg.  We would be trespassers if we went in.  The Deputy will have to wait until the Bill, which passed through the Seanad to-day, has become law, and then proceed in the way prescribed by the Bill.  The initiative can be taken by the local people affected by the flooding, and I hope the engineering difficulties will not be too great.  As I pointed out, they are very considerable.  There will then be the question of compensation.  In order to relieve the upper lands, you will have to buy lands lower down to which the water can flow.  How far the whole scheme will be an economical proposition is a question that can be considered when the initial steps are being taken by the local people affected.</P>

      <P>Might I ask whether I would be in order in drawing the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to an area which is continuously flooded during the winter in the city of Dublin. The area is known as North Lotts, in the parish of St. Laurence O'Toole. From 300 to 500 houses are flooded to the extent of three or four feet three or four times a year in that area.</P>
