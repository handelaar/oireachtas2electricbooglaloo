      <P>The year 1923-24 was the first year for which assessments were made for the Saorstát.  Until the accounts for that year are closed and detailed schedules of discharge and default are available, it will not be possible to state how much of the revenue collected was attributable to each Schedule.  These schedules are not expected to be ready for at least another year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the Committee to inquire into the Ordnance Survey, the appointment of which he announced on July 25th, 1924, and referred to again on November 5th, has yet held any meetings, and, if so, how many; whether representatives of the various branches of the staff of the Department have been invited to give evidence or have yet done so; and if he can state when the inquiry is expected to be completed.</P>

      <P>Owing to unforeseen difficulties in bringing all the members <Col N="1318" />together at one time, the Committee have not yet held a meeting.  The procedure to be followed in obtaining the evidence, if required, has not, therefore, been settled, but any evidence the staff can usefully give on the subject of the inquiry will, no doubt, be taken.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he can state the grounds on which the blind pension was stopped from Patrick Murray, Brianbeg, Drumraney, Moate; if he is aware that he resides in a labourer's cottage, and has no other income; <Col N="1319" /> that the applicant has been in receipt of the pension since the passing of the original Act; that Murray has furnished doctors' certificates to the effect that he was and is stone blind, and whether he will have payment of pension made forthwith, with the arrears which were withheld since the 6th March, 1925.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The pension in this case was discontinued pursuant to the decision given on the 3rd instant on appeal upon a question raised by the pension officer as to whether the pensioner fulfilled the statutory conditions of blindness. One of the Department's medical inspectors made a detailed examination of Mr. Murray's eyesight on the 27th ultimo.  He reported that, in his opinion, the pensioner, who was difficult to examine as he would give no assistance, had useful vision, which debarred him from a pension under the statute.  Mr. Murray obtained the blind pension at the inception of the Act.  The medical certificate of the 15th November last, furnished in connection with the recent appeal, does not state that Mr. Murray is stone blind, but said that he was in the same condition as he had been four years previously, and was incapable of doing anything for himself, as his eyesight was so bad.  In view of the facts, as certified by the Department's inspector, it is regretted that the pension cannot be restored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the applicant can supply doctors' certificates to the effect that he is stone blind?  This man did not receive a pension. He was not all attention to the inspector, and the inspector turned down his claim because he was not all apologies to him.  The man's sister is only getting 14/- a week, home help, and she is also blind.  These two people have to live on the county, and the Minister refuses to give this man his right.  Will the Minister consider fresh evidence in his case?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The medical inspector has a very precise method of ascertaining whether a person is blind or not, <Col N="1320" /> and his decision in a particular case is final.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether four Income Tax Officials have been brought over from Great Britain within the past three months to aid in the administration of the Department of the Revenue Commissioners, and, if so, if he will state why this addition to his staff became necessary, and whether it is intended to have these officials permanently transferred to the Saorstát service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are as stated in the first part of the question. The Income Tax staff was reduced by six inspectors on 6th December, 1924, by reason of the departure of men who had been on loan since 6th December, 1922.  There were no trained officials available in the Saorstát to replace these men, and it became necessary to arrange for a loan of four inspectors to enable the Revenue Commissioners to carry on the work.  It is not intended to secure these officials for permanent service.  Arrangements were made to obtain permanent staff which is now in course of training.  It may be added that a period of at least three years is necessary for the training of an Inspector of Taxes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. O'Neill's liability to income tax was determined on appeal by the Special Commissioners of Income Tax, and is not, therefore, in dispute.  Several applications were made to Mr. O'Neill by the collector of taxes for payment of the tax due by him, but as he failed to pay it became <Col N="1322" /> necessary to deduct portion of the compensation award in satisfaction of Mr. O'Neill's liability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's answer, perhaps he is not aware that Mr. O'Neill never paid income tax under the British regime, because he was always in a position to show that he did not come within liability for income tax, and now he has got much less than he had before.</P>

      <P>Only 45 contributions have been paid up to the present for John Jones, of Upper John Street, Wexford.  In respect of these contributions he has been paid in the current benefit year benefit for 45 days on a claim made by him on the 30th October.  Under existing legislation, there is no power to pay him further benefit unless and until further contributions have been paid for him. Contributions under the Unemployment Insurance Acts become payable in respect of employed persons when they reach 16 years of age.  It appears that there was doubt as to the exact date on which John Jones reached insurable age, and in consequence it may have happened that his last employers should have commenced to pay contributions <Col N="1323" /> in respect of his employment earlier than they did.  It is understood that they are willing to pay any contributions that may be due when Jones satisfies them as to his age.  If further contributions are paid, it will be open to Jones to renew his claim for benefit.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his Department is making any effort to induce the Cement Marketing Company to reopen their works at Wexford; if he is aware that consignments of cement were leaving the works daily by rail until the railway siding there was broken, and if he can say who is responsible for the repair of this siding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Various Government Departments have, during the past few years, continually taken such action as they could to secure a market for the cement produced in the Drinagh Cement Works, and these efforts have achieved a considerable measure of success.  At present, I understand, the works are closed, while accumulated stocks are being disposed of, when I presume, the works will be re-opened.  The siding referred to is, according to my information, the property of the Cement Company and will no doubt be repaired when the Company requires the siding for  orders received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is apparent that the Cement Works require the siding at the moment; that up to the time the sleepers were broken, cement was being removed daily and that now it has stopped; is he aware that there has been a conference between the Railway Company and the Cement Company with a view to finding out who is responsible for the repair of the line, and if not, will he make inquires into the matter?  I would also like to ask the Minister if he is aware that the Dublin Corporation were taking a certain amount of this product up to the time the Commissioners were appointed <Col N="1324" /> and that since then the supply has ceased?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to what Deputy Corish has asked, supplementary to his original question, if the Cement Company require the immediate use of the siding, which, according to the best of my information, is their property, it is up to them to repair the siding and make use of it.  I am not aware as to the conference between the Railway Company and the Cement Company on the question of ownership. To the best of my information, the siding is the property of the Cement Company.  I understand that, prior to the advent of the Dublin Commissioners, cement was taken from the Drinagh Cement Works, when the Drinagh Cement Company had not sent in the lowest tender.  I personally endeavoured to secure a further contract for the Drinagh Cement Company, even though the same circumstances obtained.  I cannot say whether or not that contract was given to them.  I have no information on the point raised by Deputy Johnson.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a point which Deputy Corish has raised by way of Parliamentary Question and in the course of debate here and it is very difficult for me to state whether or not there was any promise made as to making inquiries into allegations of dumping.  I have always said, in reply to that, that there was no definition of what &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; was and, while inquires were made, I cannot state for the satisfaction of the Deputy whether or not there is proof of &ldquo;dumping&rdquo;<Col N="1325" /> because, his idea of what &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; means and my idea of what it means may be quite different.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the advisability of taking the matter up with the Cement Marketing Company, with a view to the holding of another conference?  I think the Minister will admit that matters have charged considerably in this connection since the amalgamation of railways was brought about.  He will remember that on the last occasion that we discussed this matter, there was a question of the cement passing over two lines, with consequent transfer and other charges, which militated against the best interests of the Cement Company. Would the Minister not think that this would be an opportune time for the holding of a conference, with a view to having the Cement Works opened and providing employment for the 60 men there?</P>

      <P>Deliveries and despatches of mails on Bank Holidays were suspended in An Saorstát as far back as March, 1923, but on Bank Holidays which follow a Sunday or <Col N="1326" /> other public holiday night mail despatches take place where the train service permits.  St. Patrick's Day of this year did not follow a Sunday or other public holiday, and consequently there was a complete suspension of services, except in Dublin, where a delivery of correspondence for commercial houses was afforded to callers (which is not afforded on Sundays) and a special late evening collection was made as on Sundays.  The fact of the day being the National Holiday rendered restriction of labour desirable as far as possible.

      <P>The Minister for Justice, in moving the Second Reading of this Mussolini measure, stated that he was prepared to give the most careful consideration in Committee to any amendments that were brought forward. Yesterday he endeavoured to throw dust in the eyes of the Deputies by asking them to accept the view that this Bill was the main issue in the recent elections and that it had received an overwhelming endorsement <Col N="1333" /> from the people.  Well, if the Minister's speeches in the many parts of the country that he visited to support his candidates are to be taken as any indication of what the real issue was, the real issue certainly was not the Treason Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The real issue, as I understand it, was the extinction of the State.  The non-recognition of the existing Constitution was the issue raised by the Minister's political opponents. Peculiar to relate, however&mdash;and it is a remarkable fact&mdash;in one of the constituencies in which a supporter of the Minister was seeking election the people were so inactive or so ignorant in realising that that was the issue that they elected a man who was not prepared to recognise the Constitution or this House in preference to a man who, if elected, would have come into the House.  I sincerely hope that this big issue that means nothing to the people, but is only blindfolding them, the issue of the Treaty <i>versus</i> a visionary Republic, will be dropped; that issues, like the present Bill, and other measures for which the Minister and his colleagues are responsible, will be put to the electors, that they will have an opportunity of voting on these issues, and not on blind issues and others which the people who were opposing the Minister have been raising for the past three years.  I am prepared, and have always been willing, to vote for the giving of the widest possible discretion to the judges appointed by the Executive Council in interpreting and administering the Acts that are passed here, but I am not prepared as a layman to allow to go through in a Bill like this words which it is not possible even for a judge to understand if he should be called upon to interpret them.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this section the expression &ldquo;secret society&rdquo; means an association, society or other body, the members of which are required by the regulations thereof to take or enter into, or do in fact take or enter into, an oath or other engagement not to <Col N="1334" /> disclose the proceedings or some part of the proceedings of the association, society or body.</P>
    <P>I think it is not an exaggeration to say that many men before joining the Army belonged to or were associated or connected with tontine societies, insurance societies, and other bodies of that kind, that from the clause as it stands could properly be interpreted as being undesirable associations.  I also know that members of the police forces belong to tontine and sick fund societies, so that to allow the sub-section to remain as it is, without any explanation from the Minister as to what is in his mind when he asked the Dáil to include such vague wording, is something I do not stand over.  Any person who joins any organisation composed of six or more individuals can be said to belong to a society, association or body. Most organisations of such a nature have some kind of written constitution. Surely it is going beyond all reason for the Minister to include in a Bill like this words that would prevent a policeman or a soldier from belonging to a tontine, a burial, or an insurance society, or even a football club or the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation. Perhaps even hurling clubs, athletic clubs and coursing clubs might be brought within the meaning of the sub-section as it stands.  I hope the Minister will explain to the Dáil what he had in mind when he inserted these words.  I also hope that Deputy Gorey will support me in asking for the deletion of the words in view of the strong language he used yesterday evening, and that he will not walk into the lobby and not vote, but show what his convictions are by voting on this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of a secret society has been criticised on the grounds that it is too broad.  I am prepared to meet that view by inserting instead of the words &ldquo;or other engagement,&rdquo; the words &ldquo;affirmation or <Col N="1335" /> declaration,&rdquo; so that the definition would read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In this section the expression &ldquo;secret society&rdquo; means an associaciation, society, or other body, the members of which are required by the regulations thereof to take or enter into, or do in fact take or enter into, an oath, affirmation or declaration not to disclose the proceedings or some part of the proceedings of the association, society or body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is as near as I can go to a satisfactory definition, while I am open to consider any alternative definition that may be proposed.  As I pointed out yesterday, the gist of the objection is that people might enter into commitments and obligations that from the nature of the position cannot be known to the general public, and may conflict with their obligations to the general public.  It is easy to criticise the definition in the Bill on the grounds that it is too broad, and that it embraces, or might be held to <Col N="1336" /> embrace, bodies which there is no need in fact to cover, and which are not in themselves objectionable.  I will consider any alternative definition which any ingenious Deputy may put forward, and if it is considered more satisfactory than the definition in this Bill, I will certainly insert it.</P>

      <P>That paragraph seems to be out of keeping with paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (e).  These paragraphs deal with questions of crime or a breach of the peace, but there is no specific reference to crime or breach of the peace in paragraph (d).  As it stands it would mean that a person present at any affirmation or declaration to obey the orders of any committee, council, or body of men not lawfully constituted, or of any leader or commander or other person not having authority by law for that purpose, is guilty of a misdemeanour. That is, to obey the orders of any such people, beyond what snag there may be in the words &ldquo;not lawfully constituted,&rdquo; is a misdemeanour. It seems to me the paragraph would hit against the Cumann na nGaedheal party, or might hit against many an ordinary group of business people who would be associated for the purpose of transacting their own business.  It seems to be out of keeping with the section as a whole.</P>

      <P>The object of the sub-head was to prevent people from simply making a neat parcel of their <Col N="1339" /> wills and intellects and handing them over to the custody of some other citizen or citizens, undertaking implicit obedience to any instructions that might come from a particular quarter. One can see the objection to that unless we are to assume that in any such engagement there is at all times the mental reservation that such instructions must be in accordance with law.  The instructions over a period may be perfectly harmless and lawful, but at some other time they may become of a different character.  That was the idea in which the sub-head was written in.  It has ocurred to me that possibly it is too broad and that it might, for instance, be held to cover such things as vows of obedience by religious orders, and so on.  I am willing to accept the Deputy's amendment.  As a matter of fact, I do not believe any prosecution will ever be brought under this section. I regard the section as of very little practical value.</P>

      <P>If any Deputy seeks immortality by putting down a motion to have this section deleted I will give very careful consideration to it.  It is largely <i>in terrorem.</i> Undoubtedly the things that are sought to be guarded against by the section are objectionable and dangerous, but one could scarcely ever visualise sufficient evidence being forthcoming to support a prosecution under the section.  I do not undertake absolutely that if a motion is put down to delete the section, I will accept it automatically, but I will consider it very carefully, because I attach very little value or importance to the entire section.  For present purposes I am prepared to accept the Deputy's amendment to delete sub-section (1) (d).</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister has had time since he spoke a moment ago to consider whether he will press <Col N="1340" /> his motion to include the section.  It is quite clear from the Minister's own statement that it is a useless section. It is not going to be ever enforced.  It is merely to be in keeping with the rest of the Bill, largely <i>in terrorem,</i> to be held over the people as a terror so that you make people good citizens by holding over them the big stick of five, ten, fifteen or twenty years' penal servitude. That is the conception behind the Bill as a whole, but in this case it is quite clear the Minister is not enamoured of the section, and I think in view of what he said that the House should vote against the inclusion of the section in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I wish the Deputy had made a better case for its deletion. In any case I have not had time to consider all the profound things he said on that point.  The things that are sought to be guarded against here are, beyond question, wrong and dangerous, and perhaps that is a sufficient reason why they should be formally prohibited in an Act.  I repeat what I said, that I think the practical value of the section will be small because it is a kind of offence regarding which it is very difficult, if not impossible, to substantiate a prosecution from the very nature of it.  If, by chance, evidence were to come into the possession of the Executive regarding this offence, it would be an eminently proper thing to have a prosecution, and for that reason, and in the absence of anything more substantial urged against the section, I will stand for its inclusion.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say, as one who must have considered these questions, whether or not there is at present on the Statute Book laws dealing with the administration of unlawful oaths?  I think he will find there is such a Statute, and all that now remains in this section, after the amendments have been accepted, is a prohibition against the administration of unlawful oaths.  If that is already prohibited by law, and a penalty imposed by law, why add another section to the Bill when it is entirely redundant?</P>

    <P>Motion declared carried.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 11.</P>
    <P>(1)  Where a Justice of the District Court is satisfied on the information on oath of an officer of the Dublin Metropolitan Police or the Gárda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent that there is reasonable ground for suspecting that there are treasonable or seditious documents in any specified building, land, premises, or other place, such Justice may issue to such officer such search warrant as is mentioned in this section.</P>
    <P>(2)  A search warrant issued by a Justice of the District Court under this section shall be expressed and shall operate to authorise a named officer of the Dublin Metropolitan Police or the Gárda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent, accompanied by such other members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police or the Gárda Síochána (as the case may require) as such officer shall think proper, at any time within forty-eight hours after the issue of the search warrant, and if needs be by force, to enter and search the specified building, land, premises, or other place aforesaid (which place shall be also specified in the warrant) for treasonable or seditious documents and to seize and remove all documents found on such search which appear to such officer to be treasonable or seditious.</P>
    <P>(3)  The officer conducting the search of a place under such search warrant as aforesaid may demand the name and address of any person found in such place during such search and (without prejudice to any other power of arrest vested in him by law or by virtue of any lawful warrant) may arrest without warrant any such person who refuses to give his name or his address to such officer or gives a name or address which such officer knows or suspects to be false or misleading.</P>
    <P>(4)  In this section the expression &ldquo;treasonable or seditious document&rdquo; includes any document which relates, directly or indirectly, to the commission of any act which is by this Act declared to be treason or to be a felony or a misdemeanour and any document which is a seditious libel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>At first sight these amendments would seem to be almost consequential and to follow naturally on the dropping of Section 5, but the Deputy will remember that I said that certain offences of sedition would still be indictable in common law, and consequently it could be argued that the words sought to be deleted have their value in this section.  At the same time I do not propose to oppose these amendments.  I am willing to accept them and to confine the power of search to search for documents of a definitely treasonable nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to tell us, if he can, what is the present power of search regarding treasonable or seditious documents and whether there is any justification for enacting new legislation.  I would imagine from the experience of the last 25 years that police officers have ample power to make searches where they may believe documents relating to unlawful conspiracy, sedition, or treason may be.  Searches of that kind have been made and I assume that they have been made under law.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us what is the need for a section of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The section really bears its meaning and its reason on its face.  There is no power of search for documents at the moment.  While the Deputy could, of course, remember many cases where such searches were carried out by military and police in the past, they were carried out simply in a forced situation and had no statutory authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Pre-1914 there was, so far as I have been able to find out, no power or right of search for documents. <Col N="1344" /> There are many rights of search in the police.  There is, of course, the right of search for arms under certain Acts.  There is the right of search under certain of the customs and excise regulations and so on.  But there is, so far as I have been able to find out, no specific right of search for documents, and I think it is proper that there should be such a right and that the police should not be in a position of resorting to the subterfuge of saying that they visit a house in search of arms when, in reality, they visit in search of treasonable documents.  I think there ought to be a definite right of search to cover this particular matter, but it is new legislation.</P>

      <P>Citizens of Saorstát Eireann resident in County Donegal obtain their passports from Dublin, through the local Superintendents of the Gárda Síochána in the same way as citizens resident in any other part of the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consular districts are based on considerations of administrative convenience, and Donegal is included in the United States Consular District of Belfast, to which residents of that county must go to obtain a U.S. Visa or to transact other American Consular business. The alteration of the Consular <Col N="1332" /> district involves a redistribution as between Consular district of the emigration quota and of other Consular functions, and it is not considered desirable to request the United States Government to make such alteration until the boundaries of Saorstát Eireann have been settled.</P>
