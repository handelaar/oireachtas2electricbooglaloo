      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware of the reduction in old age pension from 10s. to 9s. per week in the case of Patrick Mulligan, of Maynooth, Co.

      <P>There has been no appeal to me in connection with this case, and consequently I have no information in regard to it.</P>
      <P>It would appear from the Deputy's question that the pensioner did not attain the age of eighty years until the 7th November last.  He is not eligible, therefore, for the ten shillings pension. The concession in that matter, made by the Act of 1924, was limited to persons then in receipt of the pension who attained the age of eighty years on or before the 20th June, 1924.  There was no provision in the Act to enable me to authorise the ten shillings pension in cases where the pensioner attained the age of eighty years at a date later than the 20th June, 1924.</P>

The schedules of particulars were amended, and as the tenants did not pay the reduced amounts, proceedings were taken.  The Land Commission received on the 3rd instant from the State Solicitor a letter addressed to him by Mr. R.

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether he is aware that the estate of D.R. Mahony and others in the townlands of Mountcollins and Caherlevoy, was vested in the Land Commission in October, 1908, and that tenants agreed to purchase provided that this congested estate would get sufficient turbary for their holdings of an average valuation of £5, and an improvement scheme generally on the estate; that there was only a partial improvement on this estate, and that turbary has not been provided for the tenants, and if he is aware that turbary is for sale at present in the neighbourhood, and whether he would have same inspected and portion allocated to the tenants on this property; further, whether he would consider the advisability of removing some of the farmers of this congested district to some other portion of land in the county, and whether he would get the Land Commission to expedite the vesting of these holdings in the tenants, and if he will state what is the cause of the delay in this case.</P>

      <P>The estate of D.R. Mahony was purchased from the Land Judge by the Land Commission under the provisions of Section 7 of the Irish Land Act, 1903, and was vested in the Commissioners in 1908.  The estate comprised some 1,000 acres of the townland of Mount Collins, Co. Limerick, in the occupation of some thirty-five tenants; these holdings were very much intermixed and partly sub-let, and including houses in the village of Mount Collins (some in the occupation of sub-tenants) with detached plots.  The nature of the estate, the greater part of which consisted of moor, part of which had been reclaimed, the intermixing of holdings, and numerous sub-lettings called for a re-arrangement so far as possible, with a view to resale in an improved condition, and, for this purpose, the acquisition of some untenanted land in the vicinity was essential. It was not, however, until 1918 that the Commissioners were able to acquire some fifty-three acres of the lands at Caherlevoy, <Col N="486" /> immediately adjoining this estate.  A scheme was prepared for the resale of the lands of Mount Collins and Caherlevoy to the Mahony tenants, including several sub-tenants, so as to relieve the congestion, and the Commissioners sanctioned the expenditure of a considerable sum of money for improvements, mainly to buildings.  The Commissioners endeavoured to acquire some twenty-one acres of turbary in the vicinity, but owing to the great increase in the value of turf which took place in 1918, the owner refused to sell except at such a price as the Commissiners could not hope to recover on resale to the Mahony tenants.  The tenants on the Mahony Estate were continually disputing amongst themselves as to boundaries, etc., and it was, therefore, found impossible to proceed with the resale without having a new survey made.  This has now been completed, and the resale will be proceeded with as speedily as possible.  The question of acquiring turbary in the neighbourhood is at present under consideration.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  Its origin lies in the friendly challenge uttered by the Minister for Local Government in December last.  I had put down certain amendments to the Local Government Bill imposing on local authorities the duty of providing allotments for the growth of vegetables.  The Minister explained that in his judgment it was not fitting to place such an obligation on local authorities in a Local Government Bill which had mainly to do with administration, and that that was a matter rather for the Minister for Lands and Agriculture than for him. He promised to consider the matter with the Minister for Lands and Agriculture and see what could be done. Then he said:&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Johnson says he has no other way of making the feelings <Col N="489" /> of the people he represents known except by inserting this amendment in the Bill, but I think that the Deputy and his party adopted a very effective way of making known their attitude with regard to another matter.  They introduced a Railway Bill which met with considerable approval in the Dáil. I do not know but that they will be able to introduce a measure of this kind also.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The present Bill is a response to that friendly challenge.  There is no dispute, speaking generally, about the value of allotments, or plots as they have come to be called.  I think it is generally accepted that the movement for the provision of allotments, for town workers particularly, has been beneficial in every possible way.  It gives healthful recreation, and helpful labour of a kind which is a change from the ordinary wage-earning labour of the occupier of the plot.  It is educative, and it is economical in as much as it helps to provide a variety of fresh vegetable food of guaranteed quality for a family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might deal with the movement for allotments by touching upon the history of the practice of allocating small plots to town workers and to country workers.  Going a considerable distance into the last century, mainly in England and Scotland, but speaking generally, from the year 1907&mdash;I think after the passing of the Small Holdings and Allotment Act in Great Britain, it was mainly a rural movement confined to the villagers or the inhabitants of the very small towns.  It was not until the war that the movement became an urban movement to so great an extent that it has.  I find that in 1909 there were in England and Wales 58,000 individuals who had allotments provided for them by the local authorities, but by 1920 the number had increased to 580,000.  Speaking generally, it has become more an urban than a rural movement. The primary purpose of the plots is to provide vegetables for the family of the plotholders.  It is interesting and very valuable to remember that the greater number of plot-holders had no experience whatever when they began to work on the land. I am informed that not less than 50 per <Col N="490" /> cent. of the plotholders in Dublin had no knowledge whatever of work on land, or of growing crops of any kind. When they began with the plot holding it was to them a matter of doubt whether the potatoes grew like apples on the trees, or that carrots had roots like cucumbers.  That was the state of mind of very many of these plotholders with regard to the growth of food. Nevertheless, the fact is proved that the urban worker has become in most cases more successful than the country-bred plotholder.  That is true not only of Dublin but of most of the towns of England and Scotland.  That, I think, is partly to be accounted for by the fact that the town man has developed a variety of taste in vegetables, and that he is not, as a plotholder, confined to the growth of potatoes and cabbage.  During the war time I understand certain prizes were given for the best cared for and the best tilled plots in Dublin district with the best variety and quality of vegetables, and in the second season an absolute novice became the first prize winner.  That is a very interesting consideration, and will show that there is a possibility in this movement of uniting the interests of the townsman with that of the country man, and bringing the townsman to understand some of the difficulties, problems and risks that the farmer has to meet. It will also, perhaps, have the contra effect of inducing the agriculturists-perhaps one might say, more particularly, the country allotment holder, the labourer's cottage holder, who has his acre&mdash;to do more intensive tillage and grow more of his own food than he has hitherto done.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Dáil to recognise that there has been a very valuable economic consideration to many men who have been unemployed during this last year or two in having had at hand a plot which they had learned to utilise to its fullest advantage.  In one case a man who has had long unemployment and a large family informs me that out of his own plot and that of his son they have been able to maintain the family from one year to another entirely in vegetable food.  Had they not had such a stand-by they do not know how they <Col N="491" /> could have gone through the last winter.</P>
    <P>It is not only the men who are convenient to plots that have been induced to take this great interest in the movement. Many cases could be cited in this city where men constantly travelled two and three miles on bicycles for the whole period of the growing season, attending their plots after their work, and sometimes in the morning before they begin work.  Long travel of the kind indicates that there is a real enthusiasm among many people for this plot-holding movement and that enthusiasm has its reactions in a very valuable acquisition of knowledge&mdash;patience as the farmers will tell us&mdash;and social and educative values.  The plot-holders, though there are still 1,000 of them in Dublin and vicinity&mdash;that being a decline from the high peak of 3,000 during the war&mdash;have much to complain about inasmuch as they are not any way secure.  When they have put their seed in the ground and used all their labour, they do not know how soon they may be evicted or deprived of their holding.  That is the main explanation for the decline from 3,000 to 1,000 plots in and around Dublin.  Some of these sites have been taken from them, shall I say, on the plea that they were wanted for building purposes.  A year or two have elapsed from the time the plots were re-occupied, and yet no building has been undertaken.  That is one of the grievances that this Bill is intended to remedy.</P>
    <P>I do not think it worth while, at this stage at any rate, unless one is challenged on the matter, to go into any explanation of or any justification for the decline in plot-holding.  I will say, however, that in my judgement, from the information supplied to me, the men who have maintained their plots are to be congratulated on having had the perseverance and persistence, and that it is not blameworthy upon those others, many of whom have been obliged to give up their plot-holding because of the insecurity, because of the fact in many cases that the fields in which they were working have been taken from them for a variety of reasons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" /> I may say that this Bill contains nothing but what has been in operation in either Ireland, England or Scotland, or is contemplated in reports of the Departmental Committee which inquired into the allotments movement in Scotland.  If any Deputy has any doubt about the moderate character of the Bill, that statement ought to remove such doubt.  In the main, the Bill desires to give moderate security of tenure to the plot-holder, to provide compensation for the value of the growing crops, in case he is obliged to leave the plot during the growing season, to impose an obligation upon the local authorities to provide plots where they can be obtained, and where there is a desire to enter heartily into the movement for the development of plot-holding.</P>
    <P>Part I. of the Bill indicates that there is to be recognition on the part of the local authorities of the existence of plot-holders, or those who desire to be plot-holders, and responsibility for providing land for cultivation in this manner.  I would point out that if six registered electors or rated occupiers notify the local authority that there is a demand for allotments, then the local authority shall take such representation into consideration.  The local authority shall make inquiries, or if they are otherwise of the opinion that there is a demand for allotments by qualified applicants, then they shall acquire any suitable land which may be available, within or without their area, adequate to provide a sufficient number of allotments. The local authority shall be satisfied that there is a demand for allotments by qualified applicants, and Section 8 sets it forth that rules may be made, subject to the sanction of the Minister, defining the qualifications of the persons eligible to be holders of allotments.  Suitable land can be seen to be land which can be obtained, the price of which would be covered by the amount which can be reasonably expected to be paid over in annual payments by the plot-holders.  The duties of the councils shall be, in the case of county areas, to provide plots of half an acre in extent, or in the case of borough councils or urban councils containing a population over 7,000, <Col N="493" /> one-eighth of an acre in extent.  There is nothing to prevent either the borough council or the county council going beyond that if they are able, and consider it wise to do so.  It shall be the duty of the councils to provide such allotments within the provisions of the Bill.  It has been found, so far as spare time occupation is contemplated, in respect of the town or city allotment, that one-eighth of an acre is the standard, and is usually about sufficient to allow a man to cultivate it with care, and give it proper attention. Beyond that, some may be able to do better than others, but, speaking generally, one-eighth of an acre has been found a reasonable standard for a plot. In the country other conditions will be applicable, and probably the plot would not be cultivated wholly as a garden.  A larger area is, therefore, provided for.  Section 7 provides that the Council may enter into agreements with a number of persons working as an association, or working co-operatively, and may let a field to such a body.  It contemplates the existence of such associations.  Another section provides that an association of plot-holders or allotment-holders should be consulted in regard to certain representations that I will come to in a moment.</P>
    <P>As I said, it is intended to establish this allotments movement on a substantial foundation, to give it recognition and, where there are set up allotment committees or organisations of plot-holders or allotment-holders the local council shall take such an association into consideration.  It is provided that a borough council, or an urban district council with a population of 7,000 or over shall establish an allotments committee, and the general supervision of the allotments shall devolve upon that committee, subject to the usual supervision of the council itself.  The allotments committee shall contain, to the extent of one-third of its number, persons experienced in the management and cultivation of allotments, representative of the holders of, or applicants for, allotments.  The allotments movement has been organised in Ireland. It is well organised in Dublin city, where the greatest number of allotments exist.  There are local <Col N="494" /> associations in different parts of the country and there is a general understanding as to the purposes and desires of this movement.  I think it is well that if such a committee is to be set up by a local authority persons actively and keenly interested should receive certain recognition and consultation.</P>
    <P>Part II. of the Bill is one of the utmost importance to many parts of the country.  It is rather an extension of allotments proper and it provides that the same consideration, powers and responsibilities that are sought to be provided for in respect of allotments shall also apply in respect of common pasture. I want to emphasise this point that when we speak in the Bill of common pasture, we are thinking entirely of pasture for milk production, grazing for milch cattle and goats for domestic needs and not for the grazing of stock for sale in the market.  I understand that thought has been raised, in one or two quarters as somewhat objectionable, because it has been stated that in certain counties persons obtained land under public authorities intended for pasture originally for cows, but which was used by Tom, Dick and Harry on behalf of wealthier neighbours for the purpose of grazing stock for sale in the market. The whole object of the Bill is to provide in one case food, and in the other case milk, for consumption primarily by the family of the occupier.  Here and there occasionally there will be a surplus of vegetables of one kind or another, but the primary purpose is to provide food for the family.  We have defined a qualified person as being a person who is prepared to cultivate an allotment by the labour of himself and members of his own family, and who is not already in possession of sufficient land to enable him to provide vegetables for his own household.  The provisions regarding common pastures are subject to modification to meet the special needs of pasture but, in the main, the purpose is the same, to provide milk for the family of the occupier.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the powers given to the Department of Agriculture in Ireland during the war shall be maintained, with modifications.  It is intended <Col N="495" /> that a local authority may acquire land for the purposes of the Bill either by purchase by agreement, by compulsory acquisition, or by purchase from the Land Commission under the Land Act of 1923, or by purchase from the Land Commission by a local authority as trustee in accordance with Section 4 of the Irish Land Act, 1903, and Sections 31 and 69 of the Land Act, 1923.  It is not intended specifically to guard against the taking from a public utility undertaking, corporation or otherwise, of land which is wanted for public works. It is specifically provided that land which is required for housing should be given over to housing, that housing should have precedence, even in the case of land, which is at present under allotments, or may have been at any time under allotments, but is required for housing, subject to three months' notice and subject to compensation for the value of the growing crops.  There is also a provision for the local authority to enter upon what is known as vacant land, that is to say, land which is not the subject of rateable occupation. It is known, of course, that much land which in the early part of the war period was derelict and useless was entered upon and made to blossom as the rose in a way that was nothing short of miraculous.  Vacant lands are still lying in some parts, unoccupied, unused, useless to anybody, and not of any value to the ratepayers as rate-producing land.  It is provided that vacant land may be entered upon by the local authority, but that such occupation should be terminated on due notice.</P>
    <P>What may be said, from the point of view of the allotment-holder, to be the most important provision of the Bill and the factor which will determine whether the allotment movement is to grow or not is in Part IV, which provides that the allotment-holding shall not be terminable except by six months' notice, ending on the 1st May or the 1st November, that is, the 31st October, or if the land is required for building or industrial purposes on three months' notice, or if required by any corporation or public company for <Col N="496" /> purposes other than agriculture, three months' notice, except in cases of emergency.  But when the holding is terminated, or is sought to be terminated, for the ostensible reason that it is required for building, the local authority will have a right to be satisfied that the work, either preparatory to the building, or the building proper, will be ready for beginning at the time of the termination of the holding. There have been not a few instances where men have been deprived of their plots for the alleged reason that it was required for building purposes, and quite a considerable time&mdash;years in one or two cases&mdash;have elapsed, but the building has not yet been begun.  We think that it is quite undesirable that men should be deprived of the opportunity of utilising this land for healthful, valuable work on the plea that it was required for more valuable work, but the more valuable work is not taken in hand, and the less valuable work is altogether denied, so that provision is made in the Bill that the local authority shall be satisfied that the work will be commenced on the termination of the holding.</P>
    <P>I have already said that there is a provision for compensation on quitting the allotment, compensation to this extent, that where men have put in seed and manure they shall not be evicted, if I may use the word, between the 1st May and the 1st November, without compensation for the value of that seed and manure-the growing crops. That is surely a reasonable proposition, but, unfortunately, many men have been made ill-tempered, to say the least, and have become very resentful by virtue of the fact that they have been driven off their plots, have been forced to take everything out of the ground within a very few days, and have lost any value to which their labour has entitled them.</P>
    <P>These are, speaking sketchily, the main provisions of the Bill, and I think, apart from possible faults in drafting, that it should meet with the general approval of the House, and should at least be given the sanction of a Second Reading.  I hope that if the Bill, or any Bill containing similar provisions, becomes law, that it will have the effect <Col N="497" /> of placing this allotments movement on a firm and secure foundation, that it will become very much more popular than it has been hitherto, that it will become general throughout the country, not only in the cities and towns, but in country places also.  The cost to the country will be very small indeed. There is no intention whatever that it will become a charge upon the rates.  As a matter of fact it is specifically provided that the councils shall charge such a sum for the use of the plots as would cover their expenditure for the purchase of the land.  We are not asking for a subsidy; we are asking for an opportunity to encourage a most healthful, beneficent, educative movement that will increase public health, increase the food supply, increase the knowledge of the growth of things, increase the practice of cooperative effort, and engender civic pride.  I think that we might look forward to the development of this movement and, concurrently, a very rapid development of the movement for school gardens in all parts of the country, linking thereby the children at school with the efforts of their parents at home, and inducing also the education authority, whether the Department of Agriculture or the Minister for Education, to put into the field a considerable number of expert horticultural instructors who would help the school-garden movement, help the plot-holding movement, and by these varied means generally promote a very healthful, beneficent change in the face of the country.  I believe that it would not only be a change from the point of view of food production but that the influence would go out and stimulate agriculture indirectly, that is, horticulture in association with agriculture; would induce the farmer as well as the farm labourer to grow more food, and food of a greater variety for his own use, that we would not always be thinking of potatoes and cabbage but of the very much more varied and perhaps more healthful classes of vegetables that are included in the region of horticulture. Throughout England and Scotland, and to a very much greater extent on the Continent, I am informed by those who have recently observed <Col N="498" /> it, this allotments movement has been taken up with great avidity.  It will be taken up here if it is encouraged. Certain discouragements have been general enough in this country and in England.  These discouragements have been removed, but I would like to see an active, positive effort towards the forwarding of this movement of plot-holding made here in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAlexanderNagle" hpid="Mr. NAGLE Mr. NAGLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to second the motion.  I think it should not be necessary to put forward reasons to show that this, or a similar Bill, should be passed.  I think it will be generally agreed that there is a great need and a great demand for land to be held under such conditions.  I am sure that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture will bear me out when I say that in very many parts of the country cottage holders who have only half acres of ground have been demanding additional half acres ever since the Dáil was established.  I am sure that the files of the Minister for Local Government are full of demands from all over the country for an extension of the plots that people already hold, and I am sure the Minister for Lands and Agriculture will bear me out when I say that every Deputy has time and time again, put forward representations from their constituents to acquire lands for growing vegetables or for grazing cows to supply milk.  I think it will be generally agreed that in some of the urban districts in rural Ireland there is a great shortage of milk from the point of view of the working population. Whether it pays farmers and milk producers better to sell it otherwise or not I do not know, but some of the working class people find it almost impossible to buy sufficient milk to keep their children supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know cases where they find it difficult to get more than a pint or half-a-pint per day.  In the rural districts I know many cases of farm labourers who find it impossible to purchase one pint of milk a day from the farmer. Whether the farmers will not supply milk for certain reasons to certain persons I do not know, but it seems that farm labourers other than those actually employed by farmers, find it <Col N="499" /> almost impossible to obtain a supply of milk from the farmers in the locality. Perhaps it pays the farmer better to supply to the creameries than to supply it in small quantities for household use.  I approached the Minister for Agriculture on this point.  I know there have been demands all over Cork and other counties in the South of Ireland for small plots, whereby they could keep milch cows or goats.  I think every Deputy will agree that something should be done to meet this demand. As far as this Bill is concerned, in my opinion it is moderate, and has by no means any suspicion of the taint of bolshevism or compulsory acquirement about it.  It does not try to work a miracle.  In Clause 3 it lays down that a county council is only to be compelled to acquire land where such land is available.  We do not want a public authority to acquire land where land is not available.  I think the Minister for Agriculture will bear me out that in that we are better than some people who approached him recently and wanted land which could not be got except by acquiring some which was under the sea.  I think that the method of payment also in this Bill is a reasonable one.  It does not try to lay any burden whatsoever on the ratepayers. It tends to make the persons, who are going to avail of the allotments provided, make the payments themselves. As the matter is so obviously necessary to me, and as I believe that everyone else has as much intelligence as I have, its necessity, too, ought to be obvious to them.</P>

      <P>I would not care to intervene at this stage, but that I have another engagement of public interest.  With the general principles of the Bill, as spoken to by Deputy Johnson, I have much sympathy.  In fact, as a medical man I am in full sympathy with him, especially in respect of Part II. of the Bill.  Where it provides for milk for cottiers, whether in urban or rural districts, I see great necessity.  Our young people, especially infants, suffer very much from the want of a proper <Col N="500" /> and sufficient supply of milk.  Since the creameries were established, the scarcity of milk is unquestionable.  In fact, the farmers themselves do not get enough milk for their families.  There is some kind of ambition on their part to sum up the total amount of the milk they can send to the creameries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>The result is, as I have said, that they have not sufficient for themselves, nor have they any milk to sell to the cottiers in their neighbourhood. In my practice as a dispensary doctor I always saw, when I entered an agricultural labourers house, a teapot by the side of the fire It seemed to be stewing there from morning to night, and the children, even at as early an age as twelve months, got something out of the teapot. It did not require much imagination to estimate the damage a stew out of that teapot could to the children. I believe that it was responsible for destroying their digestion for all time.  It is true that goats could be made use of for milking purposes.  The goat is a destructive animal and makes it almost impossible for a man to keep anything else on his plot while she is around.  This has led to a great deal of her unpopularity, but there is no milk equal to a goat's milk for rearing young children, mainly because it is almost like human milk in its constitution, and because a goat might be considered immune from tuberculosis.  There is no reason why common pasturage could not be used for grazing goats as well as for a smaller breed of cows, such as the Kerry cow.  Although the Kerry cow is not as immune from tuberculosis, she is nevertheless comparatively free. We have two breeds of cows particularly prone to tuberculosis.  We have first the Jersey; after her the Shorthorn dairy cow comes a good second. That might be of interest to some of the farmers' representatives here.  I hope if this pasturage is got for the use of cottiers that neither the Jersey nor the dairy Shorthorn will be the cow they will have for their milk supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what is the mind of the Government with regard to this <Col N="501" /> Bill.  I somehow imagine they are in sympathy with its principles, but I can quite understand that possibly they would take some exception to the method proposed in the Bill with regard to the acquisition of land.  I would much prefer to see the acquisition of land placed in the hands of the Land Commission or the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.  I say that because he would approach the acquisition of land with a very much more detached mind than the local authority would.  I had a good deal of experience of local authorities and of the acquisition of land, especially for plots for agricultural labourers.  It was no uncommon thing for a man to become a member of a local authority with the idea of taking a plot off himself and putting it on to his neighbour.  It also at times gave a man some peculiar satisfaction to put a plot on some people against whom he had an imaginary grievance. I think the Bill should not be sacrificed over any difference of opinion as to which authority would be the best to acquire the land.  I am certainly in favour of the acquisition of pasture land for allotment purposes, and I think the power should be placed in the hands of the Land Commission.  I think they will acquire those lands in a manner free from any bias and they will give more general satisfaction.</P>
    <P>There must be great care exercised in acquiring those lands.  As Deputy Johnson points out, building land and land required for other accommodation will not be acquired.  I do not think there is any chance of bringing common pasture or land for allotments practically to the doors of those looking for it.  The people must make up their minds that they will have to go out in the country a mile or two.  It will be difficult to get them to do that. I must say, from my experience of the Dublin people who had allotments, that I do not believe anything too high can be said of the way that they utilised them.  They made the very best use of them, and if the same will be done in the country I think the success of this scheme is assured.  I cannot say the same for agricultural labourers throughout Ireland.  I know that many of them let their plots go altogether <Col N="502" /> out of tillage.  I was only wondering will there be any possibility of the allotment-holders doing the same in the more remote urban districts.  I hope the Government, which I have the honour to support, if they cannot adopt the whole Bill, will find some way out in which they can give its principles effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson has, as usual, treated the Bill which he has moved very exhaustively and very carefully.  I would not have said anything, but there was one matter which I do not think he touched upon when recommending the general principles of his Bill.  I support not only the general principle, but, in the main, the way in which the details have been worked out in the actual provisions of the Bill.  There is only one consideration that I desire to touch on, and that is the effect the Bill would have on one of the most important questions in Ireland to-day, the cost of living figure.  Throughout England and other countries the principle that has been embodied in this Bill has been adopted and put into very extensive practice.  The result is it has reduced the cost of living in those countries to a very considerable degree.  We know that the cost of living figure in Great Britain is lower than the figure in Ireland. I am informed by those who made careful inquiry into the matter that the actual figure, if it could be assessed in England, would be considerably lower than the figure set out in the official assessment, and that, in fact, the scale of wages paid in many parts of the industrial areas of England to-day, where trade is in a bad way, would not be sufficient to maintain families except for the fact that the principle of this Bill has been adopted there.  In some areas practically anything between seventy and seventyfive per cent. of the families of the people have got plots like these on which they depend very largely for the maintenance of their livelihood year in and year cut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson referred to the fact that the plot-holding and plot-cultivating movement developed in Ireland very considerably during the period of <Col N="503" /> the war.  It is obvious why that was so.  In the middle and the later stages of the war the cost of living went to a very high figure.  Commodities were difficult to obtain, and it became necessary in many countries to place land at the disposal of the people who proposed to cultivate that land for their own household needs in one way or another.  But for that, in many industrial areas in Ireland and England the cost of living would have been prohibitive. I am supporting this Bill, not merely for all the reasons Deputy Johnson has stated, and which I do not propose to recapitulate, but also for the extra reason that I believe that in addition to all the other benefits the Bill will confer, it will confer the benefit of helping very considerably in enabling people and families in Ireland to find greater opportunities for living within the means they can earn.  Deputy Johnson and his seconder, and also Deputy Dr. Hennessy, to some extent, in supporting the general principle, were agreed in regard to its general provisions.  I think, having read the Bill carefully, that the general actual detailed provisions are very moderate, and are carefully drafted.  I earnestly hope the Government will accept it. We are not now considering the details. The details, if the Bill goes to Committee, can be then amended and brought into general conformity with whatever might or might not be the Ministerial policy in regard to this question.  The general principle of the Bill is clearly one, I suggest, that should be adopted by this House, and I hope the Government will adopt it and give it every facility, even going as far as putting it through in the short time between now and the end of the present session.</P>

As one who has taken an active interest in the allotment movement for some years past, I am glad to notice that many, in fact all, of the contentious points that usually arise as between plot-holders and local authorities have been covered in <Col N="504" /> the various clauses of the Bill.  I hope, if the Minister thinks it necessary to suggest any alterations, they will be very few.  I hope the Bill will go through largely as it is now put forward.</P>

      <P>I am very largely in agreement with the intentions expressed by Deputy Johnson in his Second Reading speech.  On the other hand, I am not at all in agreement with the terms of the Bill.  I think it is at least arguable that the terms go very much further than the intentions expressed by Deputy Johnson. I think it is generally agreed that the demand for plots has fallen off.  Deputy Johnson has given one explanation.  I dare say there is at least something in that explanation; but I do not think it explains the phenomenon entirely.  In any case, it is fairly clear that this Bill does not actually meet the existing demand.  It is an endeavour to develop a demand for allotments.  I think that is the position in regard to the Bill.  It is unlike most legislation; it is not meeting an existing demand to any great extent.  I think it is common cause that the demand has fallen off.  I am afraid the demand has fallen off for reasons&mdash;some people say for one reason, other people say for another reason, but the demand has fallen off for a variety of reasons.  The object of the Bill is to develop a tendency which, I agree with Deputy Johnson, is desirable, and one that is wholly good for a great many reasons, but the Bill I suggest goes considerably further than Deputy Johnson's Second Reading speech would indicate.  It leaves powers to local authorities which he did not intend, or none of us probably contemplated.  It should be cleared up at this particular stage.</P>

    <P>Sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, the first part of the Bill, provide that if a local authority is of opinion that there is a demand for allotments it shall acquire compulsorily, if necessary, either by agreement or by compulsion, either by purchase or hire, any suitable land either within or without its area at <Col N="505" /> such a price as the land shall be worth for allotments.  That is really the substance of the first part of the Bill.  That analysis I have just stated is couched in very general terms.  The terms of the Bill are at least as general.  If you analyse it, it comes to this: if a local authority is of opinion that there is a demand for allotments&mdash;that is all the Bill says, this is what it comes to.  That demand may be very comprehensive or very widespread or very limited.  A demand&mdash;that is all the Bill says.  These are the words of the Bill; these words are implicit in every section, and it is as well at least that that should be pointed out.  The demand may be widespread or limited, but if there is a demand for allotments the local authority must acquire land.  The local authority has no option in the matter.  Not only is the local authority to have compulsory powers, but it must exercise these compulsory powers if there is such an undefined demand as I have just mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">

      <P>It must be the judge of the demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me go on please. Deputy Figgis has said that the local authority must be the judge of the demand. That depends entirely on the wording of the Bill.  We must assume that the judges will give effect to the actual wording of the Bill.  It can meet that demand by saying: &ldquo;In fact we are of opinion that there is no demand.&rdquo; At least that is arguable, and I will read the section in a minute.  It could meet that point by saying: &ldquo;We are of opinion that there is no demand.&rdquo; That would be a most unsatisfactory dilemma to find itself in.  There is a provision for a public inquiry. Half a dozen or a dozen rated occupiers, ratepayers, who might be rich or poor, who might belong to any class provided they were non-landholders themselves &mdash;these are the terms of the Bill&mdash;can give evidence at that inquiry that they want plots.  Therefore there would be a demand, a demand stated in public, and the local authority would find itself faced with a demand which they would be compelled to carry out if it was legitimate or to meet a possible <Col N="506" /> order of mandamus following such a demand.</P>
      <P>If they were not able to meet that demand for any reason, either because they thought it was not a really deserving demand, or for some other reason, they would find themselves in this dilemma, that they would have to say: &ldquo;We are of opinion that there is no demand.&rdquo;  They could meet the case that way probably, within the Bill. That is again a question for the lawyers but it is a most unsatisfactory position for a local authority to find itself in. It is a position that could be very easily righted and it is a difficulty that should be cleared up, and should be cleared up in the Bill itself, such as it is.  I will read sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the Bill.  I am leaving out sub-section (1) because it does not affect the point:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If a local authority, either after inquiry made in consequence of a representation under the preceding sub-section, or otherwise, is of opinion that there is a demand for allotments by qualified applicants, the local authority shall acquire any suitable land, which may be available whether within or without its area, adequate to provide a sufficient number of allotments, and shall let such land to qualified persons resident in its area who desire to take such allotments.</P>
      <P>There you have an undefined demand. I am putting the interpretation of the man in the street on that particular phrase when I say that demand might be a demand by rich or poor, any class you like provided they are non-landholders or non-land occupiers.  There would be no way for the local authority to meet the case except to say in face of the facts at the public inquiry: &ldquo;There is no public demand.&rdquo;  They must acquire it.  There is no option. They must acquire any suitable land to meet a demand undefined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill which makes it clear that land required for dairying purposes or for market-gardening purposes, or even for building purposes, is not suitable land for allotment purposes.  These are all technical matters if you like, but they are very important.  Nobody desires <Col N="507" /> that this Bill, like the Workmen's Compensation Act, should afterwards be the subject of much litigation, and this is now the place to get over these difficulties.  There is nothing in the Bill to show that a judge would not be coerced into saying that such land is suitable for allotments, and must be acquired.  There is nothing in the Bill to say that land which will be required for the three purposes I have mentioned, or for lairage purposes, or for any necessary purpose, should not be taken-nothing that I can see.  That is the difficulty.  Deputies will at least agree with me that that is a thing that is arguable on the face of the Bill, and it is a thing that should not, or need not, be arguable.  The local authority must acquire this land suitable for allotments at a price which land is worth for allotment purposes.  In other words, it would be compelled to acquire land which might be worth £15 per acre for gardening purposes at, say, £8 for allotments.  I think that is clear on the Bill.  The only portion that governs it is the sub-section I have read.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the particular sentence that governs that section: &ldquo;If a local authority is of opinion&rdquo;?  Its opinion is the thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I spent at least two minutes in reading it.  I may be wrong in pointing out that an inquiry will take place, that the words of the section are: &ldquo;On a representation being made in writing to a local authority by any six registered Dáil electors.&rdquo;  You can change that six to any number you like.  You can make it twelve, fifteen, or twenty, and it makes no real difference. These twelve or twenty electors, be they rich or poor, workmen or professional men, shopkeepers, or any class you like, make a demand for allotments.  An inquiry is held on the demand of these six or twelve electors. They state: &ldquo;We require these allotments. We are non-land occupiers, and we demand them.&rdquo;  The local authority is forced into the dilemma of taking up the position which Deputy Figgis now expressed, and to say, <Col N="508" />&ldquo;No, there is no demand.&rdquo;  They would probably be able to get out of it in that way, but it would be an extraordinary state of affairs, in view of the wording of the Bill, which states, &ldquo;if there is a demand.&rdquo;  That is a point that could be argued about, and that should be made clear.</P>
      <P>But what must be made clear also is, that it may take other factors into consideration as well as the mere demand, even a genuine demand, for land, because it is on the line of the lesser of the two evils the local authority must proceed.  It must take into consideration what land was available, whether, in fact, the land was suitable, and whether it was not more useful for any of the other purposes which I have mentioned. That is not made clear at all.  Undoubtedly, dairy land would be suitable land for allotments.  There are large areas of land which would be suitable for building, and which might also be worked as market gardens, and yet be suitable for allotments.  All that would have to be cleared up.  These matters are not clear in this Bill.  There is no reason whatever why we should argue over this, because Deputy Johnson has largely expressed my view.  All I would say is that Section 3 of the Bill goes a long way.  It leaves loopholes to local authorities to go very much further than ever was intended.  Section 3, in my opinion, would have to be completely re-drafted, because practically all the other sections depend upon it.</P>

      <P>Yes, that sub-section reads:&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister points to the possibility of acquiring dairy land, for instance, and says that you cannot acquire dairy land except by following the provisions of Section 68 of the Local Government Act of 1925. That means the holding of an inquiry, the fixing of a fair price as the compensation to be paid, and provides for the furnishing of any other particulars that may be required for what you are defining.  Whatever charge is alleged against Section 3 of this Bill is applicable to the Local Government Act, for which the Minister for Local Government is responsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I am speaking now of what happens before the decision to acquire the land is come to, or before they have adopted the procedure set out in Section 19.  Under Section 3, I think it is clear enough&mdash; at least it is arguable&mdash;that if there is any demand they must acquire any land which is suitable for allotments despite whatever other purpose it may be useful for.  They cannot acquire that <Col N="510" /> land on that sort of an indefinite demand&mdash;at the price which the land is worth for allotments.  I do not think that Section 68 affects my point.  I say that is the position under Section 3, and that is the position that is implicit in the whole of the first part of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Johnson that the plot-holding movement is a desirable one, and one that should be encouraged. It is one that certainly has most of the substantial educational advantages which he has dilated upon, and most of the substantial material advantages which he dwelt upon from the point of view of the poorer people engaged at work in towns and cities. What surprises me is that more advantage was not taken of the allotments which were available in, say, the years 1920, 1921 and 1922, and even earlier. I would be anxious, and everyone on this side of the House would be anxious that that particular tendency should be encouraged.  I realise that you are before your time in this Bill, and that you are attempting in this Bill to develop a tendency which is not very strong at the moment.  I hope the effect of a proper allotments Bill would be to encourage that tendency.  I suggest, too, that any allotments Bill which is introduced will have to make it clear that land may be acquired even if by compulsion if necessary&mdash;that is to say, either by agreement or by compulsion, by the local authority for suitable applicants to be defined, and at a price which will cover all outgoings except perhaps procedure.  That was Deputy Johnson's point of view, but I say it is not there in this Bill.  This Bill, perhaps, goes a long way further, and would have to be amended.  Practically every section would need to be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that a Bill of the sort I have outlined could be introduced, and that it would go some distance in any event to meet the case put up.  I agree that this is not a particularly easy problem to solve, in view of other demands which must be taken into account; demands for dairy lands, for market gardening, and for lairage accommodation. I want to stress that word &ldquo;lairage&rdquo; because of the fact that we do a big export trade in cattle, and <Col N="511" /> we must always have accommodation land for the purposes of that trade which is the most important trade in this country.  No one wants, on the other hand, to take advantage of that necessity, or to cheat the allotment holders' movement out of what it should have in equity, but it is in order to reconcile these two conflicting interests that I suggest that the Bill will require to be redrafted with extreme care and in a different form to the Bill which we have before us.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question as to who should be the controlling authority for a measure of this kind, I suggest it could not possibly be the Ministry of Agriculture.  I say that for this reason, that the procedure under it will entail inquiries, orders, schemes, and so on, somewhat similar to the procedure adopted in connection with the Labourers' Acts and other Acts administered by the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  That Ministry has got a staff to deal with that kind of procedure.  I am speaking now of the acquisition and the division of lands, and I say that is a thing that we could not go into.  If we were to go into it, it would mean a duplication of functions, because from the very nature of the case what we did in a matter of that kind would have to be duplicated by the Ministry of Local Government.  I put it to Deputies that they would be doing the Ministry of Agriculture a very bad turn if, at this stage, they were to expect it to do the work of that kind.  At one time the Ministry did undertake work of that kind, but that was for a particular emergency during the war.</P>
    <P>The functions of the Ministry of Agriculture are really educational and technical, and I do not think it would be doing it a good turn to ask it to but into the vexed questions of the acquisition and the division of lands. The Ministry has to give technical advice and assistance to all sorts and conditions of land-holders.  The functions of the Ministry of Agriculture are to advise existing landholders, whether farmers or horticulturists.  When there is an Allotments Bill passed, and <Col N="512" /> an allotment movement developed under that Bill, then it will be for the Department of Agriculture to give its advice and its assistance to the allotment holders.  Deputy Johnson referred to the horticultural instructors. When the allotment movement is developed, the horticultural instructors will, of course, be at the disposal of the allotment holders.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Land Commission, their functions are for a special purpose, and should stop, I suppose, except for collection purposes that are going on, when land purchase is completed; but the real point is this: Is there any more reason why the Local Government Ministry should not administer this Bill than there is for transferring any other function of the Local Government Ministry to the Department of Agriculture? Perhaps this may not be actually in point, but I did not like to hear Deputy Hennessy giving advice to people who were to enjoy common pasture not to buy any dairy shorthorns for fear of tuberculosis.  I want to say that our dairy shorthorns have far and away a less percentage of tuberculosis than any other breed, and that the percentage of tuberculosis is much lower among Irish dairy shorthorns than among any other shorthorns in any other country, including that of Scotland.</P>
    <P>On one other point, that is as to fixity of tenure, I agree that the plot-holder must realise that when he comes into possession of his plot and puts his manure and seeds into it he must be perfectly certain that he is to have that crop, or that if he does not he must get the fullest compensation.  I am entirely with Deputy Johnson in what he says, so far as that is concerned, but, on the other hand, there should be nothing else in the way of fixity of tenure.  There should be nothing like getting fee-simple title or judicial tenure of the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there is not. With regard to common pasture, what applies to any plot-holder applies, with probably more force, to common pasture. <Col N="513" /> This question is treated here by merely saying that all the considerations, <i>mutatis mutandis</i> applying to allotments should apply to common pasture.  All the difficulties inherent in the Bill in connection with allotments are very much stronger when applied to common pasture.  These particular points must be cleared up, and could not be cleared up by mere amendments of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to say very much after the speech made by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.  The House seems to be in general agreement with Deputy Johnson, and the main provisions of the Bill he has introduced.  I am not going to go into any minute details of it.  We are all in favour of the general principles of allotments.  From the educational point of view and from the health point of view, and from various other points of view, they are worthy of every commendation.  There have been some statements made here which I do not believe are true in all respects. I do not believe that it will reduce the cost of living by anything worth speaking about to have this Allotments Bill put into operation.  It is well known to <Col N="514" /> everybody that the cost of producing food is quite cheap at the present time, that is that food is produced cheaply on the farm.  It is the cost of distribution that makes it so dear in the cities and the towns.</P>
      <P>Deputy Nagle has set up the tenants of labourers' cottages as examples of what might occur when allotments are given to people in towns and cities, but I am afraid they are a bad example. My experience of the dwellers of labourers' cottages is that for the most part they leave their plots sadly neglected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking from personal observation.  At all events, there is no doubt that the demand for plots has gone down considerably in the country.  The returns show that it has fallen 38 per cent. since 1923, and that tendency seems to be on the increase rather than otherwise.  But, as the Minister for Lands and Agriculture has pointed out, that is no reason why we should not do something to foster the development of such an admirable idea.  I do not believe that the labourers will take advantage of an Act such as this Bill would be if it were passed.  In the past it was mostly civil servants and people of the middle class, who took advantage of the present Acts, and that is most likely the class of people that will avail of such opportunities in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great objection, of course, to accepting the Bill before the House has been pointed out by the Minister for Agriculture.  Deputy Johnson dwelt at length on Sections 1, 2 and 4 of the Bill, but he gave very little information about Section 3.  I do not believe it was intentional but, as a matter of fact, there is no protection at all for the property owner in the Bill as drafted. The land may be acquired and it may be compensated for only at the value of the land as plots, not taking into consideration that it may be worth a great deal more as land for building sites or market gardens, or if used for any <Col N="515" /> other purposes.  If the property owner was to be adequately protected there should be some such clause in the Bill as that land taken for the purposes of the Act must be acquired by the local authority in like manner as land taken for the purposes of Part 3 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act of 1890.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson referred to Section 68 of the Local Government Act.  But that, as the Minister for Lands and Agriculture pointed out, only deals with the provisional order.  The section in the Act says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) Any provisional order made by the Minister under the provisions of the Public Health (Ireland) Acts, 1878 to 1919, or of Section 10 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, after the holding of such an inquiry as is mentioned in sub-section (4) of Section 203 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, empowering a local authority to acquire land or other property or rights otherwise than by agreement may be confirmed by the Minister, or the Circuit Court in accordance with the Rules set out in the Sixth Schedule to this Act.</P>
    <P>The object really is to give the Minister the power to make an Order without having to lay it on the Table of the House, but any act taken would have to be done under some other statutory authority and for the purposes of this Act the proper statute to work under would be the Housing of the Working Classes Act of 1890.</P>
    <P>There is another matter, and that is that there is no limit to the length of time for which the land may be acquired. I suggest a limit of probably about 5 years should be the length of time for the land to be acquired for this purpose.  These and various other little minor imperfections, running through the whole body of the Bill, would make it rather difficult for us to amend it on the Committee Stage.  I suggest to Deputy Johnson that it would be better for him to withdraw the Bill, and allow us to introduce a Bill embodying the same principles, but more in accordance with former statutes, and I undertake to introduce such a Bill.  I am not going to undertake when the Bill will be passed.  That <Col N="516" /> would depend on its passage through this House and through the Seanad, but early next session I will undertake to have such a Bill introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I cannot agree with the statement of the Minister for Local Government relative to the neglected state of the plots belonging to labourers' cottages throughout the country.  I find it very different in my own part of the country.  These cottages and plots are an actual education to many people.  The greatest keenness for prizes prevails in these competitions amongst labourers.  Their plots are certainly a credit to themselves and to their families.  Many of them produce an amount of food that one would scarcely expect to get out of such a small quantity of land.  In those times of stress and unemployment they serve as a great aid to keep those large families.  In my part of the country, some competitions were got up many years ago.  Those still continue. The County Committee of Agriculture also have competitions, and there is very great keenness amongst the competitors.  In the four districts in my county the labourers go in a good deal for these prizes.  I do not know whether this may be the means of keeping their cottages and plots in such a neat condition or not. At any rate, the fact is there that there are no such well-kept houses even amongst the small or large farmers, as those labourers' cottages in the County Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other Deputies who have spoken on this matter I am entirely in agreement with the principle of allotments.  For twenty years I went, every year, to England for four months, and lived in a place outside York.  Next to me there was a very large allotment.  It had originally been what we call a &ldquo;grazing ranch&rdquo; here.  The owner thought it would be a good thing to offer it for allotment. He did so with great success, and it was largely taken up by men in the railway works at York.  It was an education to see those people in the evening working at their allotments and their small greenhouses, and that <Col N="517" /> sort of thing.  They brought out their children with them.  I think it was a sight that anybody would approve of. I was very much impressed by it, at all events.  But this particular allotment, and, indeed, any allotment that I know of in connection with the towns, are mostly run by allotment associations, and they are not brought under the control of any local body.  In that way they seem to work very well.  Of course, it is mostly the older people who use them.  I did not see many of the younger men or women coming out. It was mostly the older people, who bring out their small children.  I think it would be the same here.  I do not know how it affects Dublin, or whether there would be a great demand for these allotments here.  I agree, to a great extent, with what the Minister for Local Government says, that a lot of plots under the Labourers' Acts are neglected.  Some are beautifully kept, and it would delight a horticulturist to see how carefully the tenants cultivate these plots.  I am afraid that in my district, however, the majority of the plots are not well kept, and a great many of them are neglected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they worse than the farms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There are also some villages where the cottages have gardens attached to them, and the tenants do not take the trouble to work them at all.  That is beyond yea or nay in the case of some villages. With regard to the largest town in my district, I know there are allotment gardens run in connection with the Technical School, and they are very well kept.  These are more or less instruction plots.  But there has never been any great demand for any more of these plots.  If there had been such a demand one would have heard it. The demand would have made itself felt.  I do not think there would have been very much difficulty at the time these allotments were taken in Naas in getting additional plots if the demand had been pressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the principle, of course, it is an excellent principle, and one that should be aided in every way.  But <Col N="518" /> I am not in favour of the local authority, which is already overburdened, taking up the management of these allotments.  I think they should be run entirely by a local association.  That would be much more satisfactory.  In this Bill the principle of sub-letting is not done away with.  To my mind, sub-letting is a very bad thing to enter into any of these agreements.  Section 7 of the Bill says an allotment shall not be sub-let except with consent.  That does not do away with it. I think sub-letting ought be prohibited absolutely. Sub-letting is most detrimental to any of these holdings.  With regard to the matter of common pasturage, I think that is a most important matter.  In most of the villages with which I come in touch, people who have cows can generally put them out for the summer or winter on their neighbour's land. As far as I know, that is possible.</P>

      <P>There is a cheaper plan for grazing cattle than taking land like that.  In a couple of villages in Yorkshire my experience is that up to five years ago they had a custom there by which the villagers used graze their cows along the bye-roads between the hours of eight o'clock in the morning and five in the afternoon.  The cattle used be under the care of an old man, generally an old age pensioner. If you go round the Yorkshire villages you will see those cows under the care of some old man.  This is allowed by the District Council, and it is a great benefit to the people concerned.  They pay nothing for it except what is paid to the old man who looks after the cattle.  That custom seemed to work extremely well.  Without doubt, it was a great benefit to the people.  I think it would be well worth while considering it here.  We have certain bye-roads in the country, around the villages, where there are broad grass stretches, and where the cattle might be grazed if they were under proper control.  That would be a different matter to having them running about, as they are now, without anybody in control of them.  It is a different thing <Col N="519" /> if there is somebody to look after them, to see that no accident happens, and that the cows are brought home at the proper time.  I think that is a matter that might be considered.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, I think that making the Local Government Authority the body to whom this work would be entrusted would be unworkable. The additional burden would be too much, and, for that reason, I hope that some other measure, which will be clearer and more suited than this, will be brought before the Dáil.  I hope that such a Bill will be brought in soon.  I believe the principle of allotments is an excellent one, if we can only get the people to take it up.  Perhaps when it becomes an established thing, and when it will be possible for the people to have these allotments, they will become more popular.  I am sorry that at present they are not popular.</P>

      <P>I suppose it would be thought that I should oppose the Bill on account of the source from which it emanates.  I might, at any rate, be excused for looking upon it with a good deal of suspicion.  But I endorse the principle embodied in the Bill.  The drafting, I think, could be improved, and it would be better, too, if the Bill were brought in under the auspices of the Government, after the consideration it will receive, in the first instance, because at present it contains some anomalies.  Sub-section (2) of Clause 3, for instance, empowers a local authority to go outside its district. That is introducing a new principle.  It might prove very far-reaching and it would require many safeguards.  There should, too, be provisions introduced which would afford a reasonable amount of protection for the people whose land is going to be taken and in connection with the proper carrying out of the aims of the Bill.  I do not suggest at all that the Bill does not purport to do that at present.  Although it emanates from the Labour benches there is nothing Bolshevist about the measure.  Some Deputies have said that the demand for allotments has seriously fallen away.  I think that is the case. <Col N="520" /> Where allotments would confer the greatest benefit, it is most difficult to provide them&mdash;that is, for the workers in the centre of the city.  You cannot get ground for allotments anywhere near the centre of the city.</P>

If the workers living in the centre of the city could be induced to go out into the country and do a certain amount of gardening on their own allotments, it would add a great pleasure to their lives.  But the difficulties are greater in their case than in the case of workers in urban or rural areas, where land is more easily got.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture and the Minister for Local Government have suggested that the promoter of this Bill should agree to their bringing in a Bill next session instead of it.  I rise merely to remove any misapprehension there might be so far as my attitude to the Bill is concerned.  So far as I am concerned, and so far as those whom I am supposed to represent are concerned, the principle of the Bill would be heartily welcome.</P>

      <P>I welcome that portion of the Bill which deals with genuine workers in the cities.  But the promoter of this Bill does not specify who is to get the plots.  Any resident of a city or urban area will be entitled to make a claim to a plot.  The reason, more or less, that I stand up to welcome this Bill is because it does away with the idea we heard so much about during the past five weeks&mdash;protecting the home market.  The home market will disappear altogether if this Bill is worked to its fullest extent.  Citizens of the towns will be able to supply their own requirements from their own plots.  They will be able to supply their own vegetables and their own milk and, when they get the half rood the Minister spoke of last week to grow their own wheat, there will be nothing left for the people of the country to supply at all.  For that reason I welcome the Bill. <Col N="521" /> I rise, also, to sympathise with Deputy Doctor Hennessy on his unfortunate experiences.  He is unfortunate in his cows, unfortunate in his butter and unfortunate in his friends.  I think he told us that the reason some of his friends went on public boards was to pass on a claim for a cottage on their lands to somebody else.  One must sympathise with a man of that upbringing, living in an atmosphere of that description. The Deputy also talked about the peculiar tubercular tendencies of dairy Shorthorns.  A short time ago he gave us a lecture on the gross impurity of Irish butter, in the condition it was put on the market and, at the same time, he spoke of the perfections of &ldquo;Glaxo.&rdquo;  I do not know if he is an agent for &ldquo;Glaxo&rdquo; or not.  I think he is very unfortunate in his experience of cows.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  Unless people want plots there is no use in providing them.  People whom I came in contact with in connection with these plots said it was scarcely worth while.  This new land is all right for a few years, but after a few years it has got to be manured.  The cost of getting manure and carting it to the plot makes the working of the plot hardly worth while.  There are a lot of aspects of this question that would require consideration.  There is no use in putting people on land and permitting them to crop it until it is worn out, when they will say it is no good. Land can be rendered almost sterile by that treatment.  The class of people who have availed of these plots, I think, are not people of the labouring type at all, but civil servants and people with very little to do in the city, who have an income, and who devote their spare time to the plots.  Is it to enable these people to spend their leisure time that the plots are to be <Col N="522" /> provided?  I do not know what the extent of the incomes of these people is, but are they the class of people for whom the State is called upon to provide plots?</P>

I would like the Minister to take particular care, in framing the Bill he has alluded to, that the land will not be used for a few years and then abandoned.  I do not approve of the compulsory portion of the Bill, which says that the local authority shall acquire land.  That wording might create a state of affairs that nobody wants to see.  I agree with the idea of the Bill, but, in its present form, I do not think I can support the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, and my only reason for standing up is to remove the idea from Deputies' minds that there is any reduction in the demand for allotments, so far as the city of Dublin workers are concerned. The fact that they want allotments is proof that they are workers.  The demand in Dublin is greater than ever.  Twelve months or two years ago there were 1,000 allotments in the city of Dublin, and since then, as a result of housing needs, the plot-holders gave up their allotments, and are still anxious to travel, even a distance, if they can get the one-eight of an acre.  They say that the one-eight of an acre will provide vegetables for the best part of a year for a family of five.  I have had experience of the successful working of the allotment system in Marino, Croydon Park, and in Drumcondra, and anybody who thinks there is no demand for plots, so far as Dublin is concerned, is making a mistake.  I say that the demand and the necessity are greater than ever now in view of the unemployment in the city of Dublin. I sincerely hope that the House, if not to-day, will on some future occasion <Col N="523" /> follow the good work started by the introduction of this Bill.  Within the past week I received letters from Limerick and Cork, conveying resolutions in support of the Bill.  I am aware that there has been an agitation recently in Limerick, where there was an attempt made to evict plot-holders, but they resisted, so far as lay in their power.  If this Bill were in operation I am satisfied that the eviction of plot-holders would not take place.  It is well to know that so far as the plot-holders in Dublin are concerned, they entered into agreements with the Municipal Council that, should the housing needs necessitate their removal from the land on a suitable housing area, they would be willing at any time to give up their plots, and they did so in more than one place.  I hope that Deputies will support the Bill, unless there is some understanding with the Government that they will introduce a measure, that they will not hang it up indefinitely, and that, whatever measure is introduced, will be brought in before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I also rise to support the Bill.  I remember a few years ago during the war, near the town that I come from, Fermoy, seeing a lot of labourers and artisans going every evening, and on every other occasion they could, to their plots, tilling their little gardens and cultivating varieties of vegetables for their homes.  I think it is very useful to have these plots, and, as Deputy Johnson pointed out when introducing this Bill, they cultivated ideas and habits very quickly about tilling.  They provide recreation for tradesmen and other classes in towns and cities.  No class should be exempted from these little plots.  I am sure that the House will have no hesitation, at least it should not, in passing this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The experience of this evening leads me to have some sympathy with Ministers when they are introducing measures upon finding that nobody appears to have read them.  I had hoped to save the time of the House by going rather sketchily <Col N="524" /> over the provisions of the Bill, but I think I made a mistake and should have exhausted two or three hours by going into every detail and dealing in advance with questions that might arise in the Deputies' minds.  That might have been more satisfactory to the prospects of the Bill.  There is no suggestion in this Bill of forcing men to till plots.  There is no intention of compelling the residents of any urban district, or any borough, or rural district to apply to local councils and for the local councils to throw on these people the duty and obligation of tilling plots.  It is a provision that where there is a demand, which is easily ascertainable from qualified persons, it shall be a duty on the local authority to find land for tillage as garden plots. Even then the conditions under which the plot-holders will hold plots are to be fixed by the council, and the fear that only the people with £1,000 a year and upwards may be provided with plots under this Bill, can be guarded against by the local outhority, subject to the sanction of the Ministry.  That is provided for in Section 8.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture and the Minister for Local Government seem to have regretted that we did not put Sections 18 and 19 where Section 3 is. I have no hesitation in saying that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture did not read this Bill half as carefully as he would have done if it had been presented by a departmental officer, for instance.  He would not have suggested that there is any difficulty about obtaining the lands required for these allotments at prices which would make them useful as allotments.  In the first instance, the assumption is that the council will obtain lands by purchase, or by agreement under lease, but if it cannot, if it has to use its compulsory powers, it has to go through the process which has been provided in respect of local authorities acquiring land for other purposes.  If it has been thought desirable that a local authority should have compulsory powers to acquire land for any reason, certain procedure has been devised, and prices are fixed in accordance with that procedure, and that is the proposal which we made in the Bill, that the provisions <Col N="525" /> in the Local Government Act, 1925, shall apply to lands purchased compulsorily for allotments, just as they apply to land purchased compulsorily for other purposes, and there need not be any fear that the property owners are not going to be duly considered.  This is a very conservative Bill, as everyone admitted, and Deputy Hewat might take heart, or, rather, he might not pat himself on the back for magnanimity if he knew that the British Bill, on somewhat similar lines, at present under discussion, was supported by Conservative members and all parties in the British House of Commons, so there is no particular magnanimity on Deputy Hewat's part in supporting this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to suggest that only civil servants and the better-off section of the community are the people engaged in plot-holding in Dublin, or around Dublin, or anywhere else.  Plots are held by a proportion of retired civil servants, ex-policemen, ex-soldiers, and the like, but in the main the one thousand plot-holders who are working these plots are workingmen, or are men looking for work.  In view of what has been said it is incumbent upon me to defend the plot-holders of Dublin from the suggestion that they have lost heart.  In 1923 there were two thousand plot-holders, and as far back as 1919 over three thousand.  Of course at that time any dustheap, or any impossible place, was planted, and it is perhaps hardly fair to take that particular year as the criterion.  Take 1922-'23, when there were about two thousand in and around Dublin; that number has since been reduced to one thousand.  The explanation I have heard is that six large areas which had been in the control of the Department since 1918 were handed back to their owners, thus dispossessing six hundred.  That is not the fault of the plot-holders.  The owners demanded back the land, which had been acquired under the powers of the Defence of the Realm Act, and the Department thought it was due to the owners that they should have their land back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1922, Marino, Clontarf, Faireld, Glasnevin, and Donnelly's Orhard in Clonliffe Road have been taken over for building.  One area, <Col N="526" /> Church Road, North Strand, was taken over as far back as 1919, and it still remains derelict, with no sign of anything having been done.  Two areas in Crumlin Road, Dolphin's Barn, were given back to the owner for building sites in 1922, one of them by the Department of Agriculture, and the other by the Dublin Corporation.  These fields are still idle, nothing having been done, and the plot-holders or the people who would have been plot-holders, are still looking for these lands and would be very glad to have them.  I was informed about one field that was let to plot-holders; it was taken from them and has since been under corn.  It was producing much more food as a garden, and the owner got the advantage of the tillage and manuring during the plot-holding period.  Speaking with responsibility and restraint, I have no hesitation in saying on the authority of a considerable number of people that if this Bill were to become law and put into operation by local councils that the one thousand plots held to-day would be multiplied by two next year. The Bill only imposes the obligation to provide plots where they are in demand, and if there are no plots looked for in any part of the country then there is no obligation.  The Minister for Agriculture pretends that there is a difficulty in defining what is suitable land for allotments.</P>

      <P>Well, there are six people required to make representations that there is a demand.  They may be the people who are demanding, or they may not.  They may be the interpreters of the local demand.  Then it is for the local authority to satisfy itself that there is a demand, just as it is the duty of the local authority to find that there is a demand for houses, sewage schemes, or anything else the locality requires.  It is at least capable of finding out whether there is a sufficient number of people to warrant them in taking an acre of land, and dividing it into thirty or forty plots.</P>

      <P>There is a big difference, that where the preliminary procedure <Col N="527" /> in any of those cases contemplates a demand being made to the local authority, there is a section that usually goes on to say the local authority &ldquo;may&rdquo; do this, that or the other thing.

We have not seen the Bill yet.  Now we have it on the authority of the two Ministers that it will not be a Bill to acquire land compulsorily for allotments when it does come.

However, the question of which Minister is going to be responsible for the administration of the allotments system is a very minor <Col N="530" /> one, and it is not a matter that should cause any contention.  I am afraid that the Minister has taken a line which means that there will not be any Bill this side of January next.  That is to say, there will not be any Act.  There may be a Bill introduced, but I am inclined to think, from the statements of the two Ministers, that while a Bill may be introduced, they are not ready to commit themselves to the acceptance of the principles contained in this Bill. I am rather sorry for that.  I hope that whatever happens to the Second Reading of this Bill something will be done, but I ask the Dáil to agree to the Second Reading.  It will at least test whether there is genuine approval of the principles contained in the Bill: that local authorities should be given compulsory powers to acquire land; that the plot-holders should have certain security of tenure; that the local authorities should enter into the allotments movement by associating the plot-holders with the administration; and that compensation should be provided if, in any case, a plot-holder is obliged to give up his plot during the growing period.  I thank Deputies for the general reception given to the Bill, and I hope that whatever happens as a result of the division, there will be some fruit gathered before the next plotting season comes round.</P>

    <P>This is following out a discussion in the Dáil a few days ago with regard to sending this Bill to a proposed Joint Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to suggest to the Minister on this motion that this special joint committee of the Dáil and Seanad should not sit until the autumn, and should not take any part of this Bill into consideration until then.  In the meantime the Minister could make some special inquiries in regard to that section of the Bill dealing with copyright, as far as the United States of America are concerned.  The position with regard to copyright, as it is covered by the Bill, <Col N="533" /> does not vary very greatly from the position at the moment.  The position now with regard to the United States, as the Minister is perfectly well aware, is a very unsatisfactory one.  Attempts by Great Britain to put it on a more satisfactory basis have not succeeded. The Minister might legitimately and fairly say that where Great Britain has failed it is hardly likely that the Irish Free State will succeed.  Nevertheless, I think it would be worth while to make the attempt.  The United States of America is the only country that is not a subscriber to the Convention. Anyone who has had any experience of copyright in America&mdash;and I have had as fairly extensive an experience as most people during the last fifteen or sixteen years, not only in my own particular case, but in the case of firms for which I have acted, and I know something in regard to questions of copyright&mdash;knows that although individual firms and publishers there, often and generally do act on the whole very fairly in regard to copyright, there are firms who make it their business to pirate editions.  There are, I know, Irish authors whose works have been pirated there.  It is a complaint of very old standing, and I would like that at least we should make an effort &mdash;I do not say that it will be successful&mdash;now that we are passing our own Copyright Bill, to see if something could not be done to put books published in the Free State on a fairer basis for the future.  That is why I suggest that consideration of the Bill in Committee might be postponed until the autumn and the interim might be spent by the Minister in instructing the Minister-Plenipotentiary of the Irish Free State at Washington to see if, in regard to books published in this country, parallel copyrights might not be obtained in the United States as is conferred at the moment, and would <Col N="534" /> be conferred under this Bill in every other country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been my own idea that the Committee should not sit until the autumn, other than for a formal sitting.  That is to say, I think that No. 2 motion ought to pass to-day; there would, I presume, then be an order made that a Message be sent to the Seanad acquainting them with what has happened and requesting their concurrence.  After that we should proceed to elect, by whatever method of selection would be adopted, the seven members to represent the Dáil.  They, I presume, would then meet the seven members of the Seanad and have one formal meeting at which they would set out the course of their proceedings in the autumn, not before the autumn session, and having got together for the first time they could then formulate certain questions which they thought would be worthy of investigation in the interim.</P>
      <P>The question of the American system of copyright was examined at great length before the present Bill was introduced, and my best advice on the matter was that the American people were so dissatisfied with their present copyright position that they had determined that they were going to fall into line with or become adherents of that of other countries.  Deputy Figgis is rather arguing the other way; he would rather have a certain amount of legalised pirating here because it exists in America.  That is not a thing to which we could accede.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a word in connection with this, merely as a promise, or a threat, for the Report Stage.  I want to have an amendment introduced.  In the definite statement that we have put down in Section 3, sub-section (1) there may be the following danger: You will remember that the Bill has two main purposes, one to enable the Commissioners to make leases, or to grant licences, and the other to allow the Commissioners to make bye-laws for the proper management of the Park&mdash; for the preservation of order.  The intention in sub-section (1) is that places like the Chief Secretary's Lodge, the Under-Secretary's Lodge, and these enclosed spaces, would remain as they <Col N="538" /> were.  Again and again, certainly this year, and last year more definitely, the question of the disposal of these lodges came up, and I fear that in the Bill as it stands it might not be possible to lease, say, to a private individual these houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I will explain it in a moment.  It is quite true that under Section 4 we have power to make leases, but all these leases are revokable.  What I would propose on the Report Stage to do would be to introduce an amendment to the effect that any powers that the Minister has under the State Lands Act would not be impaired by the Bill, so that if he thinks fit the Commissioners might make a lease, say, of the Under-Secretary's Lodge to a private individual, that lease, of course, being put on the Table of the Oireachtas. That is simply the intention I have, and I think it well to give the House warning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will consider the desirability of being a little specific regarding any amendment he proposes to make.  If he is thinking of the lodges I think it would be easy, and quite in conformity with usage, to specify these places. We know how easy it is, even under the provisions of the State Lands Act, to specify in a report laid upon the Table that certain contracts be made, but nobody notices them because the procedure is a very formal one, and it takes a lynx eye to detect anything that might happen.  I think we ought to avoid the possibility that some future Minister, for instance, some Deputy from the Farmers' Benches or these Benches, or the Independent Benches who happened to be in the place of the Parliamentary Secretary, might want to dispose, or try to dispose, of certain sections of the Park, and get it through the Dáil under the provisions of the State Lands Act.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should specify the two or three places that he has in mind which he may want <Col N="539" /> to except from the provisions of this sub-section.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 2, line 46, after the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My brain is still rather reeling with trying to understand how the first amendment can be consequential to nothing antecedent.  I observed that on the Second Reading the discussion mainly concerned itself with the closing temporarily of certain parts of the Park and the charging for admission.  That is covered by the sub-section, but very much more is covered.  This sub-section gives the Commissioners of Public Works, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, power to close part of the Park permanently, as I read it.  It must be read with regard to sub-section (3):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every licence heretofore granted by the Commissioners for the exclusive occupation of any portion of the Park and in force at the passing of this Act, shall continue in force.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a licence for exclusive occupation in the way of a licence to build the Chief Secretary's Lodge, the Under-Secretary's Lodge, and so on.  I think this sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Commissioners may, subject to the consent of the Minister, grant to any person a licence authorising such person to fence-off and have the exclusive occupation of any portion <Col N="541" /> of the Park for any particular purpose, and to exclude the public from the portion of the Park to which such licence relates, and to admit the public to such portion&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is to say &ldquo;to admit the public on payment of such fee,&rdquo; but they might charge a prohibitive fee.  I think this sub-section, read into this whole section, might give power to build more lodges in the Park.  I am not in the least frightened of that nor that the Commissioners of Public Works will make improper use of the powers granted in the section to give licences to build houses in the Park to any private individual.  What I am frightened about is the pressure of other Government Departments.  The Ministry of Local Government may have a scheme for housing in Cabra and may come to the conclusion that their scheme may be more complete and effectual if they could take a small portion of the Park. They might say: &ldquo;There is a portion of the Park; no one uses it; it is of little value and it would be of great value to our scheme.&rdquo;  If the Hibernian School is again occupied by the troops, the Minister for Defence may decide to have a miniature rifle range and warn people off for that purpose. Gradually Department after Department would encroach on the space in the Park and the area available for the public would become smaller and smaller.  I suggest that if anyone, whether a private individual or a Government Department, wishes to obtain the exclusive occupation of any portion of the Park for any serious length of time, that matter should be submitted to the judgment of the Oireachtas, preferably I think by Resolution.  I do not think you should put a Bill through all its Stages in both Houses.  A Resolution of each House ought to be sufficient.  That was my intention in drafting this amendment.</P>
    <P>I say the parallel to the State Lands Act which Deputy Johnson made is not sufficient.  The procedure adopted by the State Lands Act, which is more or less the procedure adopted in Amendment No. 3, is inadequate.  The bulk of the lands covered by the State Lands <Col N="542" /> Act were lands which would normally be let, coastguards' cottages and things of that kind, which it was right and proper to let.  The normal procedure with regard to the Phoenix Park is not that it should be let or leased or given for exclusive occupation.  That should be abnormal procedure requiring the consent of the Oireachtas.  I do not know if the form of words I propose entirely covers the situation.  If the Minister tells me that, on Report, he will insert some proviso preventing the granting or exclusive occupation of the Phoenix Park for any longer period than, say, two or three years, such a period as would make it impossible for people to build, then I shall be quite satisfied to withdraw my amendment, but I think there is a certain danger under the Bill, as drafted, and that danger ought to be met.</P>

      <P>Take the example Deputy Bryan Cooper mentioned, that is the building of cottages under the pressure, say, of the Ministry of Local Government.  I do not think that can happen under the general terms of this Bill.  They are too narrow; I do not think we have any power to do that.  It would be actually ruled out, I think, by Section 3, sub-section (1).  So far as the meaning of the amendment is concerned, it would mean that we should have to proceed by legislation, and so far as the other point is concerned, namely, that we should proceed by resolution, that applies not merely to building, but also, for instance, to letting, say, for athletic purposes.  This is a remark that applies, not merely to this amendment, but to some others.  I doubt if it is proper in that particular instance, or in cases like that, that the House should solemnly pass a resolution and have it adopted on those particular lines.  It is largely a matter rather of administration than of legislation. Also, so far as building is concerned, and a lease for building, I doubt if under the Bill we can give any satisfactory lease.  Any lease we would give under this particular Bill is revocable at the will of the Minister. Though it does not quite fit in with <Col N="543" /> all that Deputy Cooper requires, I should be quite willing that any leases or lettings should follow the procedure of the State Lands Act.  For the moment that would seem reasonable enough to cover the particular cases. I see the force of the argument that the Phoenix Park is in a different position from Glen Imaal or the Collins Barracks or any property in the possession of the State down the country. It is not in a position to be let. Undoubtedly in the case of the Phoenix Park, letting would not be normal; it would be abnormal.  What I feel is, if we bind the Commissioners too much to too many different ways of procedure for different instances, it would be possible for the Commissioners and the Minister to do what there is a general feeling ought to be done, for instance, in connection with the various grantings of athletic grounds for which the Phoenix Park would be a suitable place.</P>

If the Minister would frame &mdash;I appreciate that he has the advantage of having a draftsman&mdash;some form of words that would deal with this matter, I have no desire to hamper him unduly with regard to the letting of the Park, and, with the permission of the Dáil, I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (1), page 3, the words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided that no licence issued under this section shall empower the holder of the licence to erect any fence or structure so as to preclude the public from viewing any games, entertainment or exhibition unless <Col N="544" /> the draft of such licence shall have been laid before each House of the Oireachtas for ten days on which the House has sat after such draft was laid before it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fear I have is not so much the letting of buildings, though that is one that ought to be taken into account, as that pressure will be applied to allow certain portions of the Park to be enclosed for special purposes as against the recreation and enjoyment of the public.  There is a growing propaganda in favour of the development of Ireland as a tourist resort, and there will be a growing propaganda in favour of utilising portions of the Park for special purposes, such as sport and recreation. If there is liberty given to Ministers to allow enclosures to be made by the fencing off of portions of the Park, they may some day be tempted and may fall to the temptation.  I want to guard against that, if possible, and to provide that no licence will empower the erection of a fence without the definite sanction of the Oireachtas.  I mean a fence that would preclude the public from viewing any game or entertainment. So far, all games, such as polo, football, cricket, etc., that are played in the Park, are played on specified grounds, and they are open to the public.  I want that system to continue. I am not averse to setting apart portion of the Park for special purposes, or even erecting pavilions for athletic grounds, such as those for cricket and polo; but I want to preclude the possibility of any of those grounds being enclosed with a fence or barricade of any kind that would prevent a public view. Even to allow that for a short period, I think the specific saction of each House of the Oireachtas should be obtained. I believe the Parliamentary Secretary is clearly of the same view. I think he will agree there is no prohibition in the Bill, as it stands, against that possibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the general paling off for a lengthy period of any portion of the Park is concerned, I do not think I would have any difficulty in accepting that part of Deputy Johnson's amendment.  I would like to point out, however, a <Col N="545" /> matter that we discussed on Second Reading.  It may be necessary to carry out an entertainment of a certain type for a very limited period, say, three days.  It may be necessary to charge a fee and raise money in that respect.  In that way, if a licence is necessary for a limited period of time&mdash;three days, the same period as we have in the other amendment&mdash;permission could be given to the Commissioners to authorise, if they thought fit, the erection of a barricade that would obstruct the view.  I think that would be only reasonable. So far as interference with the public view in the ordinary way is concerned, I fully agree with what Deputy Johnson has urged, and I would be willing to see if some steps could be taken to carry out the view expressed in his amendment.  So far as any period extending over three days is concerned, I am quite ready to fall in with Deputy Johnson's view.  I would ask the Deputy to consider the point further, seeing that we do take power to grant licences to people to charge fees in order to be able to carry on particular work.  I think it is only reasonable that the Commissioners should have power to grant a really effective licence for the holding of a particular entertainment over a limited period.  So far as all other sports are concerned, I quite agree that there should be no obstruction of the public view.</P>

      <P>From the Parliamentary Secretary's point of view, I am afraid there is the possibility that there could be a licence covering three days a week for a period of ten weeks in the summer season.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no.  I can make provision that such a thing shall not occur and that the licence shall only cover a certain length of time, once or twice a year.  There is no intention to have three days added on to three days, so bringing about a permanent interference with the rights of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather anxious to make it possible for any place to be fenced-off and a charge made upon the public only in very exceptional circumstances, circumstances which would <Col N="546" /> secure the approval of each House.  A general national purpose might be better fulfilled by allowing such a procedure to take place.  Only in such a case would I allow any such thing.  I want to make it difficult, therefore, and I want to make it possible to grant a licence only when the project would be such as would have the support of the Oireachtas.  Unless there is some provision of the kind I have suggested, the temptation will be great and the pressure from all kinds of parties who want to raise funds for charitable purposes will also be great.  I have not the slightest doubt that the pressure would be very hard to withstand unless there is a legal stop to which the Minister can refer, saying: &ldquo;I would be very glad to do it myself, but the law prevents me.&rdquo;  The Minister should favourably consider a provision of this kind which would prevent the fencing-off of any portion of the Park except on very special occasions which would command the general assent that would be shown by the approval of both Houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a possibility that the Oireachtas might not be in session when the suggestion might come forward for fencing-in portion of the Park in the manner indicated.  We might not be able to fit in or apply this particular provision which is similar to the State Lands Act provision.  Therefore this would be an exception.  That is the reason I suggest we should be given power to permit this once in the twelve months at the very most.  We could limit ourselves in that way even in the Bill.  I quite agree that it is not a power that should be often used or that it is not a power that we should have power, so to speak, often to use.  I quite fall in with the Deputy's views in that respect.  They are my own views and I would be quite willing to consider whether a limitation of that kind could not be put into the Bill.  An exceptional occasion may however, arise where a decision may be necessary, a decision on comparatively short notice when both Houses of the Oireachtas would not be sitting.  I suggest in view of that that the Deputy might withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, before sub-section (3), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Commissioners shall not by any licence granted under this section in respect of any period exceeding three days authorise fees to be charged for admission to any part of the Park unless either&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the grant of such licence has been approved by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas; or</P>
      <P>(b)  the draft of such licence has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and neither House has, within the next ten days on which the House has sat after such draft was laid before it, passed a resolution disapproving of the grant of the licence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This lays down a provision in regard to a letting for a period of three days. If the period is more than three days the licence must be approved by a resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment I put forward was on the same terms, minus paragraph (b), and it might be well to discuss both together.  Paragraph (b) is subject to the criticism which I have already expressed, that the licence referred to may be laid on the Table, and simply by carelessness or laxity of interest or apathy, leave the power in the hands of the Commissioners. I think that it should be by positive approval.  I think we ought not to use this form of laying papers on the Table more than is absolutely requisite for the conduct of the business. I think everybody will agree that unless we have a very much more alert House and a very much better organised information department, the procedure of allowing a draft of the licence to lie on the Table, and in the absence of any positive action on the part of either <Col N="548" /> House it shall become operative is too risky.  I think that that is risky because of the absence of this alert public opinion within this Dáil, and I would ask the Minister to agree that it requires positive assent, rather than absence of opposition before the licence should be issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point in regard to this amendment which Deputy Johnson has not touched upon.  That is that there is no provision as regards laying the licence on the Table in this amendment for any statement as to fees to be charged.  I think if it is necessary to move a resolution we should find out&mdash;when the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary issues a licence, I presume they would make some stipulation as to the fees to be charged&mdash;what stipulation has been made.  That is a matter over which we should have some control.  If the Park is to be national property and not the property of the city, then the Oireachtas is the body that ought to have control as to the manner in which it is to be let.  If the fees to be charged are considered exorbitant, by any section of citizens, the representatives of that section should have an opportunity of making and presenting their case. The point as to the Oireachtas not sitting is, at first sight, one of considerable weight, as is any point that comes from the Parliamentary Secretary, but in cases of this kind where sports meetings are organised, we must remember that they are organised a considerable time in advance.  Anybody wishing to organise an athletic meeting or sports meeting, motor races or anything of that kind, starts organising these fixtures six months beforehand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do feel very keenly that we must control this question of letting public property in the Park and that it is not enough to leave the whole discretion to the Minister for Finance and the Board of Works.  In that case our only opportunity of challenging a letting would be either by resolution, which it might not be possible to bring on in private Deputies' time, or on the Estimates. It might well happen that very nearly a year would elapse and the whole thing would be dead and gone <Col N="549" /> before the Estimates of the Minister for Finance came up for discussion.  I suggest that when it is intended to let the property of the State and the property of the citizens and to charge fees for admission to it, that the definite consent should be sought of each House before such an action is taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the licence is concerned, when it is put on the Table of the House, the draft licence will show the fees to be charged.  On the other point, whether it is to be a positive act on the part of the House, from the point of view of the ordinary conduct of the House, I doubt if it is desirable that a matter of this kind should be brought on for special sanction.  Any proposed letting of the Park could scarcely slip through.  When any Deputies from the City of Dublin intend to object to the issuing of such licences, it would be possible for them to challenge them. It seems to me, as far as that is concerned, that the proceedings of the State Lands Act is more compatible with the dignity of the House in regard to a proposal of this kind, than that we should enter into what would practically amount to a curtailed system of legislation for each particular act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather object to giving the Board of Works a free hand in this matter.  I think the basic principle in connection with the Park is that it does not lend itself to this fencing in and excluding the public from any particular part of it.  The question of erecting a barrier which would be effective would be a very expensive proposition.  It would need to be a very special form of entertainment, and I do not know that the cost could be covered by the receipts at a meeting lasting for three or four days. I think that we could not depart from the general principle, that the Park in all its area is open to the public without running the risk of allowing things to creep in to the conditions of letting, that would afterwards be found objectionable.  I am merely speaking of cases that would justify the payment of a sum that would really and <Col N="550" /> effectively shut out the public.  I think that the Board of Works ought to press for such powers in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with the view expressed by the Parliamentary Secretary, that special sanction to deal in a matter of this kind is more in the region of legislation than in the function of the legislature.  But in the resolution, paragraph (a) specifies for the approval by resolution of each House as one alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>So, if there is any meaning intended there, the Parliamentary Secretary's criticism of the amendment put forward in my name does not follow.  It is part of his own proposition, and it is only made because we are departing from what is the general view expressed by Deputy Hewat just now, that there should be no departure made from freedom in this matter; that there should be no fencing-off and a charge for admission. There has been the acceptance of the proposition that there may be occasions when such power should be in the hands of the Ministry without special enactment, but we are very anxious, every one of us, that those occasions should be few, and that they should not be used freely.  We want to put on some kind of a curb, and we really want to give power to the Minister to be able to stand up to the demands from sections of the public. The latter proposition, that is, the proposition contained in paragraph (b) strikes me in this way: The proposal is made, say, to hold a garden party, a motor race, or an aeroplane parade in October.  A licence is arranged and prepared and laid on the Table of the House in July, but it does not become operative until ten days have elapsed during which the House shall have been sitting.  True, but when the public is interested in the matter in July, it has concurred more or less that such a thing should take place.  By the time the House begins to sit, a paper is simply put on a file in the Reading Room for Deputies?  Unless it is someone's <Col N="551" /> duty specially to watch these files, the licence is passed, no action is taken, and the matter becomes a mere formality at the Minister's discretion. While I disagree with the general proposition that the House is to be responsible for administration, I think there are circumstances, and this is one of them, when there should be specific resolutions in the matter of a departure from the general will of the House in regard to the letting of the Phoenix Park for fees or the closing of it. When there is a departure from that general will on special occasions, it should be, I think, by the specific resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I feel that the formal method of laying these licences on the Table of the House, while it would be satisfactory, if the Dáil had been an institution with a couple of generations of life behind it, and was active in all its critical aspects, it might be quite satisfactory, but our experience is that it is not satisfactory in that particular aspect, and therefore I think there should be positive action on the part of each House of the Oireachtas before a licence of that kind becomes effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be admitted that it is only on the very rarest occasions that the Board of Works or the Minister would consider the question of letting the Park for a particular purpose.  During our time it was only so let on probably one occasion.  This is a very big proposition, the letting of the Park or the closing of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Or any portion of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, any portion of it.  Remembering that that power has been used so sparingly in the past, it will certainly not be used more generously by reason of the provision that is contained here.  The very expenses referred to by Deputy Hewat, which appeared to him to work in one direction, should actually work in the other direction.  The cost of putting up such fences would have to be borne almost entirely, if not entirely, by the persons getting the use of the Park, and that <Col N="552" /> particular cost would be prohibitive. It is only where you want an immense space that would not be available in any other ground that the Park would be used.  The bringing in of the Oireachtas to pass the necessary resolutions for a matter of this kind, does not, in my opinion, add to the dignity of either House.  With regard to the laying of papers on the Table of the House, has anything occurred since that particular practice was introduced to warrant any suspicion with regard to getting things through without notice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the President to bear in mind that we are not legislating for this year or for next year or for the next five years.  We are legislating for perpetuity, and for a time when a different atmosphere may prevail here, and when there may be a Government in power with entirely different feelings in regard to these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not subscribe to that at all, not in the least bit.  As long as I have known the City of Dublin&mdash;as Deputy Figgis would say, I think I have some right to speak on a matter of this sort, having been born in Dublin&mdash;I have observed that a most jealous care has been shown by the citizens in regard to the Phoenix Park, and an objection to any interference with its use.  That was only as regards one section of the country, and it was because of its nearness to the city that the citizens were interested.  Now, it is the property of the nation.  Not alone Deputies, but people from all parts of the country would have an interest in seeing that this place was still kept open.  I think it most unlikely that there would be any abuse whatever of the power that is sought in this measure.  I think the case made by Deputy Hewat, that a special resolution should be passed by reason of the cost of the fences, is really a safeguard in the other direction.  It could not be a small institution that would ask for the use of the Park.  The trouble and the cost entailed, the cost of advertising and so on, would make it a proposition upon which public opinion could easily be consulted outside the passage of a resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="553" /> With regard to Deputy Johnson's point that we do not know what sort of a House we may have years hence, in answer to that I might say that you might have a puritanical Seanad which would object to any sort of sport.  It might object to the utilisation of an institution like the Phoenix Park for any purpose other than a public purpose, while Deputies here might be unanimously in favour of giving its use for the purpose asked for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  I intended my argument to be used in this way, that if there were people willing to come forward and spend so much money on fencing-off the Park, that the object of their doing so would be very important and would be worthy of the consideration of the House.</P>

      <P>In discussing this amendment, Deputy Hewat, I think, was getting back to the idea contained in an amendment dealt with earlier.  I might point out to him that I doubt if this Bill is extending our powers very much.  I think it is limiting our powers rather than extending them.  Under the existing law, we could do the very thing which Deputy Hewat objects to.  If we were simply to drop this Bill we have the powers that Deputy Hewat objects to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We have legal power to do it.  I am really trying to carry out, as far as reasonably possible, the provisions of Sub-section (1) of Section 3, so far as this question of letting is concerned.  Under this Bill we are claiming powers that we have over the Park under the State Lands Act.  In reality we are to a large extent limiting our particular powers. After all if there is something in what Deputy Johnson says about Deputies not watching papers laid upon the Table of the House it would be a stimulus and an education to them in their public duty to see that they do watch papers laid in the House so far as the City of Dublin is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point Deputy Johnson made that appealed to me very <Col N="554" /> strongly.  I recognise that his particular form of the amendment is a protection that the Minister in charge, or the Secretary in charge, would desire to have as such.  At least it would undoubtedly be an excellent argument when people came to him to be able to say that we had no power to do this.  It is the easier way.  Protection on that point is more easy to give by reason of the fact that this matter may be challenged in the House, and held up.  I think, on the whole, that is a reasonable precaution enough.  I think the responsibility should not be taken off the administrative side of the general government of this country and put on to what I may call the legislative side.  So far as I am concerned, it will require a great deal of argument to make me consent to any interference with the rights of the Park.  It would undoubtedly have to be a very big occasion that would allow of such a thing even being considered, to say nothing about its being granted.  I think, on the whole, the idea proposed in Deputy Johnson's amendment would meet the general requirements of the case.  Perhaps it might be better in all these matters to have one uniform method of procedure, and that might be preferable to adopting the Deputy's amendment.  If agreeable to the House, I would make arrangements so that the provision in the State Lands Act should be applied and that we might have one uniform method of procedure.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill, the title of which is &ldquo;An Act to extend the limit of time imposed by the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, 1924, on the giving of guarantees and the making of loans under that Act.&rdquo;  The Bill speaks for itself.  It is simply giving a further year to the Trades Loan (Guarantee) Amendment Bill, 1925, and certain consequential amendments with regard to the period continuing the three-monthly period in which statements have to be laid before the House, and a consequential amendment with regard to the title.</P>

      <P>Is there any information to be given to the House in addition to that given, I think by the financial resolution, in regard to the utilisation that is to be made of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act up to date?  There was certain information given regarding the amount of money called for and the amount guaranteed up to two or three weeks ago.  I would like to know what is the position today? Has it changed to any degree since that time?</P>

      <P>As far as I remember, I made a rough calculation for the Deputy who asked a question some time ago as to the applications recommended for guarantee by the Advisory Committee.  The total money involved in the applications recommended came to about £300,000.  But the position has changed as regards the money value since.  I am taking it still on the same basis of applications recommended by the Advisory Committee, because the position changes from day to day as between applications passed by my Department or the Department <Col N="556" /> of Finance, and applications where the guarantee has in fact been given, and where the money has, in fact, been given by the Bank.  The position, as to applications recommended for guarantee under Part 1 is that they amount to £484,000, and under Part 2 the sum is, as I think it was on the day the Deputy asked, £5,500.  The total money involved is £489,600.  Of course there will be the usual quarterly statement made as soon as possible, following the 31st July, which will bring these figures up to date then, but that is the position actually at the moment.  The money involved is about £490,000.</P>

      <P>I think before we renew this Act we might have a little more information as to its working and as to the applications received.  For instance, we were told that in this Act the Government were giving effect to its pledge to put down profiteering. To what extent has that been effective?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told, on the discussion on Section 2, that loans would be granted to associations of consumers and producers, and that it was intended for this purpose, so that they might market their goods more effectively and cheaply.  I should like to know how that section, as regards loans to associations of consumers and producers, has worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How many associations of consumers or producers, as distinct from ordinary commercial firms, have applied for guarantees and how many have received guarantees?  There is another point that I want to make as regards the working of the Act.  It was, I think, felt by everybody, when <Col N="557" /> the principal Act was under discussion, that in its working this Act should be divorced altogether from politics.  The Minister placed himself in the hands of an Advisory Committee&mdash;an admirable Advisory Committee. I think he got the best Advisory Committee he possibly could get.  But then we have Ministers going to their constituents and practically promising them money from public funds.  A couple of nights ago the Minister for External Affairs escaped from the arduous labours of his Department and went down to Clondalkin, where he told his constituents that the Government were going to put up one quarter the cost of setting the factory going again.  The report of the Minister's speech was, no doubt, very much condensed in the newspapers and he may have qualified his statement in some way.  But the speech read as if that money was being given under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  Is that the case or is a special grant being given by the Government towards relief of distress? If that is so, it would be a proper thing to do, but it is undesirable, I think, that Ministers should go to individual sections of their constituents and say: &ldquo;We will provide this money for you&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the President's pledge, to which Deputy Cooper referred, I have the Official Report here.  I thought this matter would be referred to.  Deputy Cooper, on the Second Stage of the Bill, on the 25th June, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It is more than an ordinary Government Bill, brought in in the ordinary course of Government business.  It is a Bill to fulfil a pledge, and a very long-delayed pledge, made by the President.</P>
      <P>The Deputy then goes on to give certain details with regard to the time and place where this pledge was, as alleged, given.  He proceeds:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Last week the President informed us that this was a Bill that was intended to fulfil this pledge.  Does the President dispute the reference?</P>
      <P>The PRESIDENT: Oh, no!  I said the answer was very safe.</P>
      <P>That is all that is said there about the pledge or the fulfilment of it.  I do not think that either at a public meeting, or in the House here, the President made the statement that this was the Government's Anti-Profiteering Bill. I certainly was never guilty of any such suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the pledge is still unfulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I shall have to read further from the Official Report. On that occasion the Deputy pressed the matter further.  He asked had the pledge been fulfilled, or whether they were to take it that the pledge, then, was still unfulfilled.  He said that they appeared to have got no distance at all; that the Government had not been able to achieve the object which the President, the head of the State, then <Col N="559" /> put forward as an argument in an election.  The Report then proceeds:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The PRESIDENT: No.</P>
      <P>Major COOPER: And on which he secured the return of his candidate.</P>
      <P>The PRESIDENT: It was given as an answer to a question.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson then intervened and Deputy Cooper summed up with the remark: &ldquo;We will leave it there.&rdquo; There was nothing very conclusive or decisive about the pledge&mdash;whether it was in fact given, whether there was any fulfilment of it or whether it continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>We left it there and it is still there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be still there, so far as the putting down of profiteering by this Bill is concerned. If we are to go into that question, it will occupy much more time than I intended this Bill should occupy.  I should have to require&mdash;as I think I shall have to require in future, when anybody stands up to talk about profiteering&mdash;a definition of &ldquo;profiteering.&rdquo; What is profiteering?  Is the word used in the sense in which the word was made popular by &ldquo;The New Statesman,&rdquo; or by &ldquo;The New Age&rdquo; in the days before the war&mdash;goods produced for profit?  Or does it mean some type of extravagant or extraordinary profit?  Who is to draw the line between what, I am sure, Deputy Cooper would call, on the one hand, &ldquo;ordinary profit&rdquo; and what, on the other hand, he would describe as &ldquo;extraordinary profit&rdquo;?  When you say that there is no anti-profiteering Bill, I can argue that there cannot be any anti-profiteering Bill until we all go over under Deputy Johnson's leadership.  I do not know that Deputy Cooper would regard that as an end to be desired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the Advisory Committees has been raised, and from the way Deputy Cooper introduced his remarks, he went further, I think, than he intended.  He said I had set up very good Advisory <Col N="560" /> Committees under this Act, and he asked whether Ministers or Deputies interfered with those Advisory Committees by going to their constituents and promising certain things.  The report of a speech made by the Minister for External Affairs, has been mentioned. What did the Minister for External Affairs actually say?  As I was not present, I cannot say, but I know what he went there prepared to say.  He went prepared to make the very ordinary and simple statement that the Clondalkin Paper Mills had made application for a guarantee, and that that guarantee had, in fact, been passed by the Advisory Committee. Those are the simple facts.  There is nothing to be added to them.  I do not see that it is going out of the way for either a Minister or a Deputy to address his constituents and to give them certain information which any Deputy here could have got by way of question.</P>
      <P>There have been, under Section 2 of the Act, 30 applications, of which three only have been recommended.  These three are co-operative societies.  I do not know whether that is what the Deputy means by speaking of associations which are &ldquo;not of the ordinary commercial type of association.&rdquo;  Three co-operative societies have had their applications for loans recommended. Ten applications have been rejected.  A certain number of others have been examined by the Committee, but no decision has yet been come to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give us further details?  Will the loans tend to make the goods of these co-operative societies cheaper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The applicant companies who have received recommendations from the Committee are: the Waterford Co-operative Society, the Kildare Co-operative Society, and the Collooney Co-operative Agricultural and Dairy Society.  These are the only three.  There have been only 30 applications under Section 2 of the Act.  Under Section 1, there have been about 265 applications.  All told, there have been about 300 applications.  Of these, there have been recommended by the Advisory Committee, to date, about <Col N="561" /> 21.  There have been definitely and finally rejected about 31.  About 52 have been examined by the Committee, which has not yet come to a decision upon them.  That does not exhaust the list.  The mere addition of these last three sets of figures will not amount to 300.  The explanation is quite simple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very big number of claims came before the Committee, which were found on a first glance, to be outside the terms of the Act and to be simply a matter for rejection.  There was, apparently, a certain amount of misunderstanding as to the purpose of this Act. One of the first letters received in my Department was from a gentleman who said that he had observed from the newspapers that loans were about to be granted by the Government, and that he wanted one.  Another gentleman framed his application in an alternative way.  He said he would not mind whether it was a loan or a Government job he got.  But he wanted either.  There have been quite a number of applications which were outside the scope of the Act.  Of the Advisory Committee, what Deputy Cooper has said casually, should be supplemented by me.  I got five men who were sufficiently unselfish to give a considerable amount of their time, and to take themselves away from their own business, to give care and attention to the applications received under this Act.  The three who formed the Committee for the purposes of Part 1 of the Act, have been much more called upon than the full Committee for the purposes of Part 2.  From these three, if I might single them out, for that reason, we have got the most constant attendance and the most careful consideration for all the applications that came up.  The amount of service that has been rendered by these three gentlemen, in an honorary way, to the State, has been more than any tribute I could pay them here, would do justice to.  I have been fortunate in securing <Col N="562" /> that two, at least, of them will remain on if the Act is to be extended for a further period.  The third I omit, because I have not yet been in a position to approach him, and see if he will continue to act.  I have great hopes that he will also continue to serve.  Deputy Bryan Cooper raised one question, and I had rather hoped I might get him to speak again on the point when I had emphasised, in reading, the longer title of the Bill&mdash;&ldquo;An Act to extend the limit of time imposed.&rdquo;  I fear, however, that the amendment that he projected will hardly find a place in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to suggest that that was not a matter for me to rule on.  It was a matter for the Ceann Comhairle to rule later, if the Deputy proceeded with his amendment. I have given certain figures as to the amount of money guaranteed.  These things will be more clearly set out in the quarterly statement to be issued after the 31st July.  These statements have not contained very much information so far.  The position was clear to Deputies.  They will remember that there was a certain hindrance to the free operation of this Act in its early stages, and, consequently, it was not possible to have applications dealt with, and to have recommendations put through with the speed that was desirable. However, that difficulty has been got over, and the final statement will show the position for the yearly period of this first Act.  From that on, I hope the quarterly statement will give much more information than the quarterly statement issued heretofore gave.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be read a second time&rdquo;&mdash;put, and agreed to.</P>

    <P>I would propose, with the leave of the House, to amend this motion very slightly in a direction favourable to Deputy O'Connell.  I would make it read, &ldquo;Payment of increases as from 1st April, 1925.&rdquo;  There is one reason why we do not wish this increase to be retrospective to any considerable extent, and that is that considerable complications might arise in the case of people who had died, and the personal representatives of whom would have a title to these arrears of pensions, and would have to be sought out.  There is the further point that it is unusual to make these increases retrospective unless they are in fulfilment of a pledge given some considerable time back.  There is no pledge in this case except a pledge that was given one or two months ago.  If we were to make the date 1st April, 1925, we give these people increases from about the date they would have got them if we had adopted Deputy O'Connell's Bill when it came in and allowed the necessary money resolution to pass.  The amount of money involved in this particular Bill is not very large, and, of course, it is not a charge that will continue for any great length of time.  I would make the resolution read: &ldquo;That it is expedient to make provision for the increase of certain pensions, and to authorise the payment of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of increases as from the 1st day of April, 1925, under any Act of the present Session to extend the residence qualifications for the receipt of an increase of pension under Section 6 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the first thing the House will notice about this financial motion is that the wording is rather unusual.  It would look as if this particular phrasing were introduced in order to bowl out my amendment, as will happen undoubtedly if the Minister's resolution is passed, for it will not then be in order.  My reason for putting down this amendment is that a pledge was given by the late General Collins to these pensioners early in 1922.  It took us more than a year, something like 15 months, to get that pledge implemented, and that was done under Section 6 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923.  In order to carry out the pledge, as the Minister has stated, a special sub-section was put in, which stated that any increases of pension to which a pensioner becomes entitled by virtue of this section shall take effect and be payable as from the 1st April, 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was passed in August, 1923.  The sub-section was put in to give effect to a pledge of the late General Collins, and there was also put in this section which we are now repealing by this particular Act.  At that time it was not thought that this section would bar out any pensioner in Ireland.  This point was raised before.  I raised it when the other Bill introduced by me, was under discussion.  I explained this point fully.  It was the opinion of the late Attorney-General that the Interpretation Act did not bar out those who lived in the Six-County area.  I have that expression of opinion in writing, that the Minister for Finance without this Bill, could pay these teachers. Now, we come along to remove this barrier to enable the Minister for Finance to pay.  I hold, and have always held, that you were only carrying out the pledge of the late General Collins who, when he gave his pledge, did not intend that these increases should be confined to the Twenty-Six Counties.  I am quite certain of that.  It was not in his mind that it should be confined to the Twenty-Six counties.  Now, we come along and the Minister for Finance says that the only ground which would <Col N="565" /> justify him in saying that the retrospective payment holds in this case, is that this is the fulfilment of a pledge.  It is sixteen or eighteen months ago since the matter was taken up with the Attorney-General, and it has taken that length to get this sub-section knocked out of Section 6 of this Act.  There is no reason why these few people should suffer because this did creep in for some reason or another at that time.  I do not believe that there would be any such difficulty as that about which the Minister speaks.  The Minister ruled that there were some who would be affected by sub-section (3) of Section 6 if the payment were made retrospective. But those who are living, I maintain, are entitled to the strict fulfilment of the pledge given by Michael Collins, and should get paid from April, 1922. I am sure the last thing General Collins would have had in his mind would be to confine this little increase to those who live in the Twenty-Six counties. I would suggest to the Minister, who has met me very fairly in this matter, to give way on this point and to make it retrospective.</P>

      <P>I move that the Sugar Beet (Subsidy) Bill, 1925, be read a Second Time.  The question of the encouragement of the initiation of a beet sugar industry in this country has been under consideration and under discussion for a very long period.  The present Government have been examining the matter for a considerable time, and have given as much care to its consideration as, I think, any matter with which we have dealt.  That degree of consideration is necessary by reason of the fact that it became apparent to us that the starting of the beet sugar industry would be very costly.  Whatever we do now is, in a sense, experimental. It may possibly turn out that the beet sugar industry here, through climatic or other reasons, might scarcely ever take root in such a way as to carry on without a substantial subsidy. On the other hand, the indications we have are that this country is suitable for the cultivation of beet crops, and that a high sugar content can be obtained, but no firm will undertake the starting of a factory here, and the outlay and risk involved, without very substantial Government assistance. In Great Britain, very considerable assistance, assistance approximating to the amount of assistance which we will have to give, has been given.  In countries where the sugar beet industry has been established, it is, in a sense, one of the actual props of their whole agricultural system.  Benefits will accrue to this country from the establishment of the industry on a healthy <Col N="567" /> basis, and these benefits will be very great indeed.  It will put many thousands of acres of land under cultivation. It will increase the tillage area.  Beet can only be grown in rotation, and for every acre of beet grown there will have to be one or two other acres also under cultivation.  Its cultivation demands heavy manuring and very good tillage.  The result of that will be found of benefit to farmers in the returns which they will get in the subsequent crops.  The pulp which comes back when the sugar is extracted, or extracted as much as possible, will be available for stock, both for milk production and fattening.  The industry, moreover, gives employment to a considerable number of men at the slack season of the year.  It is in the late autumn that the manufacture of sugar from beet commences, and that goes on until the beginning of the new year.  It gives employment when employment is most required in the countryside.  It is clear that the manufacture of beet sugar can be carried on without substantial Government subsidy only when the farmers are able to grow crops with a high sugar content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be a considerable period of years before the results that are necessary to make the industry a purely economic one can be achieved.  We will have to discover the variety of beet best suited to this country, and we will have to have the farmers educated in the growing, tillage, cultivation, and manuring of beet; we will have to have the farmers understand the benefit of crops in rotation, and to get them to be willing to cultivate beet at the lowest profit consistent with the proper carrying on of their tillage operations. That will certainly require a certain period of years, and, in addition to the actual manufacturing side, the initial difficulties are considerable.  In this country there are transport difficulties, and certain other disadvantages as compared with other countries.  These disadvantages will be only very slowly overcome, and there will be the necessity for bringing in a considerable number of foreign workers in the beginning years.  That will be a very expensive operation.  Men are brought <Col N="568" /> out of their country to another country that is unknown to them, they are separated from their families, and higher wages will have to be paid to them.  You will have also all the difficulties incidental to dealing with the repair of the factory.  In that respect it will probably be necessary to pay a higher subsidy than will be necessary at any-time in Great Britain. Great loss is incurred if there is any interruption in the process of extracting the sugar.  If any breakdown of the plant occurs that cannot be immediately remedied the loss will be considerable, and consequently mechanics and a repair plant will have to be retained.  In England, where you have big engineering shops spread all over the country, a lesser repair plant and lesser number of mechanics are necessary.  Here you will have to make provision for dealing on the spot, by your own staff, with matters that in England would be dealt with by adjacent engineering firms.  You have to have duplication in England even of certain items of plant and equipment.  Here you may have to have triplication.  Then, in this country you shall have, probably, in most cases to pay an appreciably higher price for the coal.  Coal in the actual manufacture of sugar from beet is a very substantial item.  The coal bill amounts to well over 50 per cent. in the cost of manufacture of sugar from beet.  If these particular facts are had regard to, Deputies, I think, will realise that the subsidies we propose to pay compare favourably enough with the subsidies in Great Britain.</P>

      <P>We are paying a rate of subsidy which over the ten years will work out at about an average of 23/- per cwt.  The British average over the ten-year period works out at 15/8&mdash;that is at present.  But, for the purposes <Col N="569" /> of comparison, it is necessary to take into account the fact that we are paying no subsidy on molasses.  The British are paying a subsidy of 8/7 a cwt. on molasses containing 70 per cent. or more of sweetening matter.  The fact of our paying no subsidy on molasses will be that for the purposes of comparison 10d. might be added to the British subsidy, or 10d. deducted from our subsidy.  That is, there is 10d. actually less in the difference over the ten-year period than appears simply in the figures of 23/- and 15/8½.  Of course, we must bear in mind the fact that we are beginning.  The experiment in Great Britain has been going on for some time.  You have the Kelham factory and the Cantley factory, which started manufacturing in 1912.</P>
      <P>If we compare what this first factory started by us will cost with the cost of Kelham, we will have a fairer idea of what the comparison is.  A company called Home Grown Sugar, Ltd., was formed in 1920 for the purpose of carrying on the manufacture of sugar at Kelham.  They issued capital amounting to £500,000.  The British Government subscribed half and guaranteed a dividend of five per cent. over ten years on the 250,000 shares issued to the public.  It was provided, moreover, that the capital subscribed by the Government should not begin to earn dividend until 31st March, 1930.  Later on, the shares were written down from £1 to 5/-, involving a capital loss to the Government of £187,500.  The Government also had to pay, under its guarantee, dividends amounting to £32,500, and there was a loss of dividends on its own capital which might be put down at £125,000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, there was the fact that the Kelham factory had the assurance of a subsidy over 12 years, as against our ten years, and the average rate of subsidy for their first ten years amounted to 19/-.  If we actually take the subsidy at 19/- for the first ten years, as compared with our first ten years at 23/-, and if we add to that this £125,000, loss of interest, £187,500, loss due to the writing down of capital, in addition to the £32,500 for dividends that it had to pay to the public, it will be seen that the actual variation, when <Col N="570" /> all the factors are taken into account, between the British subsidy and our subsidy, is very small indeed.  If the amount of sugar produced at Kelham over the period were to be somewhat low and not come up to the amount we estimate, it may be that their subsidy, taking into account the capital losses, will actually be higher than ours.  We are estimating for the production of 86,000 tons of sugar over the ten-year period.</P>
    <P>It is an extremely difficult thing to arrive at any basis on which to fix a subsidy.  It was found very difficult in Great Britain, even up to the present, where they have more experience than we have.  People have suggested that the rate of subsidy which we have agreed to pay this firm is excessive.  It is true that if all goes well the company obtaining the concession may hope to make very substantial profits. But, anything may occur to reduce the amount of profits that are to be looked for.  They may find it impossible to get the full quantity of beet that is looked for.  A factory is being built which ultimately may be raised to the capacity of 15,000 tons of sugar per annum.  It will begin with the production of about 5,000 tons of sugar per annum.  If the extent of the area under sugar beet were not to expand as rapidly as it is hoped, there would be naturally less profits.  Any sort of difficulty might arise which would be to the disadvantage of the company.</P>
    <P>The way that we went about fixing the subsidy was something that was very nearly a matter of receiving tenders. We appointed an inter-Departmental Committee to examine the matter of starting a sugar beet industry here.  It was known that the Government contemplated legislation enabling it to give subsidies for the carrying on of the manufacture of sugar beet.  That inter-Departmental Committee interviewed anybody who had any sort of proposition to put up. In addition to that, it actually went to the Continent and interviewed people engaged in the manufacture of sugar beet there, with a view to their undertaking to start the industry here. The offer that was made by M. Lippens was the best offer that came in.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" /> Another Continental sugar manufacturer who is engaged in the industry in Great Britain was also prepared to start a factory here, but he was prepared to start on terms which worked out at an average of 24s. 2d. per cwt. over ten years.  That is 1s. 2d. higher than M. Lippens.  M. Lippens, with whom the Government proposes to enter into an agreement as soon as this Bill has been passed, is a man of as good standing as could be got to undertake this work.  He is President and head of a large sugar-manufacturing firm in Belgium, a man of high reputation and is in every way competent to carry this new enterprise to success.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of discussion of another offer which was put before the inter-Departmental Committee and before Ministers.  I do not know whether I need go into that other offer at any great length.  It was an offer which the Government regarded as being entirely unacceptable and which did not deserve to be treated seriously.  There were quite a number of factors which led the Government to take that view.  In the first place there was a provision that the Government should put up £150,000 of capital, and that only a comparatively small sum should be put up by the concessionaires until after the factory had been completed.  The Government were to take preference shares to the value of £150,000, and were to pay cash.</P>
    <P>The concessionaires were to take £100,000 in preference shares, but they were only to pay up 2/6 per share on allotment, and the remainder was not to be paid until after the factory had been completed.  In addition to this they were to take 100,000 shares of 1/- each, which they were to pay up, amounting to £5,000.  Holding something like two-fifths of the capital, they were to have three-fifths of the voting power.  They were to have three directors on the Board to the Government's two directors.  They were also to have three-fifths of the profits.  The position, as far as I see it, would have been that the Government would put up the money, £150,000, which substantially would have erected the factory.  The <Col N="572" /> other shareholders in it were to be a firm of manufacturers of plant, not sugar manufacturers, although it is true the Skoda works do maintain a staff of experts in the manufacture of sugar, who will show anyone who buys plant how to use it.  Their interest in the industry is primarily the interest of the manufacturers of plant.  Our position was to be that we would put up the money to erect the factory. After the £150,000 was spent we would then be in the position that, if the new company were to allege that the subsidy suggested in the beginning was insufficient, with our money sunk in the plant, we would have no alternative but to increase the subsidy or see our capital go to waste.  That was the sort of proposition which the Government could not accept.</P>
    <P>There was also the aspect of their offer concerning the price to be paid for beet.  It will be obvious to Deputies that if this experiment is to be a success at all the first consideration is that farmers should be induced to grow beet, that they should be induced to embark on the cultivation of a new crop which they know nothing about, to which they have not been accustomed, and which will not fit in with their ordinary methods or ordinary rotation.  If a sufficient price is not paid to the farmers, then the whole thing fails.  If the experiment were to be made on the lines suggested, and if £150,000 of Government money had gone into the creation of a factory, we could not have allowed the £150,000 to go to waste, simply because the terms of the subsidy did not permit of a sufficient price being paid to farmers to induce them to grow the crop.  We regarded it from that aspect as being wholly illusory.</P>
    <P>Then there were provisions that the price to be paid to the farmers, which was low in the first instance, 42/- as against 50/- without a contract, and 54/- with a contract for three years, which will be paid by M. Lippens, should be reduced or increased by 1/- per ton for every shilling in the wholesale price of sugar above or below 45/- per cwt.  That meant again that the proposal was not one to be seriously accepted, because a reduction such as we recently made in the Customs duty <Col N="573" /> on sugar reduced the wholesale price of sugar, very naturally, by a very substantial amount, and would have meant a big reduction of the already too low price proposed in that scheme to be paid to the farmer.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact the agent that put forward that scheme was not himself a sugar expert.  He was prepared to put forward a scheme about anything. He came first with a scheme for afforestation, and when he found nothing doing in afforestation he put up a scheme for the manufacture of sugar.  No doubt, when sugar is off, we may have a scheme for other things. We did not regard that person as a responsible expert whose offer was one that we should go out of our way to discuss with him.</P>
    <P>We simply let it come in as other offers came in.  We took the best offer. Both in regard to the price paid for beet and in regard to the subsidy required, we regard the offer of Lippens as being satisfactory.  It is higher than the subsidy that is being provided in England at present, but it is not higher than what Kelham would cost, having regard to the capital loss.  It is a few shillings higher only, if we have regard to the subsidy, apart from the capital loss.  There are those facts that I stated in the beginning that will tend to require a greater subsidy here than in Great Britain.  First of all in regard to distance.  It will probably be more expensive to bring workers here and keep them here; the price of coal will be higher, and then there is the question of engineering facilities.  All these things will have their effect.</P>
    <P>We may be asked why we should propose, as we do propose, for the present, to confine ourselves to one factory.  It has been said that we could get great results in employment, could give a great fillip to tillage, by arranging for a number of factories each producing, say, 10,000 tons of sugar.  We might have six, or seven, or eight of them if we were to supply our own sugar requirements.  But the production of sugar on a large scale, on a scale to meet our requirements, at the cost at which it will be produced under this scheme would not really be a business proposition.  What <Col N="574" /> we are paying for now is the education of the public, of the farmer, or people who may adventure their money in sugar production.  At the end of ten years I do not think that there will be any chance that the sugar industry will be on its feet sufficiently to carry on without any subsidy, but it is to be hoped that it will be in a position to carry on for some other period with a very much reduced subsidy.  When things have advanced to the stage that we can get other factories started at a rate considerably below this it will become a proposition for the starting of other factories.  If we can even get factories at something like the rate that will be paid in Great Britain henceforward it would be a proposition. But the way to look at this present subsidy when you are thinking of employment and of extension is: What would it mean per acre with a crop which would give, say, a ton of sugar to the acre&mdash;and that would not be a very heavy crop or a crop very rich in sugar?  The subsidy will work out in the first year at £24 10s. per acre of cultivation.  It will be obvious to anybody that if we are only thinking of employment, if we are only thinking of the present, that money at the rate of, I think, £122,500 for the first year, and increasing from that on, could be spent on other things to give greater employment, that is, if we were not thinking of the creation of a new industry, the education of the cultivators and the workers, we could not justify the setting-up of six or seven factories and paying for the cultivation that would result from the setting up of them a subsidy amounting to £24 an acre.  It seems to me that under our conditions the only thing that we can justify is the beginning, getting the first steps taken.</P>
    <P>When progress has been made, as it undoubtedly will be in a year or two, when it becomes apparent that farmers will grow beet, that farmers will be businesslike enough to realise that a valuable new asset is being created for them, and they will deal in a fair and businesslike way with the people undertaking the enterprise, when it becomes apparent to anybody who has an expert knowledge of this industry, not <Col N="575" /> only apparent but proven, that labour will be reasonable and will carry on as labour in England is doing, and that there will not be holds-up which will make the conducting of the industry impossible, we may hope, I believe, in a very short time to have other people willing to take less than the subsidy now offered; perhaps not less than the first year, but less over the period.  But after the most careful examination, after doing everything we could to get <i>bona fide</i> offers from people qualified to carry on the industry, this is the best offer we have been able to get.  This is practically the result of our asking for tenders.  We did not formally ask for tenders, but the thing operated exactly as if we had, and this is the best <i>bona fide</i> offer we have been able to get.</P>
    <P>This is not extravagantly in excess of the subsidy that is being paid in Great Britain.  Taking into account all the circumstances, it is a reasonable sum. It is a sum, as I have said, that gives a promise of good profits.  It involves the investment, however, of very big sums of money.  It is estimated that the complete equipment of the factory will run to the neighbourhood of £200,000 for the 10,000 tons.  It also requires people who are skilled in the industry.  It is not merely a question of money; you must have organisation and direction of knowledge.  There are only a limited number of people who can be got.  I have little doubt from what we have been able to learn, that the industry is one which will flourish here, that by the expenditure which we will undertake over these ten years&mdash; an expenditure running into nearly £2,000,000&mdash;we will have got an asset for our agriculture and also from the point of view of the economic life of the country, that would be worth a great deal more than that to us.  We will have something that we had not before. In its own way, it will be something like the discovery of a coal or a gold mine; a new source of wealth will have been opened up.  We gain nothing by waiting; it is a question not merely of soil and climate, although those come into it, but of psychology; it is a question of the readiness of our farmers to grow a crop and also to deal reasonably <Col N="576" /> with the company which will be manufacturing the sugar, a question of the estimate of foreigners as to what the conditions are here.</P>
    <P>We gain nothing by waiting; we only lose time.  One of the curses of this country has been that time has always been lost, that opportunities were never seized, that the wrongs were never righted in time.  The country simply lagged behind because things were not done.  There would be no advantage in leaving this undone.  If we did save £50,000 by leaving it undone for two or three years, we would lose a great deal more than £50,000.  I think what has been a prop to agriculture in countries with similar climates, is most likely to be a prop here.  Certainly, the advantage promised is so great that the speculation is the soundest possible speculation; it is a speculation that I think any sane and reasonable conception of national interests demands.  I move the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I approached the consideration of this question with a distinct bias in its favour, but during the last week-end I spent some little time in getting together what material I could and very grave doubts arose as to the wisdom of this proposition but I was hopeful the Minister would be able to resolve those doubts and bring me back to my first thought in regard to this proposition.  He has not done very much to remove those doubts.  I rather think he has done something to confirm them.  I want him to clear away one false impression or, if it is correct, I want to have it confirmed right from the beginning.  It is in connection with what he had to say on it.  The Minister said the cost of coal was fifty per cent. of the cost of production of sugar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Egan told us that a ton of coal was needed for the <Col N="577" /> extraction of one ton of sugar. Assuming coal at fifty shillings or three pounds a ton inland&mdash;I think fifty shillings a ton, would not be an extravagant figure for large quantities&mdash;£5 a ton would be the cost of the production on the basis of coal being half the cost. If that is a fact it reveals a state of things much more damaging to this project than I had anticipated.</P>
      <P>I find from the discussion in the British House of Commons when they were debating the Bill, a month or two ago, that one of the representatives of Lyle, Tate and Company, Sugar Refiners, said &ldquo;The finished article costs about 24s. per cwt., or £24 per ton.&rdquo;  There is a big margin between £5 and £24 and one would naturally say that margin is to cover the cost of raw material, risks, depreciation of machinery, and overhead charges.  If raw material is delivered free, then the difference between £5 and £24 is to cover overhead charges, depreciation and profits.  That is too great a margin.  It suggests what I had already thought, that the proposition before us is that the first three years of the guarantee amounting to £441,000 on the estimated production will be enough to cover the cost of erection of a factory, and profits.  That is to say, the first three years is intended to relieve the shareholders of any further liability and risks.  Supposing, after the three years' contract with the farmers is completed, that the farmers refused to supply at the expected lower price for beets.  There will be no risk to the shareholder because they will have already written off their investments in the first three years of working. The big margin between the working cost of production and the price, of sugar on the market, wholesale would require some explanation. I wish the Minister had been as careful to present to the Dáil on this proposal as much detail as has been given in regard to the Shannon Electricity Scheme.  I wish we had examination by independent experts and the presentation of estimates, costs of production, prices, etc.  Even though there may be greater variations it would have been calculated to give us more confidence in the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> The case, as I understand it, is that it is worth two million pounds in ten years to stimulate new agricultural production and to improve agriculture in this country, that the sugar industry is quite subsidiary, and that the real value of this proposal is that it will stimulate better cultivation and improve farming.  I think we ought to ask whether this is the best way to spend two million pounds in ten years to achieve the same end.  Of course it is not by any means sure that we will be called upon to pay two million pounds.  It is fairly certain that in the first three years we shall be called upon to pay £441,000, inasmuch as in those three years, an attractive price was guaranteed to the farmer for the production of beets.  Contracts are expected to be three years contracts, at the price of 54/- per ton, for beets, &ldquo;delivered at the factory&rdquo;&mdash;that is a difference between the proposal here and that in England.  After that period it rests with the company and the price of sugar as to whether they can afford to offer the farmers a price sufficiently attractive to encourage the farmers to continue producing beets.</P>
    <P>The very clever, eloquent, and able advocate of beet sugar industry, Sir Alfred Wood, told us&mdash;this was sent by post to us, and I am sure every Deputy has received a copy&mdash;that in due course it was inevitable&mdash;he was speaking to English farmers, but the lesson is equally strong for Irish farmers&mdash;that farmers would be obliged to accept a beet price very much lower than the guaranteed price.  He went on to suggest the possibility of not more than 30/- per ton for beet.  I say it depends on the price of sugar, after the first three years.  One might say everything depends on the price of sugar after the first three years, and whether the farmer can be induced to continue to grow beets.  Perhaps it is worth while to look at the sugar position in the world. Before the war 46 per cent. of the world's sugar production was produced from beet.  In 1923-24, only 26 per cent. of the world's production was produced from beet.  There had been a considerable increase in cane sugar production.  Plantations had increased rapidly both in Australia, West Indies, <Col N="579" /> and East Indies.  There is an increasing production of sugar in Europe.  In 1912-13 the world's production was estimated at 18,187,000 tons.  The war prevented production to a considerable extent; it certainly prevented the collection of statistics.</P>
    <P>In 1919-20 the world production was down to 15,193,000 tons.  It is worth noting, and it is important in view of the possible course of prices, that there has been a steady increase in the world production of sugar from 1919 to 1924-25. Last year the estimate was 22,633,000 tons, or four and a half million tons more than was produced in the year preceding the war.  I do not know whether the demand has increased as rapidly as that, or is increasing more rapidly.  It is difficult to say.</P>
    <P>The fact that prices have varied so much as they have done in the last year or two, is a consideration which we must take into account.  Perhaps it would be well if we endeavoured to arrive at some explanation of the rapid variations.  In the two years 1923-24 the world price variations, apart from duties, were as much as from 22/- to 40/- per cwt., the pre-war price being about 15/- to 16/- per cwt.  It is down again to about 22/- or 23/-; that was so about a month ago.  These variations in the price of sugar suggest manipulation by market controllers and speculators.  America and Holland are playing a strong game in this matter. While I do not pretend to understand anything about the manipulation of the markets, I can only say that where the course of production has been so steady in ten years, and where the consumption must be fairly steady, the rapid variations indicate to me more than anything else, a market manipulation.</P>
    <P>We can contemplate, for the purposes of argument, that we may have, for the next three years, a production of sugar quite small in comparison with the world supply, and small even in comparison with the Irish demand.  We can, however, only keep thinking of the next three years, the three years during which the farmers are guaranteed, inasmuch as after three years the price to the farmer is going to depend inevitably upon the world market price.  We <Col N="580" /> can only think of that period with certainty, and can only be comparatively sure in regard to that length of time. For that three years there is an estimated production of 18,000 tons of sugar, and the subsidy amounts to £441,000.  During that time, provided the quantity and the quality of the beets are as such as may be counted upon to bring forth that quantity of sugar, the total sum payable under the guarantee to the farmers will be £405,000.  That is to say, the State will hand to the factory £441,000, of which £405,000 will be paid to the farmers for beets.  There will be £35,000 or £10,000 a year, of a margin over and above free raw material.  I think we ought to have presented to us an estimate&mdash;not a binding estimate in this case, but a fair and reasonable estimate&mdash;of the normal costs of production in a factory which has been working.  Then we can add a percentage, a reasonably ample percentage, to meet the novitiate stage, the risks of failure to supply beets in sufficient quantity and quality, or a failure of the man-power.  We could add that if we had the basic price and the costs of production in a normally working factory.</P>
    <P>For instance, if we can get from the Minister particulars of the cost of production in the existing British factories, not in the earliest years but say last year, it would help us to form our judgment on something like a sound foundation. The Minister quoted one of the factories, the Kelham factory, and to my amazement compared the subsidy paid over to the establishment of the Kelham factory, and likely to be paid over under the ten years proposal, with the amount likely to be paid over by this scheme, to the Irish factory. It is notorious that the whole Kelham scheme was a failure largely because of bad management.  Certainly, it has not been looked upon as a fair test of a sugar factory, and to suggest that we must be prepared to go through a similar stage, like every child is supposed to go through measles, is asking us too much.  I would have thought that that superstition had passed.  On the question of experiments, the Kelham factory and the <Col N="581" /> Cantley factory have been running for several years.  These are the first experiments subsidised by the British Government and the amount of the subsidy was not unlike the amount of the subsidy proposed in this scheme.</P>
    <P>They have had their experiments. They have proved now profitable. They have overcome their early difficulties. They have learned that they can grow beets in England suitable for sugar production and that it can be produced in paying quantities and that the farmers will respond, given a price.  But there are six or seven factories being started in other parts of Scotland and England.  Is it suggested by anybody that because in Norfolk, it was found possible to grow beets, and to make a commercial success of a factory, that that is sufficient to prove the possibilities in the North of Scotland or in any other part of England? Is that the contention?  If it is, then I say it is equally proved that beet can be grown in Ireland.  I recognise that the farming conditions are different.  I recognise that, but it should not require that we must go through the same process of experiment at the same cost as they have done in England and that we must never take advantage of the experience of other people.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if it is possible now to persuade sugar companies to start factories on a basis of 19/6 for the first four years, 13/- for the next three years, and 6/6 for the last three years, in Scotland and parts of England which have not yet been touched by sugar factories, then we should get very much nearer to that in Ireland.  The difference as between our proposals and the proposals now being put into operation in England, would mean for the same quantities, in the ten years not less than £869,000.  I am prepared to admit that the circumstances of Ireland might require that we should pay something extra for added risks, but I am not prepared to say that we should bind ourselves to a sum of £869,000.</P>
    <P>I think that we ought to be able to take some advantage of the experience of other countries.  While for the first <Col N="582" /> three years, we provide £441,000 to the factory as a subsidy and they pay to the farmer £405,000 for beets, if the estimates of the Minister is fulfilled in the ten years we shall have paid to the factories £1,961,000.  Provided that the factory maintains the same price for the remaining seven years, as they have proposed to do for the first three years, 54/- per ton for beets, then the total amount paid to the farmers for the whole ten years for all the beets produced and supplied to the factory would be £1,935,000, or £25,000 or £26,000 less than is paid in subsidy to the factory.  That is on the assumption that they maintain the price during the succeeding seven years that they have fixed for the first three years which the advocate of sugar beet growing promises is most unlikely. That brings us to the position of the Company in relation to the Government. The Company has had produced 86,000 tons of sugar and has received in subsidy £1,961,000, in the ten years.</P>
    <P>What is the position of the Company? The cost of the factory is, according to different estimates, to be between two hundred and three hundred thousand pounds.  Perhaps the difference between the two hundred and the three hundred thousand pounds is intended to cover floating capital.  But they have this very big margin between current prices of sugar on the market and the actual cost of production.  That is to be used for paying off the capital and for providing a substantial profit.  I propose to quote from a weekly journal of last week an extract from a letter which is alleged to have been written by a director of this company, M. Lippens. It is a circular which has been distributed with a view to raising capital in Ireland towards this company, and it says: &ldquo;From M. Lippens' letter, it will be seen that the earnings of the factory, together with the Government subsidy, are expected to be sufficient to amortise the entire capital expenditure in ten years, in addition to the payment of substantial dividends.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I have no particular fault to find with that except that it proposes <Col N="583" /> to run no risks.  I think the probabilities are that they are hoping to amortise the capital within three years, but the Government has, during this time, paid over nearly two million pounds.  Has it any sort of control of the company, has it a share-holding in the company in that period?  I am reminded of the play produced by the Ulster Players where the fisherman caught herring.  The dealer played a trick upon his neighbours by pretending that there were found, in the gullet of the herring, as if by a miracle, one pound notes.  The fisherman wanted to know: &ldquo;Who owns the herring, and who owns the pound notes?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have paid over to the company £1,961,000, and the company has got its beet as a consequence for nothing.  At the end of ten years the capital expenditure has been wiped out, but who owns the factory?  Is it the company or the people who paid over the £2,000,000.  Of course the proposal is that the company shall continue to own it as usual.  I think that there ought seriously to be in any scheme of this kind, which involves the paying over of large sums of money to a company to assist the establishment of a new industry, a definite share in the control of that company, and that there ought to be a definite share in the possibilities of profit during this period of ten years.  While I am not influenced, and have not been influenced, by any arguments that have appeared in newspapers in regard to this matter, I feel that the suggestion, so far as the terms on which it may have been proposed&mdash; I say nothing of the suggestion that the Government should become part proprietors&mdash;to pay 49 per cent. of the share capital is one which is certainly worth supporting, so that if there is an exhorbitant profit during the period of ten years of subsidy, a share of it will come to the Treasury.</P>
    <P>I would like, if the Minister for Agriculture is to speak on this matter, that he will give us his views as to whether this is the most beneficial way of spending £2,000,000.  I have said more than once here that I believe what is required for agriculture is to give a <Col N="584" /> direct stimulus to tillage.  I have no doubt that this will be a stimulus to tillage, but unfortunately it will be a stimulus to tillage in a very limited area.  Thirty thousand acres or thereabouts will be the limit of the stimulus until there are new factories set up in other parts of the country.  I think the stimulus ought to be more general, and should not be confined to the factory area.  I think that is a fault in this scheme so far as giving a stimulus to the extension of tillage is concerned. I feel that another fault in this matter is that it is going to extend tillage perhaps in a tillage area.  The probabilities are that the factory area which will be called upon will be the area where at present there is a great proportion of tillage.  It may extend tillage. To that extent it would be of value, but if we were going into a country where there is at present no tillage, or at least only a very small proportion of tillage, then we would have more satisfaction.  There may not be very much in that point, and it may be said that whatever area is chosen, if the proportion of tillage there be small, it must inevitably be extended.</P>
    <P>But, I fear, examining these proposals with every care and with a desire to support them if possible, I fear that they are going to be too costly, that the two million is not being spent to the best advantage, that we have not been provided with sufficient details to warrant us in practically voting that this agreement, which is only in broad outlines presented to us, should be confirmed. We ought to have much more details.  Experiments as to the possibilities of the country producing beet in large areas and in considerable quantities, shall I say, could be tested at a cost of a few thousand pounds per year, even supposing the beets as a whole were shipped to the factory in England or dropped into the sea.  I think, as an experiment in the possibilities of beet production of the right quality, it is altogether too costly.  If we had any assurance after tentative experiments that factories could be brought here, for a much smaller subsidy, I do not believe there would be much loss of time if the Board of Agriculture were to test beet production in various parts <Col N="585" /> of the country on a fairly large scale, but not on a factory production scale, to prove that not merely demonstration plots but fields could produce beet root for sugar of a paying quality, and on a paying basis.  I think that experiments could be tried at comparatively small cost.  I think, if that were true, it should be sufficient to satisfy the sugar speculator or the sugar factory investing company that they would be fully justified in opening a factory in Ireland for the promise of very much smaller subsidy for ten years than is proposed in this scheme.  It will depend upon the course of the discussion whether I can give my support to the Second Reading of this Bill.  I have tried to examine the question fairly and with a bias in its favour, and I have come to the conclusion that so far a case has not yet been made for this scheme with a very high subsidy over a period of ten years.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to contrast the attitude of a Labour leader in Ireland on this matter of beet sugar production with the attitude of a leader of the Labour Party in Great Britain, who in his official capacity of Minister of Finance &mdash;or Chancellor of the Exchequer, to be correct&mdash;was called upon to reply officially to the overtures of those who advocated an extension of beet-growing and a further support by way of subsidy or grant of public money to the beet-growing industry in England. Mr. Snowdon, speaking in the House of Commons on the 30th July, 1924 during an unemployment debate, makes this confession&mdash;Deputy Johnson has made <i>his</i> confession.  He said he approached the subject with a bias in its favour; he is now sceptical, or if not actually sceptical, he at least adopts an attitude of philosophic doubt&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Snowden said: &ldquo;I approached the consideration of this question, I will not say with hostility, but certainly not in a favourable or sympathetic frame of mind.  I have given very long consideration to it, and the more I see of its possibility the more enthusiastic I become.  I believe it is one of the very biggest things that can be done for British agriculture.  I believe it will revive <Col N="586" /> British agriculture and restore rural England, and I am confident, so successfully were the early stages, the early experiments, that the areas devoted to sugar-producing purposes will extend until this country is in a position to produce a great part of the sugar it requires.  I think it is necessary if the scheme we are going to propose is to be carried through, that it should be carried through, I will not say with the unanimous approval of the House of Commons, but at least with a certain measure of agreement among all parties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And as we know, the Subsidy Bill was carried through with the unanimous consent of all parties Now, this proposal of the Minister for Finance excites my imagination.  It appeals to me.  I have given very considerable thought and detailed study to this matter.  In its own way, particularly to the agricultural industry, it is quite as big a thing as the Shannon scheme. I believe with one alteration the words Mr. Snowden used about England, can be used about Ireland. It is one of the very biggest things that could be done for Irish agriculture. I believe it will revive Irish agriculture and restore rural Ireland. Taking that view of the matter, the proposal of a subsidy in aid of this industry commends itself to me as really a State investment.  What is it, after all?  On closer investigation, it reveals itself to me as a State investment paid in instalments.</P>
    <P>I probably inform Deputy Johnson of what he knows already as well as I do, if I quote what the Labour Minister for Agriculture said about these proposals.</P>
    <P>There was a very big man, a very great man, now only a short time dead, who always took the big view of things&mdash;he had the courage to confess himself, though once the high priest of imperial federation, to be an advocate and apostle of the British Commonwealth of Nations and lent his support and his wide experience to the signing of the Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, that is Lord Milner. Lord Milner, approached by the English <Col N="587" /> Society for propaganda in aid of the sugar beet industry, said: &ldquo;The question is whether for an object of this importance the subsidy, which is not a very large one, is not worth making. I have no doubt at all that the giving of the subsidy can be completely justified and it is not all a loss. I would like to impress these words not merely upon Deputy Johnson but upon members of the Executive Council as well as upon my own colleagues in the House.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not all loss.  Even what the Exchequer gives us is not all loss.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At that time he was speaking of relief from Excise Duties which were operative.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are very great compensating advantages.  It is a great help to agriculture.  It tends to improve agricultural profits, from which the State also derives benefit and which gives employment.  It means a great deal of extra employment in agricultural districts&mdash;a matter of the greatest importance at the present time.  It is a subsidy. All subsidies are objectionable but I would rather subsidise work than subsidise idleness.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is really the alternative.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think, on national grounds, you have a strong case and I earnestly hope your effort will be successful.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is, in the main, a question of subsidising the agricultural industry.</P>

      <P>Athanasius was right in that controversy, but as Deputy Cooper is well aware, the phrase has got a much more extensive <Col N="588" /> application since the days of Athanasius. It applies to him who sets himself against the current of experience and wisdom, as well as to him who was the sole upholder of the right view against the multitude.  This is a subsidy in the interests of agriculture.  It is that more than anything else.  It would be a mistake to suppose that what is in question is merely the creation of one sugar factory, or one sugar factory, more or less.  I shall take as an example a man who was as big in his own conception of himself as Deputy Gorey is&mdash;Napoleon Buonaparte. In 1811, it may interest Deputy Gorey to know, Napoleon, in his own Napoleonic way of doing things, ordered a huge sum to be set aside for the creation of schools of expert research and study in regard to sugar beet.  In the following year he ordered students of medicine, pharmacy, and the various allied studies of chemistry to transfer themselves to these technical sugar schools, and he directed that 150,000 acres be immediately devoted to the cultivation of beet.  There in he laid the foundation of the present prosperity of the agricultural industry in France.  That was copied in Belgium.  There is not a country in Europe at the present time&mdash;and this is true more particularly of Germany than of any other country&mdash;in which the growing of beet for sugar is not the backbone of the agricultural industry. Those who look around with parochial vision and see nothing except what is under their eyes, are unaware of what the big world beyond them has done and is doing.  While they talk of a Greater Ireland and of devising all sorts of contrivances for the development of her prosperity, they refuse to learn from the experience of other people.  Of course, the present speaker, Mr. Deputy Chairman, is a Professor. Therefore, all that he knows about anything is derived from books, and whatever knowledge you derive from books is inferior to that which you derive from the spoken voice.  Why that is so, I do not know; but on those benches it is the prevalent superstition.  If one is a Professor, one cannot see the obvious; one cannot travel in other lands and see what other people are <Col N="589" /> doing and learn from their experience. One must be a member of the so-called Farmers' Party to be capable of illumination on any topic.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson made a point, and at the risk of breaking in upon the continuity of my argument.  I will deal with it now, because of Deputy Gorey's interruption.  Deputy Johnson spoke of the variations in the price of sugar, and interpreted these, with their abrupt changes, as indicative of manipulation. I agree with him.  I think there is manifest evidence of manipulation of the sugar market.  This is a thing we should not forget: the world market price may, at a later stage, as he pointed out, become adverse to us in our production of sugar.  There, also, I hold with him.  But what is the answer?  The answer is that in Germany the farmers find it worth while to grow beet and could afford to sell it practically for the cost of production because of the advantage they derive in the return from the dry pulp which remains over after the larger portion of the sugar has been extracted.  That has been found to be a most valuable feeding material for cattle.  Experiments both in Government research schools and in the actual practice of dairy farming, show enormous increase in the yield of milk in the case of cows fed upon this pulp.  Between 45 and 60 per cent. increase are the official figures given in an English observer's report to the British Government&mdash;an official sent out to make a report on agriculture in Germany.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly it had.  It was all part and parcel of scientifically conducted farming and dairying.  That is the respect in which Germany led the world&mdash;the application of science to industries of every kind.  German Universities built up what was a shattered people after Napoleon's wars.  German Universities made Germany what it was at the outbreak <Col N="590" /> of the Great Continental War in 1914.  The point is that the value of the beet crop to the farmer would make it worth while, irrespective of the sugar.  A member of the Farmers' Party told me some time ago that he understood the beet crop exhausted the soil.  It cannot exhaust the soil. There is the best of all reasons for that The peculiar thing about the beet plant is that the leaves are the manufactory and the root is the warehouse.  The leaves manufacture from the air and light the saccharine material&mdash;it is not sugar at that time&mdash;which it stores in the root.  Furthermore, it has been proved by experience that the peculiar character of the growth of the beet aerates the soil.  The Minister for Finance pointed out what at first sight would seem to be a strong argument against it&mdash;that it requires heavy manuring and deep digging.  But then, in Holland, in Czecho-Slovakia, in Belgium, in France, and in Germany the one manuring has been found to do for the succeeding crops.  It has the advantage of clearing the ground and making it fitter for the cereal crop to follow, so that it is economic in the long run.  The answer that I would respectfully make to Deputy Johnson on this point is &ldquo;Granted all these things with regard to sugar price fluctuations, still the stimulus to tillage which would be given by this subsidy would produce a result in farming that would be well worth the money expended.&rdquo;  If you want to know where to get the money &mdash;well, instead of that £600,000, given as a grant-in-aid of agricultural rates which is only relief&mdash;a species of outdoor relief&mdash;give the money in the form of subsidies that will create, not one, but at least three factories&mdash;one in each of the provinces at present under the jurisdiction of the Saorstát and create something with a permanent yield.  I speak of this subsidy as a State investment, paid in annual instalments.  But what are the dividends for the State? A rejuvenated agricultural industry: a brighter countryside.  Notice&mdash;I do not think the Farmers in the House will contradict this&mdash;what is wrong with the small farmer, the man with fifteen to thirty acres.  He has an uncertain <Col N="591" /> market.  He must take, very often, the price that is forced upon him, because of the narrow circuit within which he sells.  But here, with sugar factories planted in appropriate centres, the farmer, under the scheme which is set out in the Schedule to the Bill, has an assured market.  If he has got carefully selected seed, that has been produced under the most careful scientific production, from the moment he puts this seed into his soil, he knows that there is a buyer waiting for the yield, and he knows, moreover, the exact price he is to get for it, as a minimum. If, by learning&mdash;it is, no doubt, a difficult art&mdash;how to thin at the proper moment and how to deal with his crop at the last moment, he is able to produce a bigger yield than 15½ per cent. of sugar&mdash;experiment shows that he can easily produce 17 to 18 per cent. &mdash;he will get a higher price.  But the important point is this security or assurance. He might produce a greater tonnage per acre of mangolds, but where is he going to sell the crop? Can he be sure that anyone will buy it?  Deputies who were in the Provisional Parliament will remember hearing about the luxuriant yield of potatoes in one year recently when there was no one to buy them.  But in the prices in operation under the schedule to the Bill, the farmer has a guaranteed market and a guaranteed minimum price.  He has the very incentive that a man needs for production. There is the dividend that will be yielded to the State: the money will be well spent.  I cannot conceive of any better investment for the funds of the people than this upliftment of the people, firstly, in respect of the chief industry, and, secondly, in regard to the collateral advantages.  You give hope and brightness, you give a rosy outlook on life to the man who is getting his feet firmly planted at last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only point with which I felt inclined to quarrel in the speech of the Minister for Finance was when he spoke of &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; in this regard. Of course 90 per cent&mdash;perhaps 99 per cent.&mdash;of what he referred to in regard to experiment was correct, and my criticism may appear meticulous. <Col N="592" /> Is beet, as a crop, experimental?  I have already answered that.  The world answers &ldquo;No; it is long past that stage.&rdquo;  Is it an industry that is suitable for our soil and climate? Deputy Johnson referred to the growth in England, and asked would that be typical of growth in Ireland.  Unfortunately, beet was grown in the Victorian period, as a trial, in Ireland, and a factory even was put up.  In my reading of the history of industry in what used to be called the &ldquo;United Kingdom,&rdquo; I learned that Ireland was the first place in which the growing of sugar beet was attempted.  The procuring of seed&mdash;which, by the way, hit the English industry very hard during the war&mdash;was very difficult at that time, and the growing of seed was not properly understood. The crop did not fail because it was unsuited to Ireland, but because there was no one with the requisite expert knowledge in the growing of it.  It has been grown successfully in Ireland. It suits the soil and climate.  In fact, we can get a better average yield of sugar&mdash;a bigger percentage of sugar&mdash;from Irish-grown beet than from beet grown in most other centres. What is very remarkable as regards the growing of beet in connection with the Norfolk factory, which is owned by Van Rossum, is the result of the experiment they had performed for them by Nature.  The extraordinarily dry summer of 1921 was followed by a very wet season.  Yet the yield of beet and its yield of sugar proved to be practically constant.  Experiments in the North of Scotland have been also found to be successful.  Although one would not expect anything of a sugary or saccharine nature there, on account of the climate, there was quite a respectable yield of 16 per cent. in sugar from the Cromarty beets in Scotland. The point to emphasise is that the growing of sugar beet in Ireland is in the experimental stage in this sense only: Will the farmers take it up and will they make it go?  Will they be sufficiently enlightened to know that here is salvation?</P>

      <P>It would <Col N="593" /> not be the first time in the history of a race that salvation came to it and that it turned its back upon the light and even crucified the reformer.  These things have occurred in history before now.  Ignorance may prevail again and prejudice may prevail again&mdash;the project is in the experimental stage in that sense&mdash;will the farmers take it up?  Can sugar be manufactured from home-grown beet at a profit after paying an adequate price to the grower? That might appear to be experimental. All these experiments, as Deputy Johnson remarked, have been worked out for us in other countries.  The plea that I would make here is that we should not disregard the experience we have ready to hand from Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance mentioned the criticism that was in &ldquo;Irish Truth&rdquo; alleging that the subsidy is excessive.  It speaks here of very handsome profits.  Perhaps, so that I may not be accused of quoting by paraphrase, which is a frequent allegation, I may be permitted to quote from the original.  &ldquo;There has just come into our hands a circular issued by a Dublin financial house which announces the formation of a company to start a beet sugar factory in the Free State &lsquo;under the best Belgian auspices and with a handsome subsidy from the Free State Government,&rsquo; as it naively puts it. Although one of the great recommendations of the Belgian offer was that it was to provide all the capital, it appears that it is now desired to raise one-third of it in Ireland.  Not unnaturally, therefore, the full value and effect of the &lsquo;handsome subsidy&rsquo; has to be set forth.  This is done by enclosing a copy of a letter from M. Lippens, late Governor of the Belgian Congo, Director of the Banque d'Outremer, President and Director of a large Belgian sugar factory.  Let us quote the circular:&mdash;&lsquo;From M. Lippens&rsquo; letter it will be seen that the earnings of the factory, together with the Government subsidy, are expected to be sufficient to amortise the entire capital expenditure in ten years, in addition to the payment of substantial dividends.' &rdquo;  Then the writer puts in, parenthetically (I suppose, knowing his readers' limitations) <Col N="594" /> a note as follows: &ldquo;&lsquo;amortise&rsquo; signifies to redeem, extinguish, or replace.&rdquo; The writer then goes on to say:&mdash;&ldquo;Why should the Free State dip so deep into the taxpayers' pockets in order to enable the Belgian or any other group, not merely to make &lsquo;substantial profits,&rsquo; but also to replace all its capital outlay in ten years?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is quite a number of fallacies involved in these simple sentences. There is one reason why we should dip into the taxpayers' pockets for this, in addition to the reasons which the Minister has already set out.  The trouble in England was at first farmers would not grow beet until they saw the factory in being which would take beet from them.  The capitalist would not set up a factory to extract sugar from the beet until he saw a sufficient number of acres of beet under cultivation.  That meant a deadlock.  I suppose most of us read in the days of what I may call our nursery-rhyme age, about the old woman who found a crooked sixpence and went to the fair to buy a pig. Prices seem to have been different in those days&mdash;she bought a pig and proceeded to drive it home.  The pig, apparently, was the same as pigs now, and refused to budge, so she got a stick, but the stick refused to beat the pig.  Thereupon she invoked in turn various natural agencies.  But some inducement had to be provided.  That was the function of the State and that function is being discharged now through the instrumentality of the Minister for Finance to get over this difficulty.  The difficulty has to be surmounted.  You must secure to the factory, or factories, an adequate supply, and not merely an adequate supply but a continuous supply throughout the hundred days which the Dutch speak of as their sugar campaign.</P>
    <P>All the transforming of beet into sugar is done in one hundred days in one continuous process.  That is why I answered Deputy Johnson when he asked if the production of sugar includes sugar refinery.  There are not two stages in this industry as in the sugar cane process in which you first produce the raw material and then refine it.  In beet sugar it is all one process.  What <Col N="595" /> comes out is fine white sugar.  Molasses and pulp are residues.  If there were a lightning strike, if there were anything that interfered with the continuity of the process in those momentous one hundred days, all the stuff in the factory is wasted, over and done with.  Consequently, a great number of risks have to be incurred, and those who put their money into the setting up of a factory for the installation of costly and special machinery have to have some guarantee. On the other hand, the farmer has to have an inducement, and the important thing to remember is, that in the early years of his work as a sugar beet grower, while he is getting his experience, his yield will not be very considerable, but he must be paid all the same to induce him to put in the crop and persist.  So his pertinacity is bought until the thing has righted itself, until he has become expert to produce the crop in the right way.  So that phrase, &ldquo;dipping into the taxpayers' pocket,&rdquo; insinuated there is something, at least, injudicious in this. What are we doing, after all, in voting Estimates but dipping into the taxpayers' pockets for this, that and the other public service, and giving aids in a variety of ways to different enterprises? Why is this thing, which is, to my mind, to be the salvation of our agricultural State, to be viewed with particular disfavour?</P>
    <P>The difference between M. Lippens and the other tenderer referred to by the Minister for Finance, is not remarkable. The Minister told us that the method by which the Government proceeded was by way of tender, and that there was an inter-departmental committee set up to inquire into the relative merits of the tenders, and also to see the work of sugar beet production in Continental centres.  The Minister has brushed to one side altogether the overtures made by one of the tenders, whose case was expounded in &ldquo;Irish Truth&rdquo; during one or two weeks.  That is the case of the sugar factory plant makers of Czecho-Slovakia.  The Minister spoke of another tenderer, and the Dutch group of Mr. Van Rossum. The further plea I am making <Col N="596" /> now is, that, instead of making an experiment under conditions that will not be wholly and completely scientific and that will not be thorough, since the experiment is obviously worth making, to discover whether farmers could be induced to grow beet in sufficient quantities, and whether the factories can secure beet in sufficient quantities so that a subsidy would no longer be needed, and that the time would come when the Irish industry would be able to stand in competition with the world, at least, as suppliers of sugar to the Irish people.  I suggest that if one alone is set up the experiment will take this form, the farmers in a certain area will supply beet, and they will have all the advantage of the payments guaranteed under the second schedule&mdash;50/- per ton for one year's contract, and 54/- per ton for three years' contract.  If, by any mischance, as I hope will not be the case, anything goes wrong with the experiments there the public will pronounce finally against the industry, and the door is closed for the industry in this State, whereas the failure may be due to local circumstances, to something that is incidental to that particular case.  Furthermore, Deputy Johnson spoke of what I might condense into less elegant phraseology as the bag of loot with which the shareholders, or dividend receivers, would go away after the period of subsidy. It might be possible that when the outlay had become amortised that the company, being foreigners, would quit and leave the thing there in our hands. That would be impossible if there were another firm in another locality in competition.  I would ask the attention of the Minister to that consideration.</P>
    <P>There is an obvious safeguard. Either we perform this experiment or we do not.  I think it would be a terrible mistake not to make the experiment, and if we make it why not make it as every experiment is made, namely, under the most exact conditions, nothing overlooked, every contingency provided for?  What was the proposal made by the other tenderer, and what was his position?  Practically all the pioneer work in England, <Col N="597" /> over and above what was done by the propaganda society of which Mr. Wood is Secretary, was, for all practical purposes, done by the Dutch group.  One of that group was for over 20 years a chief instructor in the State School for sugar production in Holland, and Holland, by the way, has the extraordinary pre-eminence of being the one Free-trade country in the world which has made sugar a success, although preference, tariffs, and subsidies are given in aid of it in other countries.  The Canley factory in Norfolk, is worked by the Van Rossum group.  Struggling through inimical conditions it had to close during the war.  Eventually, when the Coalition Government came to the aid of the industry it got on its feet.  It is now thoroughly successful, so successful that this firm was begged by England to set up other factories.  There are now three factories in England actually in full blast, and there are six others on the stocks.  England has found the experiment very successful, and it is not going to lose any time about profiting from it.  On that topic I might quote what the Minister for Finance said that the history of this country is a history of opportunities not seized.  In effect, we are really like the Royal Carbineers in Offenbach's opera, &ldquo;always too late.&rdquo; England has seized her opportunities. Through the instrumentality of an Irishman, the Van Rossum group were interested in this country, and they made proposals here.  I quite agree that the Minister has given a very accurate account as regards the difference between the three tenders.  But if the experiment is to be properly conducted, we should have at least three factories, one in each of the provinces.  At any rate there is the possibility and the opportunity to have two, because this group does not ask for money.  They propose to put up £400,000.  Three hundred thousand pounds, or thereabouts, represents the installation of the factory, and the rest working capital, the money available to give an inducement to farmers, to pay them in anticipation of the delivery of their crops and so on. <Col N="598" /> An alternative proposal also was to put up £300,000, and if Irishmen like to provide £100,000, then the Government will be provided with founders' shares, on which dividends would be paid when the dividend on the ordinary shares rose to a certain point.  I may be a faddist in this respect, but I may repeat, perhaps, what I took the liberty of saying on a former occasion, not so long ago, that while our expenditure continues to be so high, necessarily high, and the amount of taxation that we dare impose so exceedingly limited, the Government must get busy in earning. The proposal to make the State a joint taker of dividend from an industry that has met with success, and which, in fact, has been made possible by State subsidy, seems to me not merely an interesting but a very practical proposal.  Perhaps, instead of repeating in my words what the offer was, if I were to quote portion of the tender and argument in favour of it, it would make the situation clearer.  It was feared by the Minister for Finance, I understand, and possibly by some of his colleagues, that this company was merely going to exploit Ireland, and to go away with all the money it would acquire in the years of subsidy&mdash;when I branched off a few moments ago to deal with the remark of the Minister for Finance about opportunities not seized, I had begun to sketch what the Van Rossum Company had done in England; how with tremendous persistence and pertinacity it held on in England.  The Company did not let the English people down, and it is not likely to do in Ireland what it has not done there.  What are the likely gains? See how the thing could work for a tenderer of this type.  The Irishman who induced the Dutch group to turn its attention to our country submitted certain figures to the Government.  He gave two calculations, one on the absurd supposition of a yield on production of 100,000 tons of beet&mdash;I say absurd, because it was only in 1924, in the ninth year of the work, that the Company's factory has been able to get 124,000 tons of beet to deal with. It would be very excellent progress if, during the first two years, we could get a district that would provide what <Col N="599" /> would give a yield of 3,000 to 5,000 tons of sugar.  Therefore, I prefer to read out the figures submitted with regard to a smaller production. Some of these figures, of course, would require alteration now, I should say parenthetically, because the price of coal is different, and, furthermore, the duty has been taken off sugar altogether in the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>Yes, delivered, topped and washed at the factory with an addition of 1/7, as in England, for a three-year contract. The fifty thousand tons of beet would require &ldquo;five thousand tons of coal.&rdquo; The Shannon electricity would not, it appears, be available in lieu of coal. The process requires a type of heat that coal produces.  &ldquo;Two thousand, five hundred tons of limestone&rdquo;&mdash;that is also, if I might diverge for a moment, an interesting thing.  Here is an important collateral industry developed.  For the precipitation of the sugar, limestone is necessary, and so limestone quarrying would get its filip too, incidentally.  &ldquo;Unskilled labour, 8,400.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am afraid I forgot to read out those figures as pounds.  &ldquo;Fifty thousand tons at 53/6 per ton, £133,750.  Five thousand tons of coal&rdquo;&mdash;I think coal in this was calculated to be bought in large quantities and delivered in bulk at 37/6 per ton.  At any rate, the total down here is &ldquo;£9,250.&rdquo;&ldquo;Two thousand five hundred tons of limestone, £1,250; unskilled labour, £8,400; skilled labour (which, a note remarks, cannot be seriously reduced) £25,000.&rdquo;  The significance of that note is that this <Col N="600" /> item of skilled labour is put down at £35,000, when there was question of one hundred thousand tons of beet being dealt with.  The skilled labour is. of course, the important item, not merely as regards expenditure, but as regards the whole industry of sugar production, because the expert must be engineer as well as chemist, chemist as well as engineer.  That is the reason why there are always in those countries, where beet sugar is a stable product, technical schools devoted exclusively to the production of experts.  The amount &ldquo;for depreciation&rdquo; is pretty much the same as in the larger estimate, because again it is the same factory and machinery installation awaiting the development which will provide the greater quantity of beet to work with.  &ldquo;Depreciation, £22,500.&rdquo;  That is, of course, on the £300,000 installation.  &ldquo;Stores about £5,000.&rdquo;  These are various chemicals, oils, etc., required in the working of the machinery.  &ldquo;Sundry charges&mdash;which cover a variety of things&mdash;£7,000.  Contingencies, £12,500&rdquo;&mdash;providing for the unforeseen.</P>
      <P>Receipts:&mdash;Out of the fifty thousand tons of beet it was hoped to produce five thousand tons of sugar, i.e., one-tenth. By the way, I note that in the case of inexperienced growers, 7½ tons to the acre with about 15½ per cent. of sugar yield would be the general result, as against 15 tons to the acre with 18 per cent. of sugar yield where experienced growers are in question. The figure here is &ldquo;5,000 tons of sugar at £50 per ton&rdquo;&mdash;that was the price in the market at the time those figures were compiled: 19th January, 1925&mdash;&ldquo;less commission on sales, freight, and bagging, £237,500.  Sale of pulp, £12,500.&rdquo;  The calculation was that in England the farmer would be glad to buy back as much as he would be permitted to buy of the dried pulp, and the price was to be fixed at £5 per ton, or 5/- per cwt.  So the sale of pulp works out in this case at £12,500. &ldquo;Total receipts: £249,000.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total estimated profit during the first five years is here computed as £24,350 per annum, from which has to be deducted income tax&mdash;and of course it was deducted at the rate of <Col N="601" /> 5/- in the £&mdash;leaving a net profit of £18,264 per annum for the first five years.&rdquo;  The figures for the second five years are the same as in the former estimate.  What is meant is that the Van Rossum group propose that after the first five years the subsidy should be reduced per cwt. per year, until practically the subsidy was done away with altogether.  The duty or subsidy would be reduced &ldquo;by 1/- per cwt. in the sixth year; 2/- in the seventh year; 3/- in the eighth year; 4/- in the ninth year and by 5/- in the tenth year.&rdquo;  Therefore, there would be an average net profit on this showing of &ldquo;£38,082 per annum, which might admit of a distribution of 7 per cent. free of tax.&rdquo;  From the investors' point of view, taking into account the uncertainties attached to the establishment of the industry in a country where it has never existed, these estimates do not show a very alluring prospect.  In actual practice it is unlikely that there could be any dividend for the first couple of years. There is bound to be a loss in the first couple of years.  Taking the average at 50,000 tons of beet for the first five years does not mean that 50,000 tons of beets per annum would be secured in each of the first two years.  Moreover, the ordinary investor would take into account the uncertainty of the position at the end of the ten years.  &ldquo;Mr. Van Rossum, nevertheless, is prepared to take these risks because he is convinced that he can establish the industry on a sound basis within ten years.  It should, however, be evident that Mr. Van Rossum does not stand to make any exorbitant profit.  Such profit as he is at all likely to make is hardly commensurate with the risks.&rdquo; I must really ask the indulgence of the Dáil in going into these details.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I interrupt the Deputy to get the figures verified.  Am I right in saying that out of the total cost, according to the Deputy's figures of £226,000, beets cost £133,750?  The balance of costs is about £93,000, of which coal represents about 15 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, so that really the farmer&mdash;the grower&mdash;gets the <Col N="602" /> lion's share of the distribution of the money, £133,750 out of a total expenditure of £224,650.</P>
      <P>My excuse for going into all these details is my profound belief in the enormous national importance of this matter.  The Government are fully aware of that.  They have taken the matter up and produced this Bill.  All that is between us at the present moment is merely whether there should be only one factory in the beginning or more&mdash;all my argument is, so far as I can contrive, centreing around that one point, although I may appear at times to be very far away from it.  The replies of the Government to these offers were communicated to Mr. Van Rossum, and I would like to quote from some of his comments, because they provide a reply to the criticism which seems so plausible, that the Government are giving away money.  This circular that an issuing house has put out, speaks of the handsome allowance and the handsome profit.  Is the Government really being extravagant in the subsidy it is paying?  It is nothing of the kind.  I am going to quote in support of the Government as really exercising a very strict and rigid economy in this enterprise, the comment of the man who is, I may say without exaggeration, the biggest man in the sugar world at the present moment, head of the great sugar factory of Holland, and the man who has organised the sugar industry with success in England.  He says, in reply to my Irish friend who was doing so much to get the advantage for this country of Dutch brains, Dutch experience, Dutch experts and Dutch capital:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I have considered very carefully your letter of the 10th inst., in which you set out the lines upon which the special Departmental Committee are prepared to make a recommendation to the Irish Free State Government for State assistance to establish and work a beet sugar factory in the Irish Free State.  It might be well at the outset to explain that the subsidy proposals announced by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer on July 30th, 1924, in the House of Commons during the unemployment debate, were made after a most searching inquiry <Col N="603" /> into the condition and needs of this infant industry in England at the present stage of its progress&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We hear repeatedly quoted in this House the adage of the old theologian, that circumstances alter cases.  We must always keep circumstances before our mind in these comparisons.  The British subsidy of 1924 is in aid of an industry that had already got on its feet, and that, after the perilous earlier years of infancy, is now quite a sturdy youngster&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In all such State inquiries, involving a charge upon public funds, the principle, as you are aware, is to arrive at the minimum amount of such charge, having regard to the purpose for which it is to be made. The net result is the provision of State assistance considered sufficient from this date onwards.  It would have been absolutely of no value ten years ago, when the industry was started.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a most important consideration that must not be overlooked, that the State subsidy in Great Britain in 1924, accepted as of enormous value and thoroughly satisfactory to the industry in England, would have been no use ten years earlier at the initial stage, and that is the justification of the Minister for Finance.  I mention it in support of the statement he has already made, that the subsidy in this country must be larger than in 1925 and 1926 and so on, as compared with the subsidy in England, because of this special difference between the two countries.  We are beginning, figuratively and literally, from the sod. Mr. Van Rossum goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Even with this proposed assistance the industry in England would not have developed were it not for the fact that those already engaged in it were prepared to extend their existing enterprise and build new factories, drawing thereby from their existing experience and existing organisation.  Even under these proposals, in my opinion, too great a risk is imposed upon any newly-formed group who have to go to the public for their capital and to the <Col N="604" /> continent for their technical assistance. Both in the training of English labour and in the education of the farmer, they must necessarily start almost from the point at which I started in England ten years ago.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a point to which, with your permission, I shall return presently, that the new factories, the other six that I mentioned, must start from scratch, where the Canley factory in Norfolk started ten years ago.  That, here.  The Minister for Finance talks about later on looking round to set up new factories.  He sees in his mind's eye the altered state of things in the district where the further factory is to be set up, whereas it will be the very same situation in which the one present proposed factory will be set up.  I return to the Van Rossum letter: &ldquo;Several new groups, on the strength of the subsidy proposals, have formulated and published particulars of new factory schemes in England.  Within a few weeks they have been abandoned.  This has brought me to the conclusion that only those who have had the experience already secured in England would venture upon an enterprise of this kind, involving so large a capital outlay, except with the courage which is born of ignorance.&rdquo;  That is an anticipatory criticism, I presume, of M. Lippens. &ldquo;The above important considerations prevent my entertaining the responsibility for a beet sugar factory scheme in Ireland unless&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;  Now here are the personal considerations which appeal, to me at any rate as an individual, with enormous force, because I am a firm believer in prestige, and in a man's own sense of the value of reputation, and prestige to him in his trade or profession&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;(a) I felt I could make it succeed.&rdquo;  Surely that is the type of assistance that we should like to have, a man who feels his honour bound up in this enterprise and will not come into it unless he can be assured from the conditions granted to him that he can make it a success&mdash;&ldquo;(b) I ran no risk to my reputation as a Continental beet sugar expert.&rdquo;  He is loath to have his record spoiled by the black mark that he failed in Ireland. <Col N="605" />&ldquo;(c) I offer no more than ordinary business risk to capital drawn from your country or elsewhere, that is to say, it must be free from any taint of what is known as company promotion,&rdquo; and if he had known about what the Minister for Finance has dealt with so ably it would be free also from any attempt to exploit a new country in this, that, or the other, novelty department. &ldquo;(d) There must be no possibility of the Irish farmers being exploited for sugar beet cultivation and finding themselves ultimately let down.&rdquo;  There are two important considerations: That those who put their money into the factories shall not be let down by the farmer, and that the farmer shall not be let down.  These are the guiding considerations in the formation of prices all through his estimates. &ldquo;The following are briefly the matters which make it impossible to effect the purpose we have in view on the same terms as offered in England&rdquo;&mdash;He proceeds to corroborate what the Minister for Finance said in the opening part of his speech: &ldquo;It is quite clear that the work in Ireland as compared with the work in England is &lsquo;prairie&rsquo; pioneer work.  The subject must be examined <i>ab initio</i>, from the technical side, the agricultural side, and from the economic standpoint.  Organisation, working costs, and rates of income from products must be reviewed under entirely new conditions.  This pioneer work will be costly.  In an English factory the manager, the principal chemists, the charge hands at every post, must be foreign; and this must continue for some years.  The labour working under them is English and also semi-trained.  As in England at the beginning, so in Ireland, a much greater proportion than this must be <Col N="606" /> foreign, probably one to every five or six, although their work is applied to the training of unskilled labour acting under their direction.  Irish dilution will be slow as in England.&rdquo;  I see that it is now 10.30, and I will therefore move the adjournment.</P>

That had reference to information that I had of a factory four times the size of this factory, that is, a factory of 20,000 tons.  It also had reference to the ordinary working costs, and had no reference to depreciation.  Where you have a small factory the cost, for instance, of your skilled workers and all these things, is always out of proportion to the whole.
