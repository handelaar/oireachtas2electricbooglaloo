      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS (for Mr. P.J. Egan)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President whether the Executive Council has considered a proposal to participate in the British Industries Fair to be held next February, and, if so, what decision has been reached.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Lands and Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce have considered a proposal that the Irish Free State would participate in the British Industries Fair, 1926.  They made enquiries among producers and manufacturers, and as little or no desire to take part in the Fair was evidenced by them, it is not intended to proceed with the proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>If sufficient would-be exhibitors come forward in time, the Departments of Agriculture and of Industry and Commerce will be very glad to re-consider the position. There is, however, only a very short period of time available now. The Fair, I understand, is to take place about mid-February, and it would take some little time to make the necessary arrangements for the exhibitors.  It would be advisable and necessary, if the matter were to be re-considered, <Col N="1832" /> that information as regards would-be exhibitors should be supplied without delay.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that the duty imposed on empty glass bottles is causing serious difficulties in the Irish ink trade, and, also, if he is aware that Irish ink manufacturers complain that they were unable to obtain Irish-made bottles for six months after the imposition of the duty on imported bottles, and are not yet able to obtain Irish-made bottles in sufficient numbers or at practicable prices.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that District Justice O'Donohue has decided not to hold any more Courts in Listowel for want of accommodation; that the closing of this Court is causing serious inconvenience to many litigants throughout North Kerry, and whether suitable accommodation will be provided as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position at Listowel is, I understand, that the Justice of the District Court has repeatedly stated that he is not satisfied with the accommodation supplied by the County Council, and he has now expressed his unwillingness to sit in Listowel again until better accommodation is provided. I have no doubt that if the Justice ceases to sit at Listowel inconvenience will be caused, but on the other hand, I do not see what his alternative is, if it is his considered opinion that the accommodation is unsuitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has no powers as regards supplying accommodation; all the powers in that matter are vested in the County Council.  I am, however, endeavouring, with the help of the <Col N="1835" /> Minister for Local Government and Public Health, to make some arrangement which will tide over this difficulty until really suitable accommodation has been provided by the rebuilding of the old Courthouse.</P>

      <P>I think it would facilitate an understanding of the Bill, and perhaps would expedite the Second Reading stage if we could have an explanation as to what the purport of it is.

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The necessity for this Bill arises in this way.  The position of certain ex-officials of local authorities who had been dismissed from their employment during the pre-Truce period because of their adherence to the British Government became, after the change of government, the subject of correspondence with the British Government, which resulted in an agreement to appoint Mr. Justice Wylie as arbitrator in the matter of assessing the proper amount of pensions or gratuities to be paid to such officers. Following the awards made by Judge Wylie, steps were taken to have the pensions (or gratuities) paid by the local bodies concerned, but, owing to the refusal of certain of the local bodies to pay the pensions or to recognise in any way the dismissed officials, and following a certain amount of pressure on the part of the British Government, it was decided that the Minister for Finance should be responsible for the payment of the pensions and gratuities, and the necessary legislation was introduced and passed for the purpose of enabling this to be done&mdash;namely, the Local Officers Compensation (War Period) Act, 1924.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1839" /> The passing of the Local Government Act of 1925 raised the point as to whether Section 49 of that Act, which provided for the suspension or abatement of the pensions payable to persons who retired or retire from their employment under any local body in the Saorstát, and who are re-employed, applied to the pensions payable under the Local Officers Compensation (War Period) Act, 1924.  The general view was that Section 49 did not apply, as that section had reference to persons in receipt of a pension &ldquo;from a local body,&rdquo; whereas pensioners under the Local Officers Compensation (War Period) Act, 1924, receive their allowances from the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move for leave to introduce this Bill.  The Bill consists of two minor amendments to the Amalgamation Bill which has been passed, and these arise from the accidental circumstance that the Act which was passed in the early portion of this year was not signed until the 2nd April. Owing to some unforeseen delay in the Seanad, and owing to the seven days' interval before signature, it was not signed until the 2nd April.  Now, without the amendment which this Bill provides, there would be no relief in the coming financial year for the ratepaying body of the Dublin Corporation. The rate would have to be 8d. as usual, and if the graduated reduction of 1d. per year is to commence as from the 31st March next, this amendment will be necessary owing to the accidental circumstance that the Bill lapped over until April, and was only signed on the 2nd April.  I think the State ought not to take advantage of a mere accident of that kind, and, therefore, I am bringing in this amending Bill to fulfil what was the real intention when the original Act was being passed: that is to give relief to the Dublin ratepayers as from the end <Col N="1840" /> of this financial year and commencing in the next financial year.  The other amendment is a small matter dealing with representative bodies: enabling representative bodies to be formed as from the amalgamated force.  At present I think we are dealing with eight or nine different representative bodies, and it is advisable to pass an enabling amendment which would permit representative bodies being formed from the one single force which now exists.</P>

      <P>Before we take up this Order, I would like to make some remarks about the principles of order in general, and some specific directions, perhaps, for the debates that may take place in Committee to-day.  It is my ambition to be able to take up the Official Report of a day's proceedings, and not to find in it any remarks from the Ceann Comhairle.  My ambition was not realised last week, on any day, and I am endeavouring now, since it is my settled policy not to intervene, if it can possibly be helped, to make this intervention do duty for the whole day.</P>
      <P>In discussion on the Second Reading of a Bill a certain latitude is allowed, and on the discussion of a very important measure, such as this is&mdash;a measure which is undoubtedly one of first class importance&mdash;considerable latitude is allowed.  I think Deputies will agree that, last week, very considerable latitude was allowed.</P>
      <P>In Committee, the principle of a Bill having been accepted, the Committee considers the details and machinery&mdash; that is, speaking generally.  On Report, in theory, at any rate, the Dáil is considering what has been done in Committee, and, on the Fifth Stage, the Dáil is considering the Bill, as a whole, and the discussion is confined to what is in the Bill, not to what Deputies would like to have seen in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1841" /> So much for general principles.  Besides that, I would like to define a few things, out of many, which will not be in order in Committee to-day.  I begin with Pontius Pilate; Irish history in general, and the history of the Boundary Question, or what is known as the Partition question in particular; the Boundary Commission; the Boundary Commissioners, including our own Commissioner, will be out of order. The Irish Party will be out of order. Buckingham Place Conference will be out of order; so will the Rising of 1916; the Sinn Fein Party, the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, the Republican Party, the Labour Party, the Farmers' Party, not excluding the Farmers' Union; Group of Independent Deputies, not excluding any Deputy who may or may not be a member of that group.</P>
    <P>It will not be in order to refer to &ldquo;the magnificent achievements of the Executive Council, which deserve the general support of all true Irishmen.&rdquo; It will be equally out of order to refer to &ldquo;the gross ineptitude of the Executive Council, against which all patriotic citizens should revolt,&rdquo; and, last but not least, the Shannon scheme, in all its bearings, with all its works and pomps, will be out of order.</P>

      <P>I move as an amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 1: In line 17 after the word &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;entered into between the Governments of Great Britain and Ireland (the parties to the Treaty of 1921) and subscribed on behalf of the Government of Northern Ireland&rdquo; and before the words &ldquo;Treaty of 1921&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;said.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make it clear and unmistakable that notwithstanding anything that may appear to the contrary, from any interpretation of this Agreement Bill, we do not, as a matter of fact, and do not intend to be taken as entering into Treaty relations with the Six County Government.  The Bill, and more particularly the schedule, refers to a conference, to agreement and goodwill reached as a result of the conference, and to the Articles of Agreement, apparently issuing from that, on behalf of the Six County Government to which the signatories have set their hand.</P>

    <P>It might appear, inasmuch as this is to take effect, when passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, as part and parcel of the original Treaty, that the Six County Government in some measure or to some extent becomes a party to the Treaty.  I have introduced these words to read with Section 1:&mdash; After the word &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;entered into between the Governments of Great Britain and Ireland (the parties to the Treaty of 1921) and subscribed on behalf of the Government of Northern Ireland,&rdquo; and before the words &ldquo;Treaty of 1921&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;said.&rdquo;  That is to say, <Col N="1843" /> the section, as so amended, would read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Agreement set forth in the Schedule to this Act being an Agreement entered into between the Governments of Great Britain and Ireland (the parties to the Treaty of 1921) and subscribed on behalf of the Government of Northern Ireland amending and supplementing the said Treaty of 1921&rdquo;...</P>
    <P>I submit that with these words, whatever ambiguity might exist in the mind of a reader of this Bill would be removed. At any rate, the purpose of the amendment is that it should be clearly set out in the first section of the Bill, as it passes through our Parliament, that the high contracting parties to the Treaty, which for convenience I call Treaty No. 2, are as before the high contracting parties to the original Treaty No. 1, and that while the Northern Government is brought into this and referred to, and actually signs what is set out in this Bill as its Schedule, that that in no way involves an admission on our part that they are parties to the Treaty.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1920, which set up the Northern Government as the Government over a certain area set out in that Act, north of the Border-line, is still effective in so far as it has not been repealed.  Under that Act the Parliament which sits in Belfast is a subordinate Parliament, and the Six-County area over which it is the legislature is a subordinate province under the Imperial Parliament at Westminster.  In 1917 that was precisely the position of what is now known as the Union of South Africa.  It was declared so by General Smuts in a speech at the Imperial Conference of 1917.  Between 1917 and 1920 constitutional developments went on so rapidly as regards the status of Canada that in 1920 the absolute equality of nationhood of all states in the British Commonwealth was declared officially by Lord Milner on behalf of the British Government in these words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The United Kingdom and the Dominions are partner nations, not yet indeed of equal power, but for good and all of equal status.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1844" /> One of the arguments used by Sir Robert Borden, who, as everyone is aware, is the most distinguished of all protagonists in the fight for the recognition of the equal nationhood of Canada, was that the very fact of Canada being called upon to enter into treaty relations at the peace settlement in Paris and subscribing in its own right to the Treaty of Versailles was world-wide recognition of its equal nationhood, its equal status with Great Britain.  Now, what I dread is, rightly or wrongly, that this Agreement will have set in train agencies which will ultimately enable the Six County subordinate province to be declared a dominion.  One of the arguments on behalf of Treaty No. 1 was that the mere fact of Great Britain, the Imperial Government, having entered into Treaty relations with this country, was in itself a recognition of our nationhood, and that whatever we might dislike in this or that particular of the Treaty, at any rate there was that much gained, that much to the good.</P>
    <P>It has been repeatedly stated by publicists who write in the interests of the Six County Government status that it is a State, and not so long ago a leading article in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; referred to it as &ldquo;the youngest of our dominions.&rdquo;  I do not attack the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo;; I regard the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; as one of the finest of our journals, and its leading articles are always able, masterly, and actuated by a spirit of fair play and justice.  But it was the organ of those who opposed the claims of Ireland, and it still retains, and I will say, unmistakably exhibits traces of its former political position.  The claim is made that the Six County Government is a Statelet, and alternately that it is not a Statelet but a full-blown dominion.  If it is a dominion it has equal nationhood and is a co-equal partner, and if that were so, partition in excelsis would have been created.  Whatever may be the view and the hopes of the advocates of Northern Ireland, at any rate it is incumbent upon us to make it clear that while a majority vote carries this Agreement, there is not implied in that, even to the remotest extent, any of the <Col N="1845" /> implications which it is sought to put into it by those who advocate the growth in status of the Six County Government.</P>
    <P>It may be said that my words are unnecessary; it may be alleged that they are not requisite for the purpose I have in view.  At any rate, they are suggested as an amendment in the sincere belief that an explicit declaration as to what is the real relation in this document of the signature on behalf of the Northern Government should be made on our part.  It is in the Schedule, &ldquo;Signed on behalf of the Government of Northern Ireland.&rdquo; That is merely to indicate that though, under the control as a suzerain of the Imperial Parliament at Westminster, they agreed to this in so far as they are affected.  I take it that because they claimed in regard to Article XII. of the original Treaty they were not bound because they were not privy, that now the effort is made, by having their signature subscribed to this document, to bind them.  But it is one thing to bind a subordinate province to an agreement entered into on its behalf by the Government to which it is subordinate, and another thing to argue from the fact of its signature being an element in the document that it has acquired a status that, but for that, it could not lay claim to.  Many people are impressed by the fact that portion of the ratification of this Agreement, part of the process of the ratification, has been the submission of the document to the Parliament in Belfast, that everything that has been done in Westminster has, in effect, been done in Belfast, and the impression may be left in the public mind that the necessity for its being done in Belfast was on all fours with the necessity for its being done in Westminster.  It will allay a great deal of apprehension and it will clarify many minds otherwise disturbed to have it declared here and declared in the other House of the Oireachtas, that we do not regard this Treaty No. 2 as having more than two high contracting parties, those who were the contracting parties to the original Agreement, to wit, Great Britain and Ireland.</P>

      <P>This Agreement <Col N="1846" /> which is set out in the schedule is governed by Clause 6 of that schedule which really disposes of the whole of the case we have just listened to.  Last week we had a considerable amount of English and this week we are getting more.  It is not the extent of the English that exists in an enactment or statute of the Oireachtas, but rather the stuff that is in it, that really counts.  This is really a Treaty between Great Britain and the Irish Free State.  That is made clear in the last clause of the Agreement in the Schedule which provides for the ratification of the Agreement by the British Parliament and the Oireachtas.  There was a reason, an excellent reason, for having the Treaty signed on behalf of Northern Ireland, because Northern Ireland was affected, but the Parliament of Northern Ireland was not set out in the instrument as one of the parties to the Agreement which would require to pass legislation.</P>
      <P>As far as the dominion question is concerned, it is expressly provided by the Treaty of 1921 that the provisions of the Government of Ireland Act would continue to apply to Northern Ireland.  These provisions have not been altered except in relation to the Council of Ireland, and it is quite clear, I think, on the face of it, that Northern Ireland is not a dominion.  Dominions do not send representatives to the British Parliament.  Northern Ireland does.  I think that is a sufficient answer and these are the objections which I register as far as this amendment is concerned.</P>

      <P>The President has not justified the insertion of the signatures of Sir James Craig on behalf of Northern Ireland, and Charles H. Blackmore, Secretary to the Cabinet of Northern Ireland, on behalf of Northern Ireland.  If it were an agreement only and, on the face of it, between the Government of the Irish Free State and the Government of Great Britain, then on the face of it there would be no necessity for these third signatures.  It will be noted that the Agreement was signed on behalf of the British Government, on behalf of the Government of the Irish Free State, and on behalf of the Government of Northern Ireland, each treated on an <Col N="1847" /> equality so far as the signature goes, it not being apparent that the signatures of the representatives of the Northern Ireland Government are associated with either the British Government or the Irish Free State Government. If it could be said that the signature on behalf of the British Government was five British Ministers and Sir James Craig, that could be understood, or if it was said that the signature was on behalf of the Government of the Irish Free State, treating the Irish Free State as Ireland, as the Treaty expressly provided for, and that Sir James Craig was speaking on behalf of Ireland in association with the Ministers of the Free State, that could be understood, but I am not yet able to understand why the three groups of signatures should apply, and I agree that there is a danger that it may be misinterpreted in the future.</P>
      <P>I am supported in that view by a recent statement of the Premier of Northern Ireland.  He said that the two States were by this Agreement co-equal so far as all the services were concerned.  A statement of that kind may not have any legal effect, but, nevertheless, it indicates a state of mind, and if that is the view of the Premier of Northern Ireland it would be well if we inserted in the Bill some provision which would ensure that in our view at any rate the Agreement that is referred to is an agreement between the Governments of Great Britain and of Ireland, the parties to the original Treaty.</P>
      <P>I take the view that Ministers are not thinking very seriously of the constitutional position and that they entered upon this Agreement and upon the method of confirming the Agreement without sufficient regard to the constitutional implications.  I think this amendment of Deputy Magennis would, at least, be one effort made to safeguard the constitutional position of the Free State.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it would clarify matters if the President would be willing to answer now the same question which I asked him on the Second Reading&mdash;it would clarify matters in connection with this amendment <Col N="1848" />&mdash;as to whether it is the intention of the Executive Council to register this Agreement at the League of Nations, and if so, how this Agreement is to be described, whether it is to be described as an Agreement as between Great Britain and Ireland, as the former Treaty was, or by what other title it will be described.  The President is doubtless aware that the State has formally undertaken and promised to register all its international agreements and engagements of every kind at the League of Nations.  Furthermore, it has agreed that any international engagement which is not so registered shall not be binding.  If this agreement is not registered, we will be faced by the curious situation that the Government, by accepting the covenants of the League of Nations, has bound itself to the previous Treaty but has declared that the subsequent amending Treaty is not binding.  If the President would answer the question I put him during the previous debate, it would clear matters in connection with this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am glad the President has brought out clearly what is in the mind of the Executive Council by referring to Article 6 of the Schedule.  As a matter of fact, the marginal note that I have made on Section 6 of the Schedule is my amendment. I am quite alive to the fact that Article 6 declares that this Agreement is subject to confirmation by the British Parliament and by the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State, but let us not forget that it was, likewise, confirmed by the Northern Parliament, and furthermore the signatures following the date&mdash;&ldquo;the 3rd day of December, 1925&rdquo;&mdash;are set out as if on an equality.  The only objection, therefore, to my amendment is that it dots the i's and crosses the t's, for the purposes of our nationals, of all that is signified by Article 6 of the Schedule.  The important thing is <Col N="1849" /> that the Schedule is common to the ratifying documents or instruments of the other two Parliaments, whereas, as I conceive, this portion to which I am moving my amendment is our expression. To me, it seems not merely desirable but most advisable to utilise this portion to express our mind in unmistakable language with regard to what is the character of the new Treaty&mdash;that this is an amendment of the original Treaty and that the parties thereto are the original parties; notwithstanding the introduction of a third Government signature, that that signature is merely subscribed so as to make the Government in question bound by whatever refers to it in the instrument.  If, however, the House is satisfied to have it recorded in the official transactions of the Dáil that the President has declared that the meaning&mdash;I take it that is the only possible meaning of Section 6&mdash;is that the Agreement is subject to confirmation by the British Parliament and by <Col N="1850" /> the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State and not subject to confirmation by any other, then, of course, I should be merely arguing for what others would call a surplusage of words.  But I am not quite sure yet that the President would say that the formula here&mdash;&ldquo;This Agreement is subject to confirmation by the British Parliament and by the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State&rdquo;&mdash;carries with it the meaning that it is not subject to confirmation by any other Parliament or any other State.  The value that I claim for the amendment is that it sets out distinctly that the reason why the confirmation requisite is merely the confirmation of those two Powers is because they alone are the contracting parties and that the other party merely subscribes in its subordinate capacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know to what extent the ruling that you have given would prevent a discussion on the merits of the schedule, but I would point out that the schedule itself creates, as between the Twenty-six Counties constituting the Free State, and the Six Counties constituting Northern Ireland, a severance greater than the severance as between Ireland and Great Britain.  There are in the House men, if not women, who have declared themselves in the past separatists, who advocated independence, who applauded the phrase which is attributed to Parnell about severing the last link which bound Ireland to the British Empire.  The Treaty of which this is intended to be an amendment arrived at certain relationships between Ireland and the British Empire, but this Agreement severs, in a way which the Treaty of 1921 does not, any connecting link between the Free State and the Six Northern counties.  You have the clean cut that the separatists preached and advocated, brought into operation, not as between Great Britain and Ireland but as between six and twenty-six counties out of Ireland's thirty-two.  There is not left even a symbol of unity or of union between the Six Counties and the rest of Ireland.  There is not a judge or a court of justice left as a link, unless, forsooth, it is to be said that the judicial committee of the Privy Council is now the bond of union, or is it to be said that the bond of union is the King?  If that is said, then the symbol of unity as between the Six Counties and the Twenty-six Counties is only the same as that between the Twenty-six Counties and Australia, or South Africa, or India.  There is no other bond of union.  You have, as I say, a severance cleaner than any separatist ever thought likely to come in his lifetime between Ireland and Great Britain, but that severance, that cut, is between Ireland and six of its counties.  Between the people of the Twenty-six Counties and the people of the Six Counties, if this Agreement becomes <Col N="1852" /> law, as no doubt it will, there will be no political union.  The last link will have been severed, and I wonder whether the separatists who may be here are pleased with the operation. This is the outcome of their separatist propaganda.  This is the outcome of the demand for a separate and independent Republic.  It is well that we should understand what is the effect of the passing of this section of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am taking this opportunity to draw attention to the facts that are revealed by any proper examination of the situation.  You had in the Treaty a certain position arrived at, which did not sever the Northern counties from the twenty-six counties. The President said on Thursday that in certain eventualities the Treaty provided for partition, the severance, the clean cut.  I deny that and I would ask any member on the Government benches to tell us what they think would have been the position in the Dáil of 1921-22 had the position, that they now say was embodied in the Treaty, been revealed to the men and women who then were discussing the acceptance or rejection of the Treaty. Had it been revealed that, in certain circumstances which were implicit in the Treaty, the clean cut was involved we would have had no Treaty. There was, of course, the provision of Article XII. which provided for a Boundary Commission, and there was a second provision which provided for the continuance of one of the provisions of the 1920 Act, that is, the Council of Ireland.  This was the second barrier against partition, and against the clean cut, but now we are told that there was implicit in the Treaty, in certain eventualities, the complete severance of the six counties, eventualities which were not unexpected, which were threatened and avowed on the part of the Northern Government.  We were told quite clearly and explicitly by Sir Edward Carson, as well as by others, that in one hour after the Treaty had become ratified the Northern Government would decide to opt out.  That was said before there was any ratification or approval of the Treaty.  Yet we <Col N="1853" /> are calmly told by the President, with an audacity which I never expected to hear anywhere, that there was implicit in the Treaty, in certain eventualities, complete and absolute severance. Had either the Dáil or the people at that time been told by those who were proposing and supporting as well as by those who were condemning, the Treaty, that there was implicit in the Treaty this complete and absolute severance, there is not a single member of the Dáil would dare to say that the Treaty would have had a majority of votes in January, 1922.</P>
    <P>The separatists in the House will, however, understand now that they are separating the Six Counties from the Irish Free State clearly and absolutely, in a way far more direct and definite, far more nearly absolute, than is the position of Ireland or the Free State as compared with Great Britain. It is said, of course, that ultimate unity is more likely to be achieved by the provisions and working out of this Agreement.  I will not risk your displeasure, sir, by arguing that point, but I would say that that was the argument of those who said that Ireland and Great Britain would, by virtue of their ordinary commercial and social communications, be bound to be one political unit, and that they would inevitably come together as one political unit.  The question of nationality and national life was not supposed to enter into it.</P>
    <P>The implications of this section approving of this Treaty are that all the denials of the two-nations theory, which are contained in the Government's handbook on the Ulster question, were so much fudge, that there is there admittedly now existing in this island two nations which ought not to be brought into one political unity, or ought not remain one political unit. but that, so far as this Agreement will secure it, so far as it can be secured by political action of this Dáil, the severance is going to be complete and we are to trust to the chances of social and commercial associations to bring about political unity.  How any advocate of Irish independence can argue that way in respect of Ireland when they deny it in respect of England <Col N="1854" /> and Ireland I cannot understand. However, it is all embodied in this Section 1, which the House is asked by the Minister to approve.</P>
    <P>Hopes have been expressed by Ministers of the North that Ireland will be united, and the symbol of unity is to be the Union Jack, and the not-an-inch policy, of course, will find its expression in that very resolutely and very definitely.  The assurances of goodwill and concord, of course, will be given due value, but we must not forget the avowal of Sir James Craig that there was no necessity for any such protestation on his part, that, so far as the Nationalist and Catholic population of the North is concerned, they have had equal and fair treatment, and he really puts his position quite clearly when he says that it is of vast importance that the Free State Government was desirous of working in more harmonious relationship with the North.  It is the Free State Government that is showing its desire now to work more harmoniously with the North. If there is not any promise of any more harmonious working from that side, the blame and responsibility rest with the Free State Government.  That may, or may not, be true.  It really does not matter on whose shoulders lies the responsibility for the absence of harmonious working in the past.  We do know that there has been a clearly expressed determination on the past of the Northern Government that they would not come under the jurisdiction of an Irish Parliament, that they would not allow their people to be ruled by any Parliament for the whole of Ireland, and their demand for the recognition of Ulster's &ldquo;nationality,&rdquo; for the severance from the control of Ireland. The acceptance by the people of Ireland of that policy of renunciation of Ireland is now being confirmed by this State and this Parliament.  I hope the separatists, the Irish Nationalists, those who always thought and taught that Ireland was a nation and that Ireland should be a united people with a united Government, with a single political authority covering the whole country, are pleased with the work which is being done in their name.</P>

      <P>Those of us who oppose this measure are described by the Press and by supporters of the Government as disruptionists.  Let us examine the so-called amending of the Treaty, that is spoken of in Section 1 as amending and supplementing the Treaty of 1921.  How many of those who support this have adverted to the fact that Article 1 of the Treaty is cancelled?  It is stated in the Schedule, which is covered by this Section 1, that Article XII. is revoked as regards certain things, and that Article V. is no longer obligatory on the Free State. There is no mention whatever of the effect of the Agreement on Article I. It reads: &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;not the Irish Free State, not the Twenty-six Counties, not any other designation whatsoever, but &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;shall have the same constitutional status in the Community of Nations, etc., with a Parliament having powers to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of Ireland.&rdquo;  What becomes of that provision of the Treaty? Ireland we contended, and at that time we were all one, had as its value as a designation reference to the geographical and historic entity, not the 26 Counties but the entire of Ireland, and all the area and all the people within the four seas of Ireland.  Ireland has no other meaning and could have no other meaning.  It was never until now contended that it had another meaning.</P>
      <P>The moment this becomes an Act will there be the possibility of the provision of a Parliament for all Ireland? On the contrary, we shall have the Irish Free State no longer a synonym for Ireland as described here.  The Irish Free State would be the proper cognomen of the 26 Counties, and no more.  The last clause of Section 1 of the Treaty is the following declaration of:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A Parliament having powers to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Ireland, and an Executive responsible to that Parliament, and shall be styled and known as the Irish Free State.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hereafter Ireland shall not be styled and known as the Free State.  That <Col N="1856" /> would be to contradict Treaty No. 2&mdash;&ldquo;hereafter styled the Irish free State&rdquo; shall be applicable exclusively to the 26 Counties.  You will have divided Ireland by this Agreement, and that entity which we have always declared one and indivisible is now by our own act severed into two.  Why is it not stated exactly and explicitly in this document that the Agreement specified in Section 1 carried with it a revocation of Article 1?  The original Treaty is eviscerated of most of what was valuable in it.  I, therefore, say deliberately and advisedly that in so much as, and in so far as, it is not stated that Article 1 of the Treaty is hereby revoked the document is a fraudulent document.</P>

I think it was on the point which Deputy Professor Magennis has been referring to, and I had hoped that possibly my amendment, which I did not know was not in order, would be acceptable to the President.  It is for that reason I put down the amendment, as I had concluded that apparently it was not the intention of this Agreement to modify the provisions of Article I. of the Treaty.  With a lack of knowledge as to the reason why my amendment is out of order, I am not at liberty to discuss the matter, except to point out that if it is true that this Agreement does modify Article I. of the Treaty, then it is high time that this Assembly changed its name.  Surely the title Dáil Eireann is no longer applicable to this Assembly if the provisions to Article I. of the original Treaty have been modified by this Agreement?  It was for that reason I hoped that the President would be willing to accept some such amendment as that I put down.</P>

      <P>I was just thinking, when listening to the statements <Col N="1857" /> we have listened to, how this country would progress with an Executive Council staggering under the wisdom of the three expounders we have just had of this particular first Article. Taking them in the order in which they spoke, Deputy Johnson taunted people who undertook a great personal risk at a great sacrifice of time and with a wonderful exhibition of patriotism, so as to do something useful for the country.  They worked hard and they got little for it, and now, having failed perhaps to achieve the summit of their ambition, they are taunted by a person who, while his sympathy was with them, certainly never bore the brunt and the heat of the day when the contest was taking place.  As for the wordy Professor who has just spoken, I was just wondering how many sleepless nights he passed during this great struggle and what contribution he gave towards making the thing possible. And then he can come down here and state that this document is a fraudulent document.  What is there fraudulent in it, except what he seeks to impose or to make appear fraudulent? Is it an honest man who stands up here and says that Article I. of the Treaty is not to be read in conjunction with Article XII.?  Is it an honest man who states that the Treaty, as it was signed, had not in it the implications that are here in this Treaty No. 2&mdash;when it was well known to him when he was accepting it that if the Northern Government opted out neither he nor ten million like him could alter the partition of this country?  No ten million Magennises piled on top of one another, with all the resources of their wordy warfare at their back, would have altered by one inch the Boundary that was to be drawn between the Twenty-six Counties and the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing that has run through this debate, that is evidenced now at this stage, is the effort to make bad blood now between Dáil Eireann and the Parliament of Northern Ireland for the first time&mdash;for the first time nakedly and unashamedly.  Having failed to get any support outside they say: &ldquo;We will antagonise the Northern Parliament; we will make this Agreement and this union and this amity impossible.&rdquo;<Col N="1858" /> Dáil Eireann is not the name of this Assembly! That is very new. The Irish Free State is a term of opprobrium&mdash;it is not Ireland! All the speeches that the three Deputies could make from this until the day of Judgment, if each of them lived to be as old as Methuselah, would not affect the name of this Assembly, the name of the Irish Free State or the name &ldquo;Ireland.&rdquo; If they want any lesson from Irish history I can tell them that there was a stronger Pale in this country than the present Pale of the Six Counties&mdash; a Pale which history has wiped out&mdash;and the speeches we have just listened to are not going to conduce to the unity of the country.  When listening to them I was imagining whether they were three judges sitting in judgment upon the people who endeavoured to make this country free, united and prosperous&mdash;the three judges, the three wise men, whose efforts were not perhaps as great as those they are criticising to make it better than it is.</P>
    <P>Do we not regret that there is partition in this country?  We do, and we have the courage to say that if there is anybody to draw a line we are prepared to draw it; we are not going to shelter behind other people who are drawing it; we are not going to say: &ldquo;No, we will not draw it; it will never be said to us that we drew a line; we will not be the people who will fix a Boundary, or to show that the people were powerless to prevent its being done.&rdquo;  I can imagine Deputies Johnson, Magennis and Esmonde shouldering machine guns to prevent their country being partitioned.  Their brains have not prevented it, their valour will not prevent it; their military genius will not prevent it.</P>

If a Deputy is elected and exercises his right to make a contribution to anything that is under consideration in this House, he certainly ought not to be insulted.

      <P>I did not think that a discussion on partition, in all its bearings, would have been in order.  The President has returned to the question which seems to be the great stock-in-trade of all the defenders of the Agreement: what is your alternative?  All the Ministers spoke of the Feetham Commission only as from the moment at which its report was expected but there was a time here in the Dáil when the Executive Council were aware of what was coming, when, according to their conception of it, it was a menace to the peace of the <Col N="1861" /> State when&mdash;as the Minister for Finance, who always speaks candidly and honestly what is in his mind&mdash;said their interpretation of the situation was that it was a menace.  What did the Executive Council do then?  They are trying to get away with this with the people by bluster and stage thunder. Such thunder does not frighten us from doing our duty here.  They came here not in sackcloth and ashes, as they should have come, nor in the white robes of the penitent, but with something of the penitential spirit. They declared there was a critical situation and they asked for our patience and forebearance in criticism so that they might have ample time to determine a policy.</P>
      <P>Probably everyone is aware we have a parallel to that situation at the present moment in France.  There is a financial crisis in France which threatens the stability of the State in precisely the same fashion, it is alleged, the Feetham report threatened our stability. How does French patriotism propose to meet that difficulty?  By precisely the same agency that when suggested in this House, meets with nothing but jibes, jeers and personal imputations.  &ldquo;Le Matin,&rdquo; which is one of the four independent Paris newspapers, devoted two columns of its front page to a proposal for a union sacre, for a Coalition Government to meet the emergency. Deputies may laugh, but why do they laugh?  Because in their hearts they know that the country was not menaced in this way and that the menace, if it were at all in any proportion, is simply amplified by the terrors of certain Executive Ministers beyond its due proportion into colossal dimensions.</P>
      <P>Here is what &ldquo;Le Matin&rdquo; says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The economic difficulties which we are now encountering, the crisis of lack of will-power&mdash;the almost complete breakdown of the French spirit, are they to be allowed to lead us to the abyss which we can already see ahead? ...  Are we to witness that lamentable spectacle of France vanquished by herself, stricken down by that sleeping sickness, which has for its name politics? Enough of politics.  The country is <Col N="1862" /> sick of them.  It does not wish to plunge into adventures&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I repeat that because it is an essential part of our case also&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Disaster is in sight ...  The situation is mingled tragedy and comedy&mdash;tragedy on account of its consequences and comedy by its pettiness.  Imagine giants trembling when they are threatened by nothing at all.  There is nothing wrong except that the nation is being badly led by those who sought the honour of defending it ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What did the Government do?  Did it hold a secret session and did it call into conference representatives of the various groups in the House?  No.</P>

      <P>I am speaking of the period anterior to this debacle.  After all if Irishmen meet in conference is it more shameful than a conference between another type of inhabitant of the country and the Executive Council?  Those who live in glasshouses ought be very slow to throw stones.  There was an alternative policy, namely, to act constitutionally, to keep faith with the Dáil. The Dáil honourably and patiently gave the time it was asked for.  Deputy Johnson asked how long and the answer was an indefinite time.  How was that truce, as I might call it, utilised by the Executive Council? They go over and enter into this compact of surrender.  After that it is useless for the President to ask, what is our alternative.  The case is prejudiced. Are we therefore to be silent? Are we to say nothing?  Are we not to speak our honest convictions with regard to what the Government did and what we foresee is the consequence of what it has done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President wishes us to subscribe to this extraordinary kind of Ireland that began to be and received services from her sons in 1916.  No one who lived before that time served Ireland in any way and there is no way of serving Ireland except by way of military service of some form.  It is not the first item of the new gospel that has been vouchsafed us by the prophet of the front bench.  I say and it has not been <Col N="1863" /> met by argument that the manifest and undeniable effect of this Agreement on Article I. is to make the term &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; no longer applicable to the entire island, but to confine it to the Twenty-six Counties.  No unifying bond is left, no germ that might grow into a means of unification.  That, as we shall see later, is done away with in Section 1 of the Schedule.</P>
    <P>I challenge the President to leave aside this vapouring method of his and come down to the lower level of common sense and plain argument and deal with arguments.  Here is language that never was questioned until now: Ireland shall have the same constitutional status in the Community of Nations known as the British Empire as the Dominions, with a Parliament having powers to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Ireland. Does it say &ldquo;with a Parliament having power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of whatever portion of the area Ireland shall hereafter remain after a bargain affecting it had been entered into&rdquo;? There is no such language there.  The President is thinking of Article II. of the Treaty, which says &ldquo;subject to the provisions hereinafter set out.&rdquo;  One of the conditions hereinafter set out that modifies Article II. of the Treaty is Article XII.  There is no such overriding condition or reservation with regard to Article I. Article I. is an absolute declaration that Ireland is the Free State and the Free State is Ireland; that Ireland shall have a Parliament with powers to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Ireland.  Not only that, but a responsible Government with the Executive responsible to that Parliament.  Not a Parliament of the Twenty-six Counties, but a Parliament of Ireland.  Will the President deal with that instead of this repartee which belongs to other spheres than a deliberative assembly?</P>

Most of what I know of the Irish national movement was derived from the separatists.  The President thinks, as I said before, that it is not beneath his dignity to use the language of the fish market rather than the language of a deliberative assembly in dealing with me.  I have no reason to be ashamed, though I have no special need to be proud of any part I took in the work of the Irish national movement after or before 1916.  But it was not beneath the dignity of the President's colleagues of that time to approach me on many occasions asking me to do what I could with the organisation in which I had some authority to assist in that work.</P>

      <P>And it is not for the President, considering the people who are supporting him in this movement, to throw stones at me because of my inaction with the gun.  I was never a member of a military organisation and I am not claiming any credit due to members of a military organisation.  I do not claim any credit at all except for having done work for the Labour movement of which the President's colleagues were very glad to take advantage.  If there were any risks in doing that I took the risks.  I have no particular reason for being proud of it.  I certainly am not ashamed of it.  The President might well have thought that the cause that he is endeavouring to serve would be better served if he had adopted an entirely different tone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1865" /> Now the President has reiterated the case that there was, implicit in the Treaty, and in the Constitution, in certain eventualities, absolute partition. Will he deny that there was more in Article XII. and the consequential Articles than the area of administration or the area of authority, either of the Northern Government or of the Free State Government?  It may be said that there is partition between Cork and Kerry, or between any other two counties in the country because they are different administrative areas.  It may be said that there is partition between the provinces of Canada.  But there is also a unifying authority.  There is the Federal Authority governing the whole country, and, while there may be partition for many services, there is, at least, a single unifying authority in respect of others, and, therefore, partition is not absolute.  Under the Treaty and under the Constitution there was reserved to Ireland a single authority.  There was some kind of union retained, and all the Boundary Commissions in the world would not alter that.</P>
    <P>You have talked about the Council of Ireland as being something that you would throw overboard in any case.  If you are prepared to cut six or four counties or any portion of Ireland&mdash;if you are prepared to cut them away, then you are entitled to say that the Council of Ireland is useless.  The Council of Ireland, at least, retained authority as an all-Ireland institution in respect not merely of railways, that very important function, but in respect of Private Bill legislation.  It retained a single authority, and whatever was faulty in its mechanism, it undoubtedly maintained not merely the symbol but the machinery of unity.  That was contained in the Treaty, and the very fact that it was there was used as a refutation of those who alleged that the Treaty brought about partition. It is this overthrowing, this renunciation of that section of the Treaty, in addition to the other section of the Treaty which deals with the Boundary, that is the final and clean cut, and I say it is creating a position for which you will look in vain for support <Col N="1866" /> in any writings and speeches of any advocates of Irish independence, self-government, Home Rule, or even in the Council Bill.  You will look in vain in any such writings or speeches for any proposition of that kind which signified a clean cut.  It is the proposition only of those who were against anything in the nature of self-government for Ireland.  It is the proposition of those who were absolutely opposed to Home Rule in any of its phases.  It is the proposition of those who put it forward because they believed that Irish feeling was so absolutely and so intensely opposed to it, that the very insertion of such a proposal would destroy the prospects of Home Rule.  And we have it at the behests and proposal of a Government that came into power and authority on the wave of a demand for independence.</P>

      <P>Before any other speeches are contributed to this debate, Deputies might regard anything approaching a personal nature as being definitely precluded. Any Deputy who may be deemed to have a grievance has been given an opportunity to speak.

The arguments themselves should be dealt with and there should be no dealing with personalities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Treaty in its first Article unquestionably establishes the Irish Free State as a single political entity embracing all Ireland.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Ireland shall have the same constitutional status in the community of nations known as the British Empire as the Dominion of Canada ... with a Parliament having powers to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Ireland and an Executive responsible to that Parliament, and shall be styled and known as the Irish Free State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The next relevant Article of the Treaty is Article XI., which provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Until the expiration of one <Col N="1867" /> month from the passing of the Act of Parliament for the ratification of this instrument, the powers of the Parliament and the Government of the Irish Free State shall not be exercisable as respects Northern Ireland; and the provisions of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, shall, so far as they relate to Northern Ireland, remain of full force and effect ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They shall not be exercisable as respects Northern Ireland.  I invite, in passing, the attention of Deputies to the exact words used in that Article concerning the powers of the Government and the Parliament of the Irish Free State&mdash;&ldquo;shall not be exercisable as respects Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  There is no question of their existence. The very wording seems to imply their existence.  It does not say that they shall not exist over, or shall not extend to, the area defined by the Act of 1920 as Northern Ireland, but merely that they shall not be exercisable. There is, therefore, so to speak, an artificial suspension or paralysis of the powers of the Government and Parliament of the Irish Free State over a particular area, pending certain decisions to be taken by the Government which was in existence in that year and which had been in existence during the year prior to the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Article XI., therefore, gives us the suspension or paralysis of the powers of the National Government and Parliament over a particular area.  During the time over which that suspension took place, a decision, a very important decision, fell to be taken by the Government which existed within that area.  The decision lay as between Articles XII. and XIV. of the Treaty. Under Article XIV. it was open to the Government of the area defined by the Act of 1920 as Northern Ireland to retain intact the Six-County area of jurisdiction, to retain the substantial powers of local autonomy conferred by the 1920 Act, to remain within the political system of the Irish Free State and to accept the same relationship with the National Parliament that was about to be established here as had <Col N="1868" /> previously existed with Westminster.</P>
    <P>It is, I suggest, unfortunate that, in or about the time that decision was about to be taken, conditions here were not calculated to induce a decision in favour of unity, in favour of remaining within the political system of the Irish Free State.  I do put it to Deputies that if a section of our countrymen had sat down in grave council to consider how best they could deter the Government of the area known as Northern Ireland from taking the road of political unity rather than the road of secession, they could not have sketched out a programme better calculated to promote that end than the programme which, in fact, to the tune of many patriotic slogans, they enacted and carried out in the early months of 1922.  The President put it vividly and picturesquely the other evening when he said that the invitation to the North was to come in and warm their hands at the fires of Mr. de Valera's kindling.  One by one every inducement, or possible inducement, to take the road of Article XIV., the road of political unity, rather than the road of secession as set out by Article XII., was sedulously sought out and smashed.  There was not, at the time that that decision fell to be taken, security of life or property within the 26-county area.  Taxes were soaring and bade fair to soar further as a result of the material damage that was occurring, and, generally, those elements of stability and security which civilised man is rather prejudiced in favour of were lacking when the choice fell to be made between Articles XII. and XIV.</P>
    <P>The road of Article XIV., the road of political unity was not taken.  Instead, there was taken the road of Article XII., which provides&mdash;and again I would direct that special attention be given to the words&mdash;the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>If, before the expiration of the said month, an address is presented to His Majesty by both Houses of the Parliament of Northern Ireland to that effect the powers of the Parliament and the Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland and the <Col N="1869" /> provisions of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, shall&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>With regard to the parenthesis, the reference there is to the Council of Ireland.  I am not forgetting the parenthesis.  The Council of Ireland, as contemplated by the Act of 1920&mdash;assuming that Act had come into force and operation throughout the country&mdash;was a real piece of machinery, and, no doubt, in this measure, and in the measure of the Act of which it formed part, a valuable piece of machinery.  There, at any rate, you would have had a Council constituted of an equal number of representatives from both areas administering certain services throughout the entire country, throughout the twenty-six county area and the six-county area, those services being of a nature common to the entire country. But under the Treaty this truncated lopsided survival of the Council of Ireland, as envisaged by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, was, as the Deputy correctly remarked, rather more of an irritant than a useful piece of legislative or administrative machinery.</P>

I should not have been corrected if, in fact, the Deputy had accepted the term as a correct description of his outlook on this particular piece of machinery.  Now he says that as well as being an irritant it was a useful thing to form part of the bargaining&mdash;to form part of and to figure in the result of negotiations, and in face of that point of view it is rather difficult to understand where exactly the Deputy's grievance is.  This gem of his has been used precisely as he himself suggested it ought to be used&mdash;as part of the bargaining and figuring in. The Deputy has had his wish; it is figured in in the negotiation embodied in this Agreement.  You have the Deputy's Council of Ireland figured as the Deputy would have it figured.  I think that the Deputy did well to accept the description of the Council of Ireland as an irritant and to make the term his own.  In fact, it was so and would be so.</P>

      <P>Twenty representatives from this State going to meet twenty representatives from Northern Ireland to consider the administration of certain services. Where?  Common to the entire country?  No, no!  Within Northern Ireland, and anything more calculated to breed friction, stubbornness, bad blood and ill-will between two peoples <Col N="1872" /> could not be devised or designed.  It was an irritant, and because, as I suggest, we are moving away from the frame of mind when things have any value as irritants, we parted with the Council of Ireland without a sigh, but not simpliciter: not without substituting some provision for contact on services which undoubtedly, whether administered in this area or that, might have reactions throughout the entire country.</P>
      <P>There is substituted for this irritant of the Council of Ireland a provision that the Governments of the Irish Free State and of Northern Ireland &ldquo;shall meet together as and when necessary for the purpose of considering matters of common interest arising out of or connected with the exercise and administration of the said powers.&rdquo;  I do put it to the Deputy as something to reflect on, whether that conception there of the Minister for Industry and Commerce meeting, I think it is, Mr. Andrews of the Northern Government, the Minister for Lands and Agriculture meeting Mr. Archdale of the Northern Government is not a wiser, a saner, a more constructive and a more healing solution than the irritant of the Council of Ireland: whether, in fact, business, real business, is not more likely to be done between Ministers meeting in that way, in friendly contact, than between twenty tough men of ours meeting twenty of theirs to carry on a wrangle about services lying wholly within their area.</P>

    <P>I am sorry that to any degree I have <Col N="1873" /> treated Deputies to something approaching a repetition of the Second Reading debate on this Bill, which was very full, but points were raised and urged again with renewed vigour as if they had not been disposed of effectively and satisfactorily on Second Reading.  I simply want to put that definitely, that it is untrue to say that hic et nunc we are perpetrating partition and becoming the fathers of a partition which was there before.  Anyone reading and contrasting Articles XI. and XII. of the Treaty will see that whereas in one you have a suspension of powers, in the other you have a definite and explicit statement that these powers shall no longer extend to a particular area of this country if a certain choice were made, and as to the Council of Ireland, this magic link, this symbol, this germ that might grow into a means of unification, I consider that in removing it we have removed an obstacle to that goodwill which can alone bring unity, and that we have substituted for it a saner, a wiser, a more constructive and a more healing provision than ever that irritating Council of Ireland, as envisaged by the Treaty provision, could have been.</P>

      <P>We have had them here.  I cannot recall the exact words, but if you go back to the speeches made last week you will find plenty of them there.  It is suggested that this clause should be set aside, which <Col N="1874" /> is, practically speaking, suggesting that the whole Bill should be set aside. Very well.  Let the suggestion be made that the Bill be set aside, but let Deputies who say these things point out to the House how we are to face the new situation which would then arise.  Let them tell us some of the one or two things that we can do, and let them point out the course we can take.  Two things must happen if this scheme is not ratified.  One is we will have the threatened Feetham report, and, as to the other alternative, are Deputies Johnson and Magennis prepared for that situation?  Are they prepared to tell us that there are one or two courses open to the people of the country?  Will either of these Deputies say &ldquo;I propose to point out the particular way and I propose to show you how the position can be faced&rdquo;?  Are they prepared to tell us that there is a way out?  I think it is the duty of every Deputy to ask Deputy Magennis and Deputy Johnson to take us into their confidence, and tell us what they have in their minds, and what their alternative way out is. I can promise them from these benches, at any rate, that if they do that their proposals will get due consideration. I think it is our due, and our right, to be told these things.  I would like either Deputy Johnson or Deputy Magennis to say &ldquo;I suggest there is a means,&rdquo; and then I would like them to proceed to show us the means, and whether there is a new situation and what they propose we should do.  Let them show us the way to preserve that unifying bond they are talking about.</P>

      <P>Where is it?  Am I to be told that the Council of Ireland is the unifying bond?  If not where is the unifying bond that they want to preserve to meet the new situation? Is it not right to say that we were faced since early 1922 with the concrete fact of definite partition?  Since the North of Ireland opted out in 1922 we have had that concrete fact.  It is said that this Dáil, by its own act, created partition, and drew a line, <Col N="1875" /> when we know that that line was already drawn, and that the only difference is whether it is to be the line drawn since 1922.</P>
      <P>The Article in the Constitution is there, and the Article of the Treaty is there, and they leave no doubt, in any man's mind, as to what their meaning is.  How can that position be avoided? How can this Dáil avoid that position? That is a question we have been asking ourselves since the vote taken last Thursday.  We have been asking ourselves what truth, or what possibility, there is about the argument of the opposition.  Not one scrap of light has appeared, not one shred of an idea has been presented to my mind; perhaps I am dense, but I could not see anywhere any light or leading given. They do not point to any alternative way, or any alternative method.  It is due to every Deputy in this House to be taken into the confidence of Deputies who have a plan, if they have one, and told what is in their minds and what is it that they propose to do.</P>
      <P>I did not want to intervene in this discussion.  It is more or less a Second Reading debate that has gone on up to now, in which things are said that should have been said on the Second Reading.  But to come down to the hard facts, we ask, with all due respect to Deputies who opposed this particular Agreement and clause, to take the House into their confidence and to show how far they are prepared to lead us on the new way.</P>

The Minister for Justice read Section 5 of the Bill in which it is provided that the Governments of the Free State and Northern Ireland shall meet together as, and when, necessary.  The Executive officers of the Free State and the British Government meet as, and when, necessary, to discuss similar things as affecting Great Britain and Ireland.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, through his officers, the Minister for Finance, through his officers, and the Minister for Agriculture, through his officers, meet the Ministers of these several Departments, through their <Col N="1876" /> officials, to discuss matters affecting the common interests of the two countries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not.  What you are binding yourself to is this: that the Governments will meet and discuss matters such as might have been discussed at meetings in the last year or two, such as those in connection with railways, unemployment, national health insurance, and other matters, and I may tell the House that in these matters the Northern Government always professed itself willing to do what the Free State refused to do.  The Council of Ireland had an entirely different kind of powers.  It was that the representatives of the Parliaments should meet and discuss matters of common interest and make recommendations to their respective Parliaments in respect of legislation as well as administration in matters of common interest. In these matters it had no legislative powers, but it had power to meet representatives of the Parliaments, not merely the Governments, and discuss matters of common interest and to make recommendations to their respective Parliaments in regard to legislation. Now, apart from powers over any part of Northern Ireland, that in itself was a more valuable provision towards unity than any proposal for the Governments to meet, because the representatives of the people directly, not as Executive officers, but as Deputies and members of Parliament, would be meeting and discussing these matters of common interest and would make their recommendations, which would be public and subject to the criticism and support, or otherwise, of the people.  That was one of the functions of the Council of Ireland which the Minister derides.  With regard to the other functions, such as railways, surely <Col N="1877" /> Deputies in business realise the importance of having a single authority to administer and from which should be sought powers in regard to legislation respecting these things.  It is true, of course, that when this provision had been acquiesced in, under protest, by the Northern Parliament, it might refuse to work amicably with this Council of Ireland.  In such a case, no doubt, it would be an irritant, but in such a case there would be no powers within the Northern Parliament; there would be no powers of any kind, outside this Council of Ireland, to deal with matters of private legislation.  It was the only authority set up in the Government of Ireland Act in respect of Private Bill legislation.  There could be no extension of legislation respecting fisheries, railways or diseases of animals with regard to Northern Ireland except through this Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely that was a tremendous leverage, a tremendous power, for unification. It was a tremendous power in the hands of the Free State in respect of these services, and as a matter of negotiation, if it were recognised by both sides that this particular machinery was not well oiled, was not going to work easily, then the bargaining value of this was to enlarge the powers, to improve the machinery, retaining a national organisation, retaining a national political institution.  If those powers had been retained, instead of being thrown away, they would have been used as a means for unification, because the Northern Government and Parliament were not in a position to extend or develop except through the Council of Ireland under the 1920 Act, and there was an assurance that Ireland was going to remain a unit.  The very phraseology of the Treaty, both in Article XII. and in Article XIII., shows that that was considered by the framers of the Treaty and was recognised by them as important in the event of the Northern people opting out.  The Minister supported the Treaty, he argued for the Treaty containing these clauses, and bear in mind that it was that Treaty containing these clauses that the Provisional Parliament approved, and it was made the basis of the Constitution&mdash;not any revision of the Treaty. <Col N="1878" /> The suggestion of the Minister that this power over certain functions of Government was of no use will not stand any analysis at all.  If it were to be an irritant, it would be because the Northern Government chafed under it and because they refused to use it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gorey has asked for some light as to an alternative.  If this Council of Ireland was recognised as being difficult in its working, surely instead of being thrown away it was possible to improve it, if there really existed a desire for amity and concord, if there really existed a desire to move towards unity.  I suggest that the Council of Ireland, if it was to be amended, could have been amended in such a direction as would have brought agriculture within its purview, perhaps to have given this Council, even with equal membership from each side of the Border (a fifty-fifty arrangement with regard to membership), authority over agriculture and agricultural matters would be better than throwing this away.  It might have been amended by creating what is conceived of as a possibility in the Constitution, a Vocational Council, a Council of Agriculture, a super-Parliament if you like, a National Economic Council, such as has been established in Germany, to which matters affecting trade, commerce, agriculture and economic affairs would first of all be submitted for consideration and then come to the respective Parliaments for approval or disagreement.  If matters of trade and commerce were to be relegated to a Council of this kind, representing the whole country&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not dealing with the whole Bill at present. I say that if you were going to deal with and improve the Council of Ireland, recognising its value as a unifying authority, you might at least have put forward the suggestion, as a positive alternative, to improve the Council by giving it additional powers, and even by giving it wider powers as well as additional powers.  If thought had been directed to the improvement of the Council, while holding to the principle that there must be a single national authority, there were infinite ways in which matters might be discussed. What I suggest as a very definite proposition is that on the lines of a National Economic Council you might have got far to meeting any reasonable objection on the part of the business men in the North-East corner that their interests would be swamped by an entirely agricultural interest in the South.  I say that the whole theory, the whole framework, both of the Treaty and of the Constitution, was based upon the assumption that there was going to be a united Ireland, and the proposition in your Constitution, which was passed after the opting-out decision, that the Free State might set up subordinate Parliaments, contemplated unity.  The Vocational Councils contemplated unity, contemplated the whole of Ireland being brought into them, and every provision of the Constitution was based on the assumption that you would retain for Ireland a single authority in respect of legislation over at least some matters, and that that authority would gradually add to itself powers over other functions by the goodwill and acquiescence of the two Parliaments.</P>

      <P>I agree with one thing and with only one thing that Deputy Johnson has said.  I agree that the framers of the Treaty did contemplate in Article XII. the Council of Ireland as a unifying force.  I think that particular clause came mostly from the mind of the then Prime Minister of Great Britain, because both Mr. Lloyd George and Deputy Johnson share a peculiar quality of mind that promotes unreality to the highest quality of statesmanship. Articles XII. and XIII. were, as I saw them described in a newspaper this week &ldquo;a Welsh rainbow over an Irish bog.&rdquo;  I was very much interested to hear Deputy Johnson's caoine raised at the wake of the Council of Ireland, because I am in a certain sense one of the fathers of the Council of Ireland.  The Council of Ireland was introduced into the 1920 Act as a result of steps taken by a small group of members of the British Parliament with whom I was then associated.  We thought it very desirable then to have some machinery that would cover the whole of Ireland and that might possibly make for union.  It has not covered the whole of Ireland and it has not made for union because there was not the spirit of goodwill, and I realise that my efforts were futile. But if the Council of Ireland is so valuable why did Labour not work it? If the Labour Party recognised the surpassing merits of the Council of Ireland why did they not seek election to the Parliament of Southern Ireland? Why did they not become members of the Council of Ireland, as they could have done with the greatest ease?  They did not.  This is a case of discovering the extreme merits of the Council of Ireland as a political organisation five years after the date&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Northern Government naturally felt that they should get rid of it lest there might at some future date come into power a Government in the Free State that might use it as an irritant. What would it do?  Twenty Deputies from the Free State would meet twenty members from the Northern Parliament, I suppose, at Dundalk.</P>

It is a great misfortune for this country that there is a large number of people in it who think they can dispose of problems by passing resolutions.  That is not the case.  The Council of Ireland would have no power to carry out any of its decrees so far as Northern Ireland is concerned unless it had the absolute co-operation of the Government of Northern Ireland.  How can you enforce orders under the Diseases of Animals Acts or about the preservation of fisheries, unless you have police?  Is it contemplated that the Council of Ireland should send down their own separate police to enforce their decrees? They could not rely on the cooperation of the Northern Constabulary. Unless the law courts recognise the validity of their decrees you could not enforce them with regard to railways or any other matter.  No; it was an illusion.  It was a well-meant illusion but a vain illusion.  As Deputy Gorey has said, there is no alternative to the course we are now taking.  He is absolutely right.  I, for one, rejoice that we have given up riding the rainbow, and that we are walking on solid ground to the only goal we can hope to attain.</P>

That Parliament of all Ireland was not to exercise jurisdiction over the Six County area during a period of a month within which their option was to be made to come in or to stay out and after the time at which they had exercised their privilege of choice by Article XII. the powers of the Parliament and the Government of the Irish Free State were no longer to extend to Northern Ireland.  That is to say, there shall not be the Parliament of the Free State, otherwise Ireland, exercising jurisdiction over the thirty-two counties.  There shall be a Parliament for Northern Ireland as provided therefor under the Act of 1920, but what our opponents are continually ignoring is that that is not absolute, unqualified control of Northern Ireland. They insist in all their arguments here in using language that implies, and sometimes explicitly declares, that from and after that date referred to in Article XII., not only is the jurisdiction of the Free State Parliament withdrawn but that there and then unqualified jurisdiction over the Six Counties is provided to the Parliament in Belfast. That is not so.  There are two limitations upon it, one of which only is relevant to the present discussion, to wit:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The powers of the Parliament and the Government of the Irish <Col N="1883" /> Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland and the provisions of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 (including those relating to the Council of Ireland) shall so far as they relate to Northern Ireland, continue to be of full force and effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now we have the father, as he styles himself, of the Council of Ireland claiming paternity of the child and repudiating it in the same breath.  It is not the first time in history that first thoughts were best.  In that much-abused Act of 1920 there was a very important provision with regard to the Council of Ireland.  There were three important provisions, but the one on which I dilate now is that after a certain period, by a joint resolution of both Houses, a Parliament of Ireland was to take its place.  It should then be the very type of Parliament that is indicated in Article I. of the Treaty. That Parliament of all Ireland, under the Act of 1920, was to be created by a joint resolution of both Houses.  That is, the goodwill about which we hear so much, was to have brought it into being.  The Minister for Justice objects to the continuation of the Council of Ireland on the peculiar ground that the Northern Government did not like it.</P>
    <P>Let us analyse that for a moment.  We find that here is a principle that if there be any arrangement of State, making for the advantage of all Ireland both now and hereafter, and that it proves a subject of dislike to the Northern Government, then it must go.  I have already said in another debate&mdash;I hope I will be forgiven for quoting myself&mdash; that as regards disputes between nations there are only three ways, or modes, of settlement&mdash;settlement by war, by arbitration or by surrender. Surrender is the easiest way out of all those.  That is what we have had here. The men who signed the Treaty on our behalf stipulated for that clause in Article XII.&mdash;at least, we have been always told so and my habit is to believe, rather than disbelieve, until I have seen, or been given, very excellent reason for disbelieving.  That was not put in as aimless verbiage.  As a matter of fact, we have the authority of Lord Birkenhead, a few evenings ago in <Col N="1884" /> the House of Lords, for the statement that they&mdash;the English signatories to the Treaty&mdash;did not like this provision but that they could not have passed the Treaty without it.  Now, when it is possible to undo it, it is undone.  That was the very doctrine of British statesmanship that was laid down, long ago, by Lord North in regard to the revolt of the North American Colonies.  Whatever England is obliged to concede in her hour of weakness, she reserves the right to withdraw again in her hour of strength.  This is surrender.  Now, the extraordinary thing is that, in support of the surrender, you have the revelation of the bureaucratic mind in the Vice-President once again.  He declares that better than a democratic system of responsible Government&mdash;of an elected Parliament, with an executive responsible to it&mdash;is conference between two Governments.  Here we are back to the eighteenth-century heresy of government&mdash;the dynastic idea, not peoples, through their representatives in Parliament, but Ministers acting on their own.</P>

      <P>Yes, &ldquo;responsible Ministers&rdquo;&mdash;responsible on paper and irresponsible in fact; irresponsible in so far as they can go to other governments and enter into agreements which they sign, and, thereby, paralyse the action, to a great extent, of the representative assembly, which is afraid of what might happen. Deputy Gorey has told you what is in his mind.  Is he an enthusiastic supporter of this settlement?  No; but he does not see his way out.  He is confronted with the accomplished fact; he does not see how he can get a way out of it, and, therefore, he votes for it. That is what I stigmatise here as a crime against our liberty&mdash;that our Ministers at the very moment, or within an hour of the time, at which this Assembly was deliberating on the right or power of the Executive to alter the Treaty, were altering the Treaty.  And we had here the Minister for External Affairs, whose business it was to communicate with them.  Did he communicate <Col N="1885" /> with them?  That is for him to answer and it is for them to say, if he did communicate with them, whether they paid the slightest attention to what he had to say.</P>
      <P>Does the Vice-President know the history of the Constitutional development of the Dominion of Canada?  If he did, he would know that there were progressive steps in Canada from mere occupied territory, held by military force, to a colony, then to a dominion and the status of a State with complete internal sovereignty and quasi-sovereignty that entitled it at the Peace Conference to sign the Treaty of Versailles.  If he knew the history of that dominion, he would know that British aggression had to be faced, again and again, by Canadian statesmen, and that if they had yielded, as our Ministers yielded, Canada would still be a self-governing colony, a dependency of the Empire and not in the family of nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with Deputy Johnson in maintaining that at this hour of the day it is reactionary to go back to a preference for conference between Governments of independent States instead of having the instrument of government.  Neither Deputy Johnson nor I have ever pretended in the Dáil, when this subject of the Council of Ireland came up, that it was a perfect thing.  Of course, it was not a perfect thing.  In some respects it was anomalous. I am quite willing to concede all that.  In some respects it was anomalous, but in British constitutional arrangements it has never been the case that that which had, to the logical mind, an anomalous character was cast aside as a thing that should not be made to work.  This could have been made to work.  The satisfaction evinced by the Northern Government over its removal is sinister.  So long as there was, let me call it, a shadow of a Parliament of all Ireland, then the drawing of a boundary line was not that type of partition which we abhor. This discussion about partition ignores that there is partition and partition&mdash; the partition which reduces the only bond of union between the State in <Col N="1886" /> which there is such a large minority of men who think as we do with regard to the Motherland, to a provision that the only bond of union between that State that contains our nationals and this State is to be occasional conferences at the goodwill of the respective Governments.  That is not the shadow of a Parliament or the pretence of union.  If it were, then Locarno would mean the unification of all the sovereign States of Europe into a unitary Power.  It is only necessary to mention that in order to have it understood.  All the arrangements and the contentions and the claims, in virtue of which now we see the culmination of intrigue and negotiation, have ended in making the Six-County Government a thing which is meant by them to endure.  And when we protest against it here&mdash;here, before the thing is finally accomplished&mdash;we are told that our object is to stir up strife and to stir up disunion.  Surely that is the wisdom of the coward, that says &ldquo;Better yield, better concede in presence of threats, because if you don't the threat may be carried out.&rdquo;  I quite admit, with Deputy Johnson, that when this Dáil, by a vote such as they gave on the Second Reading, declared in favour of this Agreement, it is useless to talk about alternatives. There was a time when an effective alternative could be made, when the whole of those who represent Ireland in this Assembly might have been ranged together, with a solid front, to resist the aggression.  How it might be done I will deal with on another Article here, because I am anxious to observe all the laws of order.  I cannot deal with Article V. properly until we reach it in the Schedule.  If Deputy Gorey would bear with me at that time, I think I could show him again, from Lord Birkenhead, that the case was not so hopeless as he has been led to believe, and that the situation could have been met in a far more effectual way than it has been met. I think I could convince Deputy Gorey that this is an exceptionally bad bargain.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete Section 2.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 says that &ldquo;All references in Section 2 of the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) Act, 1922 (No. 1 of 1922) to the Treaty of 1921 (in that section referred to as the Scheduled Treaty) shall be construed and have effect as references to the said Treaty of 1921 as amended by the Agreement set forth in the Schedule to this Act, and accordingly all references in the Constitution to the Scheduled Treaty shall be construed as references to the said Treaty of 1921 as amended by the said agreement.&rdquo;  The references here are to Section 2 of the Constitution Act, not to Section 2 of the Constitution, as is reported in one of the morning papers.  Section 2 of the Constitution Act provides that &ldquo;the Constitution shall be construed with <Col N="1889" /> reference to the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland set forth in the Second Schedule hereto annexed (hereinafter referred to as &lsquo;the Scheduled Treaty&rsquo;) which are hereby given the force of law, and if any provision of the said Constitution or of any amendment thereof, or of any law made thereunder, is in any respect repugnant to any of the provisions of the Scheduled Treaty, it shall, to the extent only of such repugnancy, be absolutely void and inoperative.&rdquo;  I think it will not be denied that this Bill, if it becomes law, will be repugnant to some of the provisions of the Scheduled Treaty and, consequently, would be void and inoperative under this clause.  The Constitution Act begins by solemnly declaring that &ldquo;Dáil Eireann sitting as a Constituent Assembly in this Provisional Parliament, acknowledging that all lawful authority comes from God to the people and in the confidence that the national life and unity of Ireland shall thus be restored, hereby proclaims the establishment of the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  It is not lightly that a legislature or a constituent assembly undertakes the work of making a Constitution, or, at least, it should not be lightly done, and it should not be lightly altered&mdash;that is to say, a Constitution so made should not be lightly altered.  In the case in question we have a Constitution which is only to be interpreted with reference to the Treaty, and any law made within the powers of the Constitution which is repugnant to any of the provisions of the Treaty is void and inoperative. This section says that all references in that section of the Constitution Act to the Treaty mean to the Treaty as amended, leaving us in the position that the Constitution, which is supposed to be a stable instrument, the fundamental law, the basis of all other laws, while it is to be interpreted in the light of the Treaty and laws under it can only be made in the light of that Treaty.  It is now proposed that we should amend the Treaty in such a way as is now indicated in this Bill, and so that the Constitution shall be read in the light of the new Treaty, and not the old Treaty.  We are to have a variable, alterable instrument by which to test <Col N="1890" /> the Constitution, and it seems to me that the effect of that is to say that the Constitution does not exist.  There is a consideration which I would like to put before Ministers and the House and it is: that if we proceed with this enactment leaving in the section, we are leaving ourselves in the position that at some future time, let us say after the eight years have passed, agreements might be entered into between two Governments, ratified by two Parliaments, radically altering the Treaty, and, though we have provided in the Constitution for references to the people in regard to any proposed amendment of the Constitution, the people would be debarred by means of an agreement between Governments and Parliaments from having anything to say.  By this process you can alter the Constitution radically by merely altering, or making, a new Treaty.  I say that that is in itself a violation of the spirit and purpose of the Constitution. It will be within the memory of the Dáil that the question of the method of changing the Constitution has already been considered somewhat lightly in this House, and it has been explained that certain judges and lawyers in high places have held that the clauses in the Constitution are such that for a period of eight years amendments to the Constitution can be made by ordinary legislation, and that that provision, as interpreted by these lawyers and judges, implies that any legislation within the period of eight years, though it be repugnant to the Constitution, shall be read in preference to the Constitution, because it has been passed by the process of ordinary legislation. As against that, Ministers have contended, and the President has said, that the Attorney-General refused to argue that case on the grounds that amendments to the Constitution must be explicitly and clearly stated to be amendments to it. That was the view taken by the House when it decided that the recent amendment to the Constitution should be by an Act designated as an amendment of the Constitution Act.</P>
    <P>If this Bill becomes law in its present form we are putting ourselves in the position the British Parliament is in, that is to say, that the written Consituation <Col N="1891" /> really has very little validity as a Constitution&mdash;that it is not a constitutional document, that it is not a Constitution.  It is an ordinary Act of Parliament which may be amendable by any other ordinary Act of Parliament. Let me give this illustration: Supposing that the Government here, responding to certain public opinion in this country, agreed with the British Government to introduce a Bill which in effect said that the right to establish and maintain a military defence force in Ireland is reserved to the British Government&mdash;I am putting that as a hypothetical case&mdash;and if certain agreements were entered into and ratified by the Parliaments, then the Constitution itself would have to be read in the light of those agreements.  That would in effect be an amendment to the Constitution, because it would be an amendment of the Treaty.  All the provisions within the Constitution make it difficult for amendments to be made in the Constitution; for instance, that 50 per cent. of the voters must vote, and that half of that 50 per cent. must be in favour of, or in the alternative that a clear majority of two-thirds of those who do vote&mdash;I think that is the provision&mdash;must agree.  At any rate, the effect of the provision is that at least thirty-three per cent. of the voters on the register must record their opinion in favour of an amendment to the Constitution, which is to say that the intention of the Provisional Parliament was that there should be difficulties in amending the Constitution, that it should not be done easily and lightly. But by this process all that is required is an agreement between the two countries, that agreement to be ratified by the Oireachtas, and all the safeguards go by the board.  I say that is a process which is very unwise if the Dáil has any regard for stability.</P>
    <P>If this process is proceeded with and carried through, I suggest that the Dáil should bear in mind that it is a procedure which might be improved upon by other people with different views.  If the Constitution can be lightly set aside, and the Treaty can be amended in this way and the Constitution thereby altered, then there are people with <Col N="1892" /> different views who can follow and better the example, and who will have a very good precedent to cite.  I urge that this proposal in itself is a radical change in the Treaty, and we say it is in itself a refutation, a denial, a contradiction, of Article II. of the Constitution Act and that we ought not to put into this Bill a clause which says that all references in this Constitution Act to the Treaty shall be construed as references to the Treaty as amended by this new Treaty.  If we pass it in its present form, then I urge that it simply means that the Constitution which we have been maintaining, and which is the basis of our legislation, is of no effect, that the pledge of faithfulness and allegiance to the Constitution is a pledge of faith and allegiance to something which is unstable and quite easily variable, and as a consequence there is no pledge whatever implied in Article XVII.  It appears to me that in dealing with this matter the Government have taken the practice of the British Parliament as their guide, forgetting that we have by design a written Constitution. In Great Britain, of course, it is understood that no law can be rendered void because of previous enactments, that the present will of the legislature is the final court of appeal, that it is a Constituent Assembly continuing as such, and you cannot say that any particular Act of legislation is void because it conflicts with a previous Act.  In our procedure we have said: Here is a Constitution Act, here is a Constitution; any legislation which is in opposition to that is void and cannot be carried through.  The Ministers seem to me to have been following a procedure which would be valid if there were no written Constitution here, and to have quite overlooked the intention of the Constituent Assembly that this Constitution should be a fundamental document.  I shall be interested to hear from the President or the Minister for Justice how he explains the contradiction between the Constitution Act, Section 2, and the contravention of a Treaty No. 1 by Treaty No. 2, and whether he considers that the Bill which we are now asked to make law will be valid in view of the contention in Article 2 of the Constitution Act that <Col N="1893" /> any such law which contains any provision repugnant to the Scheduled Treaty is void and inoperative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="MINISTER FOR JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER FOR JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that, unlike Great Britain, we have a written Constitution. It is also true, as the Deputy has mentioned, that at the time when that Constitution was being enacted we were sensible enough to insert in it a clause providing for its alteration by ordinary legislation for a period of eight years.  Article 50 provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Amendments of this Constitution within the terms of the Scheduled Treaty may be made by the Oireachtas, but no such amendment, passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, after the expiration of a period of eight years from the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution, shall become law, unless the same shall, after it has been passed or deemed to have been passed by the said two Houses of the Oireachtas, have been submitted to a referendum of the people ...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Therefore, for eight years, as from the date of the passage of the Constitution Act, the Constitution may be amended by legislation passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Deputy knows that we have at no time taken the view that even within the eight years the Constitution may be amended by implication.  Our contention is and has been that any amendment of the Constitution must be done expressly. And it is being done expressly in the case of this Bill which is under consideration. Section 2 of the Constitution Act provides that the Constitution must be construed with reference to the Treaty of 1921, and the effect of that is that the Constitution consists, in fact, of two documents&mdash;the Constitution itself and the Treaty of 1921, on which it is based and out of which it grew.  The Treaty of 1921 is now being altered and, to that extent, the Constitution is being altered, and that being the position, it ought to be stated, having regard to our conception that the Constitution cannot be altered by implication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy moves to delete Section <Col N="1894" /> 2 of the Bill under consideration&mdash;and that is the section in which the alteration of the Constitution is expressly adverted to&mdash;though he would probably admit that to whatever extent the Treaty of 1921 is being altered, to that extent the Constitution is being altered.  It is simply a difference in viewpoint.  We, holding as we do that the Constitution should not and, in fact, cannot be altered by implication, prefer to insert in this Bill an Article expressly stating that the Constitution must now be construed not merely in reference to the Treaty of December, 1921, but in reference to that Treaty as modified and amended by the recent Agreement, for which the endorsement and ratification of the Dáil is being sought.  That seems to us the proper course.  It is the course which we are advised to be the correct one in the circumstances, and, that being so, we are not accepting the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The doctrine that the Constitution cannot be altered except by express legislation designed therefor, is, I think, common case.  There is no member of the Dáil who will contest that, so far as I am aware.  Furthermore, this procedure of altering the Constitution obliquely, by entering upon new terms of treaty and confirming them by a specific Act of Parliament, is perfectly legal.  That, I think, also is common case.  My quarrel with the Executive Council on this matter is not with regard to the legal procedure. I attack it on the ground of policy which, after all, is something much higher than mere legality, especially in regard to an infant State, as Saorstát Eireann has so frequently been described within this Chamber.  I daresay that if I were to quote great authorities from centuries back with respect to the growth and character of responsible government I should be condemned as pedantic.  Consequently, I will omit references that I might make to great authorities so far back as the 14th century.  But the view expressed and acted upon frequently in European States may be put briefly in this way: that so long as the fundamental rights and powers of a people <Col N="1895" /> are dependent upon the will and the power of another Government they are not free.  Test the application of that Constitutional doctrine by the present measure in regard to Article II. as framed here.  We have a Constitution which is fundamental law.  Any law passed here, any piece of ordinary legislation, is null and void, I take it, in so far as it is repugnant to the Constitution. But that Constitution becomes itself a variable instrument if procedure such as has been indulged in by our Executive Council is persevered in by their successors.  It would always be within the competence of Gt. Britain to send a message to the Irish Executive Council that the Premier or President of the Council is required&mdash; that his presence in London is demanded&mdash;and then, under cover of some supposed danger, or because of some bargain that the British Ministry seek to enter into, the Irish Executive Minister in London puts his hand to an agreement; the agreement is brought over and the Irish legislature and the Deputies of that time&mdash;like the Deputies that surround me here&mdash;would be so much afraid of the consequences, so unwilling to challenge what the Executive Minister has done, would feel so irretrievably committed, that they would vote for it.  What does that reduce itself to?  That the British Ministry can, by pressure as in this case, in other cases later&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I made it clear.  At any rate, if I have not, with your permission, sir, I will repeat it, that I am speaking of what this creates a precedent for.  I do not know what happened.  Will it please the President for me to make the confession that I, as a Deputy, was left in hopeless and absolute ignorance of what the Executive Council were doing in our name?  It was never disclosed to us.  How were we to know? What I sketch is the possibility of this being a precedent to be followed by later Ministers.  They go to London <Col N="1896" />&mdash;are summoned to London.  That does not mean that the President was summoned to London, because it is within the range of possibility that he went there voluntarily.  But a future President or Premier of the Executive Council goes to London on the demand of the Prime Minister in London.  A bargain is entered into.  There is no way out of it.  It has to be ratified in the legislative assembly.  What then ensues?  As the Minister for Justice has rightly stated, there are two elements in our Constitution.  There are the plain articles of the Constitution and the enveloping condition of the Treaty, and, as this Section 2 of our No. 1 Act of 1922 declares, the Treaty is the all governing factor in the matter.  If a British Ministry can at will&mdash;as I was saying when interrupted&mdash;by pressure or by other means, succeed in making an Irish Executive force upon a Dáil the acceptance of a new Treaty, then the Constitution is so far altered, and that means there is no Constitution. A variable Constitution that purports to be a written Constitution is a contradiction in terms.  I alleged that in doing what they have done the Executive Ministry have destroyed the Constitution as an effective instrument&mdash;as the basis of our liberties here.</P>
      <P>I quite agree with the Minister for Justice that, inasmuch as this Bill intends to alter the Constitution, it must mention specifically that it is altering the Constitution.  Are these the only words, is that the only form of expression that can be used?  I put our fundamental liberties above the mere question of legality.  What is at issue in this point is the same thing over again as the Feetham award: a question of a legally constituted Arbitration Board finding in accordance with the terms of law its verdict&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Surely the Deputy is travelling very far from this particular section.  We have agreed to the Second Reading of the Bill and the Committee has agreed to Section 1.  What arises on Section 2 is the question that Deputy Johnson has raised.  The question which does properly arise is: is a consequential amendment of the Constitution necessary? <Col N="1897" /> Surely the Deputy, in fact, is going to begin a debate all over again as to why the President went to London. There is no other possible method of replying to Deputy Magennis and the Deputy must realise that.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy can give me any point I will consider it.  Section 1 deals with the Agreement.  That section has been carried.  Section 2 deals, as is set out in the side note, with a consequential amendment of No. 1 of 1922 and the Constitution.  Surely the question that arises is whether a particular agreement having been made, apart altogether from the circumstances under which it was made, this kind of section should go into the ratifying Bill?  In my judgment Deputy Johnson's points were absolutely relevant to this particular section.  I am at a loss to see what other points arise, but if Deputy Magennis can explain what other points arise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the value of a Preamble to an Act of the Oireachtas may be, but I assume it is of some value.  The Preamble of the Constitution Act says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the confidence that the national life and unity of Ireland shall thus be restored, hereby proclaims the establishment of the Irish Free State,&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and declares the Constitution.  Thus by means of this Constitution, which is to be read in the light of the Scheduled Treaty, the Dáil declares that the national life and unity shall be restored.  (By the way, I would like to point out that a little booklet, issued officially as late as October, 1923, states that this is the Constitution of the Free State of Ireland.) We proclaimed the establishment of the Irish Free State and enacted (1) the Constitution which is to be construed with reference to (2) the Treaty, and by enacting the Constitution, to be read in the light of the Treaty, we declare that the national life and unity of Ireland shall thus be restored.  The Constitution sets forth in the First Schedule &ldquo;shall be the Constitution of the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  That is to be read or construed with reference to the Treaty. Now it appears it is not to be construed with reference to the Treaty. It is now to be construed with reference to another instrument or the Treaty as amended.  It seems to me that that is a direct contradiction. The Minister says that this Bill, the new Treaty, is part of the Constitution Act, or rather is part of the Constitution and that the Bill or Act when it becomes law is to be treated as an amendment of the Constitution, specifically and clearly an amendment of the Constitution.  Well, if that was the intention, it is a pity that the <Col N="1899" /> Minister did not introduce this Bill with a new title.  That by the way. I think if the Constitution is to be amended by altering at stated intervals, or at any interval, or any time, the Schedule, that is to say, the Treaty, by the making of new Treaties, instead of making new Constitutions, we are setting a very bad example to our successors.  I suggest that if the Constitution can be amended in this way that our allegiance to the Constitution has no weight whatever.  It has no meaning, because those of us, at any rate, who came into the Dáil and declared our willingness to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution were declaring our allegiance to a particular document read in the light of a particular instrument.</P>
    <P>Now we are to read that document in the light of a new instrument and we do not know where we are.  I would like to understand what would be the demerit, what would be the loss, if this section were deleted?  Would the Agreement have any less effect? Would the new Act have any less <Col N="1900" /> effect?  I had hoped&mdash;but I have too much respect for the rules of order, and I felt that it would be probably disorderly and would not be accepted by the Ceann Comhairle&mdash;that the obvious course that we ought to take is to repeal all this latter part of Section II. of the Constitution Act of 1922, that is to say, that part which says: &ldquo;and if any provision of the said Constitution or of any amendment thereof, or of any law made thereunder, is, in any respect, repugnant to any of the provisions of the Scheduled Treaty, it shall, to the extent only of such repugnancy, be absolutely void and inoperative,&rdquo; and so on.  It seems to me if we proceed in this way we should repeal that part of Section 2 of the Constitution Act of 1922.  I wonder would Ministers agree to any proposals of that sort? Ministers say that the present Bill is to be read as a Bill amending the Constitution. I suggest, to begin with, that it ought to have a new title, and that it ought to be put before the country as an amendment of the Constitution, not as an amendment of the Treaty.</P>

      <P>With regard to the portion of the Schedule, Section 2, which deals with Article V. of the Treaty, I would like to be permitted to quote some further information on this transaction which we were fortunately in a position to get, because of the fact that we did not conclude the transaction so early as it was concluded in the British Legislature. Speaking on the Irish Agreement, the Earl of Birkenhead, in moving the Second Reading&mdash;I am quoting from the report in the &ldquo;London Times&rdquo; of Thursday, December 10th&mdash;said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The criticism might be raised that Article V. of the Treaty had no relation to Article XII&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
      <P>It is probably within the recollection of the House that I did raise that criticism on Monday.  Lord Birkenhead proceeded:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;And that criticism was perfectly well founded.  Was it seriously suggested that there was available in Ireland any sum of money which would afford ...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;and then he mentions an extraordinary sum&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;to this country.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He answers himself:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The expectation was extravagant. We could have made Ireland bankrupt, but what advantage to us would be a bankrupt Ireland at our doors?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Again further on, he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We as a nation were deeply affected by financial burdens and interests, but, nevertheless, we were a great, wealthy, resilient nation, and in dealing in terms of finance with those whom we were so deeply concerned to conciliate, we must think always in terms of national resources. No nation had permanently occupied a great place in history which could not subordinate questions of finance, however embarrassed its finances might be, to considerations of high policy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1904" /> Now there is the considered opinion of one of the signatories to the original Treaty, a man who, in the history of the boundary question, was known in his time as &ldquo;Galloper Smith,&rdquo; the lieutenant, indeed the able lieutenant, of Lord Carson.  Article V. had no relation to Article XII.  That criticism is well founded.  &ldquo;No nation has permanently occupied a great place in history which would subordinate considerations of high policy to questions of finance.&rdquo; Does not that dispel the illusion that the Free State was in serious difficulties, and would be tremendously embarrassed financially by the operation of Article V. in the original Treaty.  In a conversation over the telephone with a Press representative at 12.30 a.m., the terms of this new Agreement were communicated to me.  I happened to recall what one of the negotiators at the time&mdash;he was then Mr. Alfred Cope, and is now Sir Alfred&mdash; said, to the effect that Article V. was never intended as anything more than eye-wash.  The words were mine, not his, a paraphrase of his, for the British public, who, of course, would have been very much enraged by a settlement of the Treaty if they believed that money were not forthcoming.  We must remember to read documents in the light of the thought that was current at the time they were framed.  We insisted on that always until now, with regard to Article XII.  I would ask the House to remember the same thing in construing Article V.  That was composed for a purpose.  We all remember Mr. Lloyd George's promises to the British people that he would rake every pocket in Germany.  There were two promises on which he went to the electorate and got their support&mdash;one was to hang the Kaiser and the other to rake every pocket in Germany.  The whole cost of the war, he told the British people, would be defrayed by Germany, and England would not have to contribute one scintilla.  In the same spirit Article V. was composed.  We were assured at the time&mdash;some of us, at any rate, were assured at the time&mdash; that it was, what I call for brevity, eye-wash.  What did Lord Carson say about that?  He wrote an article in the &ldquo;Sunday Times,&rdquo; in which he repeated <Col N="1905" /> that it was eye-wash.  What did he say in the debate in the House of Lords?  &ldquo;In regard to finance he was never in the least taken in by Clause 5, under which we were to get a large contribution from the Free State.  That clause was mere window-dressing.&rdquo; The reporter adds &ldquo;Hear. hear.&rdquo;  The quotation continues:&mdash;&ldquo;He agreed it would have been impossible ever to get a penny of the money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These two contributions from British statesmen are very illuminating and very informative, and yet we are asked to believe here that this dreadful burden of financial debt uncalculated, and almost incalculable, was over the heads of the Free State so that its borrowing powers were practically reduced to nil.  Now that bubble is burst. That is due to the fact that we here, before the thing was completed, had got what the views of British statesmen were on the subject.  If it were not for this Document I should be told here when I state that Article V. had no relation to Article XII. in the original Treaty, that that was mere moonshine. Is it moonshine when you hear it disclosed by those who ought to know?  Now, it has been impressed upon us again and again here&mdash;I think the Minister for Finance told us and I took a note of it at the time&mdash;that our Ministers snatched at the opportunity to settle the claim under Article V.  That is an admission that there was a bargain, and that our Executive Ministers conceived that the transaction on our part was a bargain in which they were getting a good thing. We know that at any time, if Article V. had been approached, this great nation whose tradition of statesmanship is so high would never have allowed financial considerations to outweigh policy, and that it would not enforce that: that all the time they were well aware and fully conscious that the thing was there simply to satisfy the English mind.</P>

      <P>I would remind the House that once upon a time there was a Provisional Government. The President was then Minister for Finance, and when I raised a question about arrears of income tax due to the British Government a debate ensued on it, and after an interval the President came to this House and assured us that anyone who paid arrears of income tax paid it to the Free State revenue, and that no claim later would be made about it.  Was not that a financial understanding between the rapacious British Government and the poor little Free State?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite see the point of that observation, but I am sure it is very pointed if one could only see it.  Article V. had no relation to Article XII.! But our negotiators had given it a relation, because they asked the Irish public to believe that it was by surrender on the boundary that they got these magnificent terms.  Our credit, I have already admitted, in the financial world required undoubtedly that there should not be hanging over our heads even what I described myself as shadowy liabilities or obligations.  Therefore, I do not dispute the advisability of coming to a settlement under Article V.  That is not part of my case.  I contend that, in the light of these revelations, a good bargain could have been struck at any time, and that the bad policy of the matter is to select this moment for it as it gives the impression of being the price at which our nationals are left under British control in Northern Ireland. That is not good policy; that is not what the President describes as the result of bringing to bear on the matter all the statesmanship they possessed. Where is the statesmanship in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, as regards another portion of <Col N="1907" /> the schedule, the statement about the friendly relations, we have seen the declaration of his Lordship the Bishop of Down and Connor.  If I may be permitted, I would like to read a comment on that and amplifying that quoted from the &ldquo;Derry Journal&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; to-day:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The grievances of the Catholics in the Six Counties which Most Rev. Dr. MacRory, Bishop of Down and Connor, drew attention to on Sunday are also emphasised by the &ldquo;Derry Journal.&rdquo;  There are places in the Six Counties, it says, where Catholic Emancipation is not yet felt in full measure.  The Nationalist minority, more than 30 per cent. of the population, lived under a wholly Unionist Government.  The Cabinet, the Judiciary, the whole machinery of the State was completely in the hands of the Unionists.  It adds: For any position of trust or emolument in the service of the State no Catholic need apply; indeed so axiomatic is this that both the privileged Protestants and the outlawed Catholics have both come to regard it as a common-place of life&mdash;a thing as natural as the movements of the stars in the heavens.  Was it no grievance, it asks, that the Nationalist majority of Derry has been jockeyed, gerrymandered and cheated out of its civic rights by a specially designed Act of Parliament?  By a piece of calculated trickery a minority in Derry had been enabled to dominate a majority of the population. The Nationalist majorities of Omagh rural district, Dungannon town, and other centres have likewise been placed under the rule of a minority by a disgraceful system of representation that made one Unionist vote equal to two or three Nationalist votes.  The journal draws attention to many acts of bigotry, and says that in view of these facts, which could be multiplied, it can only regard Sir J. Craig's recent speech as what Lord Carson would call &lsquo;eye-wash,&rsquo; and adds: we assure him that we shall not &lsquo;rule the book&rsquo; until he delivers the goods and gives Catholics not words but <Col N="1908" /> deeds and proof of his change of heart.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The question that is embodied in this has been a matter of public discussion for a long time.  On September 14th, 1923, a certain newspaper which has considerable influence in respect of this subject printed the following.  It is headed, &ldquo;Mr. Cosgrave's Argument.&rdquo;  It is not a quotation from anything that the President said, but it is an argument as written by the journalist himself of what Mr. Cosgrave's argument would be, judging, presumably, by his published or private statements.  Bear in mind the date, September 14th, 1923&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Our aim is the unity of Ireland based on good-will and the mutual advantage of all parties concerned. Getting a bit more territory or even a couple more counties into the Free State is, therefore, of no interest to us unless it is really to be a prelude to the incoming of the rest.  If the forcing of the Boundary issue were to result in our acquiring two counties, but made the remaining four more than ever determined to maintain their isolation, we should consider ourselves losers and not gainers thereby.  At the present moment we see no likelihood of grabbing Tyrone and Fermanagh in any circumstances, and even if we could persuade the British Government to force Ulster to hand them over, it is only too obvious that the other four counties, so far from following suit of their own accord, would make every conceivable effort to make partition permanent.  All of which being the case, let us see whether we cannot get something worth having out of the British Government in return for our relinquishment of the Boundary Clause of the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The British Government have sold us somebody else's cow.  When that occurs in private life the vendor is mulcted in damages.  Let us collect damages from the British Government.  Only two clauses of the Treaty remain unfulfilled.  One is the Boundary Clause and the other is our agreement to assume a fair <Col N="1909" /> share of the war debt.  If we play our cards well, we should be able to set one off against the other, which will put £10,000,000 per annum into the Free State's pocket.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As things have turned out that was a good prophecy, except that the estimate of the sum was a little bit exaggerated, perhaps not so exaggerated as may be thought.  It was a good prophecy of the arguments now being used, but not used at that time, of course, because this is the invention of the special correspondent of the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; in September, 1923.  I say it was a fairly good prophecy of the attitude that would be taken if the President were allowed.  It is an argument prefaced by the statement that &ldquo;Mr. Cosgrave and his colleagues fully appreciate this position&rdquo;&mdash;the position being that the Coalition Government did not put anything down in writing. But a slight rectification of the Boundary as some fondly imagined could not be anybody's interpretation of Article XII. of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Cosgrave and his colleagues fully appreciated this position, and as fully realise that the Treaty was an agreement made between the Irish Free State and Great Britain and that Ulster was not a party to it.  They are not, however, all at one in their view of how the situation should be best taken advantage of.  The most reasonable and at the same time the most sensible view is taken by President Cosgrave and Mr. Kevin O'Higgins.  If pressed to formulate it they would do so something after this fashion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then follows the argument I have read.</P>
    <P>That correspondent must have had a very deep insight into the minds of the President and the Vice-President when more than two years ago he was able to prophesy almost exactly the argument that would be used in December, 1925.  I am glad to see the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs here.  I am going to put to him a certain speech he made on 3rd January, 1922, on the Treaty debates in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The alternative for a Republic,&rdquo;<Col N="1910" /> he said, &ldquo;for three-fourths of Ireland was the unity of all Ireland, and you (the Anti-Treaty Party) could never get that unity you insisted on.  A Republic would definitely alienate the North-east Ulster corner and divide our unfortunate country into two separate and distinct areas, and into two races for all time.  That is the programme that you have brought forward.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Even without a Republic, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is supporting this thing which he derided in 1922.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I hold that Ulster is the very important clause of the Treaty which we consider, and to this our opponents have not in any single instance given any consideration. Had I believed that this Treaty would leave Ireland as a permanently divided nation I would vote against it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now he is voting for it&mdash;permanently dividing the nation.</P>

      <P>I want to ask Ministers, in view of the position in which they are placing us, what is the interpretation of Paragraph 2 of these Articles of Agreement?</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Irish Free State is hereby released from the obligation under Article V. of the said Articles of Agreement to assume the liability therein mentioned.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Article V. says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Irish Free State shall assume liability for the service of the Public Debt of the United Kingdom as existing at the date hereof and towards the payment of war pensions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a certain misapprehension in the public mind, judging by certain comments I have read, that the Public Debt of the United Kingdom referred to was the Public Debt relating to war pensions and the war debt, but Article V. says: &ldquo;The Public Debt of the United Kingdom at the date hereof.&rdquo;  Now, the Public Debt of the United Kingdom included liability <Col N="1911" /> for Irish Land Stock, and I want to ask Ministers whether this is a renunciation or release from the obligations under Article V. to pay anything towards that portion of the Public Debt, or rather, shall I say, whether there is any obligation to hand over to Britain any portion of the moneys collected for land purchase annuities?</P>

      <P>I want to ask, if it is allowable, whether Ministers, in making this Agreement to amend the Constitution, as the Minister for Justice has explained that this is an amendment of the Constitution, thought it worth while to discuss with the British Government Article LXI. of the Constitution?  It will be remembered that that Article was discussed in the Constitution debates, and Ministers assured us that the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council could not be appealed to on any matters except matters of constitutional moment, and that probably they would not be appealed to more than twice or thrice in a century.</P>

      <P>I am raising this point because it surely is a matter of moment as regards the relative positions of Northern Ireland and the Free State with respect to Great Britain, and inasmuch as decisions have been made touching the rights of citizens in the Free State, it might have been well considered as a matter for re-arrangement in any alteration of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>On a point of order.  In the discussion of this Schedule, is it in order to exhaust all the topics which might well have been considered when this Agreement was being arrived at, or which, in the opinion of Deputies, might well have been considered? Are we, in short, to confine ourselves to the actual contents of the Agreement which is scheduled to this Bill, or are we to travel over all the ground that, in the opinion or judgment of one Deputy or another, might have been traversed or ought to have been traversed or could have been traversed when the negotiations were proceeding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are plainly confined at this stage to what is in the Agreement.  Questions of the negotiations and alternative agreements, and so on, arose, as I think I explained at the opening of the proceedings to-day, on the Second Stage.  They do not arise now.  That, I think, is plain.  It is plain, because if one matter which is not in the Agreement can be discussed on the assumption that it might have been in the Agreement, then any number of matters might be discussed, and there would be no finality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Agreement <Col N="1913" /> itself, the proposal is, as has been said so often, to sever the country.  Definitely, and, as I believe, for a very long time, until a new revolution takes place, either constitutionally or unconstitutionally, by, shall I say, constitutional methods or by unconstitutional methods, by following the example of the Government in this way, changing the basis of our existence, or by force, the two parts of the country will be severed.  It is being done by way of getting out of the grave difficulty into which the makers of the Agreement on the Free State side brought us.  They came back with an Agreement which is approved of as some great triumph because they have barely saved their skins.  I repeat that this Agreement which, I believe, will be disastrous and not beneficent, is not likely to be improved until that radical change to which I refer has taken place in the constitutional position of either the Northern people or the Free State people, whether by revolution by force, or by revolution through Parliamentary methods.  I think there can be no unity in the country by this method.  I think, on the contrary, that all the forces of Government and the influences of administration will be more and more towards disseverance.  We have already seen in the course of the last three years that there has been the setting up of Northern Committees and Councils, of organisations which were hitherto unified.  We have seen in many cases the actual severance of these social economic organisations.  We have seen Trade Unions, Friendly Societies, professional organisations, having to recast their rules and constitutions because of the existence of different laws, different administrations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are going to be established, stabilised and fixed these new Governmental and administrative influences, conserving influences of the new forces, the establishing of vested interests under the new methods.  Every factor, as far as I can see it, is going to move against unity, and nothing, except this one proposal that the Executives will meet to discuss matters which affect the two parts of the country, is going <Col N="1914" /> to be used, so far as the Ministries can effect it, towards unity.  Legislation and administration will certainly tend to harden the Northern people against unity with the country as a whole. Those people who have been advocating, very enthusiastically advocating, and insisting that the Irish language should take a prominent place in the education system are going to find just the opposite influences brought to bear on the children of residents in Northern Ireland. That again is going to be a distinct influence against unity.  The whole of the Agreement in my view is bad, because it is going to tend against unity.  There may be clauses in it that could be justified if taken alone.  The whole of the Agreement, the bargaining that has taken place, the surrender, as Deputy Magennis states, that has been made, is a surrender on the part of the Free State, and all the gain and none of the &ldquo;give&rdquo; has been on the part of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The President charges us with having taken a line which will militate against unity and tend to irritate and destroy any hopes that he has had and that others have had.  I do not believe anything that has been said here will have any such effect.  Certainly nothing I have said had any intent of that kind.  I hope that all that has been done and that is being done will be undone at some time in the near future.  I hope that new influences will be brought to bear on the politics of Northern Ireland.  My faith in that is very small.  I know how strongly entrenched in the political councils in the North the enemies of Irish unity are.  The only hope that I can have is that other influences, may I say Labour influences, will by their contact with their fellow-workers in the Free State, at some time in the not too distant future, come into power and possibly they may be mollified and that that section which is liberal-minded and has some thoughts of &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; will prevail. My faith, as I say, is very weak, but I will retain some hope.  I would perhaps now say that as I view it the dominant political influence in Northern Ireland is in Belfast, and the dominant <Col N="1915" /> interest in that dominant portion of Northern Ireland is the interest of the shipbuilding and the linen industries. Those interests have their eyes outside of Ireland entirely.  They bring their raw materials from abroad and they send their finished goods abroad. If Ministers are relying on the possibilities of trade interests, economic factors, weighing with the predominant political influence in the North, then I am afraid that their hopes are based on very unstable ground.  However, the deed is about to be done. My mind at any rate is satisfied that I have done what I could to prevent its confirmation.</P>

      <P>I conclude that we are discussing the whole Schedule and that I am entitled to ask for some elucidation as to certain legal points in connection with the draft of the Schedule which I raised on Second Reading, but which were not answered on that occasion.  I would, therefore, like to ask the Minister for Justice a question, seeing that he is a legal authority in this matter and one of the signatories to this Treaty.  I would add that I am afraid to ask the President, as any question I might put to him might be answered, as was a suggestion of mine not very long ago, that as my contribution to the establishment and to the defence of the State is of no value whatever, I have no right to ask him any question.  I would, therefore, like to ask the Vice-President if he could explain the draft of the beginning of the Schedule, namely, the inclusion of the term &ldquo;Articles of Agreement for a Treaty&rdquo;? The Treaty of 1921 has been registered with the League of Nations as a Treaty between Ireland and Great Britain. As I understand it, a certain Lionel Curtiss, boon-companion and fellow-conspirator with Mr. Justice Feetham, invented this term, &ldquo;Articles of Agreement for a Treaty,&rdquo; because it was considered by the British Government in 1921 that if they signed a document called a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland and that that document was not ratified by the Dáil, the British Government would <Col N="1916" /> be placed in a worse position than before by having concluded a Treaty and therefore partly recognised an Irish State which according to the actual terms of the Treaty would not be recognised until the agreement had been ratified by the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>For that reason, this phrase.  &ldquo;Articles of Agreement for a Treaty,&rdquo; from which it is quite obvious there was the intention of making a Treaty, were employed at the head of the document which happened to be signed in December, 1921.  Since then, that document has always been referred to as a Treaty.  It has been registered at Geneva as a Treaty, and I see no reason why in this Agreement&mdash;made four years after the signing of the Treaty&mdash;the words used should be &ldquo;Articles of Agreement for a Treaty,&rdquo; which would imply that there was still the intention of making a Treaty, but that the Treaty had not yet been completed.  That is the first point I desire to raise.  The second point is purely legal.  It is stated in the Preamble to the Schedule that the Treaty was given the force of law by a British Act of Parliament.  As I understand, the Treaty, so far as this country was concerned, was given the force of law by Dáil Eireann.  Even if this phrase were included in the preamble or in the title of the Agreement, there should also have been included an addition setting out that, so far as Ireland was concerned, the Treaty was given the force of law by Dáil Eireann, and not by Act of the British Parliament. Those are the two points I wish to raise.  I hope the Minister for Justice, as a legal authority and as one of the signatories to this Pact, will be able to give us some explanation on these points.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson's hope in the ultimate unity of Ireland to-day is a very palsied one.  The brightest hope for the ultimate unity of Ireland must come from faith, and I would suggest to Deputy Johnson that he should try and recover his faith in a unified Ireland.  He has just now handed himself over to the enemies of <Col N="1917" /> the language and what they stand for &mdash;he has delivered himself into their hands&mdash;by his statement that the continuance of the educational policy recently subscribed to by the Dáil is going to be an obstacle on the road to the unity of Ireland.  I am satisfied that he did not mean to do that.  I am satisfied that when he considers the matter further, his faith in what the language stands for, so far as the country and the unity of the country is concerned, will increase.  Whilst I was discussing with one of the Secretaries of State in Washington some weeks ago some of their problems there arising out of the very diversified character of their people and the effect on their social life and industrial life, he turned from the consideration of his own problems, and, hitting the table, said, &ldquo;Keep Ireland Irish.&rdquo;  If you are going to have a people whom you can energise and direct, a homogeneous people with traditions that you can appeal to to energise them in the work of building up their nation, leave nothing unkept that you can keep to do that.  That was his meaning when he said, &ldquo;Keep Ireland Irish.&rdquo;  If we are going to solve our national problems, including the problem of the unity of Ireland, we can do nothing better than take the advice of this American statesman, who knew little about Ireland and had no Irish connections, and set ourselves to making Irish life in the twenty-six counties that we have jurisdiction over as intensely Irish as we can make it.  If we are going to attempt to do that, without paying attention to our language, or if we are going to leave anything undone that can keep us our language and all that it stands for, then we are going to fail to keep Ireland as Irish as we can keep her, and in the measure that we fail to do that we are going, in my opinion, to fail in the achievement of Irish unity.</P>

In that Article it is stated that the financial settlement should be made &ldquo;having regard to any just claims on the part of Ireland by way of set-off or counter-claim.&rdquo;  Now, in the schedule, <Col N="1918" /> Section 2 purports to release the Irish Free State from the obligation under Article V. of the said Articles of Agreement.  One of the points which, repeatedly, I have had to weary this House in pressing on its notice was the debt on University College, Dublin, arising out of its building.

Yes, but America's problems are all considered under Federal Government.  There are States with their internal sovereignty but they are under Federal Government. Here we have racial and language problems with regard to a divided country under two separate, distinct Governments with no points of contact whatever, except what meetings may take place, not between the peoples and their Parliaments, but between their Governments.  Ireland's aim&mdash; I mean again the Irish Free State: I am always forgetting that this Treaty is almost as good as amended&mdash;is to make the Irish people as Irish as they can possibly be made.  Do we not know that the people of the Six Counties will be made as English as they can be made?

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy apparently ignores that the one little element of unification which survived is done away with. Those powers are transferred, and now the only link, if link it be, and I do not regard it as a link, is the meeting occasionally of the two Governments, but we are to be inspired with a holy faith that, notwithstanding the division to which this Dáil sets its hand, there will be a unity some time because of some agency, we know not what.  Surely the whole tendency of the Northern people, or, at any rate, of its majority, will be away from the Free State. It is an area in which economic considerations count for much.  They regard our nationalism as so much sentiment, as weakness and a mark of the unpractical nature of the southern mentality.  If the great industries of the North, Deputy Johnson mentioned two.  There is a rope factory in Belfast, one of the biggest in the world. There is a flour-milling industry, one <Col N="1922" /> of the biggest in the world.  There is a vulcanised-material industry, one of the largest enterprises in the world. Raw materials for all those things come from abroad.  All the financing that has made Belfast what it is, came largely from Scotland.  All the aid, by way of subventions and subsidies, has come even in recent years from Great Britain.  Is anyone such a visionary and a dreamer as to think that with all that tendency of centuries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One thing at a time is quite enough for one to deal with.  I say, when you have set those two countries apart without any machinery for bringing them together, the tendency is away and away from the South.  There are districts in Switzerland where there are notices forbidding one to laugh or shout under the pain of a fine.  Why?&mdash;because the slightest vibration will disturb the air and precipitate an avalanche.  Once the collective masses are set going nothing will stop them.  Something similar is provided for here.  Deputy Mulcahy forgets the important point that when he talks of keeping Ireland Irish he is really talking only of twenty-six counties, and is willingly surrendering six counties to further and permanent Anglicisation.  That is what it amounts to.  I wonder am I in order?  It seems I am constantly out of order because I cannot state the end of my argument as the first sentence, nor can anyone else who follows an argument in its rational course do anything but begin at the beginning.  With regard to this question of the boundary difficulty, it is also dealt with in the schedule under Section 1.  We are constantly twitted that we have no constructive proposals to make and never had anything to say that was helpful (hear, hear).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall, with the permission of An Leas-Cheann Comhairle, answer the &ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo;  There was a time when we were assured by our leaders that all was well, that a Boundary Commission set up under Article XII. would decide in favour of what we were looking forward to.  The President, whom I regarded as our leader, repeatedly <Col N="1923" /> declared that he would abide by the decision.  I interpreted that to mean that he had full confidence in the successful result.  When the hour came to alter the Treaty, in order to allow Great Britain to nominate the third Commissioner, I proposed to the President, through the Executive Council, that in view of the propaganda in circulation in England to affect the minds of the Commissioners, a new situation had been created very dangerous to our hopes and wishes, and while, in the first instance, it would have been perfectly irregular for us to declare our interpretation of the terms of reference, that that course had been forced upon us by the action of the British Signatories, by the British Press, and by that social exchange which we know counts for so much in English society. I proposed that we should accompany the passing of that identical legislation with a resolution declaring our minds. Here is the resolution as it was returned to me.  There is not a comma, not one iota, altered, not even the folds of the paper.  Internal evidence will show the date on which it was written:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whereas since the first reading of this Bill recognised leaders of public opinion in Great Britain, including nearly all the British Signatories to the Treaty between that country and Ireland, have insistently claimed that the only admissible interpretation of Article XII. of the Treaty limits the function of any Boundary Commission acting thereunder to the mere rectification in minor respects of the border line created between six counties of Ulster and the rest of Ireland by the British Statute of 1920; and whereas this division of the area of Ireland, a nation one and indivisible, was decreed by the British legislature in arbitrary disregard of the protests of Irish Nationalists and Irish Unionists alike; and this artificial line of demarcation was drawn in direct contravention of those principles invoked for the settlement of Europe by the British in common with the representatives of the Associated Powers at the Peace Conference of Paris and without resort to a prior plebiscite <Col N="1924" /> to ascertain the wishes of the peoples affected; and whereas the Irish Signatories of the Treaty from the first hour in which they recommended its acceptance, proclaimed without correction or demur on the part of their British co-Signatories, that Article XII. was intended to secure to our people in those Six Counties the right to choose their way of life and obedience; and the majority of the Irish people approving of the Treaty as so interpreted made an incalculable sacrifice of blood and treasure to maintain it; and whereas while we approve the policy which by the grant of ample local autonomy aims at the ultimate reconciliation of the malcontent minority resident in the north-east angle to the recognition of Ireland as their State we repudiate the pretensions of any Government to force out of vital communion with the Irish State a population which vehemently desires incorporation in it; accordingly we accompany our passing of this measure, a Bill to implement Article XII., with the considered statement of our conviction that the interpretation of the Article which British publicists have recently put forward is forced, perverse, and vicious.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now let us imagine a resolution in terms similar to that passed as our declaration, along with our promise to England to nominate the third Boundary Commissioner, could that debacle happen which did happen?  Would it be possible, I ask any reasonable man, that weeks and months should roll on and the question of the exact terms of reference never be raised?  That forced to the front what were the terms of reference, what was the Boundary Commission to decide.  There is a further point with regard to that, but as perhaps it is beyond the ten minutes stipulated, I may leave it over for a further stage.</P>

      <P>I have no particular desire to appear as a special champion of this Agreement, but I do want to do any thing I can to keep what we have.  We had a time when certain people in the beginning of 1922 in regard to the Treaty said that it <Col N="1925" /> would not bring peace, and they saw very definitely that it did not bring peace.  Now we have another Treaty, and some people begin by saying that it will not bring unity, and I want to try and see that they will not arrive at the position in which they will see that unity does not come.  Deputy Professor Magennis really becomes the great partitionist, because he tells us to keep our eyes on that little spot and that little line, the Council of Ireland, which is the only connection between the North and the South.  It now becomes less and less.  It is a matter now of meetings between the two Governments. That is the only connection between our people in the North-east and those of us in the South.  Anyone who adopts that particular line of argument becomes a great partitionist. It was earlier in the day that Deputy Magennis told us, in regard to the situation, that policy is much higher than legality, especially as regards an infant State such as the Saorstát has been called.  He asks us now to depend entirely on less even than legality. Surely he does not ask us to shut our eyes to the miles upon miles of border alongside of which pass daily hither and thither our Irish people?  Surely he does not ask us to shut our eyes to the fact that there is organised labour in the North connected with organised labour in the South, in which Deputy Johnson has some hope?  Surely he does not ask us to believe that there becomes to-day an impenetrable wall which will not only blot out the vision of the Irish people, one from another, but blot out, as he wants us to blot out, any faith among the people on one side of that wall in the people on the other side, or any faith that the work of those in improving conditions here will have an effect on the people on the other side?  The Irish people living in the Twenty-six Counties, or in the Six Counties, cannot hide themselves from one another, and cannot prevent themselves influencing one another. If we have any faith in the spirit of our country, people cannot help being Irish, and the great partititionist is one who would ask us to shut our eyes on one another, to have no faith, and simply to watch the vanishing <Col N="1926" /> spot which is supposed to be the only connection between the Six Counties and Saorstát Eireann.</P>

      <P>I would like to assure Deputy Mulcahy as to my position and our position in this matter.  If this Bill becomes law, we shall continue in the future as in the past to endeavour to bind the people of the two parts of Ireland into one, and not to break them apart more than they are already broken apart.  We in the Labour movement have kept our organisation as an Irish organisation.  It is the &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; Labour Party and the Trade Union Congress.  We had our annual meeting last year within the six Northern counties, but let me point out that with every month that passes the difficulties are greater and greater because of new legislation, because of different administrations, because of different bases on which the laws affecting the two countries are being made; it is becoming more and more difficult to maintain that unity, and with this accomplished the tendency will be more and more apart.  Deputy Mulcahy contended in the last part of his speech that because there are Irish in the North and Irish in the South unity must be maintained.  There are probably more Irish in England than in Ireland, and more Irish in America than in Ireland, but does the Deputy suggest that there will be political unity, and that there is a united country between England and Ireland, because of the fact that the race of origins is the same?  That cannot be the contention.  The fact is that political influences have overridden the social and even the industrial and economic influences.  Political influences are paramount, because they are directed to diversity, and not to unity.  We can see from our own experiences what is likely to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will, I believe, have within the Free State a body of opinion which, on the plea that it is necessary to bring about a unity of North and South, will urge and influence Governments here to conform in their legislation and administration to the desires and wishes of the Northern Government and Parliament, and the Northern people; to become less distinct, to conform, <Col N="1927" /> as I say, to the desires and wishes of the North in regard to policy and, I say it without any offence or suggestion of an unpleasant kind&mdash;of the sort that Deputy Hewat and Deputy Good would urge, to modify and moderate what I might call the national purpose with a view to that kind of unity to which the North might be inclined to accede.  That will be one tendency, and then we will have the other tendency, the party following the line adopted by Deputy Mulcahy who would like to make the Free State intensely Irish.  You will have in the North, I think inevitably, a minority movement, either open or subterranean, having certain Irish instincts and purposes which will try to deflect politics from that of the majority. Whether it be open or underground agitation, I think that is inevitable, and it is most undesirable, but in view of all that has happened in the country, I believe we are walking into it with our eyes open, and politics is going to be for a long time, I am afraid, and I am sorry to think it, a question of pro-Union and anti-Union with the North on those lines&mdash;pro-Irish or anti-Irish in the North.  I can see no hope of unity on these lines, and yet I feel that to be the inevitable tendency of politics in both parts of the country.</P>

      <P>He raised two matters.  He queries the description of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty which appeared in the Bill.  It is, of course, the name of the document referred to, and if the Deputy will refer to his copy of the Constitution, with the Treaty Schedule, he will see that <Col N="1928" /> the Treaty is headed &ldquo;Articles of Agreement for a Treaty.&rdquo;  That is the name of the document, and what we needed in the Bill was the actual name of the document, and there was no advertence or wish to advert to the purport or effect of the instrument; so it was purely just a question of choosing the name.  The words were inserted for the purpose of identifying a particular document.  His other point is simply, I think, the result of an oversight.  If he will refer to the Act No. 1 of 1922 he will see there in Section 3 that this Act may be cited for all purposes as the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) Act, 1922, and the Treaty was in fact given the force of law by a particular Statute of the British Parliament, and by that Act of ours, No. 1 of 1922, which endorsed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is the same way with the original Treaty securing the force of law.  There were other matters touched upon by Deputy Johnson and Deputy Magennis, and I do not know whether they call for any particular reply.  They are really simply a re-hash of the material they treated us to on the Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried hard to hold on to the facts of this position in the face of the blizzard of words that we are being subjected to.  Deputy Johnson drew a picture of one area moving steadily and swiftly away from another, and I suppose it would <Col N="1929" /> never occur to him to consider that all these arguments would apply, and some people might suggest would apply <i>a fortiori</i>, if an award of the Boundary Commission, which we would consider a favourable award, a substantial fulfilment of our hopes in the matter, had been issued, and had gone through with a greater or less degree of friction and dislocation.  Up there you would have an area, smaller, no doubt, standing out from your State system, containing a smaller proportion of Nationalists&mdash;a more homogeneous area, a more embittered area, because of the loss of territory and the friction that there had been in the course of the transfer&mdash;and all these terrible things, which Deputy Johnson has suggested are now going to happen, might be said to be even more likely to happen in the case of that more compact, more homogeneous, more embittered area which would still be standing out from your State system after the Boundary Commission had done its best for you.  Even assuming that it accepted your interpretation of its terms of reference, all these things would be so, and so, as one might suggest, <i>a fortiori.</i>  If what Deputy Johnson forecasted, and what Deputy Magennis re-echoed, is so, is it because of the following circumstances?  Is it because approximately 20,000 people, who a fortnight ago seemed likely to pass to our jurisdiction, seem now less likely to pass, and because 7,000 people, who seemed likely to pass from our jurisdiction to the jurisdiction of the Northern Government, seem now less likely to pass?  Is it because an unknown liability, about which one might speculate, seems likely to disappear, and because it is proposed to substitute for this truncated, lop-sided Council of Ireland, meetings between Ministers, meetings between Governments?  If the things which he forecasts are true, if his forecast is sound, then does it come down to this?  That the things are true and the forecast is sound because of the circumstances which I have recited.  It does not seem to hold water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy, I think, was drawing on his temporarily gloomy imagination, and he was reciting certain fears and forebodings and, rather stretching <Col N="1930" /> things.  He was attributing all these fears and forebodings to certain facts which can be very simply stated.  If this Northern people that we have heard talk about for some days past are the very hard-headed business type of people that we are so frequently told they are, is the release of this State from a liability which has been variously estimated, ranging from £19,000,000 a year to £5,000,000 a year more or less likely to attract them towards some kind of political union, if not now, in the future?  Assuming that there was no such agreement as this, and that Article V. remained, and in due course went to arbitration, and that a sum of X millions&mdash;the Deputy may have his own figure in mind; anything he likes: thirty millions, forty millions, fifty millions, sixty millions&mdash; was awarded against this State, would the mere fact of this State's inability to meet that award be an all-sufficient answer if the legal award was there against it?  Would not the mere fact that such an award had been made have some reaction?  Would it have any reaction, for instance, when we go, either at home or abroad, on the money markets, seeking to raise a loan for one constructive purpose or another, or for the relief of unemployment, in which Deputies opposite are quite naturally intensely interested?  Would it be an attraction for this hard-headed commercial Northern people to come into a State with that kind of liability after its name, supposing it were unable even to commence to clear it off?</P>
    <P>It may be that on reflection, and when the blizzard of words dies away, the Deputy will see that this Agreement, in fact, so far from postponing political union, so far from creating an atmosphere or a set of circumstances detracting from the prospect of political union, has, in fact, created a situation more helpful to that <i>desideratum.</i> He may lament the elimination of an irritant.  He may have his own idea as to the precise value which the casting out of Article V. of the Treaty has. But when he will ponder over it all, and have a look at the other side of the shield, have a look at what the position would have been, say, even under a favourable award from the Boundary <Col N="1931" /> Commission, and considered how much nearer that would have brought us to the hoped-for objective, he may decide that, after all, in spite of the heat and intense emotion which he and others have displayed, there is another side to the question and another side to the shield.</P>
    <P>I just want to add a few words.  British Ministers have been quoted here in a reverential way by Deputy Magennis&mdash;the things they said in the House of Lords; the things they said in the House of Commons: &ldquo;Now the cat is out of the bag,&rdquo; and the newspaper is produced and the <i>ipse dixit</i> quoted.  I have only to remind Deputies that the things that have been quoted are the words of British Ministers facing their Parliament, explaining, expounding and defending the elimination of this financial Article from the Treaty which they concluded with Ireland in 1921.  We have got to ask ourselves whether British Ministers, pushing their claim before arbitration, if Article V. had remained and had gone to arbitration, would be likely to say the same things in the same way.  It is not really just as powerful an argument as it looks to come in here and say that the Earl of Birkenhead, in the House of Lords, had deprecated any great attention being paid to the financial aspect of this Agreement; that there was really nothing in Article V.; that we would never have been able to pay.</P>
    <P>I have tried to point out that quite apart from our ability to pay, the mere making of an award against us under that Article would have rather serious reactions.  What it comes down to is this.  The Executive Council is sought to be indicted, is bitterly and meanly, at times, criticised for what?  Because of its inability to compel a majority of the members of the Boundary Commission to bring in an award after our own heart, or in accordance, if you like, with our own view as to what was involved by the terms of reference.  I say our own view advisedly and with emphasis, because it is not a new thing, not something sprung on us, that there is another conception of what was involved by these terms of reference. <Col N="1932" /> Right back, almost to the week in which the Treaty was signed, certainly back to the month in which it came before the British Parliament, there has been evidence of a very definite conflict of opinion, a very definite divergence of view as to what was involved by that particular proviso.  It has been there all the time.  It has been, of course, propagated and advocated on one side through all the channels at their disposal and with all the resources at their disposal, through the big influential newspapers, and so on. At any rate, it is not news nor a surprise to us that it is there.  The Executive Council is criticised and indicted because of its failure to compel&mdash;I will not say to induce&mdash;the majority of the members of the Boundary Commission to accept their particular view as against a rival view.  I think that will not stand fair examination.</P>

      <P>Arguments set up by the Deputy when we were setting up the Boundary Commission were no doubt countered and are on a par with this.  Would you have exchanged Article XII. for Article V. before the Boundary Commission was constituted? No, a thousand times no.  We would not have had the right.  As long as there was a real prospect or a real hope or chance of the interpretation which is and has been our interpretation being given to the Terms of Reference and relief forthcoming from that Commission for large Nationalist communities presently within the NorthEastern <i>enclave</i>, we would not have a right to set off one Article as against <Col N="1933" /> another, even though the material or financial gain might be there by so doing.  But it is another thing when those hopes are gone, when a particularly narrow and restricted interpretation has been placed on the terms of reference and the relief whittles down to a matter of 20,000 people going one way and 7,000 going another, when there was grave prospect of trouble all over that Northern area arising from the publication of that Award, and the creation thereby of a particular legal position.  It was another thing then to say that it was not good finance and business calculated to promote the ultimate unity of the country to set off one Article against another. That was a very different situation. This is an old story, and it is worn threadbare, and when gibes and taunts are passed as if the Treaty put a pencil into the hands of this Government to draw a line after its own heart or into the hands of our representative on the Commission to draw a line after his own heart, it is necessary that there should be some comment on the futility of that particular kind of argument and the unsoundness and the untruth of that particular kind of argument. &ldquo;Failure,&rdquo; we are told, &ldquo;blunders&rdquo;&mdash;bosthoondom, a Deputy called it&mdash;of being unable to compel Mr. Justice Feetham or Mr. Fisher, B.L., to take a particular view of the terms of reference as against the rival view.  If it were to be all done over again, with whatever wisdom and experience we have acquired within the last year, if we were faced with the situation anew, I honestly do not see what thing that we have done we ought to leave undone, or what thing we have left undone we ought to do in this whole matter. The difficulties of the last fortnight which had to be faced in a particular way, and of which this Agreement seems to us to be the only solution, were more or less inherent in the position, and if there is one consideration that seems to me to stand out from the whole thing, it is that this State and this people have good reason to congratulate themselves on having emerged so satisfactorily from such a difficult position and from a position which had such grave possibilities.</P>

      <P>I am not going to follow the Vice-President in his argument, because I appreciate the fact that everything on both sides has been said in this matter.  I want to say on my own behalf with regard to the Schedule before the Dáil that communion with myself and with others during the week-end makes me feel more strongly that my point of view holds good still.  I want to make my protest against the statement of the President to-day with regard to opposition to this measure&mdash;at least, as far as I am concerned.  I want to say that I think it was unworthy of the President to make charges against Deputies. I speak for myself in opposing this measure.  After all, while the Press may be at liberty to do that sort of thing&mdash;and we have heard the President himself saying in the Dáil that the people of the country can read between the lines of what they read in the daily Press, and perhaps we will probably have the President saying that again in the Dáil before another month&mdash;when it comes to the President of the Executive Council making suggestions about Deputies' motives in a matter like this, I think it is hardly fair.  Deputies have their responsibilities in this matter just as well as the President and every member of the Executive Council, and it is the right of Deputies in the Dáil to give expression to their opinions.  When they do that candidly and openly it is the right of the Opposition to reply.  They have had their chance.  They have had their opportunity and I have no doubt they feel they have suitably replied. My motive in this matter has been perfectly honest.  I protest against the statement of the President to-day.  With regard to what is contained in the Schedule, part of my protest against this Bill was that, with regard to our Nationalist population in the North-east corner, we have nothing definite written into the Bill as to what their position is to be in the future.  There was a suggestion, I think, on the part of the Vice-President that there were certain things that were not in this, but we were not told what these were in reality or what they might be in the future.  At the moment <Col N="1935" /> I have in mind the position of Northern Nationalists, and I think I am within my right in drawing the attention of the Dáil to it now, inasmuch as I think we will not be in a position to discuss that in the Dáil at any future period after we have disposed of them by the passing of this measure.</P>
      <P>It is known to me that a number of our Nationals in Northern Ireland, during the terror here&mdash;a number of them, I say, I can recall a half dozen of them&mdash;have had their property destroyed. A half a dozen of these cases have been brought to my notice, men whose property was destroyed and who sued for compensation.  In the Northern Courts of Justice it was decided, in a very short period, that inasmuch as the destruction of their premises was a military necessity, they were not entitled to get any compensation whatever. I have one case in mind where the value of the destroyed property put up by the claimant was about £20,000. I have another case of £12,000, and a couple of other cases of £6,000 and £7,000.  The position these people occupy to-day is the position of the refugee, driven from Northern Ireland without any home and without any compensation.  No citizen of Saorstát Eireann is in a similar position to-day. Regardless of what side they might have taken in the fight, they have been compensated or they will be compensated. But our people in the North of Ireland are in a different and very difficult position, I suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that this is a matter that cannot be disregarded by the Executive Council or by the Dáil. These people stood for Irish Nationality under great difficulties.  They fought their fight and they lost.  I hold that they have the right to compensation that has been conceded to every citizen here in the Saorstát.  I say it is the duty of the Executive Council to see that compensation is given to these people, and that they are treated in a manner that will be fair, just and equitable.  It is up to us, I think, if the Dáil is going to declare that for some time to come these people are to be left to the tender mercies of the Northern Government, <Col N="1936" /> who so far have failed to recognise their just claims, to see that we shall not and must not take up the same attitude in this matter.  I hold there is a grave and serious responsibility on the Executive Council, particularly on the men who negotiated this Treaty to which they are asking us to agree.</P>
    <P>I think I am perfectly within my rights in bringing this before the notice of the Dáil.  Although we have no written guarantees in this Bill as to what treatment our people are to get in the North, we are asked to believe that things will be better.  Well, we hope that they will be better.  There are times when there must be something even more positive than a mere expression of hope of better things for the future.  Unquestionably there is a responsibility on the Nationalists of Ireland to see that the people who stood up for Nationality under very great difficulties in other parts of Ireland are not now going to be let down.</P>

      <P>I want to refer very briefly to one Article of the Schedule which has not received from the Dáil the attention it deserves.  On the Second Reading I called attention to Article IV. I refer to it now again. The Ministers, in the course of their replies, have not, up to the present at any rate, given any satisfactory explanation as to why this Article appears in this particular Agreement. The President, and, I think, the Minister for Finance also, referred very briefly to the point that was made about this 10 per cent. being increased in the matter of these payments, and they said they felt that they had drawn the provisions of this particular Act very tightly.  They thought at the time when they were bringing that Bill before the Dáil that perhaps the sums that would have to be paid in compensation under it would be much larger than what ultimately transpired to be the case.  Therefore, it was necessary for them to be particularly careful in making the provisions of the Act as tight as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that that kind of argument would be perfectly legitimate, perfectly reasonable and understandable, if we had the President, or the Minister, <Col N="1937" /> coming here to introduce into the Dáil, of his own free will and volition, an Act to revise this Damage to Property Act.  There has been no explanation given as to why it should enter into this Bill as part of this Agreement. Why should it enter in here?  On various occasions we have revised Acts in the Dáil when we found from experience that it would have been better if they were passed in a different way. There was nothing, so far as I know, to prevent a similar thing being done on this occasion, if the reasons were such as were put forward by the President. Seeing it here in this Agreement, knowing the history behind the movement, as I mentioned on a previous occasion, and the agitation that was carried on in England in the columns of the &ldquo;Morning Post,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Daily Mail&rdquo; and other newspapers, it is a different matter.  That agitation was carried on with the intention of showing that we had been unfair to certain classes of people in this country in our legislation.  When one remembers that, and then finds this Article in this Agreement as part of a bargain, one cannot help feeling that the other signatories to the Agreement did ask and did insist that such legislation should be promoted in the Dáil.  If that were so&mdash;and it will require some other explanation than what the President has given us to convince me that it was not so&mdash;then it looks very much to me like unwarrantable interference in our internal affairs on the part of the British Government.  These are our people.  They are under our jurisdiction, and I do not see why we should be asked, and why our Ministers should be asked, to bind themselves to the British Government to promote legislation which is entirely concerned with internal matters and the internal affairs of our own country.</P>
    <P>The point was made by one or two speakers that nothing was done and nothing was written into this Treaty with regard to special concessions for our Northern Nationals.  I think the reply to that given by one of the Ministers was that, although no such thing was written in, these things would come in the course of good-will; that it was an agreement between friends, and there was good-will presumed <Col N="1938" /> on all sides; that these things and these concessions that one would naturally look for would come as a matter of course, and would arise out of this friendship created.  Might not one say equally well that this legislation would have been promoted out of similar good-will?  Are we to conclude that Great Britain insisted, on behalf of her own special class that she was interested in, that it would be written into the Agreement in black and white, and that we were so trustful that we did not insist on any such action as this?  Now I think we should be told definitely if this legislation was such as the Minister says, and if the Minister felt that it was such, why should he have thought it necessary to write it into this Agreement?  The Minister was perfectly free to come to the Dáil and to make the case that he felt in the circumstances should be made, and then there could be done what was right and fair; but why was it necessary to write it into this Article when the bargain was being made?  I think it is necessary for the Minister to explain that to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the last point first.  Before I went to London I had received many representations about the compensation which had been awarded.  Those representations were to the effect that the compensation, generally speaking, was not as good as had been given under the Wood-Renton, or the Shaw Commission, as it was called.  I had visits from some people, and in one particular instance I had a deputation from people who made a very strong case in respect to the compensation that had been awarded to them, and which, if the works that they proposed were to be carried out, would impose a very heavy burden on the business community. I refer to the O'Connell Street area.  I saw the Minister for Finance on this matter before going to London. The relation between this and the Agreement is a simple one.  Unless Article V. were out of the way, I would not have felt justified in making such a concession as this, even though there was the difference between the awards made in respect of damage done since <Col N="1939" /> the 11th July, 1921, and the 12th May, 1923.  With Article V. out of the way, there was a case for such a concession as this.  Deputies know quite well there was a difference between the sums awarded by the Wood-Renton Commission and the awards under our Act.</P>
      <P>As regards the case mentioned by Deputy Baxter, that certain people in the North have not got compensation, although they suffered heavy loss, I admit that is so.  I have heard of some cases, but the fault cannot be shelved by those people on us.  After all, civilisation provides certain means for ventilating grievances.  If people nurse their grievances, keep them to themselves and endeavour to throw the responsibility on the shoulders of those against whom they wish to make some political charge, no good purpose is served.  With that procedure compare the businesslike procedure of other people who had complaints.  Many complaints in the case of other people were grossly exaggerated.  At any rate, they found some means of ventilating their grievances.  They formed an association to deal with their cases and they concentrated on having public attention focussed to their claims, including the people in England, and, I suppose, also in Northern Ireland. They got sympathy.</P>
      <P>Now, what was done by the people to whom Deputy Baxter refers?  Do they expect to be spoon-fed all their lives?  Is it not only fair that they would make up some sort of organisation and concentrate upon showing definitely to the world that they were not fairly treated?  I mentioned that on one occasion to somebody who came to me from the North.  I said this agitation that was going on in England was to a large extent a political agitation against us and was directed towards charging us with not having given sufficient compensation for loss sustained and for loss suffered by the people.  There is a case there in the North and those who are our friends could at least say: &ldquo;This is not the fault of the Government of the Irish Free State alone; it can also be alleged against somebody else.&rdquo;  Nothing, however, was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1940" /> We cannot manage to remedy the ills of everybody in every part of Ireland. People ought to try and help themselves a little bit in those matters. Probably half a dozen cases were brought to my notice.  I expect that in some of those cases there were some exaggerations, just as there were some gross exaggerations in other cases. People made complaints of being badly treated by us and they complained of our Act being badly drawn.</P>
    <P>In some criticism regarding the law passed here it was alleged that under the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Code which was in existence prior to some amendments that were made to that Act in, I think it was, 1919-20, compensation would be paid for consequential damage.  That is not true. Consequential losses were compensated in one case illegally.  A decree was given for consequential damage in another case and it was reversed on appeal. I think it was Lord Justice Holmes was the judge who reversed the appeal and I believe the last holder of the office of Lord Chancellor here, Sir John Ross, expressed himself very strongly on the point that it was illegal to give a decree for consequential loss.  But because one illegal decision was given on that, we were pilloried for having excluded it from our compensation.</P>
    <P>Those are the two principal matters referred to in the last two speeches. I had intended to refer to the 10 per cent. increase.  Article V. still remaining undetermined, no accommodation whatever would have been given by us in respect to the Damage to Property Act.  I hope that point is clear and understood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess the President has not satisfied me on this point.  He has shown a relationship between Article V. and the increase of 10 per cent. that I quite accept. In other words, Article V. being out of the way, there was a case for a revision of the Damage to Property Act.</P>

      <P>There was a case for the President to come to the <Col N="1941" /> Dáil, assuming Article V. were passed, and this agreement had gone through, and point out that now that Article V. was out of the way and they knew what commitments they had to meet, they could afford to be somewhat generous.  I want to know why he thought it necessary to embody that definite promise in this agreement unless&mdash;I put the question to him&mdash;the British, as a condition of getting Article V. out of the way, insisted on it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I cannot understand why the offer could have been made either to the British Government or to the Northern Government when it was a case where our own people here, for whom we have the right to legislate, were involved.  The President could have come quite legitimately to the Dáil and said: &ldquo;Now that Article V. is out of the way we will have a more generous Act to meet the cases of hardship that have been put up to us.&rdquo;  It does not satisfy me that it was necessary to put this in unless the explanation is, and the President denies this, that the British or somebody else insisted that it should come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Numbers of cases have been reported to us.  Many discussions have taken place as to the alleged sufferings of certain loyalists under the awards that have been granted by the Courts.  Other cases have been reported to me, but, as I have already said, it was apparent to me that in one district alone the burden falling upon these people, after they had got their compensation, was rather more than they could be reasonably expected to bear if the State were in a position to come to their assistance. Now, the State would not have been able to come to their assistance unless we got accommodation in other directions, and the accommodation we have got is in connection with Article 2 of the Agreement.  As regards what Deputy Baxter and others said, there were three speeches delivered here this evening.  The three of them certainly hurt me very much, more in respect to what was said about other people than <Col N="1942" /> what was said about myself.  I do not mind much what anybody says in connection with anything I do.  It has no effect on me absolutely, but I do feel it when a reference is made to other people, and I felt it more particularly in respect to other people this evening. I did feel very keenly the expression &ldquo;fraudulent&rdquo; used by Deputy Magennis, and I also felt rather keenly what Deputy Esmonde said when he belittled some of the documents that we have produced here&mdash;the terminology that is in them.  Now, we have always taken the most extreme care to have these documents drawn with a view to preserving the integrity of our position&mdash;never by word or deed or act or anything else to give away a single iota of the position that we got when the Treaty was taken over.  That has been our aim and our intention, and allegations of fraudulency against those who do their best in connection with public business do not come well certainly from a member or a past member of our own Party.  If I said anything which gave offence, apart from the repudiation I gave to those charges and allegations, I regret it, but I desire to say that I resent the remarks that have been made, not as far as I am concerned myself, because I do not mind what allegations are made personally against me, but I do when they are made against others, some of whom are dead.  I think it is unbecoming that these things should have been said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with what the President has stated with regard to the first point that was raised.  He admits himself that this matter has been brought to his notice. I take it that we will be practically finished with this position when this Bill is passed in the Dáil, but we are not finished with the position of a number of people who stood for Irish nationality in the North of Ireland, some of whom are now refugees in other parts of the country and who have lost their property through the law as it stands in Northern Ireland. They have not been able to get any compensation whatever.  The position is that they are without home or compensation. <Col N="1943" /> Now are we going to disregard that fact?  Is the attitude of the President this&mdash;that inasmuch as these people have not organised to do something for themselves, as he says&mdash; people some of whom are not able to go back to their homes and who are refugees at the moment in other parts of the country&mdash;that they are to be left in that position?  What could they do by way of organisation when they were up against a Government and against the law that denies them any consideration whatever?  Are we to adopt the attitude that that law is fair and just, and are we to make no effort on their behalf?  Are we to absolve ourselves from all responsibility in the matter and accept the attitude of the Northern Government towards our nationals as being right, or are we to do anything about it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter on Second Reading, and the President's reply seemed to me to be a most extraordinary one.  The President's idea seems to be because those people were unable, or because they were not organised, and not shouting their grievances from the house-tops and were not able to get the service of the Press, because they had not the &ldquo;Daily Mail&rdquo; and &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; to proclaim their grievances, they are not to be considered.  Surely the President knows these people are scattered, not only over Ireland, but over England and Scotland as well.  I know some cases where these people are hard up, and not able to get enough to eat, and surely they cannot be expected to obtain the same publicity for their grievances as the loyalists were.  I thought the President had admitted that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I must have some evidence of an organised case.  That is not for us.  They have representatives of their own who should raise this in another place, and it is not really a matter that I would be entitled to take up on the evidence before me.  Three or four cases of hardship have been mentioned.  I know of several cases of hardship amongst our <Col N="1944" /> own people in which I am not able to do anything.</P>

      <P>This is plainly one of those things we ought not to discuss upon this Schedule.  As a matter of fact, I think it would be a quite fair ruling from the Chair, seeing that we have passed Section 1, to say that the Schedule cannot be discussed when a motion is made that the Schedule be the Schedule of the Bill. I did not rule that way, because the Bill is one of a remarkable character, and I allowed Deputy Baxter to put a question as to the Northern Nationalists because of the extraordinary circumstances, but it is not in order.  It is plain to everybody that it is not in order as well as it is to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, I submit, a point in regard to the promise, on the part of the Government, in respect of its own nationals, calling forth reciprocal action on the part of another party to the Agreement.  That is the point which is made, and it seems to me that the President has not made it plain.  If it is not in order to deal with the matter I will not pursue it.  But when there are two Articles to the Agreement which is in question, not merely empowering but binding the Free State Government to do certain things in regard to compensation, when that is the agreement with another Government which is in the same position, or should be in the same position, regarding its citizens, then the discussion of reciprocity in the matter might be allowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>It was allowed on the Second Stage, and it was in order on Section 1.  As a matter of fact, no discussion whatever is in order on the Schedule, and, plainly, if the question of reciprocity and the question of what ought to be in the Schedule, as contrasted with what is in the Schedule, which has been agreed to by the vote on Section 1, were in order there would be no finality at all as to what could be discussed.</P>

      <P>I want to make quite clear why I divide upon the motion, so that it will be in the form of a record in the Journals of the House.  I have said that I am against the Bill, and I am not satisfied with simply having a record in the Official Reports.  I want it recorded in the Journals of the House that I, at any rate, was against this Bill at every stage, and that is why I now call for a division on this motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">

      <P>I feel it my duty to place before the House my reasons for the attitude I have adopted towards this Bill.  I will not detain the House at this hour, but I will give my reasons for not supporting the Bill.  I believe that Article XII. was specially put into the Treaty to safeguard the position of the Nationalists in the North.  The importance of Article XII. was made clear by Lord Birkenhead's statement in the House of Lords this week, when he said that if they had not agreed to Article XII., the Treaty would not have been signed.  When the Treaty <Col N="1949" /> would not have been signed by the Irish plenipotentiaries if Article XII. had not been included, it is clear that the importance of the Article must have been very great.  If the Boundary Commission went outside its terms of reference, if it went outside Article XII., or if the Article itself was its terms of reference, it is clear that the award of the majority of the Commissioners was certainly not in accord with the evidence placed before them.  I believe that the Executive had a record of the evidence submitted to the Commission from some of those who went before it, and that it was made clear to them by some of those who did give evidence that the Commission did not act and were not prepared to act in accordance with the terms of reference.  Further, Judge Feetham himself stated, following certain lines that were placed before him in the evidence of one of the most important men in the North of Ireland, a man who holds one of the most prominent positions there, that this would interfere with the Northern Parliament and, if agreed to by him, might succeed in reducing their territory, or if not their territory, that it would injure their trade, their power and their future possibilities.  It strikes me that the greater part of the evidence made it clear that a large number of the people in the North wanted to exercise their right, the right which they believed they held under Article XII., to come under the Free State Government, and I say that Judge Feetham not alone did not act according to the terms of reference when he refused to act on the evidence before him and when he allowed other influences to prevail.  I say that that proves to us that Judge Feetham did not act as a chairman should, and did not give his award according to the evidence submitted to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When such information came before the Executive Council, as it must have come, I say that that was the time for them to take action.  They ought to have been made aware of the position and of the possibility that the award would be injurious to those in the North of Ireland for whom they were acting and whose interests they were <Col N="1950" /> to safeguard as far as possible, and that that was the time for them to get into consultation with the people in the North to consider the matter and to determine what was best to be done. Unfortunately the people in the South, as well as those in the North who were interested, were lulled into a sense of false confidence.  They believed that justice would be done.  If justice was not likely to be done, I say it was up to the Executive Council to take steps at once to see, while taking into consideration geographical and economic conditions, that these people were not to be wronged and were not to be placed in a false position.  The rights of citizenship are theirs, and by the award the rights of citizenship have been denied to them.</P>
    <P>I refused to support this Bill on the ground that, to my mind, the Executive were not sent from the Dáil to London as plenipotentiaries.  They went as members of an Executive Council when an unfortunate state of affairs had arisen, which possibly they did not foresee, and which I honestly believe they did not expect.  But I say they did not go across as plenipotentiaries with the authority of the Dáil; they were not sent as plenipotentiaries to amend the Treaty.  They merely went as Ministers of the Executive Council, and I say that they should not have concluded anything with the representatives of the British Government and of Northern Ireland without submitting it to us, giving the Dáil an opportunity of considering it and perhaps helping them to amend it still further, as the majority of Deputies believe it could have been amended.  I say that they had not that power, and I say that the Dáil itself is entitled, as representing the people, to have any Bill amending the Constitution placed before it in the first instance for its consideration before it is brought in at a moment's notice.</P>

      <P>When this matter came on first, the Minister for Justice said that it was necessary to have it put through without delay.  I stated that there should neither be undue <Col N="1951" /> delay nor undue haste with this Bill. I believe that there was no possibility whatever of any injury being done if more time had been taken.  By this agreement England is getting rid of the subsidies she has been paying to the Specials in the North.  The North is indebted to her for the building of their Parliament House, and moneys have been coming from England to the North for other reasons.  England, I am quite certain, with her keen appreciation of finance, did not wish to continue&mdash;I will not say spoon-feeding&mdash; helping out the North.  She does not usually permit any of her money to be used in a foolish way.  But I do not think she would have pressed her opposition, if it was a question of getting this signed, to giving the people an opportunity, or their representatives an opportunity, of considering this matter in all its bearings.  I do not believe that the North would have been very keen on pressing this matter, considering the state of her trade and the depressed condition of her industries. Having regard to these circumstances, I do not think the North would have been keen on pressing for an immediate answer, and, as I have stated, I do not think England would have pressed either.  There has been a great deal said about the question of the financial advantages to Ireland.  We have been told by the Childers Commission, and by other authorities, that England owes us possibly £3,000,000. The result of that Commission might have been like the result of most Commissions, when the findings were favourable to Ireland.  The result might have been nil, but there is one thing which should not be forgotten, and that is, that England holds three ports in Ireland which, to her, are of the greatest commercial advantage. England has three naval bases in this country, and I am quite certain that England would put a fairly high financial value on those three ports.  I am not aware that the value of those ports has been taken into consideration in connection with this Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of Ireland's liability and her capacity to pay in connection with the War Debt, I think <Col N="1952" /> you have heard sufficient on that subject already.  Sufficient, I think, has been said to convince us that England's idea of Ireland's indebtedness was not going to count for anything.  I believe that against the advantages we have gained we have not properly estimated the considerations in connection with the North.  In our present state of tiredness and weariness, I am not going to go over all the points raised by the various speakers, but this I say, that no advantages are apparent to me in the Bill that in any way counteract the disadvantage to our people in the North and the possibilities of other trouble that might arise.  Why I have not voted against the Bill I can make clear by two points.  (Interruption by Deputy Leonard.)  I have heard two speeches in this House, one from Deputy Thrift and one from Deputy Cooper&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This debate has gone on from 3 o'clock and we had better not now, at a few minutes to 11 o'clock, get into a wrangle over this question.  I did not hear Deputy Leonard say anything.

      <P>The matter does not affect me, and, if a remark of that sort was made, I am sure there must have been some misunderstanding.  As I was stating at the time the interruption took place, there are two points that prevent me from voting against this Bill.  One is the statement made by some of my fellow-Deputies, which would make for a happier spirit for the future.  I have all my life supported <Col N="1954" /> a spirit of goodwill and toleration and supported the coming together of all Irishmen for the building up of their country.  With me that was not a sentiment of to-day or yesterday. It is not a pious aspiration. It is my belief that the future of Ireland is going to depend on getting the people, North and South, to work together. The only thing I would ask is that that spirit which Deputy Cooper and Deputy Sir James Craig find amongst the Catholics of the South, when dealing with their Protestant and Presbyterian countrymen, may be cultivated by the majority in the North towards their Catholic fellow-countrymen, because it is this spirit that will decide the future of Ireland.  Ireland is for the whole of us, and I feel that this division has been due to outside circumstances and that it is not of Irish parentage.  That is one of my reasons for not voting against this Bill. I do not want to put any obstacle in the way of bringing about that cooperation. I should have wished that the Executive Council, or the President on behalf of that Council, was in a position to give a more authoritative statement from Sir James Craig, the Prime Minister of the Northern Parliament, as to the position of those of the minority under his jurisdiction in the North.</P>
      <P>I do not think anything would be gained by my going further, but I hope that the expression of opinion given in this House regarding the treatment of the minority in the Free State will induce Sir James Craig to secure for the minority in the North equal right of citizenship&mdash;equal right on the Councils there, equal right to education, and equal right in all other respects. That would be only as it should be in a free country.  Finally, may I say that my strongest reason for not voting against this Bill is that I have refused to allow any point of vantage that we have secured for the building up of the Irish nation to be lost.  I do not see my way to try and undo anything gained by the Treaty, even though it be injured in part.</P>

    <P>Since the publication in the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; of the line which forecasted the position of the Boundary Commission, or rather which attempted to forecast it, many representations have been made to the Executive Council as to the dangers that might be apprehended if any such alteration or transfer of territory took place.  That information has been supplemented since by officials of the State, placed in a position to acquaint the Executive Council of the possibilities of disorder and discontent, and in almost every case in which we received deputations, particularly from one particular portion of the line, it was made plain that there was danger of a breach of the public peace, and any such outbreak which might occur would have very dangerous reactions on the whole situation. In the light of that information practically all the steps that have been taken by the Executive Council since that date were taken with a view to preserving the public peace.  Now, those considerations being present to our minds we deemed it to be our duty to put down this motion so that this question should be settled definitely, once and for all.  Accordingly, I move it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The President's reasons for so great a debasement, I may say, of the Constitution are utterly inadequate.  He told us that, since the publication of a certain article in the &ldquo;Morning Post,&rdquo; he has been aware of the possibilities of danger to the public peace.  That was several weeks ago.  Yet now it is said on this day of December that there is so great a danger to public peace that it is necessary that this amendment to the Constitution shall take place, without giving any opportunity to the people to express their views upon it. I say the explanations of the Minister are most inadequate.  I think it is <Col N="1959" /> simply special pleading for a cause which is not justified by the facts.  He has not given us any evidence at all that there is any more danger to-day than there was a week ago, a fortnight ago, or three weeks ago, or that there is any more danger to-day than there will be in a week, a fortnight, a month or three months hence.</P>
      <P>Article XLVII. of the Constitution provides for a certain public expression of opinion, in definite circumstances, in respect of any legislation. It adds a proviso that &ldquo;these provisions shall not apply to money Bills or to such Bills as shall be declared by both Houses to be necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety.&rdquo;  It is well within the knowledge of Deputies&mdash; those who were present at the discussions of the Constitution Bill&mdash;that a provision of that kind was inserted with a view to meeting great emergencies where there was a risk of immediate danger to the public peace. But this danger the President speaks of, he says it was imminent.  If it is imminent since the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; issued its article, it is obvious to the Dáil that the immediate preservation of the public peace is not the issue.  It is not for the immediate preservation of the public peace that this motion is being moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President last week quite definitely declared his willingness to refer this Bill to the people if 100,000 signatures were collected and submitted bona fide&mdash;genuine signatures.  He refuses now to fulfil that undertaking and to allow opportunities to get the 100,000 signatures.  He desires to prevent public opinion expressing itself upon this Bill in the manner provided for by the Constitution.  He can carry this motion undoubtedly, and he can carry it no doubt in the Seanad, but he is carrying it in the face of his own promises and his own undertaking to hold up the Bill if 100,000 signatures of protest could be provided.  I say that he has not shown to the Dáil that there is any danger to the public peace such as that visualised in the proviso to Article XLVII.  Such danger as he has spoken of is a danger which cannot be immediate inasmuch as he says it <Col N="1960" /> has been hanging over the country since the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; published its articles.  Why was there a danger then?  Because there was likely to be a change in the boundary.  If this Bill is held in suspense for the period provided by the Constitution, the boundary will remain as it is, and there will be no danger to the public peace on that score. Consequently, I say the Minister has not proved to the House the necessity for this rushing method of changing the Constitution.</P>

      <P>The referendum was expressly provided for a situation such as this.  It is an appeal to the electorate against decisions taken in the legislature with a view to determining how far, if at all, a majority vote in the legislature is indicative of the people.  To block an appeal to the people upon this measure will be well understood by the people.  On a famous occasion when war was declared, Walpole said: &ldquo;You ring your bells to-day; by and by you will wring your hands.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The remarks of Deputy Johnson and of Deputy Professor Magennis were properly addressed to Ministers, but I, speaking as a Northerner, with an intimate knowledge of the facts of the case which Deputy Johnson has made, cannot confirm the argument which he made against the President. If the boundary line forecasted by the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; were enforced it would be a very serious matter for the constituency that I come from and for other constituencies along the Northern border.  I can assure the House that since the debates began on this question my colleagues and myself in Donegal have had sufficient evidence to prove to us that if a referendum were held the votes of the people we represent would go in favour of the action taken by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated on 7th December that I was prepared if I got 100,000 bona fide signatures in accordance with the Constitution to have a referendum.  It is right to say that at the moment I made that statement I was not aware of the fact that three months might elapse before I could get them.  If I had been aware of that at the time I would not have made the statement.  I find on looking up the Official Report that Deputy Baxter asked me if I was prepared to hold up the passage of this measure until the decision of the people could be obtained. I replied: &ldquo;The necessity does not arise.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now this measure, in my view, is just as necessary to pass, and to pass without delay, as the Land Bill and the same resolution was passed when the Land Bill was before this House&mdash;that it was necessary for the immediate preservation of public safety and peace.  I got something like 60 communications since this matter was published, and of the 60, three were against the Bill.  I believe I got one from Limerick against it.  I got two from the area of the Six Counties. I got many from the Six Counties favouring this proposal.  Most of the communications I received were from Ireland.  At least two were from America.  Some, but not many, were from England.  If it is to be a success at all&mdash;and Deputies opposite have admitted that they are not taking the line that they are going to prevent it being a success&mdash;it ought to be done at once, and we ought not to hold over the people of Donegal for three or four months or possibly even a longer space of time this measure as a sort of Mahomet's coffin&mdash;somewhere between heaven and earth, but neither one nor the other.  That is a situation which I certainly would not like to take responsibility for, and I am satisfied from what information is at our disposal that it is our duty to pass this resolution. It is the duty of the Executive Council at any rate to propose the resolution here for adoption.  From other sources at our disposal it has been very plainly asserted that the people of this <Col N="1962" /> country are in favour, absolutely in favour, by huge majorities of this proposal.</P>

      <P>There has been remarkable solidity from the Independents. As far as I know, no member of the Independent Party has voted against it.  There has been a remarkable majority in the case of the Farmers' Party.  I take it that these Deputies go to their constituents and that they are in touch with them and know what their constituents want.  I am satisfied that, apart from what I call for the moment the official Labour Party and the Anti-Treaty Party, that there is no great support against it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No; but my recollection is that I had a message from Meath on the matter, and a Deputy who sits for Westmeath, at any rate, said that 80 per cent of his constituents were in favour of it, although he voted against it himself.  Well, the risk we are invited to take is the risk of discontent, of disorder, and possibly even worse than that.  That is not a <Col N="1963" /> risk I am prepared to take.  All the time while this Act would be in suspension, if it were suspended, it would be open to the Boundary Commission to bring in their report, and I am not going to take that risk.</P>

The President has given as a reason for refusing the referendum that there has been an expression of opinion from various quarters of the <Col N="1964" /> House in favour of this measure.

He was awarded a temporary pension of 42/- a week for the period from the 29th March, 1924, to the 30th June, 1925, pending further examination and investigation. Medical examination revealed the fact that he was suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Act does not provide for diseases incurred <Col N="1837" /> on active service, and the question as to whether Mr. Bohan's present disability is due to the wound he received in 1922 has been engaging the attention of my Department.  Arrangements are being made to bring Mr. Bohan to Dublin for special examination, after which it is hoped an early decision will be reached in his case.</P>
