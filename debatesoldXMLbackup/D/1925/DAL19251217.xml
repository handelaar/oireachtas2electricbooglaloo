I would hope that the Tribunal proposed to be appointed to investigate prices, as approved yesterday in the Dáil, will obtain any information of this kind relating to articles of common consumption which is necessary.</P>

      <P>In the absence of Dr. Hennessy, I would like to ask whether any specified time is to be given to the Committee to bring in its report, or is the Committee to be empowered to continue its sittings, if it wishes, for a year or eighteen months?  This Bill got an overwhelming majority in its favour in the Dáil, but the Committee now says that it requires more evidence and wants papers and records.  It would, therefore, be able to hold up this Bill and prevent it becoming an Act for a long time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. RODDY Mr. RODDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Committee, I desire to say that before the 15th February we would, we think, be able to obtain all the necessary evidence for our purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>It was hoped that the original Bill before the Dáil would become law by the 1st January, but now it is proposed to hold it back until February. I do not mind when the Bill becomes law, but what I want to know is whether the Committee can hold up business, in favour of which there was an overwhelming majority in the Dáil. I do not think that a committee of eleven should have power to hold up a Bill which the Dáil was practically unanimous in adopting.  I will be satisfied if a guarantee is given by the Chairman of the Committee, who asks for this report to be agreed to, that he will have all the evidence necessary by the 16th February and that he will then be in a position to bring the Bill before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be impossible, in my opinion, for the Chairman to give such a guarantee.  The Standing Orders set forth that measures brought in by private Deputies shall go to a committee.  Should a Bill introduced by a private Deputy pass its Second Reading it shall, without question, go to a committee.  Deputy Lyons <Col N="2067" /> has no grievance there.  If he wished the Bill to be retained in the House he should have persuaded the Government to bring it in.  The Committee is in duty bound to examine the measure in all its aspects, its implications and possible consequences, and it is impossible for the Chairman to give a guarantee, on behalf of the Committee, as to the time when they will be finished with the Bill.  I do not anticipate any prolonged inquiry, but it is impossible to give the guarantee asked for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Johnson that it would be very rash to give a guarantee, as we might have to come to the Dáil and ask for more time.  Deputy Lyons talks about holding up the Bill for twelve months. It is really only for a month.  The fact is that many of us are doing too much work.  Deputy Johnson is Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, and is also on the Committee of Procedure and Privileges, as well as on this Committee.  I am also on the Public Accounts Committee and I believe that I have been appointed on the SubCommittee to revise Standing Orders, and, I understand, my name has been put forward in connection with the Committee on Prices, and I am also on this Committee.  Does Deputy Lyons think that this measure is of such importance to the whole Saorstát that it should take precedence over everything else in order that it may be reported in a fortnight?  Nobody could give a binding pledge on such a matter. No one knows what further evidence it may be necessary to take.  I anticipate that, with reasonable luck, we ought to be able to send the Bill back to the Dáil within a month of the resumption of the sitting.  I would be no party to try, by obstruction in Committee, to hold up any measure, and I should object to it as strongly as Deputy Lyons. The Committee could not pledge themselves definitely, as they might have to ask for further time.  I think Deputy Roddy could take a motion by Deputy Lyons for the Committee to report by the 15th February.  We could then come in and make our case and it would be open to Deputy Lyons and Dr. Hennessy to state their objections.</P>

      <P>I think I can make this matter clear.  Standing Order 62, which deals with motions for the appointment of special committees, says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Such motion shall, save as otherwise provided in these Standing Orders, specifically state the terms of reference to the committees, define the powers devolved upon them, nominate the members to act upon them, state the quorum in each case, and, if necessary, fix a date upon which they shall report back to the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  I think it refers to all special committees. At any rate the Dáil, having appointed a special committee on this Bill can fix a date, whether under this Standing Order or generally.  The Committee has asked for power to send for persons, papers, and records, and if Deputy Lyons agrees to move and if the Chairman of the Committee accepts a motion to the effect that the Committee shall report back to the Dáil by the 16th February, which will be a Tuesday, it will ensure that on the 16th February the Chairman of the Committee must come to the Dáil and make a report, if they have concluded their business, or ask for more time.  It would ensure that, roughly, within a month after the resumption after Christmas, the matter would be again before the Dáil, either on report or on request for further time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to enable the Minister for Finance to acquire 50,000 shares in the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland, to exercise all the rights and powers of a shareholder therein, and to dispose of his holding or any portion of it at any time he thinks fit.  As the Company is a private concern and not a public undertaking, the Bill does not give him any privileges other than these, with this exception only, that he may nominate two directors to represent him on the Board of the Company.  The present directors are acquainted with the terms of the Bill and have agreed to its terms generally, including the provision for the nomination of directors by the Minister.  Since the Company is a private enterprise and the Minister proposes to acquire a substantial portion of its share capital only in order to establish its credit in its earlier and critical stages, it would follow that he will be free to withdraw from it once it is successfully launched.  His right, however, to nominate two directors is exercisable only so long as he holds shares, but is extinguished only when he has disposed of his entire holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The shares are issued at par and as the Minister is to acquire 50,000 shares, the Bill provides for the issue of £50,000 from the Central Fund for its growing produce.  In view of the comparative smallness of the amount, it has not been considered advisable to issue any securities for the purpose of finding money.  No expenditure other than the outlay on the shares is contemplated or provided for.  All dividends on the shares held by the Minister, and the proceeds of the sale of any of his shares are to be paid into the Central Fund.  The Company was incorporated in July last with a share capital of £250,000, divided into 250,000 shares of £1 each, with power to increase the amount of the capital, and with power to issue any shares of the original or new capital, with any <Col N="2070" /> preference in the payment of dividends or distribution of assets over any other shares.  The subscription list was open from the 27th to 31st July, and over £50,000 worth was subscribed immediately. It has always been proposed, since the time the Company was first mooted, that a large block of shares should be allotted to subscribers in America, and 50,000 was decided as a reasonable number for this purpose. Indeed, the original idea of forming such a company as this came from America, and, accordingly, after the subscription list was closed here, a representative of the Company (Mr. Smith Gordon) went to the United States and succeeded in arranging for the full amount (£50,000) to be subscribed there.  Of the total share capital of the Company, exclusive of the amount to be subscribed by the Minister for Finance, slightly over £100,000 has been subscribed.</P>
    <P>The minimum subscription upon which the directors could proceed to allotment was £100,000.  The first directors of the Company are :&mdash;Messrs. David Telford, James Douglas, W. Lombard Murphy, Hugh Kennedy and John Mackie.  Of these, Messrs. Douglas and Kennedy are the Government nominees.  The powers taken in the Memorandum and Articles of Association are very wide.  I will summarise them very shortly: (a) Underwriting, financing and investment of all kinds; (b) lending and borrowing; (c) banking trust, guaranty, title business; (d) management, promotion, purchase and sale of companies, undertakings, property and other business; (e) brokerage, agency and commission business. The main object is to help to finance industrial and commercial undertakings in the Saorstát, and in particular to make loans, the service of which has been guaranteed by the Government under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  Similar industrial Trust Companies have been established, and have operated with success, in most European countries, including Finland, and in America and Japan, and the need for such institution has frequently been experienced here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that this is a <Col N="2071" /> measure that ought not to pass without some further explanation.  As far as I understand it, I think it is quite desirable and even admirable, but it is well to point out that it is a departure, and probably a good departure, from the normal.  I am not quite sure whether I understood the President aright, and that he said one of the purposes was to enable this Company to make loans to assist in financing industrial enterprises for which loans have been guaranteed under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather under the impression that the purpose of such a Company would be to obviate the necessity for these loans being guaranteed by the Government.  It has been argued in this way that under that Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act the Company would receive loans from banks under Government guarantee.  If there was a failure then the responsibility of that would fall on the Government, but if there were five other companies guaranteed in the same way under that Act, and if those five companies were an outstanding success no benefit of any kind would come to the Government. The Government would only be bearing the losses, and the procedure of the proposed Industrial Trust would obviate the necessity for a Government guarantee being forthcoming.  It would be only brought into play in the case of failure, that is to say, the Industrial Trust Company would be having its eggs in a variety of baskets, and that the losses would be placed against the profits.  If there were profits in five companies and losses only in one, the profits would be taken into account and there would be no actual loss, and, therefore no call on the Government. I gather from the Minister that is not contemplated, and it therefore removes some of the advantages of such a company. What seems to be the position is that the Industrial Trust Company is simply to take the place of an ordinary bank, and I do not know what the Government's part is in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, I think that the publication of the purpose, objects and benefits of <Col N="2072" /> this procedure by the Minister would be acceptable to the Dáil, and would help the public to understand the value of such a departure.  I think that the project of the Government in using this method of stimulating industrial activities is quite a good one.  I think it is well that there should be some kind of Government enterprise in matters of this kind, where the project has been well examined and carefully considered, and that the Government's entry into it would give some stability and encourage private investors.  I am not sure, from the President's statement, whether this particular Company is preferable to encouraging the further use of the National Land Bank, in as much as the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act is not being superseded in any way, and that the responsibility for failures in any company or enterprise assisted by capital guaranteed by the Government would still lie on the Government, and in this case only the profitable investment would be the interest of the Trust Company.  The Government is really at the back of any company financed by this new organisation, and I am at a loss to understand where the benefit comes in of forming a new company of this kind.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the President if one of the reasons why this Bill is brought forward is that firms or societies who have applied for a loan under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, and whose claims have been investigated by the Advisory Committee set up by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will get a longer time to pay back the loan?  I know of a case where a society has been recommended for a loan, and they could only get the loan for a five years' term, but they wanted a ten years' term.  Is it possible under this Bill for the Industrial Trust Company to give loans for a term of ten years on the recommendation of the Advisory Committee set up under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act?</P>

      <P>I am not opposing the Second Reading.  With Deputy Johnson, I agree that the condition of the industries of the country is such as <Col N="2073" /> to require a stimulus, and I might be inclined to say that Government assistance of this sort would be more acceptable to our Party than the other methods that have been applied.  We are not against the Government taking action of this kind where it is likely to bring results, but may I point out to the President and to the Executive Council that if they come to the conclusion that financial assistance is necessary in order to stimulate industrial development, assistance is also necessary for agriculture.  Agricultural credit is perhaps responsible more than anything else for the depressed conditions of agriculture.  While we are prepared to support the Bill we want to point out to the President that in our considered opinion the position of our industry should be the first consideration of the State.  Already a good deal of action has been taken by the Government to stimulate industrial development, and a further effort is being made now.</P>
      <P>We cannot say that very much has been done for agriculture.  We are not finding fault, but we want to point out that if there is to be progress or development in agriculture in this country the position of agricultural credit demands immediate consideration and action on the part of the Government. I would like to hear from the President whether, in the consideration of this matter, that aspect of things was brought to his notice or was considered by him.  As far as I understand, the activities of this Industrial Trust Company will be entirely towards the development of industries, and that money will not be available for the development of agriculture in any of its branches.  If the State is to be called upon to assist by way of putting up money in this form, I think that it has a duty to another industry that is as depressed to-day as any of the industries that will or may benefit from the operations of this Trust Company. If that matter has not been given attention by the Executive Council in coming to a decision, I say that it calls for immediate attention and for a decision on their part.  I would like to hear from the President what he has to say on these matters.</P>

      <P>I have not gone very carefully through the memorandum and articles of association of this Company as the Minister for Finance had intended to take this Bill.  He could not do so, however, as he is engaged at the moment in the Seanad on other business.  One of the directors of the Company has been approached on the matter that was raised by Deputy Johnson, and he expressed the hope that the Company would develop ultimately on the lines indicated by him.  I am not committing myself to that statement.  I am simply giving expression to the opinion that was put forward by this director of the Company; that is to say, that profits on the successful undertakings would be used to make up for the losses on the unsuccessful undertakings.  As far as I am aware, one of the original main considerations in putting forward this measure has been more or less on the lines of the question put by Deputy Colohan, that when the Trade Loans Act was passed the difficulty of getting money for a longer period than five years was noticeable almost immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People know very well that the banking institutions in this country have been generally averse to giving long-distance loans, and the case that they make against giving long-distance or long-term loans is a very good one&mdash;that they have not got long-distance deposits themselves, and that they are actually in the position of trustees for depositors and may be called upon at very short notice to pay out to depositors the sums they have in their keeping.  In consequence, they have to rely very largely upon easily realisable securities and cash, and as everyone knows, banking, with all its infirmities, will not admit of a very considerable rush.  The circumstances here during the last few years have put a considerable strain upon our banks. A number of local authorities have had to negotiate loans, and I think that at the present moment the banks generally have advanced to local authorities sums far in excess of what they had advanced in the pre-war period.  In a sense that particular money is tied up. With the Trade Loans Act coming into <Col N="2075" /> operation they were again faced with applications for long-term loans.  Now the sum itself in any one year might be inconsiderable, and this particular Act of itself might not create a difficulty, but presumably when one such Act is passed it is quite likely that other demands would come in.  The general position of banks, to put it shortly, is that these long-term loans were not in their line of business ordinarily.</P>
    <P>Consequently it was deemed advisable to bring into being an institution such as this&mdash;an Industrial Trust Bank &mdash;and I am rather pleased to say that the subscriptions from the banks here in Ireland have been very considerable. They are:&mdash;Bank of Ireland, £25,000; Hibernian Bank, £5,000; Munster and Leinster Bank, £5,000; National Bank, £5,000; Provincial Bank, £5,000; Royal Bank of Ireland, £2,500, and the Ulster Bank, £2,500.  The banks themselves appreciate the necessity for such an institution as this.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the matters raised by Deputy Baxter have been specially treated in connection with this particular Trust Company.  I presume that with greater capital it is possible it might be able to do some business in connection with agricultural credit, but as far as I know, it was mainly in connection with the Trade Loans Act that this Company was inaugurated, and it is practically assured of sufficient business to pay a dividend on its original subscriptions. It is more than possible that it may develop.  I think the articles of association are wide, and beyond that I am not in a position to go.</P>

      <P>The last statement of the President raises an important point.  Could he tell us whether this Company would be empowered to make loans to individuals or to groups.

    <P>The amount of the original Estimate for the current financial year was £115,000.  This sum was the estimated cost of completing schemes for which grants had been made during the financial year 1924-25, but which had not been completed during that year. It was not intended to finance any new works.  A supplementary Estimate of £135,000 was taken at the end of June on account of the continued unemployment and distress.  Of the total of the original and supplementary Estimates, amounting to £250,000, a sum of £228,800 has already been allocated, leaving a balance of £21,200.  The present supplementary Estimate is necessary because of the continuance of unemployment and distress which are unlikely to be alleviated before the late spring.</P>
    <P>The number of registered unemployed at the beginning of the present calendar year was 49,000; at the end of June the number was 33,000, and the number at present is 31,000.  This figure would indicate unemployment to the extent of approximately 10 per cent., but it must be borne in mind that there are also large numbers unemployed who are not registered because they are not entitled to benefit.  Apart, of course, from unemployment, there is also acute distress in many areas resulting from other causes, such as losses of stock, etc.</P>
    <P>Of the grants sanctioned during the present financial year, £118,000 has been allocated to the Department of Local Government and Public Health for expenditure on roads, reclamation, drainage, water works, school meals and fuel.  £86,100 was allocated to the Land Commission for general improvements to estates, £8,000 to the Department of Agriculture for forestry works, and approximately £3,450 for seed schemes.  The sum of £2,000 will be spent under the supervision of the Board of Works, on Arklow Harbour, and the balance of £377 of the Government subsidy was paid to Wolfhill Collieries. A sum of £7,500 was allocated for the extension of the Tralee and Fenit Pier, but it is not known whether this work will be carried out during the present financial year.</P>
    <P>Apart from grants from the Relief Schemes Vote, it must be borne in mind that there are in existence a number of schemes which provide a large measure of employment.  There is the Shannon scheme, the Barrow drainage scheme, general drainage maintenance, the sugar beet factory, and various building operations carried out by the Board of Works.</P>

      <P>I could not say, but I will find out.  A State contribution of £23,000 to the estimated cost has been sanctioned.  The Estimates of the Board of Works include £419,715 for new works, alterations and addtions. This includes £32,500 for the Four Courts, £30,000 for the Custom House, and £111,000 for the reconstruction of the General Post Office.  Provision is also made in the Estimates for <Col N="2079" /> housing grants amounting to £80,000 to municipal authorities, and £248,000 to individuals for the erection of housing.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of the financial year £720,000 has been spent on road works, and it is estimated that approximately £250,000 more will be spent before the end of the financial year.  A large measure of employment is also provided by the reinstatement condition attached to compensation awards for the pre-truce period. Awards amounting to £860,000 have already been spent on buildings; and awards amounting to £450,000 are available for payment as soon as the conditions have been complied with. For the post-Truce period, £348,000 has already been spent in reinstatement cases, and awards amounting to £731,000, in addition, have been notified to applicants as merely awaiting compliance with the reinstatement conditions.</P>
      <P>With regard to further expenditure from the Relief Grants Vote, it is proposed to insist, wherever possible, that there shall be a local contribution; the locality which derives the benefit from these grants should make some payment towards the cost of the scheme. It will also be stipulated that the works must be completed before the 31st March next, as it is not intended to make any provision of this nature for the financial year 1926-27.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>The President stated in moving this motion that this Vote is meant not only to help to relieve unemployment, wherever it is in existence, but, also, to help to relieve the distress caused very largely from loss of stock. The President said very little about that side of the case, and I doubt if the President is really serious when he states that the relief of distress caused by loss of stock can be met out of this Vote.  If he does he is either unconscious of the magnitude of that task or he is giving it very little.  If the total Vote were spent in the districts where there has been a loss of stock it would go a very short way indeed towards relieving the distress in these particular districts, apart altogether from the question of the relief of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2080" /> Now I would like to hear, from the President, in what way the Government intend to try to attack this problem, if there is definite information in the possession of the Executive or the Minister for Finance, to enable them to allocate to the particular districts where serious loss of stock has taken place; definite fixed sums.  I have had, heretofore, on this matter, occasion to bring before the notice of the Dáil the way in which moneys voted in this fashion have been spent, and it is not a pleasant position for any Deputy to have to take up, but we do know that this money is, at times, beyond question, spent in districts where political influence is strong; and I do not make that statement with regard to one constituency as against another, but I make it, even, with regard to one district in a constituency as against another.  I want to point out to the President, in the matter of the relief of distress due to the loss of stock, that there is a very distinct difference between the distress that may be caused in a district where there has been a loss of stock and the position in a district where there is unemployment. It appears, to all intents and purposes, a poorer district where employment would be needed and the disposition would be to spend money perhaps first where there is very considerable unemployment, although on the other hand the distress might be considerably greater in a district where its existence might not be so apparent.  Where the distress is due to fluke or loss of stock the conditions would be very much worse.</P>
    <P>Now if there is any definite policy in this, if the Ministers, or whoever is responsible for the allocation to particular districts, have not grasped what the position is in particular districts, this supplementary Estimate will, instead of relieving distress, cause more discontent and dissatisfaction than the good that may be done by our voting it here.  Mal-administration of this money in any way would be very bad, and by mal-administration I mean spending money in districts where influences are strong enough to get money spent regardless of whether or not the demands in another district from the point of view of distress or <Col N="2081" /> unemployment are really much greater than in districts where the people are able to get the money.  If the President wants to make the House believe that this Vote is going in any way to relieve distress caused by loss of stock I want to say that it is not, and it will not.  But even if there is a pretence that a certain amount of relief is going to be given in these districts, I want to urge that careful inquiry should be made and consideration given to the question as to whether the loss that has been was great or small.  If that is not done and if political pressure is to determine the amount that is to be given in a particular constituency and a particular district, then both the Executive and other Deputies in this House will be storing up trouble for every one of us by such conduct as that.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is necessary to refer to the figures the President has given about the money that is being spent and the works that are in the course of operation.  I think if the President said that such works may some time be carried out, perhaps next year, his statement would be more acceptable.  There is no use talking of the Barrow drainage or perhaps the Shannon scheme, or growing beet or other matters he made reference to as means for relieving unemployment, or works upon which money is being spent.  It is hardly a fair statement of the case as we know the conditions at the present time, in trying to make a case as to what our Government are really doing, to urge that money is being spent on particular works.  I think the Minister would have been well advised to have left that part of his speech out altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAlexanderNagle" hpid="Mr. NAGLE Mr. NAGLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NAGLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a bit doubtful exactly as to what is going to be done with this money.  I understood from the President's remarks that the bulk of the money would be administered through local bodies such as urban councils and county councils.  I am not quite sure that that is the truth. Deputy Baxter told us about some things that happened in Cavan under the scheme of the Government last year, with which he disagreed.  I remember the discussions that took place <Col N="2082" /> here at the time.  So far as I am concerned, I have some experience of money administered in the early part of this year by the Land Commission, and it was administered, I think, very satisfactorily indeed, and the work done there has turned out to be a work of a permanent nature, so very much so that recently the Cork County Council has taken over the roads that were then made under the supervision of the Land Commission when this relief work was going on and have decided to keep them in repair for the future. That work has been a benefit to the men who got employment in making the roads, and practically in all the cases it has been a benefit to the people locally, by giving them better facilities for getting from one place to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one case I have in mind it gave a direct road to a creamery, a school and a church to the people of the locality and saved them at least three miles, and three miles, as anyone will understand in a country district, is a very valuable distance to save, especially during the winter.  I would like myself that some of this money should be spent as it was in these relief schemes, through the Land Commission.  But there is one thing I would like to say also, and it is this.  If a decision is come to to spend the money through the Land Commission, or through any other department, the departments should be notified immediately this evening or to-morrow that the money will be available.  I remember in June when £135,000 was voted.  I approached two or three Government departments that might have the spending of the money, and I was told that they had no instructions from the Department of Finance.  I approached the Department of Finance on a few occasions and I was informed that they could not allocate any money until the schemes were put up to them by the particular department, whether the Local Government Board or the Land Commission.  I again came back to these departments and they said that the Finance Department &mdash; if I may use a word that has been used sometimes in this House &mdash; were only &ldquo;codding,&rdquo; and I was told that they would ignore, completely, any scheme, whether put <Col N="2083" /> up or not, unless they were informed beforehand that money was available for such work.</P>
    <P>There is really no use in our going to these departments for some of this relief money except they have been informed beforehand by the Finance Department that they are to formulate relief schemes.  On the other hand, the Finance Department say that these people must formulate schemes before they can do anything on these lines.  If that is the way that this £120,000 is going to be administered, we shall see the whole of the money in the Finance Department on the 31st of March next. I would like to know what are the intentions regarding it, and whether the information I got during the last few months regarding the £135,000 is true on the part of, say, the people in the Land Commission or the Local Government Department, that they must get authority beforehand from the Finance Department before they can put up schemes, or if it is true that the Finance Department gives them a free hand to put up schemes and will advance them the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement of Deputy Nagle is rather misleading.  The statement of the President is also misleading. Deputy Nagle said that money was handed over to the Land Commission to do certain work &mdash; to make roads in certain districts &mdash; and that the roads made were ultimately handed over to the county council of a certain county.  The first thing the Land Commission is in duty bound to do, in carrying out the Land Commission scheme, is to make roadways through the properties they divide for the convenience of the people who are to live there.  They, in many cases, make approaches to the different holdings. They put up buildings and they make fences around the holdings.  But their first and most important duty is to make highways through the holdings that come into their possession.  The county council must, of necessity, take over those roads if they are of a certain width.  This grant, administered in the way that the Deputy has instanced, is money that would have been <Col N="2084" /> spent by the Land Commission in any case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>May I explain to Deputy Gorey that in the cases in which this money was spent, there was no question whatever of division of land.  Roads were made to accommodate people who had been agitating, and whose grandfathers had been agitating for roads.  The county council were not bound to take them over.  But they took them over as a result of the work done, when they saw the usefulness of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>If a case could be made, it was the duty of the local authority&mdash; the county council or the district council&mdash;to make those roads at the expense of the public.  They may have neglected to do that.  If they did, that was the fault of the local authority.  It has been said that this is intended to relieve people who suffered losses in cattle.  At the time that was being dealt with, it was pointed out that the better way would be to give grants for relief of distress in those districts.  It was seriously put up here by Deputies Sears and Dolan that that was the better way.  But I want to say that this method does not meet the situation at all.  It is only a pretence at meeting the situation.  In some districts it will be found that these relief schemes will serve no useful purpose.  Districts like North and West Kerry, Clare, Galway, will not lend themselves to these schemes.  Where the greatest losses have been suffered, drainage schemes are not necessary, and road-making schemes are not necessary.  They will not reach the individuals that suffered most.  In some cases, where there are young families able to work, they will be able to avail of the work provided by those schemes, but other families who have suffered losses will get no benefit by this work.  Anybody who has a farm of twenty or twenty-five acres will have very little labour to spare in order to avail of public works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I daresay those who have the spending of this money will get better value for their money.  The particular party who is able to hand out the money will get better value, if the money is spent, <Col N="2085" /> from the political point of view.  But from the public and State point of view, it is altogether wrong.  It will not reach the people it is intended to reach.  To say that this scheme is going to meet the situation discussed here five or six weeks ago is to say a thing that is not.  Nobody believes it.  I have no objection where there is distress in the country to have a scheme of this description put up to meet the situation.  But I will not accept it as meeting the other situation if it is intended to meet it.  I can quite realise that there are areas like Leitrim and, perhaps, Connemara, where there is acute distress and where some scheme of useful work is needed to relieve the distress.  Any work of utility well done in a district where it is needed is a good investment.  The Ministry seem to be quite cheerful in putting up money in this case and, if I may say so, they shut the door on the other case. It practically shuts the door on the cases of acute distress and urgency put up here a few months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Gorey that it is very important that the money that is being voted should be applied to schemes of permanent value.  In the past, relief work has been very often dealt with on a somewhat extravagant basis &mdash; with the point of view rather of giving employment than of creating improvements that would be a lasting asset to the community.  I think there has been a considerable improvement in this respect in recent years, but I want to give an instance of one direction in which, I think, this money might be usefully applied.  I do so with some diffidence, because it concerns my constituency. My constituency is a very eclectic constituency.  It chooses representatives of all types except farmers and it is also a constituency in which there is going to be a bye-election. I refer to a scheme which has been put up for providing a water supply for the towns of Skerries and Balbriggan. That scheme has, so far, failed to come into being, because those towns have not got any form of local government.  They cannot strike a rate for themselves and, as the ratepayers of the rural districts would have to <Col N="2086" /> pay a portion of the rate for providing a water supply from which they would get little or no benefit, they are hostile to the scheme.  If a very small portion of this grant &mdash; I think £5,000 would be sufficient &mdash; could be applied to providing a golden bridge which would reconcile the rural ratepayers to the carrying out of this scheme, a lasting and valuable piece of work would be achieved.  These are both fair-sized towns.  They both have considerable possibilities, Balbriggan as an industrial centre and Skerries as a resort for tourist traffic &mdash; not perhaps so much for overseas tourist traffic as a resort for people who would, otherwise, spend their holidays in North Wales, but who want to keep in touch with the city and not go too far away.  As long as they have to rely on the primitive machinery of pumps and wells, these two towns cannot prosper.  This scheme would also relieve unemployment, which is considerable in the district, and is even more considerable in Drogheda.  Probably most of the labour &mdash; the unskilled labour required for the reservoir and the scheme itself &mdash;would be drawn from Drogheda.  My constituency would not benefit very much.</P>

I think this is the first time I ever put up a case to get money for my constituency and I feel all the bashfulness of a young girl at her first dance.  I have gone into this matter very closely.  I do not ask for any definite scheme, but I hope the Government will give the matter careful consideration, because it is of permanent value.  It is more valuable than making roads for your lorries to wear out.  It is a thing in the nature of a capital improvement, not merely a patching up to meet the needs of the moment.</P>

      <P>I believe this is a totally inadequate Estimate to meet the unemployment problem as it exists today. I do not want to go any further than to quote Deputy Cooper when he says £5,000 would be required for the <Col N="2087" /> towns of Balbriggan and Skerries. £5,000 is about one twenty-fifth of the total Estimate.  What about all the other small towns in his constituency?  What about all the other towns in the Saorstát? You would want £5,000 for every town, say, of three or four thousand inhabitants, and will £120,000 meet that?  The President speaks about meeting the losses caused by fluke, but I think, as far as the unemployed are concerned, they can make a present of £120,000 to the farmers.  They would not have much to meet their losses either.  Another thing I would like to ask the President is if there is any of this £120,000 already spent.  In June last the Dáil voted £135,000 just before the adjournment.  When we looked for grants to relieve unemployment we were told that most of the money was already allocated and therefore was not available.  I tried to get some money for Kildare but there was none.  I was turned down.  We are paying out £316 per week in home help in Kildare. The problem has been sufficiently thrashed out before all the departments to know that £120,000 divided by 26 leaves £5,000 for each county. That is no use.  The Ministry should tackle this problem of unemployment and give the unemployed some indication that they have their interests at heart.  Surely they are not going to let them die of hunger throughout the country.  That is the alternative.  There is no doubt that we can spend £120,000 before 31st March, and we could spend four times that amount if we got the chance.</P>

It was in order to get a much larger amount of capital released that I made that request.</P>

      <P>I wish to add my tribute to the work done by the Land Commission in making roads in the County Mayo, and particularly roads through the bogs.  The money allocated to the Land Commission dried up on <Col N="2088" /> a certain date, and a great number of those roads remain unfinished.  Some of them were only just begun.  I hope the Minister will place a considerable amount of money at the disposal of the Land Commission in order to finish those roads.  At the same time the county councils ought to be compelled to take over those roads when they are finished by the Land Commission, because if they do not do so the roads will become impassable after the lapse of some years, and the same work will have to be done again.  There was a considerable amount of money spent uselessly in providing fuel last year, and I hope that will not be repeated this year.  There is plenty of turf in the country, and, as the year was so favourable, the distribution of coal would be an absolute waste of money.</P>

The £120,000 given by the Government now for the relief of distress, or as it is specified in the Estimate &ldquo;by way of grants for loss,&rdquo; would not relieve distress in half the counties which are suffering acutely owing to the want of employment in the Saorstát.  I shall be very pleased to hear some Deputies from Galway voicing their opinion on this Estimate, and to hear them explaining the condition under which their people live.  If the Deputies from Galway explain the conditions under which their people live, I am sure the Dáil will credit other Deputies when they say that constituencies they represent are as bad as those of Galway.

      <P>This is the place to speak and not at a public meeting in Cork.  We have, week after week <Col N="2089" /> collections for the purpose of relieving the destitute in the different towns of my constituency.  Something like 280 families are in receipt of benefits from the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  Something like £12,500 each year is paid by way of home help.  Surely, some distress must prevail in this constituency. The same thing applies to every part of the Saorstát, and we are asked here to-day to pass a supplementary estimate of £120,000, the greater part of which has already been spent.  I would like to know if it is the intention of the Government to give some immediate relief to enable the unemployed worker to tide over Christmas.  Christmas is a time which, as the old saying goes, comes only once a year.  Thank Heaven, from the worker's point of view, it does not come twice a year.  It is supposed to be a time of full and plenty for everyone.  Yet we have thousands of homes which, coming up to the great feast we are to celebrate on the 25th of the month, have not a morsel of food.  We are told that the greater portion of the £120,000 has already been spent and that the remainder is only what the Government can give.</P>
      <P>The President spoke about relief for the loss of cattle through the fluke.  How many credit societies have been formed?  No relief can be given unless a credit society is formed.  The people have not any money to lodge.  This is not a grant but a loan, free of interest for three years.  Deputy Gorey put forward a plea on behalf of the farmer. He is perfectly right in saying that a lot of small farmers will not benefit in any way from this grant.  Practically by every county council a resolution has been adopted that no man will be entitled to work whose valuation is over £7, and no carter will be employed with over £15 valuation.  If Deputy Gorey is correct, such people as small farmers do not come within this.  I ask Deputy Gorey to make a sacrifice, as the farmers have alleged they have made sacrifices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, in the big towns, and they are anxiously looking forward to the dole.  Since I have become a member of this Dáil, I have not advocated the dole.  I put it to the Government that if you cannot find employment, you must give the workers something to keep body and soul together, and I ask the President to be generous enough to have something given immediately, even through the labour exchanges, in order to relieve the distress amongst the unemployed.  Do not take only into account those who are eligible to draw benefits but take into account also the agricultural labourer, who is the hardest hit.  He is not eligible under the unemployment benefits scheme.  He has nowhere to look to. He is probably rearing a large family and developing their intelligence and their brains in the interest of the welfare of this country. He is getting no help whatever. He is simply looked upon as a nonentity. They say to him: &ldquo;You are not entitled to any unemployment insurance.&rdquo; You have thousands of agricultural labourers on the dole at the moment who are suffering acute distress and who will not be entitled to any portion even of this amount of £120,000, given by way of a supplementary estimate.  I admit that the Government are trying to meet the case fairly well.  The total estimate for 1925-26 is £370,000 for the relief of distress, by way of loans, which include housing schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know if it is the intention of the Government to start relief works and if this money voted by the <Col N="2091" /> Dáil at the expense of the taxpayer of the country could not be utilised in any better manner than the £250,000 voted last year was used.  Can we get value for the money?  Are there not many firms who would be quite prepared to give employment to twenty or thirty extra hands if the Government were prepared to give even half the wages, say, a £1 or 25/- a week, to those who were formerly engaged by the firm and who are now unemployed.  I may be looked upon as advocating something out of the common, but I think it is only right to say that the workers of the Twenty-six Counties do not want to receive alms.  They do not look for alms.  Anything brought from the Labour Exchange is paid for by the workers themselves, and we do not accept the dope that has been used here, that the worker must go with his hand out to receive alms at the hands of the Government by way of a grant to be distributed through the Labour Exchange.  The Government are giving £120,000, the total amount to be spent by the 31st March.  That amount could be spent in one week, if the Government intended seriously to relieve distress among the unemployed.</P>
    <P>£120,000 is merely a drop in the ocean in comparison with the distress prevailing amongst us.  I know that I would not be in order to move that this amount be increased, nor would I be in order to propose that the Government allocate immediately £100,000 to the Labour Exchanges so that every worker, whether registered or not, would be able to get work during Christmas.  I appeal to the Government to have something done immediately, for I can assure the Dáil that unless something is done the workers in this country will not stand their conditions much longer.  I do not advocate any destruction, but I say that if my children were hungry they would not be hungry for long, if I could get food from shop windows.  It is up to the workers to see that their children do not starve. If I were to be arrested by the Minister for Justice himself, I would say that it is the right of the workers of Ireland to get food, especially when it is remembered that they did everything <Col N="2092" /> in their power, and made all kinds of sacrifices to achieve that freedom which we now claim to possess. If a worker, in order to satisfy his hungry children goes out and steals a loaf, he will get six months' hard labour.</P>
    <P>There is no consideration for the loss of his children, and is a life more valuable than a loaf of bread?  I want employment for my people; I do not want charity.  I have advised the workers over and over again to stand loyal, as their needs would be seen to by the Government for which they fought.  What is to become of the 14,000 or 15,000 ex-Service men who were demobilised?  You see many of them walking the streets of Dublin hungry.  Even yesterday thousands of young women could be seen asking for employment and bread.  I may be told by the Government that the country cannot afford to pay more than £120,000.  If we have succeeded in saving the country £179,000,000, surely we can afford to allocate some of this huge amount for the people on whose behalf we made the Agreement.  If a grant of £1,000,000 was given immediately, everybody could get employment and the workers would be able to rear and educate their families.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that when workers are satisfied with their lot they are an asset to the country.  They could be employed on useful work, even if it were only making a ditch. It would be better to have them do that than to have thousands of our best young men and girls following the emigrant ship and going to foreign countries to build them up for foreigners.  If the Government is serious about wanting the country to develop they should relieve distress and enable the workers to live.  There is no use in coming forward with this £120,000, of which probably two-thirds are already spent.  I want either employment or bread for the workers, and one or other they are going to have.  Some of them have been unemployed for eighteen months and have drawn all they are allowed to draw at the labour exchanges.  Now they have no further benefit, and we are offered here £120,000, of which probably only £30,000 is available at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Deputy Sears, Chairman of the Government Party, informed us yesterday, on Deputy Lyons's motion, that to his knowledge a man had died from hunger, and within a fortnight his wife died from the same cause.  I want to put a very concrete case to the House. The case I refer to will, I think, be well known to Deputies as it appeared in the Press and came before the Clonmel Corporation.  That was a case in which two children died from starvation in that town.  Three weeks ago a young married woman, the mother of five children, was buried in a part of my constituency, and unquestionably her death was due to want of food.  Her husband had been unemployed for six months after leaving the National Army.  He was one of the men who, as the President said, helped to save the State, and the reward he got for saving the State was that his wife was left to die for want of food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quoting these two cases, and if any member of the Ministry has any doubts about either of them I can furnish him with the name, and inquiries can be made in the hospital.  Three weeks before the woman died she went into hospital, and a month before that her husband had just come out of hospital. The number of people who die because they cannot get food may not be many, but the number of people who die through lack of nutrition is considerable. If anything would go to show the extent of unemployment in <Col N="2095" /> this country it would be the figures which we heard yesterday from the President.  He told us that hundreds of thousands of pounds had been provided for the relief of unemployment through the Board of Works, and through work on roads and other schemes but, nevertheless, he admits that there are 31,000 registered unemployed. I think it would be putting it at a very moderate figure to say that the number not registered would be in the region of from 40,000 to 50,000, because we must remember that every day the number of men entitled to unemployment benefit is reduced because they have exhausted their rights to benefit, and have exhausted their stamps and, when they are informed that there is no more benefit coming to them they do not sign on.</P>
    <P>Of course it is well known that agricultural workers are not entitled to any unemployment benefit.  I would suggest to the Government that this is not the way to meet the unemployment problem &mdash; giving £100,000, £150,000 in a few months and another £150,000 in another few months.  If the position is as we have been informed by the Minister within the last couple of weeks, that unlike any other country in Europe we have no war debt, and that we have the smallest national debt, why will not the Government borrow money for works of reconstruction that require to be carried out?  We were told on every occasion when the question of unemployment came up that this is a poor country and the Government could not possibly afford, or could not get, the money for relief purposes.  If they could get £5,000,000 to patch up a Boundary settlement, I submit that they should be able to get money sufficient to get work for every man in this country.  This subject is treated with a certain amount of levity by Deputies in this House, and speakers who deal with it are listened to in a contemptuous way by other Deputies.</P>
    <P>We on those benches have personal experience of the matter, as we live among these people and know their sufferings.  When we go home in the week-ends these stricken people come to us with their tales of woe.  A woman <Col N="2096" /> told me that though her husband has been unemployed for three or four months the outdoor relieving officer had refused to give outdoor relief.  I do not say that there are not cases which are not genuine, but such cases would be very odd ones.  Most of the cases are genuine.  The people are in a bad way, and when we, speaking from experience of those people, come here and put their case as temperately as we can, we are treated very often to the sneers and jibes of Ministers.  I think most of the poor people of this country have great patience.</P>
    <P>There is the case, and I am sure there are many others like it, of this man who served twelve months in the National Army and helped to save the State &mdash; as we were told by the President &mdash;and his wife died from hunger because he could not provide her with sufficient food.  That man would require to possess extraordinary patience, and he could not be blamed if he took Deputy Lyons's advice and broke two, or three, windows in order to get bread for his starving children.</P>

      <P>It might be illegal, but, as a famous law lord once said, there are illegalities that are not crimes.  It seems to me that the problem of unemployment and distress will not be solved by a sop such as this. It is totally inadequate, and it is merely trying to stem agitation for the time being in the hope that something better will happen in the next three or four months.  With regard to what Deputy Gorey and Deputy Baxter said as to farmers who lost stock, in my constituency, so far as I can gather, the loss was not great, but even in Tipperary some individuals suffered much from loss of stock, and I think we have something to be thankful for in the fact that the loss was not widespread. If cattle died as a result of cold, and owing to the wetness of the year and because farmers were not able to provide them with food, what about the human beings?  They had to endure the <Col N="2097" /> cold and the wet, and they were not able to secure sufficient food.  I am not trying to take from the case the farmers made.  I think they made a just case, and I believe that the people who suffered are entitled to be treated by the Government in such a way as will enable them to work their farms and earn a decent livelihood from them. The first duty of the Government is to see that the people will not die from hunger or malnutrition.</P>

      <P>Whether this Supplementary Estimate is sufficient or insufficient, as some of the Deputies contend, that is a matter for the Minister. If the necessity for providing employment, for providing those requirements which the farmers put forward, and for providing relief works generally, is not sufficiently met in this Estimate clearly, it is the business of the Minister to see to it.  Whether the £120,000 is sufficient for the purpose I do not know, but the Minister must know that as he has all the information at his disposal.  A moment ago, owing to an interruption, he stated that the actual amount that would be disposed of would be £160,000.  It must be, therefore, from the grant already made that the £40,000 was in some way or other reserved or not spent.  I desire to urge in regard to the western counties, where a large number of relief works, some of them small, and some of them very useful, were stopped, that these works should be completed, or otherwise the money spent on them already would be absolutely thrown away.  I suggest to the Minister that in dealing with this matter he will particularly see that these works already approved of by him and put in motion should be completed. The amount required would be very small, indeed, and well within the £160,000.</P>

I do not want to cavil with the amount of <Col N="2098" /> money that is being given for the relief of distress, but I sincerely hope, and I want to stress this point, that where there are works of utility to be carried out in the City of Cork that the money will be given for the relief of unemployment in that district, and I would be relieved if it could be done as quickly as possible.  When the Cork Corporation were functioning &mdash; and I want to say that the Commissioner there is doing his work in a capable fashion&mdash;at this period of the year they used to grant an additional sum for the relief of distress.  I am not certain that the Commissioner is doing it, but it is possible he may.  I sincerely hope he is, because it would, to a great extent, carry the people over the Christmas period, which Deputy Lyons has spoken of as being a season of full and plenty.  I am sorry for the full and plenty portion of it, but I do sincerely hope that some of that money will be sent to relieve what I have termed, and what I am sorry to have to so term, the appalling unemployment in the city which I happen to represent here.</P>

      <P>I want to say a word as to the position of things in the County Kildare.  At the beginning of the financial year it was estimated that a sum of £17,000 would meet the claims for home assistance in that county.  By the 1st of September last, a sum of £24,000 had been expended under that head, and of course we must take into account that the six months prior to the 1st of September were the best months of the year.  What I mean by that is, that during that period you would be likely to have less unemployment than during the winter or early spring months.  It is estimated that at the end of the financial year a sum of £42,000 will have been expended in home assistance.  The question arises now &mdash; How is that to be met?  It cannot be met out of the entire Estimate of the county council.  I may say that this matter has been put before the Minister for Local Government by an <Col N="2099" /> influential deputation representing the different parties in the county.  I do not know whether he has considered the position seriously, but at any rate the position is so critical that it is giving rise to very grave feelings, bordering, I may say, on consternation, on the part of the ratepayers of the county as to how they are to meet this enormous and increasing expenditure. It was pointed out previously here that the situation in Kildare is peculiarly bad because of the fact that a great number of men used to find employment in it, particularly around the Curragh.  They cannot find that occupation now, and in these circumstances it is only right that the County Kildare should be accorded special consideration.</P>

      <P>I was very glad to hear the statement of the President that this sum of money is to be devoted for relief work.  From the speeches delivered by Deputies in different parts of the House there can be no doubt left in anyone's mind that relief work is badly needed.  As far as the West is concerned, we are quite satisfied that this work could not be in better hands than those of the Land Commission. They know the sort of work that is needed in these districts to improve the land from an agricultural point of view.  I fear, however, that most of these districts have been neglected in the past.</P>

      <P>There was no one to see that roads were made into bogs.  Many of the old bogs are used up, and the new ones have to be sought out.  In the case of these new bogs, roads have to be made to them.  That is a very costly work, but it is work of a reproductive character.  I think the Government should not hesitate to carry out large schemes of that kind, and that they should give an increase of the grant they propose now.  I think the grant might be well increased in view of the general depression that exists all over the country, and particularly in the case of districts like Leitrim, Mayo, Galway, and other counties along the seaboard.  We had hoped that the sum <Col N="2100" /> for these districts alone would be at least £120,000.  When you hear of districts like Cork, Tipperary, Carlow, Kildare and other places looking for a large slice of this grant, and putting up a very good case for it, you begin to feel that the amount that will come to counties like Mayo, Galway and Leitrim will be very small.  The amount would be altogether unequal to their needs.  I certainly think that in these bad times a larger sum should be allocated to relieve the distress that prevails in these areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Morrissey that £120,000 is not going to meet the whole of the unemployment problem.  It is only a palliative, as has been said.  I would like to know how much money would meet the problem.  The Deputy mentioned the £5,000,000 which, he said, was to be paid to England in connection with the Treaty settlement.  I think if anyone examines the question he will find that it would probably take two or three millions to find work, say, for everyone looking for work within the next three or four months.  That is the position, and you cannot have it both ways. There are two policies: one is to apply a palliative, and the other is to find work for everyone who wants work. Nobody pretends from this side of the House that we are doing any more in the present instance than attempting to deal with the problem by the first method, but clearly the claim put up from the other side of the House is that the Government should find work for everybody.  It was that point of view that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was expressing when he said that it was not the business of a Government to find work for everybody. If the second method is put forward seriously, you find yourself at once up against very serious propositions indeed.  You find yourself up against the question of borrowing three or four million pounds.  I do not intend to go into the question whether that sum could be properly spent, or whether, humanly speaking, you could get value for the money, taking into account all the difficulties you would be faced with.  Looking at the problem <Col N="2101" /> from the point of view of the State, everyone knows the difficulty that would be met with&mdash;that a very big percentage of that sum of three or four million pounds would go in superintendence, in the purchase of plant and so on.  After having spent that huge sum of money annually you would have very little left even with the best possible organisation that could be put up.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, there is another side to the question.  If you are to borrow a sum of three, four or five millions, who is to repay it or pay the interest on it?  The producers.  The people who mainly produce the wealth of this country are our 350,000 farmers. From the wealth they produce the shopkeeper, the professional man, the worker, and, in fact, all of us get our share.  They are the main producers of the wealth of this country with just the few small industries that we have.  It is these 350,000 farmers, 240,000 of whom are men whose rents or annuities are £9 or £7 a year, who produce from 70 to 80 per cent. of the wealth of this country.  That fact has to be remembered, and that is really the big dilemma we are up against. On one side you have the producers, comparatively poor people who, under the best possible circumstances, can only make a very moderate living for themselves and their families.  They produce practically all the wealth of this country, and will continue to produce it until we have development. That can only take place over a period of five or eight years.  When Deputies put forward the proposition that big sums of money should be borrowed, it ought to be remembered that the people who will have to repay that money and pay the interest on it, are people who themselves are in a state of genuine distress.  On that I agree with Deputy Morrissey.  Deputies ought to remember that these people find it extremely hard to live themselves. They have to work longer than the trade union hours, and for less than the trade union rate of wages.</P>

      <P>The Minister, I think, ought to realise that if the fifty or sixty thousand people who are unemployed at present were employed in works of production, that it would be <Col N="2102" /> much easier to meet the payment of the interest that he mentions than it would be under present circumstances.</P>

      <P>That statement contains a lot of fallacies.  People can be employed, and in fact in this country people are employed, so far as labour is concerned, mainly on something that is not productive&mdash;on distribution or on relief works.  Certain kinds of relief work indirectly may be termed productive, such, for instance, as drainage schemes or road works, but in the main, the normal employment that is given in this country is connected with distribution, and something which, technically, you could hardly refer to as production.  That is a side of the problem that you have to look at in considering this question.  While it is all very fine for Deputies on the Labour benches to put us up against the brutal fact that there are a large number of people in this country without enough to eat, if we are to face the problem as it should be faced, we must face it in the light of the fact that the main producers of wealth in the country are themselves, to a very great extent, unable to support their own wives and families even with the hardest work and the longest hours. That is the dilemma that we are placed in, and it is really a frightful dilemma. There are a great many morals to be drawn from that.</P>

      <P>I will be glad to hear Deputy Johnson on this, but if it is a fact, as it is, that the producers of the wealth of this country are mainly the small farmers, and that under normal circumstances they find it hard enough to put anything by for themselves, then we have to face the problem in the light of that fact, remembering, too, that everyone must cut his cloth according to his measure.  The shopkeeper, the professional man, and the labourer has to remember that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to take up the Deputy on debating points, but what I have stated is the fundamental fact in connection with our economics in this country, that the producers of <Col N="2103" /> wealth here are principally comparatively poor people who have to work extremely hard to make a living so as to enable them to put a little by even in normal times.  They are at the basis of our economic system, and every other class in the country, professional, shopkeeper, worker, and everyone else must endeavour to realise that there ought to be some relationship between his or her standard of living, as the case may be, and the standard of living of the people out of whose wealth he or she may be existing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could put in a plea here for the 150,000 congests that we have.  We have to face the fact that out of 350,000 farmers we have 150,000 congests properly so called.  When I ask myself what can be done for them I have to realise that so far as they are concerned our foundations for agriculture are unsound.  You have too many people trying to live out of the land. You have a larger number of people endeavouring to live out of it than the land can support.  Of course that statement of mine can be twisted, and it can be said that I am preaching a policy of emigration and so on.  All sorts of glosses can be put on that, but it is a hard fact, and in order to deal with a problem like this you have to face facts.  I know it will be said that the farmers could make considerably more out of the land, if they were better educated, if they were better organised, if they worked harder and better.  I admit it, but that has nothing to do with the point.  No education and no amount of hard work will support more than one family on a £5 valuation holding with any decent standard of living.  That is the real problem so far as the farmer is concerned.  I am speaking of the distress so far as he is concerned at the moment.  I am not clear that we are not in the same condition with regard to the distributors.  We have congests among the distributors and congests, if you like, among the labourers, and when you talk of palliatives, and when you say this measure is but a palliative, and when we agree with you we have to go further and realise that there is a much bigger problem <Col N="2104" /> there that none of us are facing except each from his own point of view.</P>
    <P>Another thing that must be remembered in the interest of accuracy is that the Government has spent very big sums of money in connection with this unemployment problem.  In the last three years they have spent one and a quarter millions of money on unemployment; they have spent over £300,000 a year, raised mainly by taxation, and Deputies ought to remember when they are complaining from public platforms that taxation is so high that every penny spent in that direction has to come out of taxation which has to be raised in this country, and means a reduction in our borrowing potentialities. There is £120,000 to be voted now, and the Land Commission has been asked to spend a certain amount of that in relief works, and I have been asked will we complete the works begun last year, and that are now incomplete. The answer to that is that we will; that is the first thing that will be done. I am also asked what effect will this have upon the problem which the farmer Deputies have put up to us&mdash;that is, the loss caused by fluke.  Let me say, first of all, it is not the duty of the Land Commission to engage in carrying out relief works, and it is not the duty of the Department of Agriculture. We have no organisation for it.</P>
    <P>I have been taking Land Commission officials from their proper work constantly during winter time, and throwing the inspectorate and indoor staff upon this work of organising relief works and carrying them out. That is not the function of the Land Commission.  The function of the Land Commission is to acquire and distribute land.  When Deputies make a fuss here of the rates at which land purchase is progressing they should remember that they themselves have been pressing the Land Commission to do things that if they are to do will prevent them carrying out land purchase as expeditiously as it should be carried out.  I have to go now to the Land Commission, and to get some of the best of its officials to come forward and take over the work of spending this £70,000 as soon as possible.  That <Col N="2105" /> is interfering with the work of the Land Commission, calling upon it to do work that it was never intended to. Neither should the Department of Agriculture have to do it.</P>
    <P>With regard to fluke, this will only relieve people who lost stock, and it will only relieve them to a very small extent, and incidentally I cannot give any undertaking that the Land Commission will pick out particular districts where there has been loss of stock, and do relief work there.  We have to take a great many considerations into account.  The Land Commission staff will have to work where there is poverty; and, secondly, where there is work to be done that can be usefully done.  They have to take all these things into account, and face them in all the circumstances.  We will spend this money mainly among the congested districts and among some of the poorer districts outside the congested districts, but principally where practical work can be usefully undertaken in these districts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The President, in his opening statement, gave certain figures and he gave a long list of projects in the course of being done or work that is projected.  I want to make some inquiries about the figures, and I want also to ask what bearing this long list of moneys spent or offered to be spent or projected to be spent in the future has to do with the immediate problem. He might just as well have quoted the sums advanced by banks towards wages week by week, the amount spent in building this or that or the other, the amount paid out by private employers in the last 26 or the last 52 weeks.  They would have just as much relation to the problem before us as the projects he gave us, because notwithstanding all these works he instanced, he told us there were at the present time on the list in the Labour Exchanges 31,000 work people unemployed. That is the fact the Dáil ought to direct its attention to, not to the amount of money spent last January in wages, or the number of men employed in March or April or May on wages paid by Government assistance.  Notwithstanding all these works undertaken, there are still, according to the <Col N="2106" /> President's figures, 31,000 men in this State on the unemployed list.  I want to know what is the meaning of these figures.  He quoted 49,000, 33,000 and 31,000.  I think that 49,000 relates to some date in January and the 33,000 to some date in June.  But we know that the Ministry for Industry and Commerce told us a year ago that &ldquo;unemployment figures failed to appear for some time, and that this had been deliberately done because it was found that the figures were not being properly understood.  There was no distinction made in these figures published as between unemployed in insurable occupations and the unemployed generally, and the figures do not reflect a true index of the unemployment problem in the country, and as they were being misconstrued it was thought better to discontinue them.&rdquo; That was the Minister's statement in October. The 31,000, I presume, are the persons at present registered.  The President said that that was 10 per cent., and he said that there was an indeterminate number not registered that would have to be added.  If that is 10 per cent. of the workers it would represent 310,000 people.  I think it is important that we should have some figures that we could rely on, because I have not the slightest doubt that these figures will be quoted in the newspapers as showing a tendency downwards and an improvement in the position of unemployment.  I would very much like to be assured that that is the case.  I hope the Minister will be able to give us some proof, or at least if he cannot give proof that he will give it as his deliberate opinion, after making inquiries, that there are fewer numbers unemployed to-day than there were in June or January last.  I think we ought not to allow this discussion to pass with the acceptance of this bald statement of figures without having some inquiry as to what they mean.  310,000 workpeople is the basis of this Estimate of 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About eighteen months or two years ago we had an official statement that the insurable population of the Saorstat was 250,000.  This figure of 10 per cent. would represent 310,000. Now, speaking of 10 per cent., if that is accurate, in respect of 310,000, it is inaccurate in respect of 250,000, and I <Col N="2107" /> think we should have some reliable data to go upon before we accept these figures for comparative purposes, because if you mention 10 per cent. it will be quoted as against 10 per cent. in Northern Ireland or in England, and unless the figures are really comparable we shall be deceived.  Is it 10 per cent. of the insured persons?  Is it 10 per cent. of the persons who are insurable? Or does it include agricultural labourers and domestic servants? The figures that were provided to the Commission on reconstruction, in respect of the number of wage earners in the country, were as follows: The total number of persons insurable on the existing basis if all occupations were eligible&mdash;and that would include domestic servants and agricultural labourers&mdash;the total number of persons in that category was 465,000; presently insurable 250,000, leaving 215,000 for domestic servants, agricultural and some other non-insurable occupations. Now, we ought to have some accurate statistics in regard to that.</P>
    <P>I agree with those who said that this sum of £120,000 is utterly inadequate. I hoped, when I saw signs on the Government benches that there was an inspired question put upon the paper, that we were going to have a really generous proposition from the Ministry.  I had even hoped that, in addition to sums to be voted for the purposes of works, that we would have some proposition regarding insurance, that those who are not reachable through relief works, would have some prospects, even though they had run out of unemployment benefit on the insured basis, of having their benefits extended, and that they would thereby come into receipt of something to carry them through the coming weeks during the winter.  It is really a deplorable position, and it is not merely men who have been, shall I say, in their normal state of only being engaged now and again in a payable occupation, a wage-earning occupation, it is not the casual worker, who is more or less inured, to his cost, to long periods of unemployment who are affected.</P>
    <P>I have information of a trade that <Col N="2108" /> Deputy Egan (Cork) will be familiar with.  For some considerable time, not less than 25 per cent. of a skilled body of workmen&mdash;coach-builders&mdash;have been unemployed and 60 per cent. are on short time. That is really a very deplorable state of things.  It is indicative of the conditions in quite a number of skilled trades, which men spend from five to seven years in learning, at very small reward, in the hope of something like constancy and adequate yearly earnings. That is their position.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture often reiterates the fact that the country is living upon the produce of agriculture and that the agriculturists are living at a low standard.  He tells us that, roughly, two-thirds of the population are keeping the other third and that the other third are living at a higher standard than the two-thirds who are producing the wealth.  He argues that the basis of our economy is unfair and lopsided. He even goes so far as to say that there are too many people living upon agriculture and that it will not afford the present population.  I ask the Minister and the Dail to consider that proposition.  Accepting it as a truth, what are we to draw from it? Of that one-third that is living upon agriculture, a very large proportion are living at a very high standard&mdash;in many cases, a very high standard of luxury would be the description&mdash;and not contributing anything, not even service, to the community.  They are not even engaged in distribution.  They are not engaged in public service of any kind, and yet they are living at a very high standard.  Accepting the Minister's contention that that one-third which is living upon agriculture is living at a great variety of standards, in the case of a very large proportion of it&mdash;the working-class element&mdash;they are relying upon the spending of the other portion, to a very great extent.  If you are to take that as the inevitable state of things, then we shall demand at least such a redistribution of the wealth enjoyed by that other part as will ensure that every one within that one-third will have meat and bread before anybody has any of the extras.  If you are going <Col N="2109" /> to maintain your present method of distribution, we at least are going to demand that a man shall have bread before his neighbour has cake.  For the Minister to ask us to face the basic fact, that the wealth production of the country is being done by agriculturists, is very valuable and very important. Incidentally, it emphasises the necessity of having other forms of wealth-production encouraged and developed. In the meantime, if the total wealth produced by agriculturists is being distributed unfairly, and two-thirds of the producers are enjoying only one-third or one-half of the wealth produced, then the balance is being distributed unfairly and being enjoyed disproportionately. If that is considered the inevitable consequence of your present methods of production and distribution, then you have, at least, the right to pay the insurance premium and provide your working-class population with at least sufficient to eat.</P>

      <P>I am speaking about the distribution of the annual product.  I will return to the question <Col N="2110" /> the Minister has put in a minute.  The Minister has spoken of production in agriculture.  I want to ask the Dáil to direct its attention, for a minute or two minutes, to a fact which I brought before the Dáil once before and which, I think, with all the modesty that is necessary, is worth bringing before the Dáil again.  The purpose of agriculture, in the main, is to produce food. Agriculture in this country does produce food enough to feed the people of Ireland&mdash;but in quantities which perhaps are not properly balanced.</P>
      <P>In the year 1912, there was produced in this country by agriculture very much more than what would be sufficient to feed all the people of the country.  In so far as wheat was inadequate and certain other commodities were inadequate, there was a great excess of other commodities produced and exported&mdash;more than sufficient to exchange for those that were deficient.  Apart from the monetary values, if you think only in terms of food values, agriculture in this country did produce in 1912-13 very much more than what was necessary to feed all the people of the country.  The Minister asks us to recognise the basic fact of our economic life, that we are all dependent on agriculture and that the first producers are not enjoying sufficient of their produce, and I am glad to emphasise it.  I make this claim, that the first charge upon agricultural production should be a fair standard of life for all agriculturists.  I preach that everywhere, and I hope I shall get the enthusiastic backing of the farmers' representatives for it.  The first charge upon all production should be an adequate livelihood for the producers. If we accept that as a basic principle in economic life, we will find extraordinary reverberations and developments. And yet I do not know how anyone will controvert that the first charge upon the production from the land should be a fair livelihood for the people who produce.  The Minister has asked how we are going to set about the better distribution of the annual product.</P>

      <P>Positively the sole production, as the Deputy says, <Col N="2111" /> of the country, is food.  That food is roughly sufficient for all the people of the country and is to be used for all the people of the country.  Therefore, if all that is being produced is food, and if it is required for all the people of the country, the people must go naked, because they require clothes and shelter as well as food.</P>

      <P>If the Minister desires it, and if I am in order, I might begin.  I put it as a matter appertaining to this motion that the people who are debarred from an opportunity to work the land, because they do not own the land and have no right to enter upon the land, and who are debarred by other economic circumstances which are the offshoots of our present system of production and distribution must be maintained unless you are prepared to allow them to die of starvation. Civilisation lays down that a community must not allow any of its inhabitants to die of starvation.  You say you <Col N="2112" /> have machinery for home help, but we hear what is said from all sides about the inability of the home help authorities to add to the amounts they are at present paying merely to keep from starvation, quite apart from maintaining anything like a sense of self-reliance or dignity.  We are driven back to the position that the central national authority, the Government here, has a right and is bound to provide maintenance, either through extended insurance or preferably through the employment of men at useful public work at decent wages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not admit that. I believe it will be essential, as long as you desire to maintain a big margin of unemployed people, so that your system may run, to pay as an insurance premium a sufficient sum to allow those unemployed people to live and to maintain themselves.  On the immediate question, we have had this problem before us for the last two or three years.  It has been before us for much longer than three years, but we have endeavoured to insist on its being dealt with with much more attention and much more insistence than the Government has yet seen fit to apply to it.  And with every additional month we are finding people getting more and more demoralised and a larger number of people coming to manhood who have never worked.</P>

      <P>We have the announcement that six, eight or ten thousand people could be got to go from all parts of the country to work on the Shannon scheme, for 32/- a week.  Is that an indication of a desire to refrain from work?  Your proposition is that there is £160,000 to be made available between now and the <Col N="2113" /> end of the year.  That is £10,000 a week and there are 30,000 men, on the Minister's own statement, waiting for work, apart from the additional numbers not registered.  I came across, this morning, a quotation that I think I may be excused for reading to the House.  It is slightly adapted, and is applicable to the circumstances of this country at present:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Fancy then some thirty full-grown thousands of such gaunt figures, with their haggard faces in woollen jupes, with copper-studded leather girths, and high sabots, starting up to ask their washed Upper-classes, after long unreviewed centuries, virtually this question: How have ye treated us; how have you taught us, fed us, and led us, while we toiled for you?  The answer can be read in flames, over the nightly summer sky.  This is the feeling and leading we had of you: EMPTINESS&mdash; of pocket, of stomach, of head and of heart.  Behold, there is nothing in us; nothing but what Nature gives her wild children of the desert: Ferocity and Appetite; Strength grounded on Hunger.  Did ye mark amongst your Rights of Man, that man was not to die of starvation while there was bread reaped by him?  It is among the Mights of Man.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Thomas Carlyle was right, and it may be necessary to apply the lesson he hints at there in this country if we do not beware.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to express my disappointment at the totally inadequate efforts of the Government to meet the situation.  The Estimate, in my opinion, will only barely touch the fringe of the problem.  I am satisfied that if the whole sum mentioned in this Estimate was distributed in the city of Dublin amongst the unemployed it would barely keep them from starvation between now and Christmas. I will make a suggestion to the Government because I am satisfied that this scheme brings no immediate relief, and that what you are up against to-day is how to give immediate relief to the hungry men, women and children that are at present in the city.  I would <Col N="2114" /> suggest to the Minister that, as at emergency measure, some fund should subscribe to the Unemployment Fund, and so put every man who is out of benefit and ineligible to draw unemployment benefits into benefit, and give him at least something for Christmas week and the week after.  I understand that there are many thousands in Dublin to-day who are being helped by their neighbours living in the same house. Unfortunately, most of our unemployed come from the tenements.  I had an experience of the distress these people suffer when I visited a certain house. I made inquiries, and I was told by the woman in the room that I visited, that she received a little tea and a loaf of bread from a man in the next room who chanced to get one day's work that day, and that she hoped that when her man would get a day's work, and when the man in the same lobby&mdash;that is the expression she used&mdash;was not working, she would be in a position to pay back the loaf of bread and the bit of tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That condition of affairs is going on for the past twelve months in the city of Dublin, within a stone's throw of our handsomely illuminated streets, within a stone's throw of the Nelson Pillar.  I suggest to the Government that a miserable estimate of this kind, which only touches the fringe of the question, is not dealing with the problem which they must face, and face quickly.  I suggest that something must be done immediately for those who are out of benefit, who have not the necessary stamps to their credit, to give them at least one week's unemployment money for Christmas week and the week after.  In that way we will bring a little relief to the unemployed in the city, and you will, yourselves, get a little further time to consider how you are going to face this problem of unemployment.  I am aware of a case where a young woman gave birth to a child, and the child was stillborn.  I will prove, if proof is necessary, that the woman was delicate, and that the child was stillborn because of starvation.  This is a problem which the Government must make up their minds to face, and face quickly.  I <Col N="2115" /> suggest that while the preliminaries are being arranged for the spending of this sum of money mentioned in the Supplementary Estimate, that immediate temporary relief by the method which I suggested should be granted for Christmas week and one week after.</P>

      <P>Reading over the details of this I find provision is made for financial assistance by way of grant or loan for miscellaneous schemes on terms and conditions to be approved by the Minister for Finance.  I would like to know from the Minister what proportion of money is to be advanced by way of grant and what portion by way of loan, and if the money to be advanced by way of grant will be utilised for the purpose of completing the works that were left unfinished on the 31st March last&mdash;works initiated by the Land Commission, but not under the control of the Land Commission.  I would further like to know for what purpose the money to be given by way of loan is intended.  Some of the money, I presume, is intended for the purpose of financing credit societies, assuming that more credit societies are going to be started.  It would be interesting to know for what the rest of the money to be given by way of loan is intended.  Like most of the Deputies who have spoken on this Vote I am certainly disappointed the Minister did not act a little more generously. I assumed, in view of the changed financial outlook, brought about by the revocation of Article V. of the Treaty, that the Minister for Finance would take a generous view an that he would be prepared to give a substantial figure for the relief of unemployment and distress. After all, as the President stated in his opening speech, the money is intended, to a certain extent at all events, for relief of distress in those districts where people lost cattle owing to the ravages of the fluke disease.  I am afraid that the £120,000 provided for in this Vote would not even cover the losses of people in three of the counties of the congested areas.  I hope that the Minister will see his way to increase the amount provided.  I am sure that considerably more than the amount <Col N="2116" /> mentioned in the Vote could be spent before the 31st March next.  I am anxious to know from the Minister how this money is going to be apportioned or on what basis the apportionment is going to be arranged.  I am particularly anxious that the congested counties, counties such as Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo and Galway, where the small farmers lost considerable numbers of cattle last year, should be taken specially into consideration in the allocation of this money.</P>

      <P>Poverty in the city of Dublin has been referred to.  I am sure there is poverty.  I have not seen it, but if Deputies who know the city state that I will accept it.  But side by side with that poverty you have evidence of extraordinary prosperity.  You have evidence of the spendthrift.  You have evidence of luxury, and you have evidence of squandering, side by side with, and less than 100 yards from the extreme poverty that Deputy Byrne has talked about.  Anybody travelling on a tram through different streets will be struck with the changes in the last ten or twelve years&mdash;house after house, palace after palace, in our main thoroughfares and suburbs&mdash;cinemas and theatres and amusement houses, of one kind or another, everywhere, and night after night you will find every one of them full.  When I was a young man, and in more recent years, no one need book a seat in the few theatres then in Dublin.  They were mostly half full.  Now all the cinemas, theatres and dance halls are crammed, and people still think it good business to invest their money in further cinemas and dance halls in Dublin and in most of the cities and towns of the country.  That is evidence, if evidence were needed, that the country has gone mad.</P>

      <P>It percolates right down from the top to the bottom, and it all comes back to the land.  There are specialists with their staffs and their servants, specialists in medicine, in surgery, in law, anything you name, hardware, clothing, boots, in all the necessaries of life.  You find huge staffs in all the shops and not many customers, staffs attending practically nobody and getting good wages, and all of it charged back to the community that works.  Take transport in the city of Dublin.  Transport here costs more than in any other city in the world to-day.  Dockers are paid more to discharge a vessel, they work shorter hours and give less output. Dockers here are paid 16/- a day.  At ten o'clock in the morning, perhaps, you have a strike for &ldquo;dirty money&rdquo;; at 12 o'clock you have another strike for canteen money for refreshments. The employers meet the men, an agreement is come to, and the thing goes on. This is the last port in the world that masters of ships wish to put into to discharge.  More demurrage is paid in the port of Dublin for slow handling than is paid in any port in the United Kingdom, and all this is charged back. These are the bushes in the gaps of prosperity.  Prosperity cannot come while these bushes are in the gaps.  We would have more of everything, more work, a better standard of life, if the whole subject was approached from a different, a better aspect and a better angle.  But while you have it approached from the present angle, these men must get a huge wage, only work for a few days, and do very little for these few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can the masses of the people of Dublin get employment?  Who would think of giving employment except of absolute necessity?  Who would engage in business, who would go into anything necessitating the giving of employment except he were driven to it by necessity?  Who would go into it as a business proposition?  Who is prepared to gamble in view of the present outlook?  We have a railway system where the employees see only one or two trains passing in the day, and still <Col N="2119" /> an eight-hours day is enforced.

      <P>Some of them, and it will be our duty to educate them still more to the fact that they are being robbed, that they are always working, and that their work is not dictated to by trade unions, that their wages are not trade union wages, their hours are not trade union hours, and that their output is not of the trade union standard. Some people could work harder if they saw that they were going to get any return from their work, but get it out of your heads, once and for all, that those engaged in agriculture <Col N="2120" /> are only cart horses.  They are something more than that.  They will demand better treatment and they will get it.  I recognise that this Vote will not meet the present situation.  I am sure that a good case could be put up for the whole of the grant to be spent in Dublin, and I know that some Deputies would cheerfully make that case. Other Deputies who come from counties in the West can make a case for the money to be spent in their counties. The amount is too small to meet the present situation.  But I am not dealing with the present situation.  I want to get the State to consider how this present situation can be avoided in the future.  I want the representatives of the country to realise that the few people working in the country in the immediate future will refuse, as a body, to subscribe to and support the people who will not work.  Dublin is a city of distributors&mdash;big and little&mdash;I might say big parasites and little parasites, big fleas and little fleas.  They are all living on the backs of the few who work.  In a short time the backs of those people will not be sufficient for them to feed on.  It has been asked if the fact that 6,000 people have applied for work is an indication that they do not want work.  It is not an indication that they do not want work, as far as the 6,000 is concerned.  But what about the other 26,000 we are told about? We have apostles preaching to them not to work for 32/- with hutment accommodation and all the rest&mdash;not to work for any wage at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>And if they do work to do very little for whatever wage they get.  That is not the way to meet the position.  The honest thing to do would be to tell them that the country cannot afford to give them any more, and that hundreds of thousands of people are trying to subsist on much less.  If they do work, they should be told to work as hard as they can.  If that were done, there would be more work to do, because money would be invested in constructive work.  If that is not done, neither the nation nor individuals will be disposed to embark on any undertakings that will provide <Col N="2121" /> work.  When Deputies talk about the Government they should remember that the Government is the people, and when they talk about spending money they should remember that the money has to come out of the pockets of the few people who work.  If we want money we cannot get it in the same way as the Israelites got the manna in the desert.  If we want sufficient money to go round, some people at least must work to provide it.  I would prefer to see all the people working, and not have this problem recurring year after year.  There must be a change of outlook, and the tendency to do as little work as possible must disappear.  If people are not prepared to do it voluntarily they must be compelled to do it.  Otherwise, those people had better find some means of getting to another and better country.</P>

      <P>The position as far as I know, in the constituency that I represent&mdash;Carlow and Kilkenny&mdash;is, that there are very large numbers of people now, at the approach of Christmas, practically without means of existence. They are willing to work but work is denied them.  In his opening statement the President mentioned that in Carlow there would be work on the Barrow drainage scheme and work in the beet factory.  I hope so.  The beet factory will not start until next spring, but in the meantime what is to be the position of the working classes who were looking forward to getting work, especially at this season?  We were told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that there will be work on the Barrow drainage in November.  That work is not going to start now until the spring, and we were not told whether it is the spring of 1926 or 1927.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the President to see that some road work is given in the constituency.  Work is badly needed in Carlow and Kilkenny, and the roads there are in poor condition.  I admit that the ratepayers are not in a position to provide the money that is necessary to put the roads into a good condition <Col N="2125" /> for motor transport.  I trust that these things will be taken into consideration by the Minister for Finance. It is the first time that money has been asked for relief work in this constituency.  I am not given to exaggeration, but I assure the Dáil that the position of the workers in that part of the country is a very serious one, especially for agricultural labourers. That class is not registered and does not benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  I would be glad if something could be done to tide these people over the Christmas season until the spring work begins, and also work on the Barrow drainage and in the beet factory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the President stated, the money that remains unallocated of the sum previously voted amounts to about £20,000.  In addition to that there is another £20,000 which has recently been allocated, but has not yet been spent.  There is, accordingly, for expenditure between now and the 31st of March about £160,000.  It is intended that the whole of that money shall be spent and all steps necessary will be taken for spending it before the end of the financial year.  If it is spent nearly as much money will have been spent by way of relief grants this year as was expended last year, or very nearly as much.  Not more than £380,000 of the £500,000 that was voted last year was expended within the financial year, as the schemes were not completed.  The balance was expended mostly during April and May.  The position is that there will be expended this year about as much as was expended last year out of distress grants. In addition, other works that the President mentioned are being done.  There is the Shannon scheme, and considerable sums are also being expended on building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Outside agricultural work building or construction work in connection with the beet project will be done.  It is not possible for the Government to do more than take palliative measures in regard to the problem of unemployment.  That problem cannot be disposed of by simply taking votes for sufficient money to employ everyone who is unemployed.  By its <Col N="2126" /> reactions that procedure would breed new unemployment.  Its effects on the various industries would be to throw fresh people out of employment, and I do not believe it can be dealt with otherwise than by way of palliation.</P>
    <P>A considerable number of works were undertaken in various parts of the country last year by the Land Commission and were left in an uncompleted state.  These works will be completed. In some of the districts where fluke was most severe, fresh works will be undertaken with a view to giving help to people who, no matter how willing they were, could not benefit in any way by the scheme of agricultural credit societies.  There is no doubt that where money could not be had the agricultural credit societies could not go on.</P>

In that matter also the most that can be done is to try and deal in some way with a proportion of the worst cases.  As for dealing with the problem as a whole, I think Deputies will acknowledge that it is not a problem that could really be dealt with.  It is simply a case of palliation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>In general I am afraid it will have to be spent under the supervision of the Land Commission. We are not very anxious to have it done that way, because the Land Commission has other work to do and has been urged to expedite it.  Any diversion of the Land Commission staff to relief work would tend to delay the other work.  There is also the fact that there is a Department of State which has to deal with distress normally&mdash;the Department of Local Government&mdash;and the local authorities.  Much greater delay, however, would probably be experienced in getting the money expended through the medium of the Department of Local Government and the local authorities than would be the case with the Land Commission.  In certain instances work will even be done in rural areas, it is hoped, through the local authorities.  In other cases it will be done by the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>In some of the districts where the fluke ravages were very great there are works left uncompleted by the Land Commission since last year, and it would be appropriate to take them up, or to prepare some similar works which were considered and which were not actually commenced, but in which there were certain plans, as far as plans were required, or certain details, ready. They could be taken up forthwith.  A Deputy talks about borrowing and doing work of construction.  I have always said that that is putting the cart before the horse.  There is no good whatever in borrowing for the purpose of simply spending.  The way to approach it is, what works of construction can be done economically, what works of construction can be usefully done for the State?  When they have been considered and decided upon, the money can be borrowed for them.  We have always held that we should be willing and we are willing to borrow for any sort of work of construction that we think can be economically undertaken&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I think there was at one time a Bill passed here for the <Col N="2128" /> purpose of enabling borrowing to be done for the Road Fund.  For various reasons, I do not think that Act was availed of.  There are things for which we will borrow, things such as the Shannon scheme and the Barrow scheme.  We will borrow something like £5,000,000 for the purpose of carrying through the Shannon scheme. We will have to borrow something approaching £1,000,000 for the purpose of the Barrow drainage and for drainage works of a similar character. Works of restoration and maintenance were carried out last year.  A larger number of them will be carried out next year.  We are also borrowing for the purpose of making loans to individual farmers for land improvement works.  Where the scheme of expenditure is a good one we are prepared to borrow for it.  I suggest it is approaching it entirely from the wrong angle to go seeking money on the money market with the intention of paying it out rapidly, and without giving the matter due consideration.  That would mean nothing but terrible extravagance. Unless there is long and careful preparation it is very difficult to spend money&mdash;at all events large sums of money&mdash;usefully.  I believe, myself, that it will be all that can possibly be done to spend this £160,000 usefully between now and the end of March. If we tried to spend more I believe there would be very great waste of money.  If you have works done by local authorities, waterworks, or works of that nature, unless the work is actually in progress at the present time you would find it difficult to spend much money between the present moment and the end of the financial year.  Road work is the type of work that can be undertaken quite suddenly, and fairly rapidly, and without very much previous preparation.  But other works are extremely difficult to undertake, unless you are simply trying to do the sort of work that was done in the distant past, where roads were built leading to nowhere, and clay was dug out of a hole and put into it again.  We certainly cannot afford to do that sort of work now, and it would be impossible to vote any sum that a great many people would not say was inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2129" /> Last winter was got through with the help of the works that were done.  This year, as I say, we will spend actually out of the distress grant as much money, and in addition to that we have other works going on, notably the Shannon scheme and these reconstruction works, for instance, in Dublin for the Post Office, the Four Courts and the Custom House.  Now with the additional 10 per cent. to the compensation awards, there will be really rapid progress made in the matter of reconstruction.  I think that, as compared with last year, we are doing as much as the State could well be expected to do.  Somebody asked how much of this money would be advanced by way of grant and how much by way of loan.  Probably there will not be any of it advanced by way of loan.  However, we would take power to advance it by way of loan if any suitable proposal is put up to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other Deputies who have spoken, I consider that this grant is not adequate at all, even as a palliative, to relieve unemployment. I would have thought that the Government would have before now realised the position of the people in the country, and that they would do something which would tide them over the Christmas festival.  I think everybody will admit that it is a pitiable state of affairs to find people starving at Christmas, a time when we are supposed to have peace and goodwill for all.  The President in his statement laid it down, or at least suggested, that the Minister for Finance was going to lay down expressly that before the local authorities would get any grant out of this £160,000 it would be necessary for them to put up a certain amount themselves.  To my mind, that is an impossible proposition, because at the moment the relations that exist between the banks and the various local authorities are such that the banks will not advance any money to local authorities, especially for works of this kind.  Works of this kind have got a bad name in the country, and the banks, being keen business concerns, will not advance money for such schemes.  I would like to know from the Minister for Finance if that is an express condition that the <Col N="2130" /> local authorities will have to put up a certain amount of money to warrant their getting any portion of this grant at all?  If that is the case, so far as I can see, it will be impossible, apart altogether from the fact of getting money, even if they were to get it, to have any scheme going on between this and 31st March next.  The Minister is aware of all the red-tape that surrounds the getting of a loan and all the correspondence and representations that have to be made before a loan is advanced.  When the Minister for Lands and Agriculture was speaking, he stated that the Land Commission, under his jurisdiction, would be called upon to spend £70,000 or £80,000.  I have no objection to the rural population getting £70,000 or £80,000, but I would like to know from the Minister for Finance or from the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, how he hopes to relieve distress in the towns and cities of Ireland on what is left after the Land Commission has spent £70,000 or £80,000?</P>
      <P>Some people object to the local authorities having anything to do with this money.  So far as my experience goes, I think the local authorities are the people who know where distress exists, and they are able to deal with it more promptly than other people.  I am prepared to admit that it is impossible at the moment for the Government to deal effectively with the unemployment problem.  I have suggested time and time again here that the people who are responsible for industry from both sides should be called together. I do not see that the Government have made any move in that direction yet.  I do not observe any sign of their intention to do so.  Until this is done, and until everybody tries to realise the state of affairs that prevails, and gets down to rock-bottom, I do not believe we are going to be a bit better off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has stated that it would be very hard to get back to that position, and that works of this kind are not remunerative.  I would suggest to him that to give some sort of stabilisation to employment in the country his Department should bring in again a Local Loans Bill which will <Col N="2131" /> enable local authorities to get money for a long term of years.  That will serve the twofold purpose of providing houses for the workers and giving employment in the towns and cities of the Saorstát.  All over the country local authorities, no matter how remote the district, are calling on the Government to re-establish the Local Loans Fund.  I believe that would be a very desirable thing to do, and I think the Executive Council might seriously consider the suggestion, because it would serve the twofold purpose I have indicated.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Government that they would put up, say, the difference between £160,000 and £200,000, and pay some money through the Labour Exchanges during the coming week in order to help the workers over Christmas time.  Everybody knows the plight many workers are in.  It will be some time after Christmas before these schemes are got into operation, and they will not relieve the poor to the extent we expected they would be relieved at this time of Christmas. I do not believe it is necessary to say any more on that point.</P>
    <P>I think everybody is familiar with the position that confronts us.  The Government should seriously consider doing something for the unemployed during next week.  I would like to know on what lines are the Government going to work in so far as this £160,000 is concerned.  What information will they work upon?  Immediately before the adjournment last July the Minister for Industry and Commerce admitted that Wexford and Kildare Counties were the worst-off in Ireland so far as unemployment was concerned.  He said there were more people unemployed in those counties, because of certain circumstances, than in any other county in Ireland.  Although that was admitted here, Wexford county, out of the last grant, got merely £2,000, and Deputy Colohan states that his constituency got nothing at all.  The Dáil is entitled to know where that £135,000 went, under whose direction it was given out, under whose direction this is going to be given out, and what facts are to be taken into <Col N="2132" /> consideration before any grant is given to any county.  We are entitled to know this, and I would ask the Minister for Finance or the President, when replying, to let us know it definitely. Wexford and Kildare were looked upon as two of the worst counties so far as unemployment was concerned, last July, yet one got only £2,000 and the other got nothing.  We are entitled to know where the rest of the money went.</P>
    <P>So far as the towns and cities are concerned, everybody knows the position; but the rural population are also very badly hit.  Conditions there are not so apparent as in the cities, for the reason that the agricultural labourers are spread over a large area and they do not come under the public eye so much.  Agricultural labourers are certainly deserving of consideration by the Minister.  Agricultural industry at the moment is at a very low ebb and in consequence of that the agricultural labourers are in a bad way.  They have not received any unemployment benefit; they are not entitled to any under the Act.  I am of opinion they are deserving of special consideration.</P>
    <P>I consider that £160,000 is inadequate. I am sorry the Minister for Finance is not here now.  I would like to mention that representations were made both to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and the Minister for Finance by the Enniscorthy Urban Council for a grant to relieve the distress which is very apparent there.  I put the question to the Minister about a month ago asking had he received such representation and was he aware of the distress existing there.  He admitted he was aware of the distress but he said there was no money available.  Now he comes forward and tells us that £40,000 were available all the time.  I do not think that is treating the House fairly.  I hope something will be done for the unemployed during the coming week and not have them waiting until those schemes are put into operation.</P>

Why is there unemployment in Ireland?  I say it is because the cost of production is too high.  Why will an Irishman, who goes from Ireland to America or England, work three times harder there than he will work in Ireland?  Why is there not a demand for Irish production at home? It is because in the market the prices for the Irish articles will not compete favourably with the prices for articles produced on the other side.  There is a lack of employment in Ireland to-day. I admit that, and there is also a cause for it.  There is also an answer as to why there is not a demand for Irish production.  The answer is because the price for the Irish article is not a marketable price.  I ask my friends on the other side: Why will an Irishman work three times harder in England or America than he will at home?</P>

    <P>Let us get down to bed-rock.  Let us get down to the cost of production. Let us get down to the position of a labouring man who on a Saturday night goes with his wife to do the week's shopping. Let us take, for instance, the price of boots.  Irish boots are put on the counter before them, and there are <Col N="2134" /> also American or Northampton boots. The Irish boots cost, perhaps, £1, and the American and Northampton boots 5s. less.  What reason is given for that?  It usually is this: &ldquo;Oh, the Irish manufacturer is a profiteer, and the foreign article is better.&rdquo; I will say here&mdash;and I have been challenged to say here what I have said outside this House&mdash;that the enemy of the labouring man is the organiser who tells him to keep up the price of labour.  In keeping up the exorbitant price of labour he is making a market at home which cannot meet the competition of articles of foreign manufacture. Our industries are, therefore, dying.  I would like to speak on a question on which I am an expert.  I would like to get down to house-building. What is the reason that a cubic yard of brickwork, or a square yard of plastering, costs as much in Dublin as in New York or Boston?  The wages in New York and Boston are at least three times what they are in Dublin, but it is production that counts in this matter.  A bricklayer in New York will lay between 2,500 and 3,000 bricks per day.  I have been there and laid them, and I am speaking from expert knowledge.  I came home and tried to do the same here as I did in America. What happened?  There was a strike. They would not work with me.  I was spoiling the job by doing too much work.  Then we hear about contractors profiteering.  The contractor knows when estimating his job what he is going to pay to his workmen, and he prices accordingly.  He knows what he is going to pay his bricklayer for laying 500 bricks.  I am speaking in no antagonistic spirit to labour, but I am advising and asking labour representatives, when preaching a policy and when standing behind organised labour, to recognise that they have to produce an article as cheaply as foreigners. Unless Labour allows people to work as hard and as well as their opponents, they cannot meet their opponents on the market.  When our people go out to buy on the Dublin market price governs everything, and, as I have said, the price of an Irish-made boot is 5s. more than that of a Northampton or American-made boot.  We know <Col N="2135" /> what happens in such a case.  I have been challenged by Deputy Morrissey on this point.  We are very good friends, and what I am saying I say advisedly.  How is it that when we go to America we are good workers, and become the best citizens there?  Why cannot we be the same good workers and the same good citizens here?  There is only one road to success, and that is by taking off one's coat and doing an honest day's work for an honest day's pay.  It is not the pay that grinds the manufacturer.  It is the amount that he gets back for what he pays.  I am an employer myself in a small way, and I never grumble about giving a decent wage, but what does concern me is the return I get.  A day's pay is only a small matter.  What matters is the return we get for what we pay. We always have to remember that there is somebody quoting against us. We have always to meet the foreign market, and if we cannot produce as cheaply as the foreigner we must recognise that we are beaten.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has raised the eternal question of bricks and bricklaying.  He says that when Irishmen go to England or America they work three times harder than at home.  I wonder do they work harder in England?  The Deputy says he is an employer in a small way.  I wonder would he really assert before any body of workmen in Ireland that he can take them over to the other side and pay them three times as much for three times the work, and that he would be in a position to carry all before him as a contractor.  Of course, he may say that was only a figure of speech, and that he was only exaggerating, but exaggeration in matters of this kind are rather important.  He says in America bricklayers lay from 2,500 to 3,000 bricks a day, and the work could be done as cheaply per unit in America as in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not that what I am saying, that for the unit of work the price in America is as low as the price in Ireland.  The Deputy said he estimated the bricklaying output in Ireland at 500 bricks per day.  I would like it to be stated by somebody who can speak authoritatively that on straight work&mdash;I think that is the term &mdash;a certain number of bricks would be reckoned, and that on awkward corners, in a particular class of work, that any such output is quite impossible and could not be estimated for.  I have read similar allegations made in England in regard to bricklaying.  The charge in England is that they do not turn out work there as they do in Scotland or Ireland, or other countries.  It is always some other country or place.  In Belfast, for instance, the Chairman of the Belfast Corporation Housing Committee used these words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the Woodvale estate, where they used bricks, the average was 407 bricks per day on the finished job.  At Skegoniel blocks were laid equivalent to 490 bricks per day; at Oldpark 451; and at Stranmillis 372.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So we will have in Dublin on that comparison&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Some weeks ago I happened to be watching American bricklayers.  The bricks there are a very different article indeed to the bricks we see here.

      <P>Some Deputies have suggested that we should deal with the facts of life.  Unfortunately we are not ruling America from this House; we are dealing with the conditions of life and labour in Ireland to-day.  I think it is well when Deputies are talking about the effect of labour cost on prices that they should have a little regard to the proportion of the retail price of any commodity sold in Ireland with the wages cost of Irish labour involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is good to hear in respect to bread that the portion of the labour charges &mdash;the transport of the wheat, milling the wheat, carting it, milling and baking the flour, carting and distributing <Col N="2138" /> the bread&mdash;was something like 27 per cent. of the retail price of the bread. So it is with most other commodities. Even in the case of big engineering schemes, the labour costs in Ireland are not going to be more than 36 per cent., so that the labour costs of the total price is a comparatively small proportion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Seventy-five per cent. of the cost of building is labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a new computation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Good at other times has spoken, I think, of fifty-fifty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Here we are again.  That is only the cost of the actual labour in constructional work.  Then we have the cost of labour in material, and you may take it from me that the two combined mean that of the total outlay on building, seventy-five per cent. is labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to meet Deputy Good at some private place if he will allow us to examine the books and papers and all the commodities from the time the clay is taken out of the land and put into a building, and I guarantee, to the extent of any reasonable sum to any charity, that more than twenty-five per cent is applied to other purposes than the payment of wages.  What I want to say is this, that in respect to the particular industry that Deputy Good and Deputy O'Connor have spoken of, I can repeat the absolutely definite statement from the officials in the trade unions chiefly concerned, an absolute denial that either by written rule, or by advice or by direction of any kind is there any limitation on output given to men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BartOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'CONNOR Mr. O'CONNOR">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNOR</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>And I say further&mdash; I have said it many times here and have repeated it outside: it is the burden of many speeches by members of this party in the Dáil&mdash;that the return for high wages must be high output. But we are not going to agree to the <Col N="2139" /> proposition that Labour must be beaten down by the competition of unemployed labour to the lowest possible level, and that the profit-maker or the interest receiver will receive what he can get in the market.  You cannot talk to the investor with one voice and to the worker with the other voice.  If you say to the investor: you are entitled to interest on your investment, the highest interest you can get in the market for your money, and you may transfer from one to another as you get the opportunity if it is going to be a case of the highest price for the article you have to deal with, then that is going to be the demand of Labour as well as of the remainder of the community.</P>
      <P>But apart from that theory, I believe quite definitely, and I say that, given high wages, let us give good production, let us give the highest possible output, and let your organisation from the employers' side be of such a character as will induce the best output.  I have no hesitation in saying that the country requires, and absolutely needs, the highest output per man and a cheaper unit cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hesitation in saying that at all, but I say that you are not going to get that if you are going to try to achieve it by cutting down wages, and your opportunity for introducing that principle into public work in this country is being lost by your treatment over the Shannon scheme.  Instead of using your opportunity to introduce this idea amongst workmen and employers&mdash;high-class organisation, the best equipment and high wages with a view to the utmost possible output&mdash;you are saying: No; we will get the highest output at the lowest wages.  That is your proposition, and that is how you are trying to introduce new methods into this country.  You will fail, and so long as you are going to base your economy upon the lowest possible price for labour you are going to have a war between Labour and Capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing an Estimate for relief schemes, and it may <Col N="2140" /> appear to some that the question we have been immediately discussing across the floor of the House may have no bearing at all on the larger subject of relief schemes.  Now this particular question has a direct bearing on that. As many in this House know, I happen to be connected with the brick manufacturing industry.  In the year 1914 we had in the County Dublin, in connection with the company that I belong to, four different brick works running, and giving employment to over 1,000 hands.  To-day three of these brick works are closed down, and the remaining one is working half-time. It is not able to keep a regular number of employees constantly employed, and why is that?  The reason is because cement has come into the market, and by reason of the high cost of brickwork in building, cement has cut out both bricklayers and brick manufacturers. If we could get bricklayers to do in Dublin what is done elsewhere, the industry would not be in that condition. We would have a larger amount of employment for bricklayers and a larger amount of work for brick manufacturers.  Cement, as we all know, is not manufactured in the Saorstát at all.  The labour that is used in manufacturing the large quantities of cement used all over the Free State at the moment is employed outside the Free State.  I mention that fact as we are considering this particular aspect of the question, but there is no advantage, as I pointed out here on many occasions, to be gained by discussing the difficulties in trade and production across the floor of the House.  I suggested here on many occasions that there are places where that should be done, and where it ought to be done. It ought to be done in conference between the two parties engaged in that particular industry.  Deputies know that I have preached that particular doctrine in this House on many occasions.</P>

      <P>I challenge the records as regards any proposal I have made in this House to show that I have stated that before these matters are considered certain conditions must be agreed to.  I have not attached any condition of any kind.  I say that these problems, if they are to be considered on the lines that they should be, must be dealt with in conference between the two parties who are anxious that the best may accrue to the State as a result of their labours.  Let both parties go into a conference imbued with that idea, and I am quite satisfied that we would not be in the condition that we are in to-day in the case of many industries in the Free State.  I hope that, as a result of this discussion, something may eventuate on the lines of bringing both sides engaged in our industries to-day known as capital and labour, together to discuss these problems.  I am sure that as a result of that discussion good would accrue to all concerned in connection with these industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in bringing forward this very low Estimate for £120,000 proceeded on the assumption which.  I think, is a wrong one, that the conditions in the country to-day are as good, and perhaps better, than they were when he put forward a similar sum in the last financial year.  I do not agree.  I would not care to exaggerate in the wrong direction the condition of things in the constituency that I represent, but I do emphatically state that the conditions are worse there to-day than they were twelve months ago. I had myself hoped and believed that as a result of the good harvest and the fair prices likely to come to the people for their farm produce, conditions would have been much better?  I asked, on the last occasion, when an Estimate of this kind was put forward by the Minister, that he should state quite clearly, and specifically, for what particular purpose, and for what kind of works, grants under this head would be available.  He stated, to-day, as he did on a previous occasion, that portion of this amount, something like £40,000, will be spent under the supervision of the Land Commission by fulltime officials of the Government.  That, <Col N="2142" /> I think, is a very undesirable thing if it could be avoided.  My own view is that where the taxpayers' money is spent on schemes of this kind it would be much more desirable to have it spent by the local authorities with the sanction of the Minister responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that a good deal of red tape exists between the Ministry of Local Government and the local authorities, and that a good deal of delay might elapse between the time when the works were sanctioned, and the approval of the Minister obtained. My general experience is, and it is the experience of other Deputies in this House, that we are continually receiving resolutions from local bodies pointing out the distress and unemployment that exists in particular areas, county or rural, and asking us to approach the Minister responsible to secure a grant for the relief of such distress and unemployment.  Deputies in that unfortunate position on this side of the House very often are unable to advise the local authorities or local councils as to what kind of scheme is likely to receive the approval of the Minister.  I think it is up to the Minister to make the position clear and to state the kind of works that this money is to be spent on in endeavouring to relieve unemployment. I know of schemes of road and drainage work that had been put up to the Minister and turned down. I am in the position of not being able to find out the mentality of the Minister or his officials as to what general idea is in their minds as to the most useful kind of work that money voted for this purpose should be allocated to.  I hope the Minister will make clear the kind of works that are likely to meet with his approval and sanction in the future.  I am not going to follow Deputies Good and O'Connor on the question of bricks and mortar.  I will only say that to the inexperienced the lecture we have listened to was certainly valuable. I sincerely hope that the proposal Deputy Good has made, without conditions, will be accepted.  If that proposal is to serve any useful purpose, the conference suggested must be brought about through the agency of the Government.  I understood that a similar proposal, put forward before, <Col N="2143" /> was put forward on conditions, and I think the President said on that occasion that it was not the business of the Government to bring parties representing Labour and Capital into conference. If the Department of Industry and Commerce has any useful duty to discharge, it is their duty to bring about such a conference as has been suggested, without conditions of any kind attached.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt for a moment to say that Deputy Johnson was wrong when he said that conditions were imposed by Deputy Good in regard to the previous proposal. There were Press comments which practically suggested that a certain suggestion by one side should be agreed to before going into conference.  On the last occasion, what I said was that the Government was not going to take the initiative in that matter, that it was a matter that should be approached with goodwill on both sides, that it should not be brought about at the instance of the Government, but that it should be brought about on the responsibility of the two parties.  I stated that any assistance or co-operation that could be afforded by the Government would be willingly given, but that the real effort ought to come from the two parties, rather than from anything done by the Government.</P>

      <P>May I intervene for a moment.  This question of conference has been several times raised.  It has been raised here and it has been accepted here, but it has become a proposition with a pre-condition which emanated from the assertion that nothing could be done except wages were reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  A proposition from the Chamber of Commerce was submitted to the Labour Party, through the Department of Industry and Commerce, following a discussion on compulsory arbitration.  The proposition was replied to favourably with this condition, that if it was intended to be preconditioned by the proposal of the Chamber of Commerce, which implied <Col N="2144" /> an acceptance of the idea of compulsory arbitration, then there was no use in proceeding.  I will say this for myself, that if the proposal is that the elements representative of two sections of the community, from the different parts of the country, should meet, without any preliminary condition, and discuss problems thoroughly with a view to securing the best interests of the community, I will do all I can to ensure the success of that meeting.  I will do my best to ensure that the meeting take place and to ensure the success of it if it does take place.  I have been willing to do that at any time, but now the proposition is put to us without any conditions and without any pre-suppositions, and, under those circumstances, I believe it will be accepted.  I would like to add to what I say that it ought to include everything that comes under the category of employer and employed, of capital and labour, whether it is a case of public ownership or private ownership, whether Government service or private service, and that the intentions that have been stated here that certain conditions are the only conditions on which certain public works can be carried through, prejudice the possibilities of success of any such conference.  It was stated in the other House that the official spokesmen of the trade union movement were hopefully enthusiastic in their view that the Shannon proposals would give an opportunity to introduce a new spirit in industry both amongst workmen and amongst employers, and would introduce the idea of the utmost effort on the part of workmen, within the limits of their capacity, and the best possible equipment and organisation on the part of the employers.  But I say that that is only possible if, on the wage side, there is going to be generosity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that when this conference is called, those who represent agriculture, through the Farmers' Union or whatever associations exist, will be included, because there are questions concerning both labour and farming which, in turn, concern and have a very great effect upon bricklayers and brick manufacturers.  Without such people being represented in a conference of that kind, the result we all look <Col N="2145" /> to would not be brought about.  Deputy O'Connor said that the root of the trouble was the high cost of production. I think he was only thinking in terms of bricks and mortar when he made that statement.  When we were discussing the question of a fair wage for the workers on the Shannon scheme we were told that there were 212,000 agricultural labourers with an average wage of, I think, 25s. 9d. per week, and 240,000 uneconomic holders who, with their families, receive no actual wage or return for their labour on the land. I think Deputy O'Connor will scarcely try to persist in stating in this House that the depression in agriculture to-day is due to the high cost of labour, especially when we have 240,000 uneconomic holders who get nothing for their labour on the land.  I would not like to see Deputy O'Connor leaving the remunerative employment which, according to his admission, he has, and going down the country trying to sell potatoes at £3 a ton.  When he returned to a hotel here to stay in it, he would find that the hotel-keeper here had to pay eight or nine pounds a ton for them. I wonder would he find out in his spare time where the difference goes or who is getting the most out of it in that particular case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy speaks in general terms of the trouble that this country is faced with, and said the root of the trouble lay in the high cost of production.  I deal with it so far as it concerns the main industry in the country.  The Minister for Finance indicated that he intended to provide some form of relief for the people who lived in the areas where fluke destroyed most of their stock.  I am anxious to find out from him in what way he proposes to relieve those people.  I daresay it is through the agency of the Land Commission he will carry out work of that kind.  I have a parish in my mind at present of about twenty people.  Deputy Egan knows of this case and has the figures.  Almost every one of their cows, sheep, and <Col N="2146" /> even goats, were destroyed by the fluke last year.  About a week ago the Land Commission insisted on endeavouring to collect £957 in annuities from people who have no stock on their land.  The Minister for Finance proposes to relieve such people through the agency of the Land Commission whereas the Land Commission, who are the agency, are making the position far worse by insisting on the collection of annuities.</P>
      <P>It is something in the nature of a silly proposition, and I am anxious to find out in what way he proposes to enable people who have lost their stock to restock their land.  Near the parish I speak about a proposal was put up, supported by the organisation that supports the Minister, for relief work and, like all others, it was turned down.  I think the taxpayers who have to find this money and the local councils are entitled to know the kind of works the Minister is prepared to sanction within the terms of the amount in this Vote.  If local councils were made aware of the position as far as this is concerned, there would be far less delay in putting forward schemes, which, when put forward, would receive the sanction of the Minister and enable work to be put in hands more quickly than at present.  I had not the pleasure of listening to the President's opening statement, but I gather he made a statement which has been made once or twice before &mdash; that is, that they propose to undertake work on the Barrow in the coming year.  I hope before they put the Bill into its final form they will take the opportunity of getting into touch with the local bodies that will be likely to bear their part of the local charge.</P>

      <P>The position with regard to the scheme is really that the most careful examination and estimates of the cost did not exactly disclose <Col N="2147" /> that it is an economic proposition, even allowing for the contribution that is to be made by the local authorities, but that it was considered, in view of the ultimate advantage that might be derived, and of the great damage that the overflow was doing to the land, that the doubt might be resolved in favour of the scheme.  As an economic proposition it is open to the charge that it is money that might be otherwise much better spent, and I just mention it in order that the Deputy might understand that in asking the local authorities for their contribution we are not asking for a big thing.  Rather we are giving something.  If there be any concession in it, it is a big concession for the Government to undertake it in view of the finance of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned the matter simply because, in company with local people who are likely to be concerned, or with one county council at any rate, I had long conversations with Deputy O'Sullivan upon the matter, and I had hopes, and still hope, that if steps are taken in the right direction, getting into consultation with the local people, there might be agreement as to the amount that should be borne by the local authorities.  But there is, at the moment, a difference of opinion as to the extent of area of charge, and these are things, I think, for consultation and conference with the people who will be responsible in the local areas, before the Bill is passed and a huge sum of money is spent.  If the President thinks that they are not worthy of consideration let him take his own course, and the matter will have to be threshed out when the Bill comes along, but I would prefer that there should be agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>One is glad, as a result of the discussion to-night that there is a probability that we will have these exchanges of views between the different interests concerned in the near future, and I was glad to hear Deputy Johnson mention that he will give whatever support he can, as I am sure he will, to bringing about this conference and making a success of it.  In <Col N="2148" /> connection with these relief schemes, the Minister for Finance said that the difficulty is to find suitable works to which to apply the money.  Immediately there occurred to me a work that I think it will be agreed would be a suitable work.  It is a work in connection with which I was approached a little while ago to see if anything could be done.  It is within the knowledge of members of the Government Party that a considerable amount of damage was done at Greystones, in the County Wicklow, that a roadway and a sea wall were washed away quite recently, and except some steps are taken immediately to repair the damage the probability is that a number of houses will be washed away. That is a matter to which I think some of this money might be applied.  It would give employment, it would be work of a useful nature, and I think anyone who knows anything about it will agree that it would be work of an urgent nature.  When I heard from the Minister of the conditions attaching to the giving of these grants, that one must approach his Department through the local authority and that the money must be expended before the 31st March next, it should be remembered, and I am sure the Minister knows, as we all know who have anything to do with them, that local authorities move very slowly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the local authority has to be set in motion it will mean that the greater part of the period between this and 31st March will have expired before the local authority will have got its scheme together and got into motion. So that except some means can be adopted for expediting these schemes I am afraid they will not bear the fruit we would like them to bear.  It occurred to me that if some of those interested in the area I have mentioned approached the Minister first, and then approached the local authority, it is possible that the scheme might be expedited. I know that that is not the regular procedure, but if one wants to get this work put in hands immediately I think anybody in touch with local authorities will agree that something out of the usual procedure must be adopted.  I would be glad to know if <Col N="2149" /> the Minister would consider favourably a proposal of that kind.  If he would consider that proposal favourably I think it would be a way of getting over the difficulty that many of us anticipate where works of this character have to be brought before local authorities.</P>

      <P>In a great many cases local authorities have already submitted schemes to the Local Government Department, and in a great many cases it will be possible at once to tell them that, now that further money has been voted, their scheme, having regard to its nature and to the evidence we have of distress in the district, is one which is sanctioned, and the grant can be issued at once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any condition in cases of that kind that the local authority should find a proportion of the money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>We could not insist, of course, on such a condition, but if the local authority is willing or able to put up money it will cause that scheme to be favoured over others, because it will mean that we will not only be spending the money voted but that other money will be put into motion to give employment, and we will certainly give a preference where we can get a local contribution added.  But we could not insist at all rigidly on the putting up of money by the local authority. Deputy Davin asked what sort of work would be sanctioned.  Any useful kind of work will be sanctioned, but we have to take into account conditions in the district.  We always try to get reports from the Department of Industry and Commerce, from the Department of Justice, so far as it gets any reports from the police, and any information that is forthcoming from the Department of Local Government in regard to the extent of unemployment and distress in a particular district. If a scheme is put up from a particular area which would involve the expenditure of a considerable sum, and if, according to the evidence that we have, there is not very great distress in that district, or that there is <Col N="2150" /> comparatively little distress, although the scheme and the nature of the work are intrinsically all right, we may refuse that district in favour of another where there is greater distress and more unemployment.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the conditions in Greystones are, but it is just possible that Greystones is a district where there may not be a great deal of distress and unemployment, and, of course, if that were so we would be inclined to say &ldquo;No,&rdquo; even although the nature of the work might be good. We take the two questions into consideration. It would be preferable, in any case, that the people interested locally should approach the Minister for Local Government rather than my Department.</P>

      <P>I think the attention of the local authority has been called to it.  I refer to the distress existing in a place known as The Commons, Ballingarry.  It received a good deal of publicity at one time.  I am sorry Deputy Morrissey is not here, as he would know all about it.  The Minister probably knows that this is an old coal-mining district.  The mines have been abandoned, and a lot of people who formerly worked in the mines are out of work and in distress in consequence.  They cannot be absorbed in agricultural work.  They are not suited to it, nor is the work in existence for them.  A very distressing report was made by the local Home Assistance Officer in regard to that district. There is a bad state of affairs existing.  I want simply to call the Minister's attention to it in case the local authority should not move because the burden on the local rates is more than they can bear.  The burden of giving Home Assistance to the people concerned is more than the ratepayers can bear.  I do not want to enlarge on this matter now, but I will be ready to put any information I can get at the disposal of the Minister if he will consider the advisability of giving a grant or a loan for some form of relief. We might be able to devise some useful relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is the desire to dispose of the Bill as soon as possible and perhaps there would be an adjournment until after Christmas to-night. The amendment is one which was mentioned in the Dáil, and the Minister has expressed his willingness to accept it. I think it was not put down through some delay, until the Bill had reached its final stage, and in consequence it was ruled out of order.  The amendment is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A new sub-section added at the end of Section 3 as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  Where the premises to which a supply of electricity is proposed to be given under this section are situate in the area of supply of an authorised undertaker, the Minister shall not approve of the giving of the supply under this section unless or until he is satisfied that such authorised <Col N="2154" /> undertaker is either unable or unwilling to give the supply.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The position at present is that a statutory undertaken in any particular area has practically the monopoly of supplying electricity within his area, and this is to provide that electricity shall not be supplied to premises within that area by some other undertaker, unless the Minister is satisfied that the existing authorised undertaker is either unable or unwilling to supply.</P>

At the same time I maintain that it is only right that some reply should be forthcoming from the responsible Minister after the discussion of a motion of this kind.  However, I must be very thankful to the Government for introducing this Supplementary Estimate.  But for this motion, which was handed in a fortnight ago in order to serve the unemployed, I dare say we would not have heard anything about the matter. I think the unemployed must be thankful for this small mercy received at the hands of the Government.  It is to be hoped that the £120,000 voted for the relief of distress will be allocated in a proper manner.  The motion has been supported by a large number of Deputies on the Labour Benches.

An attempt has been made and has met with some success, to put certain tariffs on manufactured goods coming in here, but to go to the other extreme and subsidise industries would require money.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil hereby approve of the Gárda Síochána Pensions Order, 1925, made on the 19th day of October, 1925, by the Minister for Justice, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, under Section 8 of the Gárda Síochána Act, 1924, and Section 13 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, and laid before the Dáil on the 19th day of November, 1925.</P>
      <P>This is to make provision for the payment of pensions and gratuities to the members of the Gárda Síochána and for the payment of pensions, allowances, and gratuities to the widows, children and dependents of deceased members.  It will apply to all members of the amalgamated force other than those who were serving in the Dublin Metropolitan Police prior to the 15th March, 1924.  These latter will continue to be governed as regards their pension rights by the statutes and statutory orders which have hitherto applied to them.  Before the order comes into operation it has to be approved by Resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.  It has been approved by the Seanad.</P>
