      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if an award of £94 was made on the 12th March, 1924, by Judge Sealy in favour of Mrs. Catherine Geary, of New Inn, Cahir, Co. Tipperary, in respect of compensation for losses suffered owing to looting of goods during 1921-'22; if the amount of this award has yet been paid to Mrs. Geary, and, if not, if he will state why this has not been done, and if he will take steps to have payment expedited in this case.</P>

      <P>A report in favour of Mrs. Geary recommending payment of £94 has been received in my Department. This figure includes a sum which represents board and lodging provided for Irregulars and I am not prepared to authorise any payment so far as this part of the recommendation is concerned. Payment of £75 in respect of goods commandeered without the applicant's consent, together with £12 11s. 9d. costs and expenses will be authorised at an early date.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that the Stationery Office are asking for tenders for the supply of fountain-pen ink in glass bottles, and whether, in view of the fact that Irish <Col N="1412" /> firms will be prejudiced by the necessity for paying duty on these bottles, he will consider the advisability of allowing the ink to be supplied in some other form.</P>

      <P>If any contractor submits a satisfactory alternative to the glass bottle in which fountain-pen ink is at present supplied the Comptroller of the Stationery Office will give the matter favourable consideration.</P>

The staff of the Civil Service Commission will be fully employed up to the 30th <Col N="1413" /> June in preparing for the examination, and it would not be feasible, without risk of failure in completion of the examination arrangements, to require the staff to prepare the detailed return asked for.  I should be glad, before considering whether the information might be given at a later date, if the Deputy would indicate the object for which the details are desired.  Unless a definitely useful purpose would be served, I should not be prepared to place upon the Department the additional burden that would be involved in the preparation of this return.</P>

      <P>Assurance Companies are under obligation to furnish returns to the Department of Industry and Commerce in respect of accounting periods only which began subsequent to 6th December, 1922.

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister, as I have had the reply, a question?  The reply states that: &ldquo;It it is not possible to state the total &lsquo;interest income&rsquo; arising out of Employers' Liability Insurance in An Saorstát as the accounts do not in all cases show separately the dividends and interest attributable to the Employers' Liability Funds.&rdquo;  May I ask whether it is not a statutory obligation to furnish dividend and interest income separately? It appears some societies have done it, while it has not been made obligatory on others to do so.  As that information is essential to a proper understanding of the returns, will the Minister require societies to give the information according to statutes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I might, in reply, direct the Deputy's attention to the <Col N="1415" /> fact that the reply is incomplete in another respect.  It says that returns have been received from nearly all the companies, and later, it says that these figures are not exhaustive owing to the absence of returns from a few companies. That defect and the defect to which the Deputy alluded, are due to the fact that there is some doubt as to our compulsory powers with regard to these returns.  A case has been listed for this week, and once that case is decided we shall know exactly our position, and then we shall take steps to get the returns in the form in which the Deputy has asked for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

I did not know that the Convent was included in these cases.  The Deputy, as a remark on his further question shows, is quite well aware that it is not a matter for my Department but a matter for the Department <Col N="1416" /> of Local Government.  I am not clear whether the Deputy is really asking that that Department should be asked to put pressure on the Commissioners in this city to do something which, in their judgment, they decided would be unwise in the interests of the ratepayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's answer, may I ask, as this is a matter relating to a railway, does it not come within the scope of his Department, and, if it does, could he not arrange that a longer notice of a shutting-down of a concern of this kind should be given?  A week is altogether an inadequate time for the inhabitants who had been getting in their supplies of electricity, to make other provision. If a month were given, they would have some chance of doing so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of a railway or a tramway in one respect, but it is also a question of a tramway company, without statutory authority, supplying light to certain places.  That is obviously not a matter for me.  If Deputy Cooper would guarantee the shareholders against further losses, which the receiver of the company says will accrue to them by keeping open, I am sure they will consider the question of giving a longer period than a week.</P>

      <P>Michael Delaney Brownstown Road, Curragh Camp, Unemployment Insurance Book, No. 2560, Droichead Nua, claimed unemployment insurance benefit at the Droichead Nua Branch Office on the 10th March, 1925.  On this claim he was paid eight days' benefit up to and including the 25th March, 1925, on which date the Fourth Benefit Year terminated.  Mr. Delaney made a further claim on the 26th March, 1925, on which a decision could not be given for some time owing to the fact that his title to contributions under Section 4 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1924, was in doubt. This question has now been determined in Mr. Delaney's favour, and consequently his claim has been authorised for 90 days, which is the maximum period of benefit allowable in the current benefit year.  Payment of all benefit due to Mr. Delaney will, accordingly, be made to him at the Branch Office on Friday next.</P>

      <P>I understand that a claim made by John Hickey, the father of Michael Hickey, in respect of his own loss in the death of his son, came before the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee, who found that it was outside their terms of reference. A similar claim had at the time been dealt with by my Department, and an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment of £100 had been made to Mr. John Hickey.  There was no information that the deceased had left a wife and four children.  In one of the claims he is described as having been single, and twenty-three years of age.</P>

This is described as being &ldquo;A Bill to restrict, control and where necessary prohibit the discharge or escape of oil into navigable waters.&rdquo; This is a matter which has caused a certain amount of trouble in all maritime countries, and legislation somewhat similar to this Bill has been introduced, or there has been an agreement to introduce it in other countries in order to do away with this matter of the discharge or escape of oil in navigable waters, which is now regarded as a very definite disadvantage for many reasons which will be explained on the Second Reading.  It has even got to the point that international action as between maritime countries is being considered with a view to enlarging the area.  The Acts passed in different countries of course only relate to territorial waters, but there is a question of taking steps even with regard to prohibiting this on the high seas.  This Bill is, as I say, of the type that has been introduced into several countries.  The details are pretty well the same everywhere and they can be discussed on the Committee Stage.</P>

In the Official Report of last Friday's debate on page 1375, the President is reported as having stated: &ldquo;the dates that appear to be most suitable are the 17th August for the completion of the panel, and the 17th December for the election,&rdquo; while immediately afterwards Deputy Johnson is calling attention to a September election, so that there appears to be some error in the <Col N="1423" /> Report.  I would like to know what the last word of the Government is. The present situation is that we have passed a resolution in Committee stating that the panel is to be completed on the 6th July and the election of our portion of the panel on the 9th July.

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my statement in connection with the Budget I said that our proposal for assistance to the agricultural industry was the doubling of the agricultural grant.  This Bill is to enable the undertaking then given to be carried into effect.  It provides for the increasing of the agricultural grant by such an amount as shall be provided by the Oireachtas, and it is proposed to double it in the current year by taking a supplementary grant for the sum equal to the full agricultural grant of £599,011.  The Bill empowers the Minister for Finance, in any subsequent agricultural year, to increase the grant by taking a vote for any amount which may be considered desirable.  Any supplementary grant provided by the Oireachtas in this way will form part of the original grant, particularly in its relation to the Guarantee Fund.  The share of each council in the increased grant will be certified by the Minister for Local Government on the same basis as the allocation of the original grant.  I do not say it will not be desirable to review the allocation of that grant in a more definite way at some early opportunity, but meanwhile the supplementary or additional agricultural grant will be allocated on the same basis as the original grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two clauses that bear more particularly on the function of the Minister for Local Government, and no doubt he will deal with them in detail on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  Clause 4 of the Bill is necessitated by the fact that certain county councils have failed to make an adequate rate provision for their requirements in the current financial year.  It is not proposed to allow them to use this additional agricultural grant for the purpose of decreasing the already insufficient rate, and the agricultural grant in those particular <Col N="1425" /> counties will be applied to wiping out the deficit which these counties have wrongfully budgeted for.  Clause 6 is necessitated by the fact that one or two counties were not in a position to make a rate provision for the year 1925-26 by the 1st June owing to difficulties respecting arrears.  The clause allows those councils up to the 31st August, so that the work in connection with the rates already done may not be lost.  If this provision were not inserted these councils would have to re-arrange their rates on the basis of the Local Government Act of this year, unlike the other councils, who are allowed to strike rates on the old basis, subject to adjustments.  It may be of some interest to members to indicate the present allocation of the £595,000 of the agricultural grant.</P>
    <P>Carlow, £11,337; Cavan, £15,896; Clare, £30,195; Meath, £29,555; Cork, £75,144; Dublin, £20,743; Galway, £31,591; Kerry, £26,877; Kildare, £15,740; Kilkenny, £25,703; Leitrim, £10,291; Leix, £15,370; Limerick, £41,055; Longford, £9,811; Louth, £12,783; Mayo, £23,238; Monaghan, £13,387; Offaly, £14,973; Roscommon, £18,534; Sligo, £14,053; Tipperary (North Riding), £18,667; Tipperary (South Riding), £27,870; Tirconaill, £20,938; Waterford, £19,693; Westmeath, £17,552; Wexford, £24,045; Wicklow, £13,646; the County Borough of Dublin, £317.</P>
    <P>I think a very good case can be made out for a revision of that particular allocation, but it is not a matter that could be tackled now, and it seemed to us that the only way we could deal with this question of increasing the agricultural grant was to divide the new sum along the lines of the old grant.  If the whole question of the agricultural grant is gone into, naturally any additional sums will be redistributed.  We do not feel at the moment, with the time at our disposal, if the benefit of the grant is to go to agriculture this year, that any reallocation could be made.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to object to the provision of this grant.  I <Col N="1426" /> hear, however, from more sources than one, that it is the intention of the Government to revive the payment of this grant in the future.  I do not stand by this allocation because it means that those who had a high rate in the year 1897 are getting yearly that amount of the high rate taken off their rates.  Still, we do not wish it to go out that the right policy of the Government to pursue is to say: &ldquo;If you do not do a certain amount of tillage and so on, you are not going to get a grant.&rdquo;  We stand all the time for as much tillage as our requirements need. We stand for tillage sufficient to feed our live stock in the winter particularly, but we do not see that tillage should take the form of crops to be sold off the land.  I do not wish the Government to understand that the proper allocation of this £600,000 would be towards the development of tillage to be sold as raw material off the lands.  I hope the Government will not be led away by that aspect of the case.  Our idea is that tillage means better food for the cattle in the winter.  Let the product of the farm be walked off instead of driven off.  We appreciate the fact that a payment has been made by the taxpayer towards the relief of agriculture.  We hold that this subvention is a long time due.  We are getting now into the same position as that of the farmers in England and the North of Ireland.</P>

As a matter of fact, the farmers in England pay twenty-five per cent. of the rates, and seventy-five per cent. is paid by the State.  Here we get something equivalent to forty per cent. of the rates this year and there is no guarantee that the Minister for Finance may not, next year, wipe the second £600,000 off the Finance Bill. There is nothing in the Bill to say that it is going to be in perpetuity.</P>

      <P>The Minister said it might be changed to more, but there is also the possibility that it might be made less.  While we would not wish his ideas to run in that direction, we must put forward a case that in giving us this grant they are only placing us on a line with our competitors.  It is a necessary subvention to the farmers who do not get the services that city dwellers get.  Therefore, while we take it with thanks, we believe it is due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like my colleague, Deputy Wilson, am thankful for small mercies.  While I am not opposing the grant, still I feel that I am justified in taking exception to the wording of several sections in this Bill. Section 2 states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Finance shall in the financial year beginning on the 1st day of April, 1925, and in every subsequent financial year increase the agricultural grant by such amount (in this Act referred to as the supplementary grant) as shall be provided for the purpose in such financial year by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does that mean that this grant must be voted expressly by the Dáil and appear on the Estimates each year?  If that is the case, I take exception to that view point.  I think it is undesirable that this agricultural grant should appear in the Estimates each year. The proper method to adopt would be to pay it out of the Central Fund.  The Minister has stated that the grant may and can vary.  In such an event as that, it is possible that an effort would be made to reduce it.  The minimum of our demand is, that the grant should be doubled.  That is the very least we could hope for.  I dislike the idea that this grant must be brought forward each year and be subjected to the Vote and the criticism of the House.  Suppose, for instance, there was a party in the House hostile to the agrarian interests which could command a majority, there is every likelihood that the grant would be reduced.  It is stated in sub-section (2) of Section 2 that &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act, the supplementary grant shall for the purposes of any enactment be deemed to form part of the agricultural <Col N="1428" /> grant and in particular shall be subject to the provisions of Section 40 of the Irish Land Act, 1903, in relation to the agricultural grants.&rdquo;  In other words, it is proposed that this grant should form part of the Guarantee Fund.  If tenant purchasers in the country cease to pay their annuities, the State is making this further provision to recoup itself.  The way it appears to me is, that the Government is giving this grant with the one hand and is retaining it in the other.  That is really what the position amounts to.  When Deputy Michael Doyle referred to this on the Budget debate, the Minister for Finance, if my memory serves me rightly, gave an assurance that this grant would not form part of the Guarantee Fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I said it would all reach the farmer.  It would not all go out this year, but the Guarantee Fund is sufficiently well provided for this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood it was well provided for in perpetuity.  The evident desire of the Ministry is to exclude this grant from Section 40 of the Irish Land Act.  On the Committee Stage I intend to put down an amendment with a view to securing, if possible, that this grant shall not be mortgaged to the Land Purchase Fund. In dealing with Section 4 of this Bill the Minister for Finance referred to county councils and their failure to strike adequate rates.  His words were that, &ldquo;instead of further reducing the rates by this grant, they would rather utilise them to make good any deficit in the rates.&rdquo;  I am not enamoured of that proposition.  The meaning that I put on these words is this, that the grant is to be devoted to purposes for which it was not primarily intended. If what the Minister states be the intention, then it would seem that urban dwellers are to receive some advantage from this grant.  I hold that that is a departure from the principle underlying this Bill, and I think Deputies on these <Col N="1429" /> Benches would be well justified in resisting such a proposal, namely, the throwing of this grant into a common fund.  This grant is to be specifically devoted to the relief of rates on land, and it should be devoted solely to that end.  While I would give no countenance to county councils which strike inadequate rates, still I am not prepared to sacrifice our rights and to dish out our bread all round.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to hear from Deputy Wilson that it is the intention of the Government to consider, if not in connection with this year's allocation, at any rate in future years, the relative values to the State, and therefore the need for a variation in the allocation in regard to the amount of land suitable for tillage which is being tilled.  I think it is well to hear that commended by Deputy Wilson, or at least to hear it announced by Deputy Wilson if not commended by him.  My only regret is that some such provision has to be delayed for another year.  It would have been available this year if that could have been embodied in this particular Bill.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that Deputy Johnson has unwittingly misrepresented my statement.  I simply reiterated a statement made by a Minister of the Government, and only adverted to the fact that such a thing might be in the mind of the Government. At the same time, I have not asked the Government to carry that particular point of view into effect.</P>

      <P>I did not expect that Deputy Wilson was asking the Government to carry that into effect, but he was announcing it for the benefit of the House, and while it might have been preferable if the announcement had been made frankly by the Minister, still it is well that it should come second-hand through Deputy Wilson. My chief purpose in rising was to ask a ruling on a point of order regarding Section 6.  It might be more fitting if this were to be done on the Committee Stage, but for purposes of notice, it may be desirable to call attention to it now.  The point I ask your ruling on, A Chinn Comhairle, is this:&mdash;Sub-section <Col N="1430" /> (1) of Section 84 of the Local Government Act of 1920, was inserted in that Act on a motion passed by the Dáil.  Standing Order 38 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A motion to rescind or amend a resolution can only be made on notice, that shall specify the resolution to be rescinded or amended, and furnish the terms of the motion to be made; but no motion shall be allowed to appear on the Order Paper to rescind any resolution of the Dáil within six months of the date of its adoption, except with the written assent of not less than twenty-five members of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Standing Order 39 states that &ldquo;No Teachta shall re-open a discussion on a question already decided, during the same session.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It may be necessary to amend that Standing Order or to suspend it for this purpose.  I do not know, but the question of the alteration and the amendment of Bills and Acts passed within the same session is rather an important matter, and I think we ought not to allow a proposal to amend Acts passed within a session without some kind of query on the matter.  Complaint has been made on a good many occasions that too many Bills have been brought forward, and that probably adequate consideration has not been given to the drafting of them.  As a consequence, amendments have had to be brought forward as well as amending Acts, and this appears to be quite contrary to the intention of the Standing Orders.  I do not know whether you will rule that this is a motion or resolution which cannot be amended during this session or not, but I suggest that it is a matter that we should consider before we either disobey the Standing Order or pass a Bill in contradiction of the Standing Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  As I indicated on the First Stage, so far as Section 1 is concerned, it became necessary because it was discovered that what was intended when the Oireachtas (Payment of Members) Act, 1923, was being passed, had not actually been effected.  Section 23 of the Constitution provides that&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Oireachtas shall make provision for the payment of its members, and may, in addition, provide them with free travelling facilities in any part of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Committee elected by the Dáil in September, 1922, on Salaries and Allowances recommended that Teachtaí be allowed £30 a month towards expenses, and in January, 1923, the Dáil resolved that such allowances towards expenses should be made, and this resolution is quoted in the Preamble of the Oireachtas (Payment of Members) Act of 1923.  In the discussion in the Dáil, when the measure was introduced, the President, speaking on the 6th May, 1923 made it clear that the payment of £30 a month was to be a flat rate, and should not be regarded in the nature of salary, but as a contribution towards the expenses of members.  The fixing of special allowances in individual cases would not have been practicable, and the allowance was regarded as an average applicable to members of all constituencies.  On the First Reading of the Bill which became the Act of 1923, the question was raised whether the allowances would be liable to income tax and the President said on the 9th May, 1923, in the House:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think I can give an assurance to the Deputies who think there is a likelihood of this sum being included in the assessment of their income tax that that will not be the case.  There is no such intention.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be clear that it was definitely intended when the Act of 1923 was passed that the allowance should not be subject to income tax.  However, it recently became necessary to consider the legal effect of the Act owing to the <Col N="1432" /> question being raised and the Government has been advised that the intention, which I have indicated, was not carried out.  The allowance payable to Deputies under the Act of 1923, though not strictly remuneration, is legally an allowance in the nature of remuneration and as such is liable to income tax.  It becomes necessary, therefore, to give effect now to the intention that the Dáil had when the Act of 1923 was passed. If we were to allow matters to stand as they are at the present time, the Revenue Commissioners would have no option but to proceed by way of deduction or otherwise to recover income tax due by Deputies and I do not think that we should either ask or put pressure upon the Commissioners to refuse to collect or to fail to collect a tax that is legally due. There would be the possibility of allowing a certain amount of it under one of the general rules.  I think under Rule 10 of the Act of 1918, there is power to allow a certain part of the total allowance as allowance for expenses.  Out of the £400 in England, £100 is sanctioned by the Treasury as the average amount payable necessarily and wholly by members in discharge of their duties. If a person wishes to have further allowance he must give particulars of his expenses and prove that the money was actually and necessarily paid out by him in such a way as to be entitled to exemption under the Income Tax Act.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 1 is necessary for the sake of consistency and complete compliance with the Constitution. The opinion is held that Article 23 of the Constitution, which imposes on the Oireachtas the liability of providing for the payment of members, clearly refers to all members of the Oireachtas, and it is held that the Payment of Members Act ought to be construed in that way.  Sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Act states that the allowance paid to each member of the Oireachtas under the Act shall be an allowance of £30 per month.  It is provided by sub-section (2) of Section 2 that the person who holds any of certain specified offices shall not be <Col N="1433" /> entitled to the allowance over and above the salary of his office, but that such salary shall be deemed to include the allowance.  We are advised that the salary of persons holding one of those offices should be deemed to be segregated, one portion being an allowance payable under the Act, and the remainder being the salary proper, and it follows that persons holding one of these offices is entitled to have that portion of his salary, which is deemed to be allowance, treated in the same way as an allowance paid to other members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is really introduced because of the cases we have in connection with the Military Service Pensions Act.  It has been the practice under various British statutes since 1834 to provide that if a person is entitled to a pension from public funds any other pension, remuneration or allowance from public funds to which he may be entitled, shall be set against the pension, and that such pension shall be suspended or abated.</P>
    <P>A similar provision in sub-section (1) of Section 8 was inserted in the Military Pensions Act, 1924, and in regard to this provision the question arose as to whether the payment of £30 a month to members of the Oireachtas was to be treated as a payment to be set against the military service pensions receivable under that Act.  We have been advised that the allowance to members is a payment which must be treated in that way, and the military service pensions, consequently, in such cases are subject to re-abatement in respect of the allowance of £30 a month to members of the Oireachtas. This would mean that in future a person who had a military service pension and who became a member of the Oireachtas, would be subject to a loss of a very substantial portion of his military service pension because of his membership of the Oireachtas, although, of course, he might, and probably would, by reason of his membership of the Oireachtas, incur expense actually to the full extent of his allowance received as member of the Oireachtas.  He would be very much penalised by becoming a member of the Oireachtas.  Although this is the effect <Col N="1434" /> of the section in the Military Service Pensions Act, it is not felt that this is desirable.  There might be other pensions and allowances which would be subject to abatement in the same way if a person became a member of the Oireachtas, and it is not felt, in general, that that should occur.  It is consequently provided that, for the purposes of the suspension or abatement of any pensions or allowances received by any persons in this country, the allowance received as a member of the Oireachtas shall not be taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed that the abatement may vary, if any pension or allowance varies according to the amount of other remuneration received. It is proposed in the case of a person who holds one of the offices dealt with under the Act of 1923, that is, the Ceann Comhairle, An Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, An Leas-Chathaoirleach, the President of the Executive Council, or any office which is dependent on the Executive Council or dependent on the support of the majority of Dáil Eireann or any office dependent on the term of existence of a particular Dáil Eireann, that in respect of persons like that the £360, or whatever may be the allowance given to members, shall not be taken into account for the purpose of determining what shall be the amount of the payment or whether there shall be a suspension of any payment received by them.  There is a matter which, it was suggested should be dealt with in this Bill, and that is the question of travelling facilities, but there is not such great urgency about that matter.  There is also power <Col N="1435" /> under the Act of 1923 to adjust the method of providing travelling facilities if it is thought desirable and necessary to do so.  The Act of 1923 provides that a member of Dáil Eireann shall have travelling facilities between Dublin and any place in the constituency of which he is a member, and that members of Seanad Eireann shall have certain other travelling facilities, and sub-section (2) says that the travelling facilities aforesaid shall be provided and paid in the same manner as shall be, from time to time, prescribed by regulations made by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Eireann and the Cathaoirleach of Seanad Eireann. So that if it is desired to make any adjustment in the matter of travelling facilities, that can be done to a considerable extent, at any rate, without further legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a demand for a system of season tickets instead of the present system of vouchers.  So far as we have been able to estimate, we think that the system of providing season tickets would involve an increased expenditure of £1,500.  There may be irritation caused to Members by reason of the fact that season tickets would have to be for a particular station in a constituency, whereas a Member might wish to travel to other stations in the constituency, so that adjustments would have to be made.  The position so far is, that it is not felt that a change from the present system of vouchers would, by reason of any convenience it might cause to Members, justify an additional expenditure of £1,500 a year.  Some time ago we took up with the railway companies the question of special rates for season tickets.  At that time any concessions were refused.  In view of amalgamation, the matter has again been raised, and it may be that some new arrangements may be possible, but, in any case, we did not feel that it was necessary to deal with the matter by seeking further legislative powers.  This Bill before us deals with two matters, both of which are in a sense, urgent. The matter dealt with in Section 1 is very urgent, because there is no doubt that very considerable irritation and <Col N="1436" /> trouble would be caused if the Revenue Commissioners proceeded with the collection of the tax.  It is, on the other hand, most undesirable that the Revenue Commissioners should be expected not to collect a tax which we are advised is legally due.  Section 2 deals with a matter which is a very considerable hardship on two or three or, perhaps, four or five Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given notice of the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That a decision on this motion be postponed for six months, and that the Seanad be requested to assent to the appointment of a Joint Committee, to consist of ten Members, to inquire into the effect of the existing arrangement in regard to the payment of Members of the Oireachtas, and travelling facilities, and to make recommendations as to the best method of putting into operation Article 23 of the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is very generally agreed that the present system of payment does not fall with anything like equal benefit upon the Deputies in the Dáil, and that amendment in the method is required, is, I think, generally conceded. There is a common impression abroad fostered by newspaper writers some times who do not appreciate the facts, that it is a very paying proposition to be a member of the Dáil.  Well, a member of the Dáil who lives in the country, and who devotes any reasonable amount of time to his duties, would require to be in residence in Dublin during every sitting of the Dáil, and on other occasions when the Dáil is not sitting, and residence in Dublin in hotels for a very extended period of the year does not allow very much of a margin out of the £30 a month salary. In addition there are the usual expenses for postages, amounting to 5s. or 10s. a week, and car fares within his constituency.  Either a Deputy has to refrain from coming to Dublin for his duties, or to have some other source of income which is sufficient to enable him to carry on with.  In that way there is a penalisation of the Deputy who is not in a position to carry on independently of his allowances as a Deputy. <Col N="1437" /> One of the consequences, I fear, of this method of payment is a temptation to stay away from the Dáil occasionally for the purpose of saving the inevitable expense of remaining in Dublin.  I do not know whether that is only a guess on my part, or whether it is a fair assumption, but I risk the making of it, without having heard anyone mention it except myself.  I think there is need for reconsideration of the method of making allowances, and of considering whether or not there should be included in these allowances something in the nature of a penalty for nonattendance, or inducement for attendance. I am very well aware of the difficulty of departing from a flat rate, but these difficulties have been met in other countries where it has been decided that the greater equity could be arrived at by other methods than the flat rate.</P>
    <P>We have had two years' experience of the working of the 1923 Act, and I urge that that experience ought to be availed of, that we ought to re-consider the whole question of the payment of expenses to members, and that we ought not to legislate afresh even in respect of income tax until that inquiry has been made.  The Minister has made it clear, and I think it has been clear to everybody who was a member of the House in 1923, that the intention of the legislature was to consider this £30 per month as an allowance for expenses, that is to say, that the sum paid to Deputies and Senators would be free of income tax.  But the Bill provides more than that.  It proposes to consider the salaries of Ministers and others as something apart from allowances, or rather that the allowance has to be considered as something apart from the salary, and it has been suggested that when the Act said &ldquo;salary shall be deemed to include allowances,&rdquo; it was intended that that part of the salary which was equal to the allowance of Deputies would also be free of income tax charge.  I think that is an interpretation that is not generally held.  The belief at the time, in my opinion, was that a Minister or officer of the House who was in receipt of salary would not be in receipt of <Col N="1438" /> allowance as a Deputy, and as a consequence the exemption from income tax would not apply in such a case. The effect of this section would be to increase the salaries in question, and, as I think, interpreting the original Act in a way which the original legislature did not intend.</P>
    <P>In may be said that interpretation of Article 23 of the Constitution makes it essential that a distinction shall be drawn, and that the Ministers and others should be free from liability for income tax on that part of their salary which is equivalent to the allowance of Deputies, but the effect of it is an increase in remuneration to salaried officers.  I think we ought not to pass any legislation at present in any direction of that kind without having given very full consideration to the position. To begin with, I think it is an unfortunate time to introduce any proposal of the kind, however desirable it may be on the merits, but the House is not in a position to judge of the merits without pretty close examination.  Therefore, I am proposing this amendment, which would mean the setting up of a Joint Committee if the Seanad assents, to consider the whole question of allowances and salaries in relation not only to the Dáil but to the Seanad also, and that then legislation should be enacted, if required, to deal with the position as might be found to prevail by that Committee. We do not know what the effect of these sections is going to be. They are very involved.  We do not know the number of persons that might be affected.  I think that we would be legislating in the dark in favour of people of whose existence we do not know, and that we ought not to be asked to pass any such Bill as this without the fullest inquiry and investigation. In the first place, as I have said, it is an unfortunate moment to be legislating for any increase in salaries for ourselves, or Ministers, or Secretaries, or officers of the House.  Deputies and Senators are all included, and I submit that we ought to make a much fuller inquiry into the whole position before we pass this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment, and for this reason, largely, as <Col N="1439" /> stated by Deputy Johnson, that this is an unfortunate time to propose legislation that could bear the construction he has placed upon this proposal, and the proposal could certainly be construed into meaning what he has said. The way we should look at this matter is that in actual practice it will be found that for the Deputy living in the country who has to leave his business and give conscientious attendance in the Dáil the allowance he gets is not sufficient to meet his outgoings.</P>
      <P>If he is paying any attention to his business and has to come up to Dublin every week and find accommodation for himself there, he will find at the end of the time that the balance is altogether on the wrong side.  The position of the Deputy who lives in Dublin is quite different.  That might explain the great anxiety that there is on the part of people in Dublin to become representatives of rural constituencies. We have a great many candidates of that kind seeking the suffrages of rural constituencies.  To the man living in Dublin this allowance is an income. Whatever his occupation is, he can devote a few hours on a few days in the week to the Dáil, and do his duty fairly well.  Ministers are in the same position Having their homes in Dublin, what they draw in salary is undoubtedly income.  After deducting the £360 that an ordinary Deputy gets, I think that the rest of their salary ought to be subject to income tax.  Last year we suggested a ten per cent. cut in the salaries of Ministers and Teachtaí, but we were told it could not be entertained, as it was against the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the amendment, though not entirely on the grounds that commend themselves to Deputy Johnson and the remainder of the Labour Party, or those that commend themselves to Deputy Gorey.  I find it difficult to criticise this measure for a number of reasons.  One is that the Minister introduced it on my birthday, and may have some intention of making me a birthday present thereby.  Another is that some eighteen months ago, in reply to a question, he informed me <Col N="1440" /> that this exemption from income tax was statutory, and he had no power to dispense with the statute.  He has now got another adviser, and tells me it is not statutory, and that the Revenue Commissioners have no option but to proceed.  I think it is the Bible says that in the multitude of counsellors there is wisdom.  In the Minister's case he has found in the multitude of counsellors confusion, as is not invariably the case.  I find it difficult also to discuss this matter without reverting to the position of those Deputies who are not well endowed with the goods of this world.  Deputy Gorey spoke of dwellers in the city having an easier time than dwellers in the country. That is so to a certain extent, but it is not entirely the case.  Dwellers in the city and county of Dublin for instance, do not get their travelling expenses I do not know if Deputy Gorey knows that.  A great many people do not know it.  They have to pay their own expenses and, when there are late sittings, they have to make their way home at their own expense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends how near the home is.  They may have homes in County Dublin far away from parts of their constituency.  The other night some of my constituents in North Dublin wanted to see me.  There was no suitable train service and no 'bus, and I had to hire a taxi at a cost of £2 10s.  Whether a man lives in the city or the country, the spirit of the Constitution, I think is, that any man, no matter what his means are, or lack of means, should be enabled to be a Deputy.  Therefore, I would willingly support any measure that made it possible for the poorest Deputies to receive adequate remuneration for their services here.  That is one of the subjects which, I take it, will be before the Committee that Deputy Johnson proposes.  But the Bill goes beyond that.  The Bill, for instance, as has been stated, makes no provision for dealing with irregular attendance. Article 23 of the Constitution lays down no particular term for which the allowance made to members of the <Col N="1441" /> Oireachtas is to be paid.  It does not definitely say that they are to be paid by the month.  I suggest they might be paid by the day.  We usually sit from 120 to 150 days in the year.  I would willingly see Deputies paid three guineas a day, or even more, on condition that they appear on that day to claim the money.  Of course, there would be some who would get the money and then go away, but, on the whole, there would be a better attendance I commend the idea to Deputy Dolan.  I am glad to see he appreciates it.  At any rate, this is a matter that would be suitable and proper for the Committee to consider.</P>
      <P>Then again, there is the question of those Deputies to whom this is, in fact, an allowance; those who, having private means, will not need to depend on it for their livelihood.  While this allowance may very properly be exempt from income tax, I do not quite see why it should be exempt from super tax. The Deputy or Senator who is in a position to pay super tax might not unreasonably pay it on this £360.  That at any rate, would be in accordance with what Deputies Johnson and Gorey say and with the spirit of the times. Lastly, I come to the question of making Ministers and others exempt on a portion of their income.  I doubt whether that is a sound principle, particularly as regards Ministers.  I doubt whether it puts a Minister in the right position, in his relation to the tax-paying public, to exempt any portion of his income from the payment of the taxation that the ordinary person has to pay.  It is not that Ministers are overpaid.  I have never had the smallest sympathy with that particular cry, which is a foolish one.  We want the services of good men, and we ought to pay them as much and more than they are getting.  I would gladly increase their salaries, but I do not like exempting them from taxation that they ought to feel, taxation in precisely the same way as the ordinary man, getting some nominal income, has to pay.</P>

I am not talking of Deputies; I am talking of the ordinary individual that you meet in the tram-car or the train who is not in that privileged position.  I think it is unwise for Ministers, unwise even for Deputies, to claim any position of privilege in this respect.  Let us pay an adequate and sufficient allowance to remunerate Ministers for their great responsibility, for the many claims on their time, and a sufficient allowance to make it possible for Deputies to attend here regularly without the feeling that their business affairs are suffering.  Let us not put ourselves in the position of exemption from the taxation that the ordinary individual, the ordinary constituent, the ordinary merchant, shopkeeper or clerk has to pay.  It is not so much wrong as undiplomatic.  It is unwise and giving a chance to people to throw stones at us as occupying a privileged position. Since I take it that the Committee proposed by Deputy Johnson will take all these matters into consideration I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>There seemed to me, and I admit it is rare enough, in the Deputy's speech, a certain confusion of thought.  The Deputy said it was undesirable that Ministers should be in any different position from that of the ordinary man in respect of their salaries.  That is not questioned.  The confusion of thought that I would put my finger on is this: that a Minister on becoming a Minister does not cease to <Col N="1443" /> be a Deputy.  He does not cease to be a member of the Dáil.  He does not, in most cases at any rate, cease to have expenses incidental to membership of the Dáil.  I am sure the Deputy would not claim that the Minister for Fisheries or the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Finance was any the less a Deputy because he held a Ministerial or Secretarial position.  The salary of Ministers was fixed at £1,700. That £1,700 included the allowance which is made to Deputies as members of the House.  The effect of the Bill would be to exempt from income tax, not their salaries but £360, that portion of their salary which represents their allowance as Teachtai Dála.  The alternative to that is to charge on the entire salary of £1,700.  That would come to £300 or £350.  In doing so you would in effect be charging income tax on their allowance as members of the Dáil, which is not proposed and which has not been the practice on that allowance to other members of the House.  I think I am right in claiming that it is not a question of discriminating in favour of Ministerial salaries, but rather asking the Dáil to agree that there ought not to be discrimination as against Ministerial salaries; that you ought not to do in the case of Ministers what has not been done in the case of Deputies, and what it is not proposed to do in future in the case of Deputies, that is to assess for income tax the £360 which represents their allowance, under the Payment of Members Act as Deputies.  The remainder of the salary will, of course, be liable to taxation.  There is no question whatever about that.</P>

      <P>There is only the question of that portion of their salaries, £360, which, in common with other Deputies, they receive as members of the Dáil.  The effect of the Bill certainly is to exempt that from taxation just as it is exempted in the case of other Deputies.</P>

      <P>I think the proposal in this amendment, to set up a Committee, is really unnecessary.  We can <Col N="1444" /> view the whole situation without calling in the assistance of any Committee to inquire into the pros and cons of it.  In a proposition of this kind it would be useless to lay down rules that would differentiate between Deputies I say that the allowance of £360 is fixed to cover what is considered a reasonable amount for expenses attached to the position occupied by Deputies In some cases it may not be sufficient, and in other cases it may. One must remember that membership of the Dáil is not, generally speaking, recognised as a whole-time occupation. It is not, I take it, intended in itself to provide a livelihood.  If that were so the amount would be entirely inadequate to cover election expenses and the incidental expenses of attending the Dáil, as well as various other charges that fall on Deputies.  You should not differentiate because a man has other means, to the extent of what other means he has available, and say he is only to get so much, while his next-door neighbour is to get another sum.  If you say that a man living in Donegal has considerably more expense than a man living in Dublin, you might also have the position that the man in Dublin would have a larger family than the man in Donegal.  You would bring considerations into the matter which I respectfully suggest are unnecessary or undesirable.  As regards income tax, I think the Bill is reasonable in that part except in so far as the amount that really becomes a salary.  I think that the Dáil could hardly differentiate in that way.  Of course the tax does press very heavily at the present time.  One must recognise that the present rate of income tax chargeable to the ordinary man in the street operates in connection with every expense he has to undergo.  In connection with that factor of the high rate of income tax it does seem that freedom from income tax on the £360 paid to Deputies is unduly favourable to the individual, but, on the other hand, to put that right would mean differentiating between Deputies.  I think that is impossible, although it may be desirable.</P>

      <P>When this £360 was <Col N="1445" /> originally fixed the idea was that the other £40, which would make it £400, would go as income tax.  I understand that was the intention in fixing £360 and that the £360 was not to be subject to income tax.  A different matter arises with regard to Ministers, as in the Ministers and Secretaries Act it is definitely stated that the amount they receive is salary.  I can hardly see how that can be got over.  Each Minister is appointed at a salary which is set out in the Ministers and Secretaries Act, and unless that Act is amended I cannot see how Ministers can be exempted from income tax as far as the £360 goes.</P>
      <P>Then Deputy Cooper's point is that the Ministers who have the right of levying this income tax should be made to feel what the public are feeling, by paying out of their salaries what the outside public are paying out of their incomes, and by that means have it brought home to them what an enormous burden this income tax is on the salaries of people.  Perhaps it would teach a lesson and perhaps it would enable us to get rid of that burden.  I would like legal opinion to be given as to whether you can possibly&mdash;in view of the fact that under the Ministers and Secretaries Act the Ministers are getting what is described as a salary&mdash; pass this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to say a few words on this, as I happen to be one of the members of the Committee which sat originally to consider this question of the payments to be made to Deputies and Ministers.  I would like to say, in passing, that the method that was adopted that time, as will be in the recollection of members of the last Dáil, was that a Committee composed of various parties in the Dáil at that time, considered the whole question and made a report to the Dáil. The report was discussed and adopted and was finally enacted legislatively. Now that is the suggestion that is proposed in Deputy Johnson's amendment, and I think, on the whole, it is a wise and proper suggestion to adopt.  I think it would be better if there was an opportunity of a full discussion&mdash; such a discussion as you cannot possibly <Col N="1446" /> have in the Dáil&mdash;on all the issues that are involved, before coming to a final decision on the matter.  That is why I support the amendment.  I might say in connection with this matter, so far as my memory of what took place at the Committee goes, that it corresponds with that of Deputy Wilson&mdash; that the original idea was that the allowance to Deputies should be at £400.  It was finally agreed that £360, less income tax, would, approximately, in the generality of cases, amount to £400 with income tax.  It was finally agreed that the figure of £360 should be fixed, that sum to be free of income tax, as this would get rid of a lot of trouble and queries so far as Deputies were concerned.  I remember, distinctly, that the same question arose with regard to the salaries of Ministers.  We had before us representatives from the Ministry of Finance who strongly advised&mdash;and their advice is on record, I think&mdash;that it would be altogether wrong, quite impossible, and introducing a bad principle, to fix a salary for a Minister free of income tax. Now, in effect, what this Bill proposes to do is to fix the salary of a Minister at £1,340.  That, in effect, is what it does, plus his allowance as Deputy.  He gets his allowance as Deputy and his salary as Minister is £1,340.  That is the proposal.  Of course I take it for granted that in the Estimates in future under the heads of the various Departments, the figure for salary will appear as £1,340 instead of £1,700 and that the allowance of £360 will go into the general Vote for payment of members of the Oireachtas.  If it does not, it will lead to confusion.  That is the only way I hold it can logically and reasonably be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am one of those who held and hold that the payment of £1,700 a year is not sufficient, at least for our principal Ministers.  It is not sufficient remuneration for the responsible duties they have to perform.  As a member of that Committee, it was with great reluctance I agreed to the figure of £1,700. I do hold that the payment of £1,700 a year all round to the different Ministers is not an equitable arrangement. I think, at the same time, that it would be far preferable and far better if the <Col N="1447" /> motion were brought definitely before the Dáil to increase the salaries of the Ministers, in accordance with what the Dáil would think right, rather than that this roundabout and indirect way be taken of increasing the salaries of Ministers.  But that is what is being done.  I say, distinctly, as one of the members of the original Committee which had this matter under discussion, that the clear and definite intention of that Committee was that the £1,700 a year should be subject to income tax&mdash;that is, income tax on the full £1,700 a year.  That was the intention of the Committee.  I have no doubt at all on that point.  I suggest, therefore, that Deputy Johnson's amendment ought be accepted and that the whole thing should be reconsidered by a joint committee.  The Seanad now is also interested in the matter.  The whole thing should be reconsidered with a view to seeing whether there is any better way of meeting what, I am prepared to agree, is a grievance on the part of the Ministers.  I think it would be a better way all round if that suggestion were adopted, and when the report came before the Dáil it could then, if necessary, be enacted in the usual form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that attention is concentrated on what is really a minor aspect of the Bill.  It may be that it is desirable that the whole matter should be looked into by a Committee at a convenient time.  I, certainly, would offer no opposition to the appointment of a Committee to examine whether the whole question of the allowance to Deputies should not be recast.  I can see very strong arguments in favour of that.  Of course, no doubt, very distinct administrative difficulties would arise in the carrying out of some alternative system and a delicate situation would probably be created for, perhaps, officials of this House.  But it is a matter that might well be discussed and I certainly would see no objection at all to discussing it.  On the other hand, I do hold that we are faced with a certain crux here, and that we must deal with it at the moment, whatever we may do in the way of further revision of the whole system later on. <Col N="1448" /> We are legally advised that this tax is payable on the £360 a year.  That being so, it becomes the duty of the Revenue Commissioners, at once, to take the appropriate action with a view to the recovery of that tax.  I believe that it is particularly unsatisfactory in the case of members of the Oireachtas that we should bring pressure to bear on the Commissioners to fail or to delay in the discharge of their duty.  If it is the advice of the solicitor to the Revenue and of the Attorney-General that the tax is due on this £360, then it would be extremely wrong that I should go to the Revenue Commissioners and say to them: &ldquo;Look here, I do not want you to take any action in this matter; I want it to rest as it had been doing when you were of another opinion as regards the law.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that if we appoint such a Committee six months would be the minimum time required for its report If we are to go into the matter thoroughly and deeply, as Deputy Johnson suggests we should go into it, it would be this time next year before a Bill could be brought in.  We should not be in the position of restraining, by a sort of not very correct pressure, the Revenue Commissioners from taking the action they would ordinarily take, during a very prolonged period like that.  For that reason, I think that whatever we may do about the Committee we really ought to meet the difficulty that has arisen now as a result of the legal advice that has been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of the Minister's allowance, that is really a minor matter.  The advice that we have got is that the proper way of carrying out the provisions of the Constitution is that we should make an allowance to members and that we should read the Payment of Members Act, 1923, in the sense I have already indicated, as including the £360, with all its exemptions and penalties.  That is to say, the salary of the Minister should include this allowance, and whatever is the law in relation to the allowance to one member of the Dáil should be the law in regard to the allowance to all members of the Dáil, whether Ministers or not.  The proposal which is made here is to put Ministers in the same position <Col N="1449" /> as other members of the Dáil, except members who have no other income than the £360.  If a member of the Dáil has income, including the £360 he gets here, the £360 is free of income tax.  If we take the position say, of a professor, who had salary and emoluments amounting to £1,340 a year, if he becomes a member of the Dáil, the total remuneration which he receives from all sources is £1,700.  If he were simply a member of the Dáil, he would have that £1,700 a year and he would be chargeable to tax, subject to the usual allowances, on £1,340 of that.  If he became a Minister and had the same remuneration, he would be chargeable to tax on £1,700.  It is a matter that is, I think, not of very much consequence, but the arguments that have been suggested to me seem to be correct: that this allowance should be paid in exactly the same way to all members of the Dáil whether they hold offices such as Ceann Comhairle or Minister or Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <P>I now come to Deputy Cooper's point about supertax.  I see no reason why we should not deal with supertax in the same way as income tax.  As a matter of fact, if there is any case at all for giving this allowance to people who have substantial incomes, there is a perfectly good case for not making the £360 chargeable to supertax.  Deputy O'Connell has referred to the view put forward by the officials of the Department of Finance and Revenue Department when the Committee was sitting.  Undoubtedly, the opinion of the officials is that we should not have £360 free of tax, but that we should have, if the Dáil thinks it wise, a larger sum, subject to tax. You will find that the general official view is that all salaries should be subject to tax and that if you want to get a certain net sum you should provide a gross sum sufficient to give you that net sum, after tax had been paid.  If there is anything in the argument put forward by Deputy Wilson he should really carry the matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he says it is necessary, for the <Col N="1450" /> giving of proper consideration to the feeling of taxpayers, that every penny of the Ministers' salaries or remuneration should be taxed, then every penny of remuneration given to T.D.'s should be equally subject to tax.  If we set up a Committee, as has been suggested, I am sufficiently in touch with the Revenue Department to share their view that the proper thing to do would be to increase the salaries, so as to give £360, after charging the tax, although there would be certain difficulties about that.  The position is now that it was intended to have this £360 free of tax. We find that that intention was not carried out in legislation.  The £360 is subject to tax.  Unless we legislate further, it is the duty of the Revenue Commissioners to proceed for the recovery of the tax due and arrears.  I do not think that that is a position that we should allow to remain for so long a time as would be taken by this Committee in its deliberations.  If Deputy Johnson proposes such a motion as this, independent of this measure&mdash; that is to say, to set up a Committee to consider the whole matter&mdash;I certainly would not object.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of the National Health Insurance Bill, 1925.  This Bill proposes to continue for another year the Medical Certification Fund, which was set up under the Act of 1924.  It also proposes to pay out of that Fund doctors for services rendered in the way of medical certification; secondly, to pay for the scheme of medical referees set up last February, with the approval of the Minister for Finance; thirdly, it proposes to make provision for second medical opinions given prior to the coming into operation of this scheme of medical referees.  Before the Act of last year came into operation, <Col N="1451" /> medical certification was a charge on State Funds.  In that year it became a charge on insurance funds. The funds were provided in the following way: there was a charge of 10d. per member for each member of the approved societies; 10d. per member from the Deposit Contributors' Fund; 10d. per member from the Military Forces Fund, and a charge of 5d. per member on the Exempt Persons' Fund. The 10d. was made up in the following way: 5d. was derived from the saving on the administration of the societies, which was effected in 1923.  Heretofore, the cost of administration of the societies was 4/10.  That year it was reduced to ?.  The first fivepence was derived in that way.  Then there was a saving of 2d. in the administration cost of the Insurance Committees. The actuarial estimate was that the administration of these Committees would cost 6d. per member, whereas in actual practice it worked out at 4d. per member.  It was considered equitable to divert this 2d. to the Medical Certification Fund.  The remaining twopence was also another windfall. There was a margin left.  The cost of benefit was a flat rate; the actuarial estimate for the cost of benefit was at a flat rate and the income was three-pence more than what was actually estimated for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Bill was going through the Dáil last year there was a certain amount of criticism.  Societies throughout the country objected to the diversion of this fivepence, which was a saving on the administration charges of the societies.  The societies maintained that if there was such a saving it should go to the benefit fund of the societies.  It was considered this objection was reasonable, and accordingly an undertaking was given that that fivepence should be only diverted for one year.  This year we have decided not to take that fivepence, and accordingly there is only a charge of fivepence on the societies this year.  The difference between the actual charge on this Medical Certification Fund and what was derived from the societies was made up in the Stamps Sales Account Naturally this year the charge <Col N="1452" /> on that fund will be greater as a result of not getting so much from the societies It is proposed to continue this arrangement only for another year.  It is hoped that by the end of that period the Commission sitting to inquire into the whole matter will have brought in a full report and then we can go into it fully.</P>

      <P>There should be some better understanding as to the dates on which particular Bills or Estimates or particular business will be taken.  I think it is not reasonable to put on the Order Paper a long list of motions, whether it is expected that they will be reached or not.  There is too much of a gamble about that.  I think the method of fixing dates on the assumption that matters may possibly be reached, is not a right method.  We should have a little more precision as to the dates on which certain business <Col N="1453" /> would be taken.  I agree with Deputy Gorey, not from the point of view of the number of days that will elapse, but from the point of view that you are putting on the Order Paper, by the order of the House, certain business, with the possibility of altering the whole arrangements later.  That is not a reasonable way of carrying out business; it rather leads to looseness and carelessness Deputies may be prepared to deal with one matter and they may not know if it will be brought forward on the day named in the Order Paper.  I suggest to the Minister that if we fix a date for a particular Bill or Estimate, we should endeavour to consider it on that day if possible; if we cannot reach it on that day, we have to appoint another day for its consideration.  We should not carry a long list of Bills and other matters on the Order Paper on the chance that they may come up, and we should not make it a habit of altering our arrangements on the morning of the day on which particular matters are to come up.</P>

It is not so simple in practice to act up to those counsels of perfection.  The Deputy says that putting down things on the Order Paper on the gamble that they will be reached is absurd.  There is a gamble in another way, too.  If you put down a limited amount of business on the Order Paper, and by chance, by some purely accidental circumstance, such as, let us say, the absence of certain Deputies, the business goes through more expeditiously than one would expect, and you were then left without any business with which to proceed, you would have no alternative but to adjourn early.</P>

It is only when you see the amendments that you can form even an approximate estimate of the time that will be taken up.  There is no real, practical alternative to putting things down for Tuesday next and seeing on Tuesday how long they will take.  There is no suggestion of a closure in order that all the business that will appear on Tuesday's Order Paper will be concluded that day.

If Deputies believed there was any reasonable chance of those Estimates being reached, of course we would have a large attendance and, to that extent, it would be an advantage.  But the attendance would only be for voting purposes and it would not be because Deputies would have considered in advance the business to be conducted.

Like to-day, there may be nine or ten items on the Order Paper.  This particular Bill may be item No. 8, say.  After questions on Tuesday we may hear that it is proposed to take item No. 8.  Deputies may find that that is the actual matter that will be dealt with.  On the other hand, it might not be taken at all on <Col N="1455" /> Tuesday.  Business is not being done as it should be.  It may be all right from the point of view of those in charge of the Bill.  They are aware days beforehand of what is going to happen.  Deputies who reach here half an hour or perhaps ten minutes before the Dáil assembles are at a great disadvantage In connection with this Bill, which is of considerable importance, we would like to be able to suggest amendments.  We have only from now until Friday to do so.  I did not think the Minister intended to go through with this Bill in all it stages before the House rose for the Recess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">

      <P>It was provided by Article 73 of the Constitution that, subject to the Constitution and subject to the extent to which they were not affected thereby, the laws that were in force at the date on which the Constitution came into operation should be continued as of full force and effect, until they were repealed or amended by a specific enactment of the Oireachtas. When that was done, a body of laws was taken over in globo and we had to proceed, as we subsequently did, by the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922, to adapt these laws to the existing circumstances The Adaptation of Enactments Act was, I think, the first statute passed by the Oireachtas after the Constitution itself.  By that Act we made certain specific adaptations of the British statutes which were taken over under Article 73, and it was provided that the Executive Council might, from <Col N="1456" /> time to time, by order make further general or specific adaptations or modifications of those statutes in order to enable them to have full force and effect in the Saorstát.  The laws which were continued in force by Article 73 of the Constitution, included a great number of charters which had, from time to time, been granted in this country prior to the Treaty.  Those charters were not adapted by the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922, nor did that Act confer on the Executive Council any power to adapt these charters by order.  There are, as Deputies are aware, a considerable number of bodies such as hospitals, which are governed by charters.  Some of these charters referred to Departments or functionaries of the late British Government in Ireland, and also to the holders of certain offices such as, for instance, the Lord Chancellorship, the Lord Chief Justiceship, and other such offices which have ceased to exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has become apparent now to the Executive Council that certain adaptations must be made in order that these charters may work in the present circumstances of the country.  Several applications have been made to the Executive Council with a view to having certain of those charters adapted. It has not been considered desirable to make a general adaptation of charters such as was made in the case of statutes by the Adaptation of Enactments Act.  The present Bill by Section 1 confers on the Executive Council power to make all such adaptations of, or modifications in, any of these charters as are in the opinion of the Executive Council necessary to enable the charters to have full force and effect in Saorstát Eireann.  The position, if and when this Bill is passed into law, will be that persons interested in any particular charter can apply to the Executive Council to have that charter adapted.  This can be done without expense by the order of the Executive Council.  Section 7 of the Act to which I have referred, the Adaptation of Enactments Act, deals with certain statutory boards of commissioners and other statutory bodies and it provides that the Executive <Col N="1457" /> Council may, by order, establish a board of commissioners to exercise in Saorstát Eireann functions previously exercised by any such statutory board of commissioners or other statutory body.</P>
    <P>The terms &ldquo;statutory board of commissioners&rdquo; and &ldquo;statutory body&rdquo; are uncertain and lacking in precision. Some of the bodies which were intended to be comprised in the section are both constituted and governed by statute and no question can arise regarding any such body.  There are, however, other bodies which were intended to be comprised in the section, some of which are constituted and governed by charter, and others of which are constituted by charter, and governed partly by statute and partly by charter, and yet others which are constituted by statute, governed partly by statute and partly by charter.  The object of Section 2 of the Bill, at present under consideration, is to bring all such bodies within the purview of Section 7 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act.  Section 9 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, also deals with statutory boards of commissioners and other statutory bodies. Section 3 of this present Bill is intended to amplify and define the expression &ldquo;statutory boards of commissioners&rdquo; and &ldquo;other statutory bodies&rdquo; which are used in that section, in the same way as Section 2 defines these expressions for the purposes of the Adaptation of Enactments Act. I move that the Bill be read a second time.</P>

      <P>In anything I have to say regarding this Bill, I shall confine my remarks to one aspect of it. It is generally admitted that retrospective legislation is bad and should only be resorted to if it can be shown that it is absolutely necessary in the public interest.  If by retrospective legislation certain rights are taken away from individuals, then there is no ground whatsoever on which such legislation should be defended.  I am not speaking of the general principles at the moment behind this Bill.  It may be right and proper that these adaptations should be made, but if the Minister will look at <Col N="1458" /> Section 2, sub-section (2), he will see that not only is it proposed that these boards shall henceforth be deemed to be so and so, but to be and always to have been deemed to be such.  Now, what would happen supposing that certain rights were conferred or were taken away as a result of the construction of Section 7 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922?  What would happen supposing, as I say, certain rights were conferred by that section as it stands at present and that now this retrospective provision were to come along and simply take these rights away?  It could happen that cases would come before the courts for a decision based on this very point, and I might point out that there is at present a case before the courts awaiting judgment based on the construction of Section 7 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act.  A very great amount of money has been spent in this case in the defence of certain rights which are supposed to exist.  The adoption of this restrictive phrase would simply cut the ground right from under their feet; it would decide the matter at once, and the court would have nothing to say. The greater part of the case turns on the point as to whether a certain body that was governed by charter is or is not a statutory board or body.  This distinctly states that it is and always is deemed to have been a statutory board or body, and the matter does not admit of further argument.  I suggest that whatever may be the case for making the thing right, as the Minister conceives it to be right from this point forth, that he should not adopt this plan of retrospective enactment, which will undoubtedly be deemed by the people who are fighting this case before the courts to be definitely and distinctly designed in order to cut the ground from under their feet.  I think that this is a bad principle to adopt, and I think that the Minister should see that that part of it is not included in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not know that I will vote against the Second Reading of this Bill, but I think it is right that I should mention, even on the Second Reading, certain defects, as <Col N="1459" /> they appear to me, even though it is possible that these defects may be removed in Committee if sufficient time is given to consider them properly.  As far as Section 1 goes, it seems to me that it simply gives power to bring into full force in the Free State charters which have been granted.  To that I take no exception.  But I think that the terms of Section 2, as has been indicated by Deputy O'Connell, are exceedingly wide, possibly even wider than they were meant to be.  It would, I fear, be possible, for instance, under the sub-section to remove rights which had been held by charitable bodies, by certain boards acting as boards of religious denominations and educational institutions.  It seems to me that it would be possible by a simple Act of the Executive Council to remove from such bodies rights which they have hitherto held and which I think in accordance with the spirit of the Treaty and the Constitution, Article 8 of the Constitution particularly, that they should continue to hold.  I do not take the view that there is any such intention on the part of the Executive Council at all; equally strongly I take the view that there is no necessity for giving such powers to the Executive Council.  We ought in Committee certainly to remove from Section 2 such bodies as I have indicated, bodies acting by charter in connection with religious denominations, charities and educational institutions, and unless I am satisfied that no such changes will be made in the Bill I hope to put forward amendments to do so on the Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two definite types of institutions that I have before my mind, the late National Board of Education and the Universities The National Board was declared in the course of a prolonged litigation by an <i>obiter dictum</i> of one of the Judges to be not merely a chartered corporation but a great State Department of Education.  As a State Department of Education it was quite easy to do away with it, but as a chartered corporation it was not, and in our dealings in this Parliament with Commissions, the National Board, as the Commission <Col N="1460" /> of Primary Education, survives.  One operation of the sweeping powers given in the present Bill would make it quite easy to obliterate that as a corporate entity and affect whatever rights are still in question to be decided.</P>
      <P>But as regards the universities the case is far more serious.  I will speak for the university which I have the honour to represent.  The National University is a statutory body; it was set up by the Irish Universities Act, and it is governed partly by that statute and partly by charter.  If it is to be deemed never to have had that status it is put in a very serious position; in fact, we have no rights whatsoever as an educational body; it would be quite easy to deprive us of them. Although I am quite sure that the Executive Council of the day or of a future date would not be willing to exercise the power, it would be quite easy to make it no longer able to sue and to be sued.  Furthermore, the universities might by some reactionary step in a moment of thoughtlessness be put under a Minister of Education and all the autonomy which is so essential to the discharge of their work would disappear.  I prefer to take the view that those who drafted the present measure had in contemplation some other bodies, and by inadvertence used a formula which would take into its scope the universities.  I find it difficult to believe that such a step was contemplated.  It would simply mean to all intents and purposes the destruction of the liberties of the universities, and that means a revolution in the very worst sense.  At the moment when all our energies should be bent upon constructing a healthy organism of education in the country, to do what would have the effect of mutilating the higher education, as represented in the universities, would be fatal.  The university must be an autonomous body.  That argument was accepted by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the universities were, I believe, included in the Ministers and Secretaries Bill, they were, at a later stage, left out and, as the law stands, though a Minister answers for the universities in the House, they retain their autonomy.  That is a point upon which I think the universities must <Col N="1461" /> always give battle and fight in the last ditch.  The university is no longer able to discharge its duty to the nation once its autonomy is taken from it.  To use a parallel, it has always been held with regard to the great historical discussion on the liberty of the Press that even though there was no interference with the publication of opinions, yet if there were a law on the Statute Book that enabled an executive officer to seize a printing press at his own discretion, though in point of fact, the Press was at the moment free, yet in essence it was unfree.  On the same analogy I suggest to the Minister in charge of this Bill that if the Executive Council have the power to deal in the way proposed, and if this House gives it that power, with institutions governed partly by charter and partly by statute, then the universities are not free.  Even though I am sure no Minister would dream of interfering with them, the possibility would be there, the knowledge that a public agitation could be worked up to invoke that power would be there, and universities would no longer be what they ought to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that.  I want to argue against the Bill. We have generally agreed that legislation by reference is undesirable when it can be avoided, and it is generally agreed that undue legislation by Order in Council is not desirable if it can be avoided.  This Bill is a combination of both to the X degree.  The Adaptation of Enactments Act is put forward as a parallel.  That dealt with enactments, the existence of which was public.  We knew them.  We could recognise the references, and this Act in general dealt with the interpretation of terms, officials, persons, officers, offices, and applied those terms <Col N="1462" /> and names and officials to the new situation here, but in the Bill before us we are asked to give the Executive Council general powers over things that we do not know the existence of, over institutions and bodies of people who may be governed partly by charter and partly by statute, and to give the Executive Council authority to adapt them to the circumstances of the Saorstát.  By that means we may be making very important changes in powers and authorities without our knowing what is involved because we have not access to the charters and do not know to what they refer.  It seems to me, if we are to legislate with regard to charters, it ought to be purely with regard to formal matters such as titles, officials and authorities, that are given powers within these charters and adapt them to the formal circumstances of the new situation.  That is quite acceptable, but we ought not to go beyond that unless we have a schedule of the charters in mind, so that we will understand exactly what we are dealing with, and then possibly have access to the contents of those charters.  This is certainly legislating in the dark and giving powers to an Executive to do things which we may regret in the future.  It is practically giving legislative power to an Executive, outside the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be argued that the giving of a charter has always been an act of the sovereign and that you are not altering that position.  We are not all satisfied that permanent and eternal wisdom is contained in those charters, and if there is to be any alteration even in adaptation, apart from nomenclature, we ought to know what we are doing, and the Executive Council ought not to be given powers to act in such alteration or adaptation without the consent of the Oireachtas, because it is in fact legislation by charter, or, as referred to here, partly by charter and partly by statute.  I submit the Bill, even in its present stage, ought not to be proceeded with because its scope is entirely too wide and gives too much authority to the Executive Council.  If there has to be adaptation it should be adaptation in respect of terms and titles and not in respect of the actual <Col N="1463" /> contents of the charter or whatever it may be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Executive Council did not consider lightly the advisability of introducing this measure. It was after repeated representations had been made to them with regard to the infirmity of the law as it stands and the fact that the Adaptation of Enactments Act and the Articles in the Constitution continuing in force all the Acts that were so adapted, were found not to cover certain charters.  I do not anticipate that many grave cases will arise in which an attempt will be made to do anything in the nature of legislation as has been suggested by Deputy Johnson.  There are minor matters which cannot possibly be attended to by reason of the infirmity I have mentioned, namely, that there is no power to do certain acts.  There are instances in which bodies are unable to spend money on alterations and improvements in certain buildings and an order <Col N="1464" /> must be made by somebody.  The persons who did such things have no existence in the State now, and some corresponding institution must function if those particular charters are not to come under review and have a particular Act passed to deal with each case as it arises.  That would be very undesirable and, as I said, it is not intended to go beyond the Second Stage at present.  If it were not that time permitted, it would not be even down for the Second Reading.  If I had been asked not to have the Second Reading Stage to-day I would have no objection It is down now for Second Reading and nothing that has been done to-day will prevent any necessary action being taken.  On the Committee Stage we will be able to give the necessary explanation in connection with certain points that have been raised.</P>

    <P>Provided that</P>
    <P>(1)  if at the time of manufacture of the sugar a customs duty is chargeable on the importation of sugar of the same degree of polarisation, the subsidy as specified in the foregoing table shall be reduced by the amount of such duty on one hundredweight; and</P>
    <P>(2)  whenever an excise duty is chargeable and is paid on the sugar, the subsidy as specified in the foregoing table shall be increased by the amount of such duty on one hundredweight.</P>
    <P>The motion sets out the terms and the rates at which the subsidy, under the Sugar Beet Bill, are to be paid.  In the Bill itself the table was not complete There was only the top figures given.  The subsequent figures given in the various columns form the usual table.  You see the same table in the various Customs' Bills.  We have completed the statement of the provisions by adding No. 2 of the proviso.  It is understood, of course, that the amount of subsidy to be paid under the Bill shall always be abated by the amount of any Customs duty chargeable on sugar.  There must be a countervailing provision, of course, that if at any time an excise duty is charged on sugar the amount of the subsidy shall be increased by the amount of the excise duty which has been charged and paid. The figures given in the various columns are the total net figures of the advantage which the manufacturer of sugar here will have our competitors It is the net figure for subsidy. I have already said, in the course of the discussion on the Bill, all that is to be said in regard to this table.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some points to which I desire to call attention, and I think I had better do so on this resolution rather than on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  This motion deals with the subsidies that are to be paid each year under this Bill.  When we read some of the letters that appear in the newspapers with regard to the tonnage expected to the acre, one begins to wonder what is the necessity <Col N="1468" /> for subsidies at all.  I have here before me a letter which appeared in a recent issue of <i>The Irish Times.</i>  The writer's name is given as Mr. Matthew Purcell, and he is described as the Secretary and Organiser of Co. Tipperary and Adjoining Counties Sugar Beet Growers' Association.  His letter reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;With regard to recent some what pessimistic statements in the Dáil and elsewhere as to the possibility of any Irish agricultural district being able to provide the necessary minimum area of 5,000 statute acres of sugar beet to justify the erection of a sugar-beet factory in the Saorstát, I am in a position to point out that, although my organising committee has been only one month in existence and has not yet completed its prospecting tour, we have already obtained promises from the farmers whose parochial meetings we have attended, of an area to be laid with sugar-beet next April far greater than the area stipulated.  By the time this committee completes its journeyings through Tipperary and surroundings, where numerous experimental plots are down, we anticipate guarantees for 10,000 statute acres under sugar-beet next spring.  The experiments already carried out in County Tipperary show a higher tonnage and a greater sugar content than the average for any other district, home or foreign, that we know of, and on the data in possession of my committee a return of £42 per statute acre, or £62 per Irish acre, is possible.  And coming down to what we would regard as the minimum tonnage of ten to the statute acre, the return would be £27 or £42 to the Irish acre&mdash;not bad money either by any means.  When Deputy Gorey speaks of only 7½ to 8 tons of sugar beet to the acre he must be thinking of some very wretched land, perhaps Connemara.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures that I used in the Dáil were the figures given by Deputy Professor Magennis.  I did not give any figures, but I commented on the figures quoted by Deputy Professor Magennis.  I thought that the Deputy knew all about <Col N="1469" /> this, but evidently he does not know as much as this writer from the Co.  Tipperary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan) MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement which the Deputy has just read out merely shows that 53/- per ton will leave the farmers a very good profit, but it does not affect the question of subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not trying to direct the attention of the Minister for Agriculture to this at all.  What I intended doing was to ask the Minister for Justice to take this up.  The letter concludes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Well, Borrisokane and Killea, in County Tipperary, produced round about 32 tons statute, while West Kilkenny and South Leix growers speak freely of being able to produce 20 tons statute.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, I say this to the Minister for Justice, that to allow documents of this kind to go around like this, evidently with some authority, would be more or less criminal, if it was not so foolish. The only explanation of it that I can see&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Simply as a matter of information, I would like the Deputy's opinion as to whether it is any more criminal than to say that a return of £70 or £80 to the acre could be made from potatoes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Very much more criminal That statement, to which the Minister has called attention, was made from information received in County Dublin that during the month of June an acre of potatoes was sold in the County Dublin for the amount I mentioned I appeal to the Minister for Agriculture if that is not so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I say this wild sort of statement is more detrimental to the project under discussion than anything I can imagine, because promises of this description are held out to <Col N="1470" /> people to induce them to try experiments which will prove the falsity of these exaggerated statements in six months, and will only succeed in damning the undertaking.  The only way I can explain these things is that these people have been inhaling J.J., No. 1 Culture, recently brought out by a Minister of this House.  This man may be able to defend himself on the ground that he has inhaled some of the culture spread about by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your decision, sir.  The question arises for those responsible for the Bill and those responsible for its progress whether it is wise to allow these statements to pass without contradiction or without some guidance, or whether the public is to be allowed to be fooled by documents of this description having a semi-official character about them.  That is all I want to say at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be quite on the safe side and, therefore, I beg to move as an amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert after the words &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; where they occur the second time the following: &ldquo;All payments of such amount as may be necessary for ensuring the payment of interest at a minimum rate to be prescribed by the Minister upon the capital invested in the undertaking.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then would follow: &ldquo;Or by payment in respect of sugar manufacture.&rdquo;  It is in fact to embody in the resolution, the terms of Amendment No. 2 which I have down for the Committee Stage.  I am just a little afraid that it may be very strictly interpreted, and unless I raise the question now I may not be able to move to have the amendment embodied in the resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill is to pay a subsidy to the factory owner.  My proposal is to give the Minister powers to pay a subsidy in another form than that set out in the Bill, that is to say, to ensure the minimum payment of interest It was argued, on the Second <Col N="1471" /> Reading Stage, that the reason the particular rates of subsidy set out in the schedules were necessary, was because in the minds of the Belgian capitalists &mdash;promoters as they might be called&mdash; it was recognised that there was a greater risk in undertaking a sugar-beet factory in the Saorstát than in Great Britain, the number of factors entering into that risk, and because of the greater risk it was necessary to increase the amount of the subsidy.  Now my proposal is to minimise the risk, and, inasmuch as this Bill is being promoted as a nation-building scheme, as a productive enterprise, in the interests of the community as a whole, and as an experiment, it is reasonable to say that the risk of the experiment should be shared by the community, and that it is better to make terms on a low rate of subsidy, as the Minister argued we could do, if we reduce the risk to the promoters, by guaranteeing a certain rate of interest on the necessary capital invested.</P>
    <P>If it is a national undertaking, in the interests of the community as a whole, and is recognised to be an experiment, then the risk of the experiment should be undertaken by the country, and we can reasonably support a proposition to guarantee a reasonable rate of interest on any capital invested for this period of ten years.  If we guarantee the interest on the capital invested presumably, on the Minister's argument, we can lower the rate of subsidy because the element of risk is greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>I am sure a good many Deputies had their attention drawn to an advertisement which appeared in the newspapers, in the last few days, for capital for a new British sugar factory in Norfolk, that is in the district in which other factories have been working for some time.  The capital required is £350,000, and in the prospectus the promoters tell us that by reason of the British Government's subsidy the advantage to British produced sugar over imported sugar will average for the next nine years £14 18s. 4d. per ton.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Per ton of sugar?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, per ton of <Col N="1472" /> sugar.  That is to say, British sugar is getting an advantage practically of £15 per ton.  We are proposing to give £24 10s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>£23.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>£24 10s. for the first three years, reducing to as low as £22, giving an average, as the Minister reminds me, of £23.  As between £23 and £15, there is a great gulf fixed, and it seems to me that the difference is rather great to meet the added risk. As we were informed on the Second Reading, that because of the additional risk involved, it was necessary to give this higher subsidy, I desire to make it possible for the Minister to reduce the subsidy by guaranteeing a definite rate of interest on the share capital over a period of ten years.  I think we ought, at least, give the Minister powers and indicate, in giving him those powers, our wish that he should endeavour to make a new bargain, either with the company which has already promoted some kind of provisional arrangement, or with any other company which is prepared to take advantage of the conditions in the Bill when completed.  We should give the Minister powers, with the implication of a direction, that he should get the advantage which a guaranteed interest would give in the direction of a lower rate of subsidy. The company, whose prospectus I quoted, in indicating that they have an advantage of fifteen pounds a ton over imported sugar, tell us that they are anticipating the nett profits of the first year's working at £71,000, during the next two years £107,000, or an average for the three years' working of £95,000. This on £350,000 share capital is over 27 per cent. per annum.  It may, as I have said, be reasonably argued that there is greater risk in establishing a factory here, but when we read this announcement of a British factory, and when we read the announcement of the Belgian promoters, as to what they anticipate, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that they are looking for an exceptional rate of profit commensurate with what they deem to be, and what the Minister assumes to be, a reasonable plea, namely, added risk.  I <Col N="1473" /> say it is right and proper that we should, by State action, attempt to reduce the risk so that we may get the advantage of a lower subsidy.  I therefore move this amendment to the resolution so as to allow the amendment on the Order Paper to be embodied in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point about this amendment which Deputy Johnson has not brought out, and which makes the suggestion made by him, in my opinion, impracticable.  His amendment, if accepted, might possibly have the effect of putting the State under greater expense than it would have to bear under the Bill as it stands. As I gather from this amendment, he wants the State to guarantee a fixed dividend on capital.  I presume that the State also have to step in and pay the difference between any loss the factory sustains and the actual cost of production.  Further, it would have to add the amount necessary to pay the interest on the capital.  If Deputy Johnson thinks that the subsidy paid in Ireland, as compared with that paid in England, is too high, the best method, in my opinion, of meeting that would be to move to reduce the subsidy to that level, or close to it, which prevails in England.  As I see it, the substance of the amendment might have the effect of involving the State in a greater subsidy than that at present embodied in the Bill.  If I am wrong in that I am open to correction, but that is how I read it, namely, that not only has the State to guarantee the actual minimum interest on capital but it will have to guarantee the company against any possible loss in the buying of beet and manufacturing it into sugar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It was stated on Second Reading that the entire subsidy which the British got was about 19s. 9d. The prospectus which Deputy Johnson quoted gives a figure which shows the advantage their sugar has over ours, but the Finance Bill is not through in <Col N="1474" /> England yet.  It provides for additional colonial preference of about 2s. 4d., and, in addition, there is the subsidy for molasses.  The fact is that if the present Financial Bill passes they will have a subsidy of 19s. as against our 23s.  That may be too big or too small, but that is the fact.  You must compare our £23 a ton on our sugar with £19 10s. in England.  That is what it comes to, when you add colonial preference and the duty on molasses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  We will hear Deputy Good on that afterwards. We pay 23/-, and in England they pay 19/-.  That is as good as we can do. Deputy Johnson makes the suggestion that we should have an alternative form of subsidy and guarantee the profits, and in that way write off a certain amount of risks.  I agree you have to consider the risk of loss of capital and other losses on the part of the prospectors.  We have to start all over again on a new basis, and to measure what the various likely prospectors would consider to be a fair measure of return for the risk they are likely to incur by reason of the fact that they have guaranteed a certain amount of interest on what was given as the difference.  Our position is that we are being forced into a definite subsidy of 23/- to M. Lippens, and we are asked why should it not be 5/- or 2/6, or why should we not take a present from these companies coming in here for their right to make sugar.  It would be delightful if we could.  Whether we have faced this matter in the right way, whether we are competent or incompetent, we spent six months in negotiations with every firm of repute in Europe, and we could do no better than we have done.  It is for the Dáil to make up its mind whether the price we are paying for the experiment is too much, or whether we could not do better in two or three years hence, until we get terms in consideration of whatever difference they think they can get to their advantage in two or three <Col N="1476" /> years hence.  In making up their minds on that, Deputies have one piece of firm ground on which to go, and that is in England, where the ordinary law of supply and demand operates automatically for a period of years, and, of course, the same laws of supply and demand operate here with certain variations in prices, but in England the subsidy is 19/- and here it is 23/-.  The difference on a 5,000 tons factory would be about £15,000 a year&mdash;that is, a factory fed by 5,000 acres of tillage, and farmers will know what difficulty there would be in getting 5,000 acres of tillage.  It is for the Dáil to say whether it is worth their while to wait three or four years and try to get better terms, and to cut the subsidy down to 19/-.  But the Dáil will not be able to do that, because there are elements here which are uncertain at the root, and which are certain in England, not by reason of any superiority in England, but that they have made experiments and know what they are able to do.  They have demonstrated that in Norfolk farmers can grow 5,000 acres of beet, and they know fairly well what the sugar content will be.  They can draw deductions from actual facts not present here, for we are only making a beginning.  It is a matter of business, and you could not get down to the terms in England.  I can understand a man saying there is nothing in sugar beet and we should drop it.  That is understandable, but for any man who takes up the position that there is a possibility of making a success of this experiment, and that it is worth starting, to say that we should hold over this experiment for three or four years for the sake of £15,000 a year is a position that I do not quite understand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Johnson, in moving his amendment, anticipated the heat that is likely to arise on the motion itself when it comes on.  I think the discussion on the Bill and the decision of the Dáil finally to accept the proposal of the subsidy is anticipated The subsidy as laid down here will be decided by the Dáil to be a right subsidy to pay.  Of course I have a general objection to the Bill, because <Col N="1477" /> it provides for a subsidy, and of course Deputy Johnson and the Dáil will not expect me to agree to the principle of subsidising industry, even in connection with sugar beet.  I quite appreciate that the House has gone and is marching in that direction, so that my opinion is of very little weight one way or the other.  Deputy Johnson puts forward the contention that the State should guarantee a fixed dividend for the capital to be raised in connection with the erection of a sugar beet factory What would be the result of that?  There will be practically no incentive to work the factory on economic and business lines at all, because there will be freedom from the responsibility of paying the dividend out of profits earned.  On that principle I venture to say that the production of sugar beet in that factory would be as expensive as it could be made.  The alternative is, of course, for the Dáil to follow to its logical conclusions the principles they have tentatively adopted, and nationalise the whole industry I could not agree with that course, but the Dáil seems to be in the humour to follow that line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have got tired of being opposed to things here, and I now take them lying down, generally speaking.  Deputy Johnson lays it down that this factory will be exceptionally profitable.  Well, if it is so I think it would be for the good of the scheme as a whole.  I think the greatest trouble that will arise in connection with that factory, if it is the phenomenal success that Deputy Johnson anticipates for it, would be that the Minister for Agriculture and the Government would not be allowed to stand by the decision they had come to, that the experiment is to be limited to one factory, but that pressure would be brought to bear on them to increase the subsidy to something greater than is contemplated in this Bill.  Already we have sounds in this House of district vieing with district for the erection of the factory, and the Government has been asked to influence the decision of <Col N="1478" /> the people who are to erect the factory as to where it should be erected.  The real danger I can see is that if the experiment is a success it will not be confined within the limits of the Bill, but I think that is anticipating some of the things that must be decided by the House at a later stage.  With regard to the amendment, I agree with Deputy Johnson that it is not necessary at this stage to fix the amount of the subsidy, and that it would be better to leave that over.  On the other hand, I do not place any great faith in Deputy Johnson's alternative.  The really substantial support I can give to this Bill is because it recognises that the erection of the sugar beet factory and its administration by private individuals is the only chance of the experiment being carried out on satisfactory economic lines.  The moment the Government interferes with the profit and loss account, or the administration or working of the factory, then good-bye to all chance of the experiment being a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to supplement what I said earlier by a point that I had overlooked.  Before coming to that, I want to point out to Deputy Hewat that the reason why this amendment has been debated on this motion is, contrary to his view, because it might be ruled out of order on the Bill itself, as it might put an additional charge on the State, and that could not be done by a private Deputy's motion. Deputy Hewat rather prides himself upon the view that if a factory of this kind is exceptionally profitable, then it is certain to lead to a very great increase in the number of factories.  That may be, provided that after the first three years they continue to pay a price which will induce farmers to grow beet, and that the Minister is prepared to give a licence to other factories But the exceptional profitableness that is a possibility is only made possible by the fact that the State is going to subsidise it.  The point I want to draw attention to is, that there are two classes of factories being dealt with.  There is the proviso to paragraph (a), sub-section (1), which deals with sugar manufactured in the first <Col N="1479" /> factory established in the Saorstát, and also in respect to sugar manufactured in any other factory, that the subsidies shall not exceed those set out in the schedule.  Unless an amendment enlarging the powers of the Minister is accepted, any subsequent factory that may be set up in the next ten years can only be set up on the basis of a subsidy, not on the basis of any other possible arrangement.  I do not remember having heard from Deputy Hewat any violent opposition to the proposal to guarantee capital and interest on loans under the Trade Loans (Facilities) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but the Deputy acquiesced. I do not think he voted against it; he certainly did not speak against it.  The proposal in my amendment is simply to do in respect of this particular kind of factory what the Dáil has accepted and the country has approved in respect to other factories under the Trade Loans (Facilities) Act.  Deputy Hewat may agree that there are other methods of assisting industries to establish themselves in addition to that of subsidy, but this Bill proposes to exclude any other method, except the method of subsidy. My amendment at least would give one other alternative: to guarantee interest on capital at rates to be fixed, and in accordance with regulations agreed upon by the Minister.  If he, in considering the terms of any licence, finds he could not make terms any better than the subsidy, presumably he would agree upon the subsidy, but I want to empower him by law to make other terms of agreement and possibly&mdash;and on the argument certainly&mdash;because there is less risk and less cost to the State.  If it is going to be more costly, then, of course, the Minister is going to use his discretion, and is not going to enter into these other more costly arrangements.  That meets Deputy Heffernan's point.  But there ought to be power given to the Minister to assist factories to come into being other than by way of subsidy on sugar.</P>

I am following the lead by saying that in respect either of this factory or subsequent factories the Minister shall be empowered to make alternative arrangements and not be confined exclusively to the subsidy method.  The amendment, of course, does not insist that the alternative method shall be adopted, but that he should have power to enter into agreements on an alternative method as well as on the method of subsidy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be undesirable to insert this amendment. We certainly would not act on it. If we were inclined to guarantee capital and interest we have ample power in the Trade Loans (Facilities) Act.  There is no reason why, within the limits of that Act, capital and interest in connection with the sugar beet factory should not be guaranteed, but we do not propose to do it in that way.  I do not think we could do business in that way.  It would never get the industry established.  I agree with the view put forward by Deputy Hewat.  There is no doubt, if there was a guarantee of interest, that there would be very little incentive towards working a factory in the best way.  If difficulties were encountered, there certainly would not be the incentive to overcome them.  If things went swimmingly, then perhaps people would work hard for the purpose of getting the extra profit beyond the amount guaranteed to them.  But, if things went ill, there would not be the incentive that we want to exist to fight against difficulties, to overcome them, to adopt any new methods that may be necessary, either to deal with the technical problems, to induce farmers <Col N="1481" /> to grow the crops, or anything else.  We want to get this enterprise on to a really hard business basis, and we feel that the only way it can be done is by making the risk the factory owners: by making them face up to whatever difficulties there are, and, being experienced in the matter, overcome these difficulties in a way we believe other people, who are not experienced, could not overcome them.  I do not want to raise any point of order, but I do think, even if Deputy Johnson's amendment were passed, unless there were a further Governor-General's Message, that we would get no additional powers.</P>

      <P>The Minister has raised a very important point dealing with the rights of Deputies.  A motion has been put down in detail authorising the payment of certain moneys in respect of sugar beet, and it sets out in detail the terms of the Bill.  We are ruled out from amending the Bill in any way in respect of this, because the terms of the resolution are detailed and precise.  Any motion affecting the finance of this scheme will have to be within the limits of this resolution. We should have had that resolution in our hands at the same time as the Bill, so that we could have put forward our amendments in due time and given <Col N="1482" /> proper consideration to them in respect of this motion, because this motion in effect is the Bill.  The method of procedure is, in fact, limiting the rights of Deputies to discuss the financial terms of the Bill.  I do not know if I am right in saying that the procedure usually in regard to these motions has been to either have a maximum sum or to deal in general terms with sums involved in the legislation.  In this motion we are now asked to legislate, and we are committed to legislating in a specific direction We cannot amend the Bill subsequently except within the very narrow limits of this resolution.  I think that is a matter we have a right to protest against as being a limitation to freedom of discussion on a matter of very great importance.</P>

Of course, it is also a question of being willing to fix the particular figures set out for subsidy at maximum level.  It says &ldquo;not exceeding.&rdquo;  Anybody can move to reduce them.  If a motion to reduce them were carried in the Dáil, the Government would have to decide either to drop the Bill if they thought they could not go on, or bring in some alternative or additional method of subsidy so as to compensate for the loss that that reduction would cause.</P>

We cannot discuss it even then with proper freedom because we are limited by the terms of the motion which are limited presumably by the terms of the Governor-General's Message.  We had not notice of the form of this motion and I submit that we had a right to have notice so that we could try and amend it in such a manner, or in any manner in which we would seek to amend the Bill, on the financial side.

Deputy Johnson will hardly contend seriously that that is a correct summary or a correct version, by way of history, of what we did a few days ago.  We did a great deal more than endorse the doctrine that the Government may promote industry by granting a subsidy. We approved of a particular, named industry being promoted by a subsidy.

The section says that subsidies may be paid &ldquo;in respect of such sugar manufactured in the first factory established in Saorstát Eireann for the manufacture of sugar from sugar beet.&rdquo;  I want to add after the words &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo;&ldquo;and licensed.&rdquo;  There is a possibility that two factories may be set up, and one promoter being in a hurry might get in front of the other and claim the subsidy The words I suggest are, I think, essential.</P>

    <P>In sub-section (1), line 22, after <Col N="1487" /> the word &ldquo;rates,&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;not exceeding those.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an amendment which I think is of importance.  The section says: &ldquo;at the rates specified in the first schedule to this Act.&rdquo;  I suggest that we ought not to bind the Minister by legislation to pay these rates.  He may not be able to do anything better, but we ought not to insist that he shall pay these rates if he can do anything better For that purpose, I suggest the insertion of the words &ldquo;not exceeding those.&rdquo;  The schedule speaks of &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; rates, but if there is any value to be got out of the word &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; we should insert words with a similar implication in the section.</P>

      <P>I do not think we could accept this amendment.  As I indicated when Deputy Johnson moved his first amendment, I think there is going to be no great rush at the present stage to put up factories on these terms.  After a considerable amount of bargaining, we arrived at the figures set out in the schedule.  Nobody is going to come to terms with us if, having arrived at a certain stage and saying: &ldquo;We will close now and go to the Dáil and seek authority for those terms,&rdquo; we entered upon another period of bargaining The result would be that the people who proposed to set up a factory here would say that there could be no definiteness to any conclusions with us, and it might actually have the effect of causing them to doubt whether there could be a bargain made with us.  I believe we cannot, without grave risk of scaring off not only the person whom we have struck a bargain with but anybody we might later try to strike a bargain with, accept this amendment.  I do not think we can go back on these terms.  We said we would seek power to give this man these terms: we are not going to re-open the matter with him.  If we get this Bill, we are going to offer him these terms and not less terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that if the Minister's view is as he has expressed it that he should have introduced the name of the firm and the terms of the agreement he has entered into and <Col N="1488" /> asked to have that agreement confirmed We are not asked to confirm any agreement with any particular firm.  Names have been given us, and information has been given us, and the Minister is now asking for powers to give a licence to any firm or company or person.  He argues as though the only possible interpretation of this Bill is that a particular firm&mdash;Messrs.  Lippens&mdash;were concerned.  But we are legislating to give certain subsidies&mdash; and this is a point of importance&mdash;to a firm which does not exist but which, may come into existence any time after the Bill becomes law.  We have said in the schedule that these are maximum rates.  There is some purpose in putting in the word &ldquo;maximum.&rdquo;  If there is any value in the word &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; in the schedule, surely there is equal justification for putting into the section the words &ldquo;not exceeding those,&rdquo; as I suggest There are possibilities that the firm in question&mdash;the firm that it is hoped will come into being and take advantage of the offers in the Bill&mdash; may not do so.  That is a possibility, and other firms may come in and say: &ldquo;We are prepared to do this work and to give you all the guarantees necessary.&rdquo; I suggest to the Minister that this provision is simple and necessary, if the rates specified are the maximum rates and if you are to put into this section of the Bill the same terms as you put into the schedule in regard to these being the uttermost limit.  The refusal to put in this provision rather suggests that the Minister is not prepared to make a better bargain, even if it were thrown at him.</P>

      <P>The Minister is certainly prepared to make a better bargain but before making the bargain at all one must at least have some idea as regards definiteness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in this particular case Deputy Johnson conjures up a picture of a proposed sugar-beet factory dealing with three different Ministers for Finance. Because that is what really this particular amendment would entail.  This Dáil will run for two years.  At the end of two years, granted it runs to its maximum period, another Dáil will come in, and granted it runs to its maximum period, it will last for four <Col N="1489" /> years, and the third Dáil will come in at the end of six years, and last until the end of the ten years' period.  During that period there may be three Ministers for Finance.  This company that is to work the beet sugar factory is to sink a certain amount of capital, and is to be placed in the position of driving a bargain as to whether it is 75 per cent. or 80 per cent. or 85 per cent. or 90 per cent. for that period.  I submit that it would be unreasonable to expect any contractor to enter into a bargain in which there would be such indefiniteness as that. This particular bargain may be good or bad.  If it is too good from the point of view of the contractor, and if the Dáil does not want to stand for it, then it can turn it down.  But to say that there is to be a bargain as from zero to 100 per cent. during the period of ten years is something which I do not think any contractor in any part of the world would sign any bond in respect of.</P>

      <P>The point about the <Col N="1490" /> Bill as it stands, as the President has pointed out, is that, notwithstanding the word &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; in the schedule, the company can be absolutely certain that the terms cannot be changed during the ten years without coming to the Oireachtas.  That is some guarantee. In a case like this, where you have not people actually burning to come in, even on these terms, I think that is a useful guarantee.  I think it should not be objected to, if it makes it easier for us to complete the agreement, especially in view of the fact that if we want to deal with the matter at any time we can come here to the Dáil.  The Dáil is always sitting, and we can deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister must bear in mind the form in which this legislation is couched.  This is a Bill to give general powers to the Minister to give subsidies in respect of a factory which has yet to be established on certain conditions.  In explanation of the Bill the Minister tells us that there have been provisional arrangements made with a person who proposes to establish a company to build a factory.  Now, that is all very well in a Second Reading speech or in an introductory speech.  But the Bill that is before us does not deal with any specific firm.  It does not deal with any company It only gives the Minister general powers.  Surely we are not going to be bound in legislation to give the Minister not merely powers, but to make it obligatory upon him to pay the rates specified even though he might be able to do better.  I want to safeguard the State with the possibility that if the Minister can do better, he may be allowed to do so.  Under this section, if it remains as it is, there is every possibility that he will be bound, in any case, to pay these rates, even if he could do better.</P>

We believe that making any change in the Bill might mean some difference to a firm with whom we have been doing business and with whom we have made definite terms.  What is the objection to leaving the Bill as it stands if it makes things easier?  If the arrangements with M. Lippens fall through, and if in a year or two we can do better, the Bill does not preclude us from going to any other firm.  If we can get better terms we can come to the Dáil.

      <P>In sub-section (2), line 31, to delete the word &ldquo;and,&rdquo; and after the figures 1928 to insert the figures &ldquo;1929, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, and 1935.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be that the prices which the factory will pay for sugar beet&mdash;which under this Bill are fixed only for three years&mdash; will be extended for the full period of the subsidy guaranteed to the factory. I am not the least bit keen on subsidies. I disapprove of them and I also disapprove of fixed prices.  We are, however, committed to both subsidies and fixed prices by this Bill.  Apparently sugar beet factories cannot be established without subsidies in Europe, and if we are to have a factory we must have a subsidy.  I have always taken it that a fixed price is a corollary to a subsidy.  Where any firm or individuals get a sum of money from the Government for the purpose of furthering business interests, they shall have obligations to other people; the obligation in this case is to the people who sow the sugar beet.  I presume it will be argued that the ordinary law of supply and demand will come into force after the first three years, and the absolute necessity of getting raw material will force the factory to pay a good price, not necessarily the price they pay during the first three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is this side of the argument too, that the farmers may be induced to grow sugar beet.  As Deputy Gorey pointed out, great efforts are being made to induce them to start growing sugar-beet.  I might say that those efforts are unreasonable and there is a lot of false and unreal propaganda. There is a danger that farmers will be lost in the mist of propaganda, in the mist of tales as to what prices they will get for their sugar-beet, and what quantities they can grow on the land. They will find at the end of three years they will have their lands tilled, their whole course of agriculture changed and an addition to their ordinary rotation which may involve them in, perhaps, twice the amount of tillage they usually manage.  Being in such a position <Col N="1493" /> they would not be prepared to bargain The firm would have the monopoly; there is only one market for the beet and we may find that firm fixing an unreasonably low price, a price as low as they can possibly fix, consistent with the possibility that the farmer will continue to grow beet.  It is only reasonable that when a guaranteed subsidy is given for a certain number of years, there should also be a guaranteed fixed price.</P>
    <P>With this amendment must be taken the changes I propose to make in the second Schedule, which fixes the prices on a graduated scale that will be paid for beet in accordance with the Government subsidy.  I have calculated those prices in proportion to the decline and the fall which take place in the subsidy over a period of about three years.  I believe the amendment is one that will commend the project to the farmers, and it will give them a guarantee in their business for ten rather than three years.  The amendment is a reasonable one and I would ask the Government to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say at once that that is not the point of view of the farmers of the country.  I would be sorry that anyone who desires to invest money in this country&mdash;an Irishman or anybody else&mdash;would think that that was the Irish farmers' point of view.  The farmers are quite willing to take a fair profit.  We have fixed a price of 53/-, which ensures a real and a good profit; in fact, it ensures a little better than a fair profit for the first three years.  I am satisfied that the farmers will grow sugar beet.  I am also satisfied that if experience shows the farmers that they can afford to grow beet at a less price, and at the same time get a reasonable profit, they will be quite willing to do their part.  The farmers do not want exorbitant profits; they are not looking for a gold mine.  They know they have to do business just the same as the ordinary business-man and they realise one must work hard for a fair profit.  The farmers want no more than that and they are well able to take care of their interests.  They do not want a soft thing and I would be very sorry that the idea would get out that farmers <Col N="1494" /> will not enter into this matter unless they are getting a soft thing.  If, at the end of three years, it is shown that prices are to be altered, I am quite certain if the alteration is in the direction of reducing the price&mdash;no one can tell at this stage, not even Deputy Heffernan, because it is a new thing in the country&mdash;and if the equities of the case show that the price could be altered, I am sure you will get any number of good farmers prepared to alter the price by lowering it if they find they can make a reasonable profit by so doing.  I would be sorry that any other view would go out from the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to farmers being lost in mists of propaganda and tales, Deputy Heffernan is expressing the viewpoint of the minority.  He talked about bad farmers who were asked to grow beet and about the unfortunate farmer who cannot look after himself in the circumstances which, it is obvious to every man, will exist at the end of three years. That is purely a minority point of view.  The ordinary good farmer is well able to look after himself.  He knows perfectly well he has guarantees which are better than any guarantee we could put into the Bill.  He is quite prepared to make a fair profit and to work hard for that.  He knows well what it costs to grow barley, mangolds and wheat; he will take very good care, before going into this sugar beet business, to investigate what the prospects are, and we will take very good care to let him know the truth.  We have gone about it the right way so as to get him authentic information; we are growing beet in five or six centres this year.  We have not gone about looking for the farmer who has his land full of dock leaves and his farmyard full of manure.  We do not look for that type of farmer; we look for the farmer who can make the growing of sugar-beet a success, and he is the only one we advise to grow sugar-beet. There will be facts as to costings and other items of information in connection with the industry placed at their disposal and in three years' time farmers will know perfectly well what 54/- per ton means.  They will know at the end of three years what 53/-, 52/-, or 48/- <Col N="1495" /> will mean.  They will know it better even than they do now, and they know it fairly well even now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Two questions of importance seem to be raised in this amendment.  Deputy Heffernan is trying to put into the Bill what has been stated as one of the consequences of the Bill, that is, that the subsidy proposed is a subsidy to agriculture.  Deputy Heffernan evidently wants to ensure that it is to be a subsidy for agriculture I think, notwithstanding that statement, that it is clearly shown that the proposals in the Bill are in the main a subsidy to the owners of the factory. We have had it made clear to us that the experimental factory can only be established on the basis of a subsidy of a generous kind.  Apart from the merits of the subsidy, or the amount of the subsidy, or any consideration of that kind, if we accept the view that it is well and good that a sugar beet industry should be established, that it is necessary in the first instance to have an experimental factory, and that such an experimental factory is only possible by way of a subsidy, then I think we have also to face the fact that it is to the owners of the factory that the subsidy is to be given.  If Deputy Heffernan's amendment is carried that proposition is turned down and such a subsidy as is proposed would be transferred to the growers of the beet and, presumably, from the story that has been told to us, there will be no factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am distinctly in favour of the general proposition that certain main products of agriculture should be guaranteed a price, but I am not prepared to take the view that there should be a guaranteed price at a rate which is alleged to be of such a kind as to give excessive, abnormal advantages to the growers.  I think that these rates, if anything like the prospect is fulfilled, would be exceptionally high and would give too high a guaranteed price. While I am in favour of the general proposition that in certain crops, and for the promotion of certain agricultural methods, we should guarantee a living wage to the grower, I am not <Col N="1496" /> prepared to say that it shall be at the rate of 45/- or 44/9 or any definite sum over a period of years ahead, because that might mean guaranteeing very much more than a reasonable, living wage and very much more than is a reasonable profit as it is called.  Taking that view, I am sorry I cannot support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The question as between the Minister and me is as to whether he is or I am expressing the views of the farmers.  I think I am expressing the views of the farmers, and that is why I tried to make a reasonably safe bargain for the farmers.  The Minister talks a great deal about this scheme being intended only for the first-class farmers.  I say that kind of talk does not amount to anything.  This scheme cannot exist for the first-class farmer.  It must exist for the average farmer.  You cannot get sufficient first-class farmers to cultivate 5,000 acres round the factory.  I doubt if you can get 50 per cent. first-class farmers in that area.  The average number of first-class farmers is comparatively small, just as in every other walk of life the average number of first-class men is small.  Even in the case of Deputies or Ministers the number of first-class men is very small.  You must try to legislate for the average person.  I am not trying to help the poor-class, worthless farmer, but we must try to help the average farmer, and it is the average farmer who is to supply beet to the factory He may not be a man who will always cultivate beet as it should be cultivated, but he will be the average farmer who will do his work fairly well and will produce fairly good beet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is very fond of saying that every farmer knows what a barrel of barley costs and what a ton of mangolds costs.  I deny that is the case. The farmers do not know the cost beforehand It is impossible for them to know it because a farmer may produce a ton of mangolds in one field under very different conditions from what he would produce them in another field. The Minister, of course, may average the cost and he may get the cost of producing a ton of mangolds, or a barrel of barley, under ideal conditions. But that is not what the average farmer <Col N="1497" /> knows.  If you get into conversation with the average farmer he can only make a rough guess as to what the cost would be, and the Minister knows that quite well.  I have asked farmers what it cost to do this or that and it is rarely I can get the exact figures, and even when I get the exact figures I am very doubtful about them. The costs vary according to the conditions, according to the climate, and according to the different qualities of land.  It is no use saying that the farmer knows what it costs to produce a barrel of barley or a ton of beet.  He may estimate it roughly, but my experience is that farmers under-estimate the actual cost and that they are inclined to over-estimate the yield.</P>

      <P>That may be.  I maintain that this amendment of mine is a perfectly reasonable proposal.  If the factory has a right to get a subsidy for ten years, the farmer has undoubtedly a right to demand the same price for the same number of years.  It is all very fine to say that ordinary business conditions will operate to make the farmer make a bargain.  He has to make the best bargain he can for himself If the farmers were perfectly organised in an organisation in which they would stand loyally together and in which they might speak with one voice, they might make a good bargain and it might be possible for them to stand on their dignity.  I say they will be in the position that they will have a large portion of their land cultivated and where they will be committed to a new system of cultivation and have a considerable addition to their rotation. They will then, to a certain extent, be in the hands of the one factory that exists in the country.  I would, if necessary, be willing to meet Deputy Johnson's point of view in regard to the actual price to be paid.  I simply fixed the price in accordance with the scale of subsidy to the factory.  That is a thing that might be gone into further and the prices might be fixed somewhat lower.  I am inclined to think, however, <Col N="1498" /> that that is a very difficult thing to do, because the only scale that I can see to go on is the scale in the schedule.</P>
      <P>I see no reason why it should not be accepted; I see no reason why the farmers should be allowed to be in the hands of this monopolistic company, which is getting a large subsidy, and I feel that if a subsidy is given the people who supply the raw material are also entitled to a guaranteed price while that subsidy continues.</P>

      <P>Deputy Heffernan seems to me to look at the matter entirely in the wrong way.  We want to have this question of sugar-beet manufacture put on a business basis as soon as possible.  We do not want to have the idea of subsidising it always at the high rates that are set out here, and we do not want farmers to get fancy prices always.  We want them to do the very thing that Deputy Heffernan says they should not be asked to do, to take the lowest price consistent with their economic position and with the management of their farms.  It will be in the interests of the factory to get not merely five thousand acres, but fifteen thousand acres grown if it can.  If it makes a profit on five thousand, it will make a greater profit on fifteen thousand, because the proportion of overhead charges will be less.  It will be the business of the factory to give a price which will induce the farmer to extend the area under cultivation, and it will be asked to do no more than that.  They should not give one penny more than will induce the farmers to grow the necessary quantity of beet, and the farmers should be satisfied with that.  It is better that the prices should be economic prices so that the farmer will give attention to the matter, be obliged to cultivate the beet properly and try to get good crops with a high sugar content.  The price at which farmers will grow beet will be one of the factors to be taken into consideration at the end of ten years, when the matter has to be reviewed.  There is no doubt that you cannot drop suddenly from a subsidy of 22/- to no subsidy at all.  At the end of ten years there must be for some further period a reduced subsidy. If you make the farmers willing to <Col N="1499" /> grow beet only by paying some fancy price, something beyond the price that the factory must offer to get beet grown, you will postpone for a further period the putting of this industry on a proper basis.  We are not proposing this by way of a direct subsidy to agriculture We could get far more tillage by having the beets thrown into a quarry hole than paying subsidies merely for the growing of beet, but that would lead us nowhere.  What we want to do is to get this business on a firm basis so that it will get along eventually without a subsidy.  If there are high profits to be got out of it on the present basis, there will be an encouragement to those who are managing the factory to keep their plant up-to-date, to adopt the newest processes&mdash;and there are always changes in processes in this matter of sugar-beet manufacture&mdash;to have a highly efficient factory.  At the end of the period we will be able to see what profits they are making, and we will be able to deal with the thing rightly when considering what should be done. But the farmer is entitled to nothing more than a price that will induce him to grow the beet and to extend the area under it.</P>

If, according to the ordinary laws of supply and demand, he is able to make a good bargain, well and good; if he is not, he can continue growing at the lowest margin of profit, because doubtless the company will bring the price to the lowest point they can, while continuing to get the farmer to grow the beet.  That is the price they will fix.  The farmer will have to give the beet; his land will be tilled and the rotation started.  It has been stated that in the bacon industry the farmer has found himself producing for a ring that controls prices and that he cannot get out of it.  He is in a form of industry that he cannot easily get out of, and he has to continue.  He will be in the same fix here, and he may be kept just to the starvation price, enough to keep him, while the company will continue to make very good profits with the subsidy they are to be given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like Deputy Heffernan to produce an amendment which would ensure to the grower a return on the average expenditure on the production over any given year.  I would like to guarantee to the farmer that he will not lose in a particular <Col N="1501" /> year by the cultivation of his land for beet.  But I do not see the wisdom in putting figures which, as Deputy Heffernan himself said, may or may not be profitable in that particular year. He does not know what the cost of production will be in any year, and the sum named may be sufficient or may be insufficient.  It is only intended to be an enticement, or an inducement, a promise held out of an assured market at a definite price.  I say that I would be prepared to support any proposal which would guarantee to the producer a price which would be measured by the cost of production in the year, but I cannot see my way to put a figure in a Bill which is applicable ten years ahead.  I am afraid that Deputy Heffernan's illustration of the pigs was rather against his argument, because we know the effect on the variation in prices in pig production, that when the prices are unprofitable people cease to breed and feed pigs, and that is one of the difficulties, I think, in regard to the pig trade, that there is such variation. Here the risks of that great variation are less because the factory is established and is bound to have some inducement for the farmer to grow, or close up.  Deputy Heffernan may answer my argument by saying that this scheme may be rather a Stock Exchange scheme and that it is intended to get all it can within the business for three or four years, and then it will not matter very much if the cultivation of beet ceases.  In such a case Deputy Heffernan's amendment is of no effect and would not have any value.  If Deputy Heffernan moved in the direction of guarantee against loss on production a guarantee based on an ascertained average cost of producttion, that certainly would get my support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Minister for his consideration.  I am afraid Deputy Heffernan is not very convincing in connection with the arguments in favour of his amendment.  One of the arguments he puts forward is that if the factory, fortunately for itself, is going to make a profit, the price paid for the beet at the factory will be varied with the amount of profit the factory is making.  That situation is, I think, Gilbertian.  Fancy a situation in which the factory is there and the price you are going to pay for the raw material is dependent on the profit and loss account they were able to produce for the farmer at a certain period. In various disputes or arguments between labour and capital we recognise the very great difficulty in one side convincing the other side that they were right.  If you imagine a case in which the farmer on the one side and the factory on the other were going to settle the right price of beet on the basis of a profit and loss account I think eternity would not be long enough to settle that question.  As far as the settlement of the question as to what it is going to cost the farmer to produce the beet is concerned that is also almost equally impossible to arrive at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had discussions from time to time with farmers and they and I have never been able to see eye to eye on the question of profit and loss.  Take a field of beet.  The farmer will admit he is getting so much for the beet.  I say in an ordinary business way: &ldquo;What is your cost on the other side?&rdquo; He will tot up the cost in a rough-and-ready way, which is more or less effective, and there will be a balance in the air.  I could not convince the farmer that that was his profit.  He would count that as part of the losses.  In a case of that kind if you cannot, even in a friendly argument, arrive at any basis on which you could find a profit <Col N="1503" /> and loss for a field of turnips or oats it would be hopeless in the other case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I never explained that the price could be fixed in accordance with the cost of production. That is an argument of Deputy Johnson My argument is, the factory gets the subsidy and while that subsidy is in existence the farmer should get a fixed price.  I will leave it at that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (2) the words:&mdash;&ldquo;and that the wages paid to and the hours of labour worked by persons employed in and about the factory are not less favourable that those commonly recognised by employers and trade societies in the trade in the districts where the work is carried out, or in the absence of such recognised wages and hours, those which in practice prevail amongst good employers, or if there are no such wages or hours recognised or prevailing in the district those recognised or prevailing in the nearest district in which the general industrial circumstances are similar.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is to insert in the Bill what is known as the Standard Fair Wages Clause.  It has not been drafted to apply especially to this Bill. It is one in regular use, and while I do not think for the moment it is going to have any practical effect of influence on the company&mdash;I think other influences would be of greater importance in fixing the rates of pay&mdash;I think it is desirable to introduce in legislation of this kind this principle that where a subsidy is being paid to a factory certain obligations shall be imposed on the factory in respect of the conditions of employment within that factory.  The principle has been adopted in all State contracts for years, and municipal contracts generally, and is recognised, at least, as imposing a certain moral and a certain legal obligation in respect of the rates of wages and conditions.  I ask that that should be done in the case of the beet sugar factory.  As I say, I do not think it is <Col N="1504" /> going to make any practical difference to the business in question, because the skilled labour will be able to obtain what might be called a monopoly price, and the unskilled labour will be special and will not be dependent on the wages round about.  I have no doubt they will be able to make their own terms, and those will become the recognised wages in the district at least.  In view of the special stress that the production of sugar involves during a particular season, it will not have any effect on the actual practice.  I think it is necessary to introduce a provision of this kind in any measure which involves the payment by the State of a subsidy or bounty through the company, and to impose on them the obligation to treat their employees according to a reasonable standard and to give them fair conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to accept this amendment in its present form.  There is, as Deputy Johnson said, no trade such as this in existence. There are, no doubt, special conditions of work in connection with sugar manufacture.  During the campaign period the factory will be running for 24 hours a day for seven days a week, and, of course, there can be no such thing as conditions which would involve no night work or Sunday labour. On the other hand, I think it has been admitted generally that where Government money has been expended, say in the case of contracts, there should be a fair-wages clause and reasonable conditions of employment should exist.</P>
      <P>I think the same argument that makes us take a stand in regard to contracts has application here, but I would like to consider the terms of the clause before I agreed to it.  I would like to consider it more fully than I have yet had an opportunity of doing, and if the Deputy did not press the amendment I would undertake to give the matter further consideration before the Report Stage is reached.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the way he has received it.  The phraseology of the clause that I put forward has been adopted merely because it is the standard which has been accepted both by employers and employees. <Col N="1505" /> It has been accepted by Governments as well as by public bodies, and has been in operation for quite a long time.  It does not contain what I would like to see in such a clause.  I may say that while it may seem not to be particularly appropriate to these conditions, it has been found, in practice, to fulfil almost any requirements even under exceptional conditions such as this may be said to be.  However, the Minister has promised to consider the phraseology of the clause, and I therefore will not press the amendment at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Johnson has pointed out, and as the Minister has admitted, there is nothing objectionable in the amendment so far as the wording of it is concerned.  The broad objection that I have to it is this, that I maintain the saving grace in this thing is that the factory for the manufacture of sugar is a private undertaking, and there is no reason why a clause of that sort should be brought into it any more than it should be brought into any other private undertaking.  It may be said that the concern is to work with the assistance of a subsidy.  The subsidy, however, is to be given for a very definite purpose and has nothing to do with the manufacture of sugar.  My desire would be to preserve the private character of the enterprise, and to save it as far as I could from getting within the clutches of the Government.  In my opinion there is no place in this Bill for the amendment at all.  The Bill does not deal with the question as to how they are going to run the factory, what rates they are to pay or anything of that sort.  It merely deals with the question of the subsidy, and I ask the House to consider this as a private undertaking.  I have no objection to the wording of the amendment, but I object to any clause of that sort being brought into the Bill.</P>

        <i>Laissez-faire!</i>  The Deputy, as I said before, is usually consistent in his advocacy of the Manchester School of Economics, but he occasionally lapses and recovers himself when another opportunity arises, and this he deems to be such an opportunity. <Col N="1506" /> Let me remind the Deputy that this Bill is giving not only a subsidy and a licence but particular privileges, and the company will inevitably have to introduce foreign skilled labour.  But supposing, as has happened in other industries and in other countries not very far away, that it was thought profitable as a private enterprise, an individual undertaking not subject to any Government restrictions, to introduce Coolie labour at Coolie prices, would the Deputy still maintain his view that there should be no intervention and no interference, and that there should be no restrictions upon the conditions on which such a company would carry on its business, while at the same time it was receiving Government subvention?4Some of us are familiar with the conditions that at one time prevailed in certain chemical industries, certain iron industries, where alien labour from Eastern Europe was introduced and introduced because of its cheapness.  If there was no restriction and if the ideals of Deputy Hewat were in practical operation, then the cheapest possible labour, living on the lowest standard in Europe, Asia, Africa, or South America could be introduced, and we should have no right and no reason to intervene.  That is Deputy Hewat's argument, and he would like that to prevail and to be allowed under this Bill.  My desire is to prevent even the possibility of that thing happening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Deputy Johnson has much grounds for that argument.  He could apply the same argument to any industry to-day run by private enterprise.  Is there anything to-day in this country to prevent private enterprise from bringing in Coolie labour or Indian labour?</P>

If you are going to treat this particular factory as a subsidised industry because of the subsidy that you give to it, then, of course, Deputy Johnson is right and any advocacy that I may have advanced in favour of the Bill is gone altogether. I say so far as the introduction of Coolie labour into this industry is concerned, <Col N="1507" /> that it could be no more introduced into it than it could into any other industry in the country.  The safeguards against the introduction of that kind of labour are public opinion, and, if I might say so, the power of the trade unions.  But, supposing there is no objection by the trade unions, and supposing there is no objection by public opinion, then why not introduce Coolie labour if you want to?  I presume because it is a perfectly impracticable proposition, and this is only a red herring drawn across the track.</P>

      <P>I move as an amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every company to which a subsidy is paid under this Act shall appoint on its board of directors one director who shall be nominated by the Minister for Finance.  The term of office and remuneration of the director to be appointed on the nomination of the Minister for Finance shall be such as shall be prescribed by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of my amendment is obvious.  I want to have a director nominated by the Minister for Finance to sit upon the board of the company that controls this factory.  Under this scheme the Government is giving a subsidy of approximately two millions to the people who are going to establish this industry.  The greater portion of this two millions will go to the factory That is particularly due to the fact that the Minister has refused to guarantee <Col N="1509" /> the price to the farmers beyond three years.  Where such a large subsidy is going to the company it is only right that the Government giving the subsidy should have some voice in the control of the industry.  As the Bill stands at present, the Government have no control whatever.  It is absolutely free to the company to do what they like and to receive the subsidy, provided they carry on their business on a paying basis.  The only safeguard the Ministry has is the annual balance-sheet which has to be submitted to the Minister.  It is well known that balance-sheets are very dubious things which can hide a great many facts and figures that never can be elucidated or found out; and even, with all these questions that the Minister is allowed to ask, there well may be many things that he will be unable to find out. There may be the concealment of capital and the concealment of earnings. There is no reason why such a thing could not be done without doing anything actually dishonest or that would bring the company within the power of the law: to increase, for instance, the value of their holdings to a great extent They may, with their profits, introduce elaborate new machinery, and still the profits would be small and the Minister would be called upon at the end of ten years for a subsidy for a continuing period.  In view of these possibilities, and the safeguards we have, we have no adequate control of the business of the factory or its internal management, and I think it is only right that the Government that gives this subsidy should have a representative upon the Board.</P>
    <P>I also had the intention of putting in an amendment, which I will put in later on, to the effect that the beet-growers would have a representative on the Board.  Possibly that is more important than the amendment I have put in, but, for the present, this amendment stands, and I suggest that the Minister should accept it.</P>

He would not be able to find out about the costings.  If he asked for them they would refer him to the manager, and he would get no information.  You would gain nothing by having a director on the Board.  I do not like to take a political simile, but it would be like where you have the representatives of one nation sitting in the Parliament of another.  They do not get you very far.  Where you have a director on the Board having an entirely different interest from any other representative and having an opposing interest because, as I have indicated, the question of subsidy is bound to arise in ten years, good care will be taken naturally and inevitably that he would learn nothing.  The result would be that if anything went wrong it would be simply ascribed to Government interference.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Every such company as aforesaid shall, on demand, furnish to the Minister such explanations as the Minister shall think proper to require in respect of any balance sheet or profit and loss account furnished by the company pursuant to this section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that shows that the Minister is taking some precautions in view possibly of the fact that balance sheets do not always disclose everything, and that there is a possibility that all the information that might be required in view of liabilities undertaken would not <Col N="1511" /> be furnished and would not be got in the ordinary way.  The Minister said one director would get no information.  I suggest that one director, although he would not have any control, so far as policy is concerned because he would be in the minority, would do much to prevent lengthy correspondence between officials of the Ministry and the managing director of the factory, and although that correspondence might go on over a long time, the Minister would not get anything like the same detailed information about the board that he would if this amendment were accepted. Deputy Heffernan has gone a long way on the right road when he said that he also intended, and would move at a later stage, that a directorship should be given to the beet growers, who, after all, are the workers.  I wonder would he agree to give a directorship to the Union that would represent the workers upon the farms and distribute the directorships in a more equitable way, representing the different interests concerned in the development of this particular industry.  However, there is, I think, a good deal to be said against the claim for nomination on the board of a business concern representing the people who have financial interest, such as in this particular case, because you cannot have control of policy.  But you can get more detailed information if you provide a man of brains, and knowledge of accounting work, and you can get far quicker information from him than by the method provided by the Government in sub-section (3) of Section 3. That is the only thing I see that would warrant me in claiming that Deputy Heffernan's amendment has something in it that should recommend it to the Minister, and if he goes on the point that the factory is turning out a balance sheet no satisfactory to the Minister, and if he points out that he will have to resort to the powers he asks for in sub-section (3) he will find that there is considerable difficulty in getting an explanation of things, and that it will take a far longer time to get that in the way the Minister wants to get it than if he agreed to the amendment of Deputy Heffernan.</P>

      <P>I would like to assure Deputy Heffernan that the nomination of a director on this concern would not achieve any of the objects he wishes to achieve by the proposal in his amendment.  The only position, as the Minister has said, that the director could take up in a concern of that kind would be to be a scape-goat on behalf of the Ministry for anything that went wrong.  It must be clear to the Committee, that the Minister is only interested in the profit and loss account.  As a matter of fact, he is not interested in the loss at all, if there is a loss.  He is only interested in the profit, if there is a profit, and it turns out to be exorbitant.  The section here provides for his getting all the information he can possibly want.  It says, &ldquo;Every company shall, within ninety days after the end of each accounting year, furnish to the Minister a balance sheet for such accounting year duly audited by the company's auditors.&rdquo;  There, of course, is exactly where the difference is.  They say &ldquo;balance sheet&rdquo; in one case, and &ldquo;profit and loss account&rdquo; in the other.  I may say that the balance sheet and the profit and loss account are two entirely different things.  The Minister is taking care that he will get the profit and loss account, which is much more important than the balance sheet, and he has taken power to examine into it, and that can be done very effectively, and really there will be no trouble at all except there is excess profits.  Loss does not concern the Ministry in the least; it does not concern anybody but the company themselves, and to put a director nominated by the Government on a board of that sort is, I think, only inviting more trouble than it is worth.  I would imagine it is a sort of addition that the company would welcome rather than otherwise.</P>

I do not agree with the Minister for Finance.  I do not believe that this director, if he were a man of the right type, and with a knowledge <Col N="1513" /> of finance, could be prevented from finding out the facts about the company.  He would be on the board and he would be at their meetings, and nothing could happen with which he would not be acquainted.

      <P>Deputy Davin is right.  It would take a long time for the Minister to get the actual facts, and he might not get the correct information Deputy Hewat surely does not accuse us of not knowing the difference between a balance-sheet and a profit and loss account, but I maintain a balance-sheet and profit and loss account could be drawn up, so that an outsider could not get a proper view of the company's position.  It is common in high finance and in company promotion to issue misleading profit and loss accounts and balance-sheets which, although not conveying anything contrary to law, convey a totally wrong idea of the financial position of the company which they are supposed to describe.  In view of the fact that the Government stake such a large amount on this, and leave the whole control in the hands of a private company, of necessity the Government should know how the company is getting on towards the end of the period of subsidy in order to place themselves in a correct position to deal with future subsidies, if any.  Deputy Hewat says that they are not concerned with the loss.  I maintain they are as much concerned with the loss as with the profit.  If the company is losing towards the end of the period of subsidy, they will ask for a continuance of the subsidy and, per haps, for a larger one.  I suggest that there is nothing unreasonable in this amendment.</P>

      <P>What a curious conception Deputy Heffernan has of the duty of a director!  I spoke before in connection with the sugar-beet debate of the amount of confused thought that it has given rise to.  The Government is to appoint a director.  That is a revolutionary proposal, if to no other extent than this, that it is the shareholders who are represented in a company by the directors, and according to all the laws that prevail in the Free State, as in other civilised communities, a director is in a fiduciary position in regard to the shareholders, whose interests he is there to protect; but Deputy Heffernan's conception of business as to be conducted henceforth in the Free State is that the Government is to have a watchdog in the guise of a director&mdash;in other words, a spy, who is to give information, which otherwise would not be forthcoming, so as to check what might be a fraudulent balance-sheet and in the matter of profit and loss account.  Does not the Deputy know perfectly well that if he were able to persuade, as fortunately he is not able to persuade, the Minister for Finance to appoint a director in connection with this factory, he would be an official of the Ministry of Finance?  That, undoubtedly, would carry out the watchdog ideal of the Deputy.  Then you would be confronted with this extraordinary spectacle of a company, invited here to set up a factory with the lure of a subsidy, having its business transactions interfered with by a civil servant and reported by a civil servant to his departmental chief.  Where is that going to stop?  I have thought it my duty more than once to protest against the encroachment of the Ministry of Finance, not that I have any objection to civil servants&mdash;far from it&mdash;but I do not want to see civil servants put into what would be a false position and give rise to a precedent altogether indefensible.  If we are going to nationalise, in heaven's name, nationalise. <Col N="1515" /> If we are going to set up a sugar factory, in the nation's name, let us do so.  Surely Deputy Heffernan has forgotten the primary conditions of this enterprise, that the State is attempting to establish an industry which has not existed here before, or, to measure words more carefully, it is attempting to explore the possibilities of creating an industry which was never here before.  That is only to be done by conducting, what is called by the Minister, the experiment, on the most careful lines.  If the Ministry is right in giving this subsidy and this advantage to a Belgian firm which has carried on the sugar industry for years and years with success, it would be an extraordinary performance to interfere with the conduct of their business in these exploration years and interfere by an interference that is wholly unskilled.  That is what I deprecate If the Minister for Finance were a Minister in a country where this was a long-established industry, where they command the services of expert men in this industry, and if they were to make a proposition when the years of the subsidy were over and when it was established, beyond yea or nay, that this was a paying industry, that the farmers would provide beets in a continuous quantity, in a requisite amount for the sugar factory, then the Government, perhaps, could go into this business on a bigger and larger scale, and with a view to that, and with a view to profit-sharing they wanted control, I could then understand Deputy Heffernan's proposal. The important thing is that we are at the inception of an enterprise.  We are at this point: Will the farmers play up, will they turn aside to put under beet cultivation the requisite number of acres?  In so far as the conduct of that experiment is in question, it is highly essential that the firm that is doing the conversion of sucrose beet into actual molasses, sugar, and pulp, should not have its actual business sagacity and skill interfered with by an amateur.  It is all very well for Deputy Heffernan, in recommending his proposal, to use the word &ldquo;control,&rdquo; and then, under criticism, <Col N="1516" /> to withdraw the word &ldquo;control.&rdquo; What sort of a director is he to be? He has to sit at the meetings of the directors, and when there is a question of control, he is to be silent and inert, according to the revised view of Deputy Heffernan, and merely to take notes of figures and report, not to his fellow-directors, but to the Ministry, which is not a shareholder, and which, apparently, until this period is over, does not pretend to be a shareholder.</P>

      <P>That is a different matter.  The Government is perfectly entitled to see whether the thing is being carried on as a <i>bona fide</i> transaction.  What Deputy Heffernan forgets in using the misleading analogy of a director representing the Ministry is, that he thinks of the Government in another light than that in which it actually correctly is to be viewed, namely, it is the citizens in their corporate capacity, functioning in their corporate capacity, and it is the citizens' money that is being used to subsidise the company.  However, the thing is that the company is enticed, if I may use such a word, because it is made worth its while by this favourable subsidy to invest in the venture, and it is the citizens' money <i>pro tanto</i> that is being adventured.  It might be out of order to revert to it, but Deputy Heffernan spoke of the farmer at the end of the period at which it is to have a fixed price as being in an unfavourable position But is not the factory at that stage at the mercy of the farmer?  If the farmer cannot be induced to supply the requisite amount of beet, the factory goes out of business.  In answer to Deputy Davin, it might be possible for the firm so to conduct its business that it would secure having a return that would give it back again the money it had put in, and then be ready to clear out of the country.  The Ministry of Finance to this extent is perfectly entitled to be a watchdog, but to create a system of espionage and to put in a civil servant on the board of directors, where he is, according to the Deputy's <Col N="1517" /> account of it, to be a director and yet not a director, seems to be ludicrous.</P>

      <P>When you come to consider Deputy Heffernan's amendment, it has to be considered that this enterprise is an entirely new business in this country.  Neither Deputy Professor Magennis nor any other Deputy need wonder at the amendment being brought up and discussed here, and considering the arguments made as to this being a subsidy to agriculture, Deputy Professor Magennis need not wonder if we ask what the figures are.  The assumption is that you are going to get 50,000 tons of beet at the figure of 54s. per ton.  That would represent about £135,000 every year.  In about ten years £2,000,000 will be expended on this factory by way of subsidy, provided you get the 50,000 tons of guaranteed supply.  That would leave the company a profit of £650,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to direct attention to the revelation of ethics of capitalistic enterprise that we have had. The shareholders, we are told, are by virtue of their savings invested in this enterprise, but because of their inexperience, their lack of knowledge of the business, and the fact that they are only interested in what they can get in a monetary way out of it, to hand over the responsibility to the directors.  The directors, no doubt, are responsible to the owners of the business, and the responsibility includes the care of the persons employed in the undertaking, looking after their conditions, and also having some regard to the national needs and the public well-being.  But we learn from Deputy Hewat that one of the directors will only be a scape-goat, and that everything would be, or might be, hidden by the majority of the directors.  We learn also from the Minister that the directors may be deprived of any exercise of the responsibility that the shareholders have devolved on them for the care of the <Col N="1519" /> business, and of the persons employed at the business, and of any social consequences that the conduct of this business may entail.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that is true.  I am afraid it applies to many enterprises, and that, as a matter of fact, the only care the directors have&mdash;the only sense of responsibility they have&mdash;is to see whether a sufficient amount of profit is gained from the industry for the shareholders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should remember that directors of a public company, particularly of a company of the kind foreshadowed in this Bill, are not going to be experts in the production of sugar.  There may be one person who knows something about sugar-beet production, or even about the sale of sugar, and the marketing of it&mdash; there is quite a possibility, not by any means a certainty, even a probability &mdash;but it is equally probable that all the rest of the directors will be either ornamental or interested only in the finances and the manipulation of the finances of the company.  They will have nothing at all to do with the management of the company beyond the financial side.  They will know absolutely nothing about the production <Col N="1520" /> of beet, the management of a beet factory, or the sale of the sugar.  Their chief interest will be to see whether they can have an inter-locking interest with another company, with the refinery company, with a Continental company, with a big machinery manufacturing company, inter-locking interests that will enable resources to be hidden, and generally to manipulated the share capital.  That will be the business of the directors, and all the technical knowledge required will be left in the hands of one person.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that, notwithstanding the weighty arguments&mdash; if one is thinking of factory management&mdash;he has put forward, there is something to be said for Deputy Heffernan's advocacy, that the nominee of the Ministry on the directorate might be able to frustrate, or at least be able to keep them informed, so as to be able to frustrate undesirable financial manipulations.  At any rate, certain aspects of policy affecting the public that a company of this kind, or a similar company might be tempted to indulge in, could not be indulged in without the knowledge of even a single director.  I do not support the proposal on the grounds that he is likely to be useful in influencing the management, in influencing the fulfilment of the trust&mdash;or, what perhaps one should say would, in a civilised community not merely a community of financiers, be a trust&mdash;but that he may be able to see that the public interest was safeguarded in whatever proposals are made by the directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, I am not pressing support for this amendment, because I realise that in such a company ethical considerations of the public welfare and matters of that kind are not the functions of persons on whom devolve the interests of the shareholders.  Shareholders do not think in those terms, and directors do not think in them as a rule, particularly in a company of the kind foreshadowed in this Bill?  I just want to say that, by giving more or less general support to the idea behind this Bill, that it is desirable to develop beet growth, and sugar production, the method is by no means faultless, and the introduction of big <Col N="1521" /> financial interests, unless some definite check from the public point of view is imposed, may have consequences of a kind which will undo all the good that the production of sugar beet will, we hope, bring with it.</P>

They have made a bargain, and will not break away from it in the slightest iota.  I am not in favour of nationalisation, and neither am I in favour of Government control.  I maintain that when the Government, to all intents and purposes, takes a share in the establishment of a company, it is right that the ordinary principle of private control should be abandoned, and that the Government should have a certain voice in the control.  They cannot obtain control of the company but they will at least have a voice, if there is somebody watching their interests and the interests of the public, whose money is being put up.  Incidentally, but perhaps more important, the interests of those who are supplying the raw material will be watched so that they get a square deal.</P>

The matter was never discussed, so we can reject the proposal really on the grounds of its foolishness, and leave all other considerations out. This sugar-beet industry will not be in any different position in relation to the Government from, say, the boot industry If we had kept the sugar tax on at the rate it was before the Budget there would be no necessity to pay a penny of a direct subsidy to these people.  They would simply have the advantage of a protective tariff.  They would then have been in precisely the same position as the boot people, except that they would have a ten years' guarantee.  It is not suggested that we should appoint a director on every boot factory or for every clothing factory. There is really no more reason except that we have a ten-years' period in question why we should not appoint a <Col N="1523" /> director for a boot factory.  Ordinarily, directors are there for one interest, and that is to represent the shareholders.  There is no reason why anything should be concealed from a particular director, why they should not work harmoniously together.  But, if you put a man in, not to represent the same interest as the majority, but to be simply a detective there, I think that it is only human nature to expect that he will be given very little information There are high political officers in other countries who do certain acts on advice, and what happens is that the people who advise meet together and decide what advice is to be given.  Then the high political officer comes along, or they go to him, and they advise him on the lines they have already arranged without his presence.  It would be quite possible for a director to attend every board meeting and every sub-committee, and not be able to gather any information that we could not get by means of an ordinary question.  As a matter of fact, a director who is in a minority on a board, could get no information that the majority do not wish him to get. When he would ask for a return he would be told: &ldquo;We do not want to be bothered with that.&rdquo;  When he would ask for the manager to be brought up to answer some questions, they would say: &ldquo;The manager is busy, let him attend to his work,&rdquo; and he would get no information.</P>

      <P>Deputy Heffernan's <Col N="1524" /> amendment is based on that.  I say that if Deputy Heffernan is right, he gets no cure by the appointment of a director&mdash;absolutely none.  We would have the disadvantage of being in the position that any failure would be, to some extent, ascribed to us.  We would be also in the other position, that instead of the company dealing, say, with farmers or workers, purely on a business basis, we would have people coming along here and saying: &ldquo;Did the Government's nominee consent to give farmers only 49/- per ton or did he agree to something else?&rdquo;  In every way, I think it would be much better to have no director, and certainly a director there could serve no purpose, and he would be hated by his co-directors.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gorey has reasoned on too narrow a basis.  The Minister is not really arguing from any knowledge of public companies. He is arguing from his knowledge of <Col N="1525" /> the Dáil, and he is putting the minority director in the position of the minority Deputy.  I recognised the words. You move for a return, and the Government say: &ldquo;Oh, no, we cannot grant this.&rdquo;  I knew where we had got to. The Minister's argument, which is becoming a stock argument, is that of the infinite gullibility of mankind.  One director cannot get at the truth in a company.  One Geddes Committee cannot get at the truth in a Government department.  We get this over and over again.  He may be right.  I hope he is not, for the sake of human nature. But, if he is right, what is the corollary to his argument?  It is this: &ldquo;Vote for this Bill now; leave everything to the Government.&rdquo;  Three or six or nine years hence it will be: &ldquo;Leave everything to the company and, to a certain extent, to the Government; do not dare to come down and presume, on the Estimates, to criticise the action of any person connected with the company; it must not be done.&rdquo;  I hope, in contradistinction to Deputy Gorey, that Deputy Heffernan will at least divide the Dáil on this amendment.</P>

Therefore, when the Minister goes that far, he is asking the Dáil to bear with him too long.  It is also well known that if a director asks for a certain return in regard to working expenses, or any other matter, he must get it, and it is not left to the majority to decide whether a director will be furnished with particulars or not.  I should like to hear the Minister explain why he deemed it advisable to insert sub-section (3) of Section 3.  Was it merely copying what is in a British Act, and, if so, for what reason?</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 13, to delete the words &ldquo;the company's auditors&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;an auditor or auditors nominated by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Bill, as drafted, the company may appoint auditors for the purposes of this Act, and auditors for their own purposes.  I think it is not definite enough that the auditors, first, shall be qualified, and, second, that they are of a character and quality acceptable to the Minister.  I suggest that it is important that the auditors shall be, first, qualified auditors, and, second, that they shall be of a character of which the Minister, at any rate, would approve.  I have put down the amendment in the form that they shall be nominated by the Minister, but I can see that it might be a little less objectionable to the company if they were auditors approved by the Minister However, the important thing is that the auditors shall be qualified and shall be approved of by the Minister. Otherwise we may have the possibility <Col N="1527" /> that Deputy O'Connell and I, who are not qualified auditors, may be the company's auditors, or any persons with as little qualifications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that Deputy Johnson makes at the end is certainly quite a good point.  The auditors must be qualified auditors.  I will look into that aspect of it.  It would not, as the Deputy recognises, be possible to say that the company should accept the auditor that I might nominate, because that might mean that it might be compelled to submit its books to people in whom it might have no confidence at all, and it might disclose information which the company might not wish to disclose.  It may well be that before the end of the ten years' period it will be possible to get offers from other people on such terms as would incline us to accept them for the erection of other factories.  These rival businesses are always very jealous of their trade secrets.  I think you could not expect a company to submit to the audit of its books by people in whom it has no confidence.  I think the certificate of an ordinary auditor, whose certificate we take for income tax purposes, would be good enough.  We have power to ask for information, if there is anything requiring explanation on the surface of the document and the accounts they give us.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In sub-section (2) of Section 3, line 21, to delete the word &lsquo;general.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point here is that &ldquo;the general nature of such assets and liabilities&rdquo; leaves the way open to a general indication <Col N="1529" /> of the assets and liabilities.  Such a balance-sheet shall contain &ldquo;a summary of the company's share capital, assets or liabilities with such particulars as will disclose the general nature of such assets and liabilities.&rdquo; Now, that would enable the disclosure simply to be the shares or stocks without any indication of what the shares may be or the class of share.  It is too wide.  &ldquo;The nature of such assets and liabilities,&rdquo; should be wide enough.  I said a few minutes ago that there was such a thing as interlocking of companies of this kind.  We know that, as a matter of practice, modern company organisation has followed the course of a company having so many shares in an associated industry, and that company having so many shares in this industry, with such a general complexity of share-holdings that nobody knows by any balance-sheet or any return of a financial character that can be published, what is the real position of the company.  The use of this word &ldquo;general&rdquo; rather encourages a company in any statement of finances, to hide the facts by a very round and bald statement.  I think that any value that is to be got out of this sub-section is lost by the insertion of the word &ldquo;general&rdquo;&mdash;that it practically invites the hiding of the nature of the assets and liabilities, and the manner in which they are arrived at.  I, therefore, move to delete the word &ldquo;general,&rdquo; so that it shall be clear that it is, in fact, the nature of such assets and liabilities that we desire to know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; there has got the force that Deputy Johnson ascribes to it, but I can see no objection to its removal, because it would certainly be necessary for the Minister to obtain a satisfactory knowledge from the account submitted to him.  Deputy Johnson, in advocating the removal of the word &ldquo;general,&rdquo; dealt with the ramifications and financial relations of commercial companies.  I would not go so far as to say that, with the knowledge and information that the Minister has power to obtain under this Bill, any balance sheet could possibly be misleading to him.  If Deputy Johnson <Col N="1530" /> means that he has any idea of restricting the operations of the company, I do not agree with him.  He says that other associations of companies have large ramifications in connection with their businesses.  Is it going to hurt anything affected by this arrangement, to build a sugar-beet factory, if they do have these arrangements?  I rather think that the only aim this Bill has is to get the sugar-beet grown and to get the sugar manufactured out of the beet.  I would go so far as to say that it is not material whether one ounce of that sugar is eaten in the Saorstát or not.  If it were all exported and money got for it, the purpose of the Bill would be accomplished just as much as if the sugar was eaten by the people of the Saorstát.  The whole assumption on which this criticism is based is that this is a company coming here with ulterior motives and for ulterior purposes.  In so far as that may be so, I think the Bill sufficiently protects the interests of this country. As regards this amendment, I see no objection to the deletion of the word &ldquo;general,&rdquo; because, in my opinion, it is redundant, and except the Minister has some good reason I think the amendment might be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was discussed on the British Bill in the House of Commons.  It is doubtful whether the removal of the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; would effect any substantial change. If it would effect a change, it is doubtful what exactly that would be.  The phraseology here is taken from the Companies Acts.  It is well established. It is what a company is bound to do as the law stands at present.  I do not know that we would really alter the position very much, or alter what is required to be disclosed, if we omitted the word &ldquo;general,&rdquo; and left the phrase to read &ldquo;the nature of such assets.&rdquo;  That might mean, in practice, practically the same thing as &ldquo;the general nature of such assets.&rdquo;  In any case, the sub-section should be read as a whole.  <i>(Sub-section quoted.)</i>  It would be possible to insert further requirements in the regulations.  Then, there is also the power to ask questions on points that are not clear.  I am not <Col N="1531" /> sure that the removal of the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; would effect anything.  On the other hand, as the wording is taken from the Companies Acts, I am slow to change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise quite well that the phrase &ldquo;the nature of such assets&rdquo; is a wide one, and the effect of the amendment may not be very much in altering it.  What I feel about it is that there is, by the insertion of that adjective, an invitation to be more general and less precise than the phrase would imply if the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; were not there.  While it is true that subsequent sub-sections may enable the Minister to require further particulars, I think we should rather aim at having the nature of such assets and liabilities disclosed in as clear and precise a form as would be assumed to be required, without inviting too general and vague a description.  The term &ldquo;general nature&rdquo; rather suggests that it was intended that the nature of such assets should not be defined except in one sweeping phrase&mdash;assets or shareholdings in other companies.  Some general phrase of that kind would cover this term &ldquo;general nature.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The section provides for financial statements other than balance-sheet and profit and loss accounts, which may be asked for, but only profit and loss accounts and the balance-sheet are to be laid before the House.  My desire is that any such statement that may be required by the Minister should be laid before the House in the same way.  I think it is obvious that if there is any purpose to be served by presenting a copy of the balance-sheet and profit <Col N="1532" /> and loss account, it is at least equally desirable that any other financial statement which the Minister may require should also be laid upon the Table.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot agree to that.  This other statement that may be required will enable us to be certain and to assure the Dáil that the profit and loss account and the balance-sheet, as far as they go, are accurate; and not merely accurate in the sense that balance-sheets drawn up by reputable people always are accurate, but that they are not misleading to the unwary.  We could not undertake that matters of a confidential character, which the company might be obliged by our questions to disclose to us, should be made public to their rivals, or should be made public in any way. I do not think that would be reasonable No company in the ordinary way of business could afford to do that. Anybody who will reflect for a moment will see that it might be highly inconvenient and highly injurious to a company to have confidential information broadcasted.  The whole purpose of this information is not really to deal with some of the matters which Deputy Johnson adverted to this evening, but simply to let us know what terms we should give to other people who might apply for permission to erect factories, if we thought it well to have additional factories, and what terms we might agree to give this first company at the end of its period; it is for the purpose of letting us know to what extent our subsidy is sufficient or is more than sufficient.

The term &ldquo;company&rdquo; appears in several sub-sections.  I desire to include in the definition sub-section that where the term &ldquo;company&rdquo; appears, it shall include any person or any incorporated body.  There are other ways in which this might be done.

But then we read in Section 4: &ldquo;The Minister may, by order, make regulations for all or any of the following purposes.&rdquo;  Unless it is said that paragraph (a) fulfils all the requirements, I think it will be necessary to show that the form and nature of the accounts and balance-sheets that are required should be amongst those things which the Minister may by order make regulations for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  At the expiration of the period of ten years fixed by Section 1 of this Act the assets of any undertaking engaged in the manufacture of sugar in respect of which a subsidy has been paid under this Act shall be valued by a valuer appointed by agreement between the Minister and the person or company owning such undertaking or, failing such agreement, by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>(2)  Upon the completion of the valuation there shall be allotted to the Minister, to be held in trust for the State, shares in the undertaking equal in value to one-half of the aggregate amount paid by way of subsidy.</P>
      <P>(3)  In the distribution of any profits of the undertaking in excess of the amount necessary to pay interest at the rate of five per cent. per annum upon the assets not allotted to the Minister, the shares held by the Minister shall rank equally with those not held by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is a much more important one, and it raises a question of principle and public policy.  It is proposed by the amendment that, at the expiration of the ten-years' period, account shall be taken of the amount of subsidy that has been paid to the company, that credit should be taken of that amount, and that it shall be deemed to be, in part at least, capital provided by the State to allow the company to carry on its business.  I think it is quite correct to state that a subsidy of this kind is in the nature of capital advanced, which may be required for spending, perhaps lavishly, for the purpose of creating a goodwill and creating a business.  My proposal is that a proportion of the subsidy shall be treated as having been capital advanced.  The proposal is that at the expiration of ten years the assets of any undertaking engaged in the manufacture of sugar <Col N="1536" /> in respect of which a subsidy has been paid under this Act, shall be valued by a valuer appointed by agreement between the Minister and the person or company, or, failing such agreement, by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.  The valuer shall complete the valuation, and there shall be allotted to the Minister, to be held in trust for the State, shares in the undertaking equal in value to half of the aggregate amount paid by way of subsidy.  Then, in the distribution of any profits in excess of what would pay five per cent. upon the company's assets, other than those provided out of the subsidy, shares held by the Minister shall rank equally with those not held by the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is my view that the subsidy paid over is in the nature of capital expenditure, that the State is prepared to forego half that capital expenditure at the end of the period, but as to the other half that it shall participate in the assets of the company, and that its shares shall bear the proportion of the profits that might ensue after 5 per cent. has been paid on the shareholders' capital.  I think that is a very reasonable proposition.  It will enable the State to get some advantage from the subsidy in addition to the indirect advantage that will accrue through what is hoped to be an improvement in agricultural production.  It is quite reasonable, I suggest, that the State should become part-owners of an industry, a corporation, and the assets of a corporation, which is only being made possible by the expenditure of State moneys.  Very moderately I am suggesting that in any case after the ten years' period has elapsed, the shareholders' investments will be entitled to 5 per cent. as a first charge on the profits, and that after that 5 per cent. is paid on a kind of Preference share, that the State share will rank equally. I submit that is a reasonable proposal, and that it should not be objected to by any company making any arrangement of the kind if it is intended that the company shall be a permanent acquisition to the State: if it is intended to be anything more than a flash-in-the-pan arrangement for the purpose of skimming the cream and then letting <Col N="1537" /> the separated milk down the gutter or to feed the pigs.  The assumption is that the business to be established will be one for the benefit of the State and shall be a permanent one.  On such an assumption it is reasonable that the State will rank as part-owners of the company by virtue of the sums of money they have paid as subsidies.  I therefore move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated my belief that it is really too much to expect that at the end of the period of ten years the company, having received this subsidy of 22/- for so long, can suddenly carry on without a subsidy. I believe that for some period, shorter or longer, some perhaps very much less subsidy, but still some subsidy, will have to be paid.  If the case is not that, and that does not represent how the matter will stand, certainly extraordinary progress will be made during the coming ten years.  If we still have to pay a subsidy, then it means that if we alter the capital in this way, we will have to give a larger subsidy than otherwise in order to pay the interest on our shares.  If this company succeeds to the extent of having much more than 5,000 acres under cultivation, supposing it succeeds to the extent of having 8,600 acres under cultivation, it would mean about £2,000,000 of a subsidy.  It would also mean that the capital of the company would have to be watered to the extent of £1,000,000. Probably the genuine capital in the company, even with the extension required to deal with that larger acreage of beet, would not be more than £400,000 or £500,000.  In commercial undertakings where risks are involved, where the future is uncertain, where attention has to be given to many details, 5 per cent. is not regarded as anything like a reasonable interest. In any commercial undertaking with these risks the interest has to be higher than, say, in the case of the National Loan or the British War Loan.  They would have to pay double the interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For every £1 that went in paying interest above 5 per cent. to bring the interest up to 8 or 9 per cent., or what would be regarded as reasonable by the Government in its dealings with the <Col N="1538" /> company, you would have to pay £2 interest on the watered capital.  That would result in having an abnormal subsidy.  Dealings with other factories that might be set up, would be made much more difficult by having this artificial subsidy, part of which was coming back to the Exchequer in interest on this watered capital that was put in.  I think that would create a very undesirable position, and even when you do get to the stage when the subsidy would not be required, you would have the position where you might have your industry really bankrupt by the over-capitalisation that would be created.  You would be probably in a position in normal times where the company could actually manage to pay very little over the 5 per cent.  They would, however, take up the position that, rather than pay £2 to the Government for every £1 their shareholders got in addition to the 5 per cent., they would try to make a few appointments, perhaps sinecure appointments of shareholders, manipulate the thing in some way, or perhaps enter into contracts with some other company, and get the profit through the other company.  At least, you would have the temptation to have all sorts of devious methods resorted to for the purpose of avoiding the liability to pay £2 to the Government for every £1 they made themselves.  When we know the efforts that people resort to, to avoid paying 5s. in the £ income tax, I think you can expect that a company would go to great lengths to avoid making money, two-thirds of which would go to the Government.  I do not think that it would work.  I think that we must look upon the establishment of the industry as our return.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister that he is mis-reading the proposal.  It is not suggested that the State contribution would be doubled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but that is my argument.  I suggested a company with an average over the ten years of say, 8,600 acres.  Then, roughly, half the subsidy paid would be a little less than a million pounds.  I said that even allowing for the extension of the plant, such an increased acreage would <Col N="1539" /> mean double the capital.  The capital would not be more than £400,000, probably, and the water would be double the original capital, so that there is some margin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The valuer would value the undertaking, and the shares held by the company and the shares held by the State, if the subsidy was sufficient to allow of it, would rank equally; they would be equal in amount, and only after the five per cent. had been paid on the shareholders' capital would the State come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite probable at the end of the time that the valuer would say that the State would have no value at all.  I think that would be the position at the end of the ten years, if you take that view of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the five per cent. is worth nothing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I can make nothing out of it than that there shall be shares in the undertaking equal in value to one-half of the aggregate amount paid by way of subsidy.  So that as far as I can see, the case might easily be worse than I suggested, that the amount of water might be ten times the amount of the shares representing the value of the undertaking held by the company, and in that case all the arguments I have been using are greatly reinforced, and the position then is that you would absolutely force your company into some fraudulent method of dealing with it; it would take care only to have five per cent. and to give the profits to the shareholders in some other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>But the shareholders would surely have some voice in the management then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if it is meant that the Government should take it over, I think they could do nothing but <Col N="1540" /> mess it.  I have no belief that at practically any stage in an industry like the sugar industry, the Government could make a success of it.  We must look as a return for our money, to the creation of the industry, just as public money had actually been spent in the erection of boot factories at present, and we are looking for nothing but the creation of boot factories.  We are looking for nothing but the creation of a sugar-beet factory, and in proportion as the first factory is successful, we will get better terms for the subsequent factories, if it would seem that the industry is capable of being established here.  I think we cannot look for any other returns except future factories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cooper has not bought a pair of boots for eighteen months; he has made his old boots do. But there is a great difference between a subsidy and a protective tariff.  The Minister for Finance must realise that a subsidy depletes the revenue and a protective tariff increases it.</P>

      <P>I hope that Deputy Johnson does not view this action of the Government in the light that the subsidy that is proposed to be paid is to be everlasting, or that it is not possible that the industry will be put on a permanent basis by the subsidy for ten years.  If, at the end of ten years of subsidising, the industry is not in a position to stand on its own legs, I say that the money that will have been expended by way of subsidy, will have done no permanent good.  I wonder do Deputies realise that the real question of the success or otherwise of this undertaking lies in the ability of the beet-manufactured sugar to compete in the market with cane sugar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  The Minister may be right in saying no, but I say the price of sugar in the world market is a factor, and that price is not made and will not be made for any one country for its home consumption. The price of sugar must and will be regulated by countries in a position to export sugar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is immaterial to the argument.  The growth of manufactured beet sugar in Europe throws an extra quantity of cane sugar on the market available for export.  The price they are prepared to take for their sugar is going to be the controlling factor for all other sugar produced. The whole point in this argument is that the world price must be the price in whatever factory you establish, that is the price which the exporting countries are prepared to sell their sugar at in the country to which they export it. That question is still to be decided to-day in every country in Europe.  That is the contest that is going on to-day in every country in Europe, and unless you, as well as the other countries that are producing beet sugar, are going to <Col N="1542" /> put a prohibitive tariff on cane sugar, and shut it out, the success of your beet-sugar factory lies in the world price of sugar.  I maintain that, even if the Minister for Agriculture argues that there is no difference.</P>

My contention is that at a certain stage in this industry, say at the end of ten years, the production of beet sugar having been subsidised in the meantime, if the factory is not prepared to carry on without a subsidy, the Government, as far as the amount for the subsidy for beet is concerned, have paid away something which may be of a temporary benefit, but is of no permanent good to the country at all.</P>
