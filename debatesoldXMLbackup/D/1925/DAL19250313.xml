      <P>The old age pension has been refused on three occasions in this case, on the ground of insufficient evidence to show that the claimant had attained the statutory age.  His baptismal certificate was not produced and he was recorded as 24 years old at his marriage on the 6th June, 1880.  An appeal on a new claim has just been received with a declaration from a neighbour stating that he has known the claimant for the past 70 years.  He has not mentioned any relevant fact in support of his belief.  As it is possible, however, that the claimant may have reached the statutory age, the papers are being referred to one of the Department's General Inspectors for local investigation.  A decision will be <Col N="1066" /> given on receipt of the inspector's report.</P>

      <P>The Fire Arms (Temporary Provisions) Act, passed last year, is due to expire on the 4th of next month.  It is my intention to introduce a Bill containing permanent provisions for the regulation of the possession of firearms and, in fact, a Bill for that purpose is already in draft, but as it contains proposals to consolidate the Gun Licence Act, 1870, and certain other enactments dealing with the issue of game certificates it could not conveniently be brought into effect until 1st August, as that is the end of the present licensing year for gun licences.  In the circumstances it seems more desirable to continue the existing temporary Act until 1st August.  I hope to introduce the permanent Bill at an early date, so that it can receive full discussion by the Dáil before 1st August.  The object of consolidation is in the interests of both public convenience and administrative convenience.  I therefore move for leave to introduce the Firearms (Temprary Provisions) (Continuance) Bill, 1925.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment which was carried in Committee deleted the figures &ldquo;1920&rdquo; and &ldquo;1927,&rdquo; and substituted therefor the figures &ldquo;1925&rdquo; and &ldquo;1930.&rdquo;  I do not know whether all the Deputies were in possession of all the facts in connection with this particular amendment.  In the first place, one Deputy, I think, in dealing with this amendment, made what was called a parallel in the case of sugar beet.  I do not understand how a parallel would be drawn.  I think it was stated that if the Government were disposed to subsidise the growing of sugar beet in the year 1925, and that persons had been growing sugar beet from 1920 until 1925, those persons would claim the subsidy from 1920 until 1925.  If that were a parallel there was really no parallel.  The case would be a parallel if it had been quoted in this connection&mdash;that if it were proposed to subsidise the growing of sugar <Col N="1069" /> beet in the County of Leix and that there were farmers in the County of Dublin who had been growing beet from 1920 to 1925, such farmers in Dublin would now claim to get the advantage which it was proposed to give to the farmers in Leix.  That would be a parallel.  In this case, if this amendment of the Seanad be accepted, you will reward any person who under the Shaw or Wood-Renton Commission has been awarded a sum for rebuilding, and who did not draw the sum and who did not rebuild, but put his 5 per cent. in his pocket during the last two or three years and is now rewarded for not being businesslike.</P>
      <P>That is the position.  During a period of stress, when Deputies on the opposite side were talking to us about employment and unemployment, and when other people were asking us what we were going to do to stimulate business, the persons who sat tight are now going to get a reward for doing so, and for refusing to be impressed with the case we made for stimulating business during these years, while others will be deprived of the advantages we are now going to give to the people who sat tight.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing for a moment that a man had sufficient sense of citizenship in 1923 to start re-building a house before the award was issued by the court, and had completed it, he gets no advantage, but the man who said: &ldquo;I will wait until I see what the court is going to do,&rdquo; and who has not started yet, is going to be made right, up to the year 1923.  I cannot understand how persons capable of understanding municipal finance can imagine for a moment that you can get back from the rates money that has been paid.  Once money is paid in rates it cannot be returned.  No return is proposed in the amendment made by the Seanad.  It only seeks to place in <Col N="1070" /> the same position persons who have constructed or reconstructed dwellings during the last three or five years, when, as was admitted, the cost of building was exceptionally high, as those who, perhaps, were more farseeing, who kept their money, and who now propose to reap the advantages provided by the amendment.  That is as far as the first section is concerned.</P>
      <P>In connection with one county it was put to us here that the amount involved, if this amendment were passed, would be £13,750 on the annual valuation. I may be wrong as regards the hundreds, but I am right as regards the thousands.  I have had the rateable valuation of that county examined for the present year, as compared with the year 1920, and the result is that, in Co. Mayo, the actual increase in valuation over that of 1920 is £2,820.  It may be that during these five years extraordinary damage was done in that county.  If that is so, it is also the case that there were public-spirited citizens in that county who re-built and gave employment during that bad period, and who laid out their money when there was no great return to be expected.  On the other hand, there are people whose property was destroyed who have not yet re-built, and whom the amendment will reward if what was done in Committee is accepted.  That is as regards the change of date from 1920 to 1925.  As regards the change from 1927 to 1930, I dwelt at some length, on the last occasion this matter was being discussed, on the usefulness and the advisability of seeing activity in building.  It is an industry that strikes the eye, and one observes activity if there is activity.  There is a sense of confidence, a sense of security, a sense of hopefulness in seeing activity in building.  If 1930 is inserted you are going to alter that sense of hopefulness. During the next five years we will be questioned from the far side of the House about the pressure that is going to be put on persons who have decrees and have not re-built; if they are putting their decision to do so on the long finger with a view to either a reduction in wages or the cost of materials. In my view that is not good business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.  It is unconfined in both directions.  It means that it would embrace all buildings save those excluded by a portion of the amendment.  I suppose I need not recite them for the Deputy.  The case made against this is that it is going to benefit certain institutions, certain industries, and certain buildings that have been put up by banks.  If it were thought that was unfair it is open to anyone to move an amendment in that connection.  Personally I might have given very careful consideration to such a proposal.  In my view the amount involved which any bank would save by reason of the passing of the amendment as it came from the Seanad, would be inconsiderable.  There is an attractiveness about this which appears to me to be very businesslike.  It indicates to persons who have had courage during the last couple of years, that there is consideration for those who had sufficient energy and foresight to have started building during that bad period. It is due to them, having invested considerable sums of money during that period, that they should not be placed in a worse position than those who waited until they saw whether or not the foundations of the State were firmly laid before they spent their money.</P>

      <P>A new section was inserted in the Bill in the Seanad.  That new section was considered in Committee, and an amendment was carried to the new section. The new section, as amended, is before Deputies in type.  The proposal is now: &ldquo;In sub-section (1), paragraph <i>(a)</i>, to delete the figures 1925 and 1930, and to insert the figures 1920 and 1927, respectively.&rdquo;  That amendment is before the Dáil.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is one thing that I have learned in the couple <Col N="1072" /> of years in which I have been in the Cabinet it is that there is no real, substantial difference between remission of taxation and a grant.  Time and again, I have heard the Minister for Finance emphasise that&mdash;that to remit taxation or to hold out, as an inducement, a remission of taxation, is the same thing as putting your hand down in the National Exchequer and handing out cash.  Therefore, we are dealing with a grant&mdash;and a very substantial grant &mdash;not, it is true, out of the National Exchequer, but out of the revenue of the local authorities and out of the pockets of the ratepayers.  It is with that well in mind that I would like Deputies to consider this amendment, in so far as the retrospective aspect which is sought to be introduced is concerned. We are dealing with a grant from the revenue of local authorities and from the pockets of the ratepayers. Now, vicarious generosity may seem an admirable thing, but we should approach this matter in just as hardheaded a spirit as if we were dealing with a grant out of the National Ex-chequer&mdash;out of the funds of the Government.  I want to know what the consideration is for this very substantial grant.  It is claimed that it is a good, a wise, and a proper thing to stimulate the building industry.  I agree.  It is claimed that it is a highly desirable thing that, within the next two or three years, there should be the maximum of activity in that trade.  I agree.  It is pointed out that increased housing is an urgent social need.  That, I think, is appreciated on all sides. But where does that come in, when you come to consider the retrospective aspect of this amendment?  The proposal is to give to people who have built within the last five years a very substantial windfall out of the pockets of the ratepayers, who are complaining clamorously that they are already overburdened with rates.  I stress the windfall aspect of the question.  These people have built.  Therefore, all that side of the argument which points to the desirability of increased activity in the building trade does not apply.  This is a windfall for those who have already built, who built without any reason to <Col N="1073" /> hope that they would receive a substantial bonus of this kind.</P>
      <P>The President queries my analogy about beet.  I said, in Committee, that this year the Government proposes to subsidise, through the county committees of agriculture, the growing of a certain acreage of beet.  I do not think any Deputy would stand for the proposal that, because of that, we are under any obligation to subsidise those who grew beet last year, or the year before, or any time over any period in the past.  It is simply a decision taken for good and sufficient reason, to be applied as from date.  It would not be a sound proposition, and would not, I think, meet with the approval of Deputies, if it were proposed that because it was desirable in the future to have a certain amount of beet grown in the country experimentally, that we should feel ourselves bound in any way to those who had so grown in the past.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced of the soundness of this retrospection with regard to this particular proposal, and I doubt very much if it would be put before the Dáil if the money had to come from taxation or from national revenue.  It is an easy thing to be generous at the expense of the local authorities.  It is an easy thing to be generous at the expense of the ratepayers, and to say: &ldquo;Let us reward the patriotic and philanthropic people who built for the last five years,&rdquo; although they built with no hope or expectation of any such reward.  I did not think this proposal would come before the Dáil, backed by any Minister&mdash; certainly, I would not visualise it being backed by the Minister for Finance&mdash;if it were a question of substantial subtraction from the national revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing need is there.  It is highly desirable to stimulate the building trade and the defence of this proposal, as it stands, is that a special bait or inducement is necessary.  If it were not necessary, I take it we would not be so foolish as to give it.  But we think it is necessary, and, therefore, we give it.  How does that apply to houses already built?  It does not apply, and the only argument for that is to stray away into realms of abstract justice and say: &ldquo;It would be a bad thing to have <Col N="1074" /> differentiation between the man who built last year or the year before or the year before that and the man who will build this year.&rdquo;  That principle would lead very far indeed. It would lead you to this point, that if for any time or any reason the Government or the Oireachtas found it necessary to offer an inducement to people to take a particular course, they should turn around to see who took that course in the past and mete out, on this high plane of abstract justice, with equal hands.  I do not agree with that.  Retrospective legislation is bad, whether you are seeking to impose penalties or to confer favours.  It is because I heard no reply to the criticisms put forward against that aspect of the amendments in Committee Stage that I voted for Deputy Johnson's amendment, deleting the retrospective character and aspect of the Seanad amendment.</P>
    <P>There is one matter on which I am inclined to agree with the President. He says, looking to the future, that to spread the thing out to 1930 might be diffusing and watering down the full effect&mdash;that you would only get the best and fullest effect by confining it to a short period of two or three years. As between 1927 and 1928, which Deputy Johnson is anxious to insert, I do not think there is very much difference. But extending the date to 1930 would be, perhaps, leaving too long a period and diffusing the full effect of this subsidy or inducement.  But nothing that was said in Committee, and nothing that has been said to-day, convinces me that it is a right or sound or proper course for us to put our hand deep down in the pocket of the ratepayer and pay out money&mdash;because, as I pointed out, this remission of rates is equivalent to a grant&mdash;to those who built last year, the year before, and every year back to 1920, with no reason to hope that they would receive any such windfall.  It is not, I believe, a sound thing to do.  It is not a hardheaded thing to do.  I do not believe we would do it if we were dealing with national revenue&mdash;if we were dealing with Government funds&mdash;and if we would not do it when dealing with Government funds, we should not do it <Col N="1075" /> just because we are dealing instead with the rates of the local authorities and with the money of the ratepayers.</P>

      <P>On the occasion of the last debate on this question, there were a few points about which Deputies did not appear to be at all clear.  First of all, they did not seem to be clear that an incentive was necessary to encourage people to build.  Let me say, as one that knows something of the building industry, that such an incentive is necessary.  The reason is that building costs in the Saorstát at present are exceedingly high&mdash;too high.  That is largely due to the fact that building wages in the Saorstát are the highest paid in Europe.  I will just give one example of that, and I should like my friends on the Labour benches to give some attention to this aspect of the question, because it is a very important aspect.  A bricklayer in Dublin to-day receives £4 2s. 6d. weekly.  His brother bricklayer in Manchester and Glasgow receives £3 13s. 4d. weekly.  I am not satisfied that for this large addition in wages we get any additional output.  In fact, the data that is constantly compiled leads one to think that we receive a lesser output for the larger wage than is given for the smaller wage in other places.  That being so, there is a well-founded impression abroad that building costs in the Saorstát are too inflated, and that that inflated figure cannot be maintained.  As long as that view is abroad, people who have money to put into building naturally come to the conclusion that they will be able to build more cheaply in the future. The consequence is that an incentive is necessary to induce people to embark on building at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having established that point, I would like to reply to a few aspects of the question put very fairly before us by the Minister for Justice.  He states &mdash;and states truly&mdash;that a remission of rates is really a grant-in-aid.  There is no necessity to argue that.  We concede that right off.  He says then, &ldquo;You are burthening the local authority, and where is the return to come from?&rdquo;  Let us consider that point, with the other point before our minds, <Col N="1076" /> that an incentive is necessary to get people to build.  That incentive is given by way of remission of rates. The Minister says: &ldquo;What return do we get for that?&rdquo;  We get a national return for it.  We get an immediate reduction in the amount that we are paying&mdash;and it is a very high figure&mdash; by way of unemployment grants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy say how that applies in the case of houses built as between 1920 and the present day, because I quite grant all the virtue of the argument with regard to future building?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not understand that.  I am glad that the Minister recognises that this remission of rates will mean a national reduction in the amount of the grant for unemployment. Therefore, in return for that remission we have a substantial reduction in unemployment grants.  Let us come to the question the Minister has just mentioned&mdash;where do we gain by making this Act retrospective?  The President cleared up one point this afternoon that it was very essential should be cleared up&mdash;that is, that once rates are paid no claim can be made for a refund. No rates will be refunded.  Now, where is any benefit conferred on those who have built, by making this Act retrospective? Recollect that up to the present the only benefit under this Act is a remission of rates.  Those rates have been paid by those who had their buildings completed.  There can be no refund of those rates.  Where is any benefit conferred on those people by making this Bill retrospective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The benefit is this that if you do not make the section retrospective they get no money back that they have paid up to the present.  After the passing of this Bill they get no benefit by the fact that it was made retrospective.  But they do get benefit in the future, and it is only in the future that they do get benefit.  They could not be included at all under this Bill if it had not been made retrospective.  It is only that they may get an equivalent benefit to <Col N="1077" /> these others who come in under this Bill that the section is made retrospective. Now, may I make that point clear, because it may not be clear to the Deputies?  A man builds.  I will not take a house as an example.  I will take an ordinary factory.  I am afraid that amongst the items about which there is an amount of ambiguity in connection with this Bill is the question of its application to house-building.  Now, there are very few houses to which this Bill will apply at all.  I am glad that the President dealt with the question that was raised by the Deputy about the effect on the rates on the buildings that had been erected in the West.  I am quite sure that the Deputy was discussing that from a want of knowledge of this Bill.  There are very few houses, as one may see by reference to this amendment; at all events, very few dwelling-houses, which will derive any benefit at all or come under this particular amendment.  Therefore, I say let us take the case of a building that was erected in 1921 here in our City, one of the many large buildings which give a considerable amount of employment in the City.  That building was finished, say, in the year 1922, or in the year 1923, and it paid rates in accordance with the valuation, each year up to the present.  Now, in making this Bill retrospective, and making its application retrospective, so as to apply to this building, it does not confer any retrospective benefit on this building. That is the point I want to make quite clear.  Those rates have been paid and no refund can be claimed.  Consequently from the retrospective proposal they cannot get anything.  What they can get is that the burden will be reduced from the full quota of taxes or rates to one-third.  Under this amendment they rank in the same position with the building started in this year. Now, that is only fair.</P>
    <P>I think everybody will agree that those people who built, as I said on a previous occasion, when there was not at all the same encouragement to build as there is to-day, are deserving of some encouragement.  These people had to incur an amount of liability that those building to-day will not have to incur. I am quite satisfied that in the case of these people who took their courage in <Col N="1078" /> both hands and spent large sums of money, when the situation looked very much darker than to-day, the Dáil will not place them at any disadvantage as compared with the person who starts to-day.  The person who built to-day can have his building erected at 25 per cent. less than the man who built in 1921.  If you take as an example a building costing £20,000 in 1921, that same building can be erected to-day for £15,000.  Consequently the business that is carried on in that building erected in 1921 has to carry a burden of capital and pay on that burden to the extent of 25 per cent. over that erected to-day.  If, on top of that, you were to give a remission of rates to the man who erects his building to-day, and who carries a burden 25 per cent. less than the man who erected his building in 1921&mdash;if you were to give him this remission in rates and not give it to the man who erected the building in 1921&mdash;you would confer an enormous advantage on the man who was erecting his building to-day. Under this Bill he would be only paying 33 per cent. of the rates paid by the man who put up his building in 1921. Now, I ask you is that fair?  This clause being made retrospective enables that man to come in and claim that remission from to-day, and puts him in that respect on a level with the man who erects the building to-day.  He gets no remission of any monies paid in the past by reason of this amendment being made retrospective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has further pointed out that it is very easy for us to be generous at other people's expense, meaning thereby that we are passing a Bill which will reduce the income of the local authorities.  I <Col N="1079" /> do not know whether I am right in taking what he said to mean that.  I gather that that is what was in the Minister's mind.  Is that really so? Are we taking from the local authorities something that they really had? Let me illustrate this particular point by one of our tobacco factories.  We were all delighted to see those factories rising up in our city, and to see large numbers of our young people finding in them excellent employment.</P>
      <P>One of these factories that I have in my mind&mdash;and it is true of more than one of them&mdash;was erected on a cabbage field.  What rates did the local authority derive from that agricultural holding on which that tobacco factory was erected?  I am sure they were very nominal.  To-day a factory is erected there which cost a quarter of a million of money.  I have no idea at all what the valuation of that factory would be, but it will run into some thousands, and the local authority will receive 33 per cent. of the rates on that valuation under this amendment.  I am sure that 33 per cent. would represent a great many times the rates paid by that agricultural holding.  The local authority in that particular case, and I can speak of two of them, has been under no additional expense whatever in connection with the factory.  It receives even under the amendment a large increase by way of rates.  Now that is not the only advantage that the local authority will receive.  In addition to paying these rates, this factory will take a very considerable amount of electric current.  That means revenue for the local authority. That factory will, in addition, take a considerable amount of water from the local authority.  That means revenue for the local authority.  I would ask the Minister, in view of these facts, to tell us where we are taking something under this amendment from the local authority.  I am quite satisfied that in the instances I have mentioned&mdash;and I hope they are fair instances&mdash;we are taking nothing from the local authority.</P>

      <P>I want to be quite fair. I was dealing with the point the Minister has raised.  I said the interpretation I put on that was that you are taking something from the local authority. I hold that under this amendment you are giving something to the local authority, because if you offer this inducement you will get other people to do as those who have built have done.  That, I hold, even under this amendment whereby local authorities would only get one-third of the rates, is a benefit to the local authorities.

      <P>Quite a good argument may be raised, that the local authority would get more benefit if there was no such amendment passed.  They certainly will from buildings already erected.  But that argument cannot be used in connection with buildings which might be erected, but which there is no incentive to erect.  Let us be fair about this matter.  Every building erected is a benefit from many points of view.  It is a national benefit from the point of view of reducing unemployment. It is a benefit to the local authority from the point of view that it means an accession of income.  So I am satisfied, from whatever point of view this matter is looked at, that you can only arrive at one conclusion, that it is a proposal that ought to be supported, and I hope it will meet with the approval of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy Good on matters affecting the building trade is illuminating and informative. It is generally admitted that there is no Deputy who knows so much about the building trade, its conditions and its prospects as Deputy Good.  Consequently, I am tempted to exclaim after his speech, in the words of a familiar pantomime song: &ldquo;The whole discovery now found out!&rdquo;&ldquo;The building trade needs an incentive&rdquo;: that is the summary of the purpose and spirit that inspires this amendment. It is in the interest of encouraging the building trade that it is recommended to the Dáil.  The building trade needs incentive?  True.  Why not provide it with the very natural incentive&mdash;get down the cost of building? For Deputy Good, true to the instincts of his class, there is only one method of reducing the cost of building, and that is to get down the workmen's wages.  What about the contractors' profits?  What about the cost of materials?  Let us operate upon these first, and automatically wages will come down when the cost of living has been reduced.  Meanwhile, because the contractors and the vendors of materials are inexorable, must the ratepayers pay for it?  Let the ratepayers come to the relief, let the local authority dispense with two-thirds of the local rate in order that there may be more enterprise, more money, put into building, and more big contracts for the big contractors.  I think we have now got down to bedrock in that: we are to subsidise the building contractor&mdash;that is what it comes to&mdash;subsidise the building trade, not out of the national revenues but out of the local authorities' takings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Good has managed to confuse and, with all respect to the President, I think he, too, has occasionally contrived to confuse, the retrospective reference and the future reduction.  It is quite obvious that if rates are remitted in regard to future buildings it will undoubtedly stimulate the investment of capital in buildings, in factories, places of industry, and the rest. That is unquestionable.  But how is this to operate where it is the case of remission on buildings already put up? <Col N="1082" /> Deputy Good's method was the method of the advocate: to excite sentiment, various emotions, in regard to things already done, so as to make us believe that it would be a generous thing, be a fine gesture to say: &ldquo;Remit the rates with regard to these commitments.&rdquo;  No doubt it would be a delightful thing, a source of joy, comfort, and satisfaction to those who built in 1920 and 1921 suddenly to find that their annual overhead charges are to be reduced in this substantial fashion.  I may drop into poetry again, a poetical quotation this time from an American writer, whose name, unfortunately, is unknown:</P>
    <P>Upon this bald old earth of sin,</P>
    <P>There's naught can make one holler, Like finding in a last year's vest</P>
    <P>A last year's unspent dollar.</P>
    <P>To find that one's possessions are greater than one calculated, that one comes out with a <i>plus</i> in an unexpected fashion is highly gratifying to everyone, not merely to the Wilkins Micawbers of the earth but to men in business on a large scale.</P>
    <P>Now I repeat the point I made when this was debated a few days ago.  Let us be clear in our minds as regards buildings already erected.  They come under two categories.  They were built at a time when building was very expensive, when things were not so stabilised as they have now become, when the risk to capital was exceedingly grave, and when it required great courage and great confidence in one's business capacity to invest more capital and to commit one's self to an extension of business.  Now some of those conceivably did not meet with the business reward that their enterprise and courage merited.  Others of them unquestionably did.</P>

      <P>I am sure I could retort equally that one case is no proof.  I have put the case that there are two categories, presumably.  Now the President would give me a list.  So much the better.  If he introduces a motion into this House to come to the relief of those people who seek relief because they were doing a national benefit as well as conferring a private gain upon themselves, though they failed to a measurable extent, I will vote for it.  I will vote for every subsidy that the State proposes to tide business over a difficult moment, and to enable it to get secure on its feet again, but I repeat, that case is not put up on the present occasion.  There are all sorts of other things put up.  Deputy Good and the President both tell us that we will encourage people to put money into building.  How?  If they find that those who put money into building will be rewarded.  Why should they be rewarded any more than any other man who embarks upon an enterprise in the hope of gain?  It was not for philanthropy; it was not through patriotism, but it was because they saw a good opening and believed that they could carry their enterprise through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am willing to admit that there were some, although I have not heard of them, who were inspired not merely by their business knowledge and their business capacity, but who thought that it would be a good thing, even if they did incur loss, to keep things going, to provide employment and to show their confidence in the future of the State.  There may have been such men, but they have not come asking relief, and yet on the assumption that <Col N="1084" /> there are such men who took advantage&mdash;I am not using the word &ldquo;advantage&rdquo; in the favourable sense&mdash;of the openings that they thought they saw, plunged in and got through they are now to be rewarded.  In England they have a better method of rewarding things of that kind.  There is the O.B.E. for the managing director or for the chairman of the Board, but as we are an agricultural country, and if the Constitution would allow it, we might confer the Order of the Good Egg instead of the Order of the Bad Egg on those who had brought things through to a successful accomplishment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good put up the only argument that has even the character of speciousness about it on behalf of this. He points out what, of course, is obvious, that on buildings already put up rates have been paid, and that there can be no refund of those rates.  Rates once paid are like water that flows under the bridge.  The only aid, therefore, he says can be to give an equivalent benefit in future, that is setting out from the passing of this Act.  That is a specious case&mdash;to put them level, as from this date, with others who only begin to build at a period later than themselves.  But that, again, postulates that they are entitled to relief.  That is the flaw in Deputy Good's argument which obviously he was not aware of or he would not have pressed it upon us as a sound argument.  Let us assume that those people are entitled to relief. Then, unquestionably, the relief should begin for them as from the passing of this Act, but what has got to be shown, and has not been shown, is that relief of this type should be extended to them at all.  The argument is childish, therefore, when examined.  The Minister for Justice put the right name on this thing when he spoke of abstract justice.  It is an effort to do equity, and it is confusing two very different things, the function of the charitable individual and the function of a Government. The individual may give alms, the individual may be generous with his own money, but it certainly is not the function of Government, on behalf of the State, to give doles to successful business men and that precisely at the moment when doles to the <Col N="1085" /> helpless have to be reduced in the name of national economy.</P>
    <P>There is one productive class in the community which I contend is the only productive class when all is said and done, and that is the teacher.  We have been obliged to reduce the remuneration of the teachers in the primary schools and to count the sixpences as regards the remuneration and grants-in-aid of teachers in the secondary schools.  These great successful businesses with huge capital invested in them, would be factories with great prospects for the future; they are to be relieved of paying rates.  Deputy Good says that a tobacco factory that he has in his mind was set up in a cabbage field.  Of course he did not mean to suggest that the cabbage leaf was to come to the assistance of the tobacco leaf, as it sometimes does in the making of so-called Havanas, but he was pointing out that had the cabbage field remained in the possession of the market gardener, the rate yield on it would have been considerably less than when it is turned instead into a site for a tobacco factory.  He argues from that, that now the local authority has benefited by the erection of the factory. It was not necessary to tell us that.  It is very obvious.  He says, therefore, that the local authority, being benefited by the greater yield of rates in this respect, will suffer no loss if the greater yield of rates is reduced.  In other words, if one-third of the rates upon the factory are greater than the total undiminished rate payable out of the cabbage field, then the local authority is no worse.  The answer to that is very obvious.  It is true that the local authority is so much the better if the rate yielded by the one-third payable on the factory is greater than what it would have been on the ordinary yield had it not been built.  What Deputy Good asks us to forget is what would be the yield if the two-thirds were not deducted but the three-thirds were paid.  That is what he conveniently overlooks and expects us under the blandishments of his arguments and his authority as a building specialist to forget.</P>
    <P>By all means give an incentive to enterprise.  But that is no argument <Col N="1086" /> whatsoever because it never even touches, although it professes to touch, the retrospective element, and it is to that retrospective element that we object. I do not understand at all, though of course that is no reason why it should not be true, how Deputy Good arrives at the statement that building is 25 per cent. less than what it was.  I am a very diligent reader of the &ldquo;Irish Times,&rdquo; and particularly of its fortnightly supplement in regard to building.  Last Thursday there was very admirable reading in regard to this point in the &ldquo;Irish Times.&rdquo;  It showed that in the last month the cost of building had gone up with a bound very considerably in England, and I presume it is not coming down consequently in Ireland.</P>

      <P>May I remind the Deputy that the cost of building what is called an artisan's dwelling in 1922, which was slightly lower than in 1920, was £750.  If the Deputy looks at last year's Building Facilities Act he will find that the price specified was somewhere about £600, a reduction of exactly 20 per cent.</P>

      <P>I am quite aware of all that.  I have studied all these matters very diligently, and in the last fortnight I have restudied them, being personally interested in them, and that does not interfere with the authority that I quoted.  It is not as if in my own person I launched it out as a statement of my own invention. I have given the authority and it can be consulted.  It is an argument which is more or less beside the point. With regard to the cost of building, arising out of wages, that is a case in which Deputy Good misses the point. He says bricklayers' wages in Dublin are £4 2s. 6d., and in Manchester £3 13s. 6d.  Very good.  What is the cost of living in Manchester?  And <Col N="1087" /> what is the cost of living in Dublin? Surely we are not to leave the consideration of important factors like that out of account.  Usually the device of the advocate is to isolate one particular aspect from the total.  We are dealing not with Manchester; we are dealing with an Irish town and the conditions that prevail there.  It was in that connection that I quoted the &ldquo;Irish Times,&rdquo; showing how the cost of building is going up in England, which is favourably circumstanced.  I do not know what the facts are in regard to last month in Ireland, but we should be entitled to infer that they did not go down in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I think if, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I may repeat what I said, we have quite enough to do with the moneys raised either by local rates or national taxation without beginning to follow ideals of noble generosity. We cannot afford it.  It might be magnificent, but it is not politics, and it certainly is not business.  When we have got the various institutions set up, and perfected, that are necessary for the future betterment of the country, we may begin to repair inequalities in this fashion, but the hour has not yet come for that.</P>

      <P>I should like to bring the debate strictly back within the limits of the proposal definitely before the Dáil, and, in doing so, I desire to say that one word has been used by the majority of the speakers that I think is not wholly applicable to the proposal that has come down in the amendment&mdash;that word is &ldquo;retrospective.&rdquo; The Minister for Justice built <Col N="1088" /> the whole of his case, impliedly, upon the just use of that word, and I venture to say the use of that word in respect of this particular proposal is not just.  It is not just for this reason: that the application of the benefits will not be applications in respect of past years.  It will only apply in respect of future years, but will apply in respect of past buildings; the benefit itself is not retrospective benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy during his speech, and I hope he will allow me to go ahead with mine without interruption.  Take the case the Minister for Justice used &mdash;the famous beet illustration.  He said that the Government proposed to give a certain bonus in respect of acreage devoted in future to beet.  And then he asked the question, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Because that benefit is being given in respect of acreage devoted in the future to beet, and the same benefit is to be conferred&mdash;these are his words&mdash; on those who grew beet last year or the year before.  Now that is exactly what the Government is going to do in respect to beet.  It will not confer that benefit, it is perfectly true, in respect of the actual amount of beet that was grown last year, but it will not preclude the person who started to grow beet two years ago from the benefits for the growing of beet in subsequent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will say to the grower of beet next year, or the year after: &ldquo;No matter whether you start to-day or started four years ago, the benefits that are now available will be available impartially for all.&rdquo;  That is not retrospective benefit, and it could not accurately be so called.  Bring the application of that particular instance down to another matter and then it will be seen exactly why the proposal from the Seanad is a just and fair proposal to place before this Dáil.  Come to the case of Balbriggan.  If the Minister for Justice were to succeed in overthrowing the amendment from the Dáil the result would be that Balbriggan would not be able to benefit from any rebate in rates.  Consider this: Supposing in the same county another <Col N="1089" /> factory were to be established for exactly the same purpose and that factory were to be established to-morrow, and supposing you built exactly the same amount of buildings and put exactly the same amount of cost into the erection of that new factory, that new factory would, by virtue of being built to-morrow, be able to claim against the Balbriggan factory on a certain benefit amounting to two-thirds of the rates paid by the Balbriggan one.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to answer these mathematical questions that are suddenly hurled at me.  If the Deputy has an answer to his conundrum I am perfectly willing to wait now and hear it.  The Deputy will work out his answer.  The point I am putting is this: The Minister for Justice stated that the proposal was one of abstract justice.  That plea was supported by Deputy Professor Magennis, who said that we had no time for such abstract justice, we had no money for it.  I put forward this to the Dáil, that we are not concerned with the question of abstract justice.  If the proposal were to do what is impossible to do, and that is to give back moneys in respect of past years' rates, then it might be possible to say that a question of abstract justice was involved. What is involved is a question of absolute justice in respect of future years, and I give the Balbriggan instance again.  If a new factory of the same kind, and of the same cost as Balbriggan, were to be erected, the existing factory at Balbriggan would be handicapped in its future operations to the extent of two-thirds the amount of rates that it pays, and consequently the new factory would be able to compete against it with that amount of advantage.</P>

      <P>Take any particular instance, any factory that has been built between 1920 and 1925. The Deputy will not deny that there have been businesses erected in that period.  Otherwise his opposition to the amendment amounts to nothing. Take any particular one, and supposing a competitor to that particular one were to be created within the next twelve months, why should that competitor be equipped with this additional advantage over its rival, having regard to the fact that the rival built at a time when building costs were higher than they are to-day, as though that were not in itself quite a sufficient handicap? That is why I say that when the Minister talks about abstract justice his words might be true if they applied in respect of returns and rebates for past years.  But having regard to the fact that they only apply to remission for future years, it is not a question of abstract justice, but a question of absolute justice, and the illustration he chose from the sugar beet industry is an absolute proof of that, because the Government themselves intend to do in respect of sugar beet exactly what the Seanad's amendment proposes to do in respect of buildings, that is to say, the Government next year, in giving certain benefits to persons who put acreage under sugar beet, will not preclude from benefit persons because of the fact that they started to grow sugar beet in 1920.  They will say: &ldquo;No matter when you began the business, in the application of that business, year by year, for future years you will all be exactly the same, and we will not give benefits to one that we withhold from another, and so put one in a position of having an unfair trade advantage over another.&rdquo;  It is for that reason that I am supporting the Seanad's amendment, and why I think the Dáil would be well advised to accept the Seanad's proposal and reject its own proposal that has come up before it from Committee.  There is only one matter that I would like to add, and it is to answer the question of the Minister for Justice.  He says: &ldquo;What is the consideration?&rdquo;  Well, if it be true, as I have suggested that it is true, that we are not talking about abstract justice, but we are <Col N="1091" /> talking about absolute justice in respect of future trading, then the question of consideration is one that does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It was admitted that this remission took the form of a grant, and was in effect a grant.  The Minister's question was: Was there a consideration for that grant?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree. Then the question of consideration arises in one particular case in respect of buildings that are to be built, but in so far as it applies to other buildings so as to place them all on the same level, and to give them absolute and impartial justice in respect of future trading, then I say that the question of consideration does not arise.  Questions of consideration are never involved in matters of justice and equity.  It would be a very extraordinary and remarkable thing if one were to hear a judge being asked to make a decision, that when a certain judgement was asked from him on grounds of equity he were to turn round and reply: &ldquo;Yes, but what is the consideration?&rdquo;  No, the question of consideration does not apply, and I suggest that the effect of the word &ldquo;retrospective&rdquo; also does not apply, that the benefit is not retrospective benefit, that the benefit is one for the future, and is of a kind calculated to put people who built during the past four years on the same basis as those who will build in the future as a matter of justice, in order that it shall not be said that one person shall by the State be given a trading advantage over another person, or one corporation be given a trading advantage over another corporation, seeing that both of them incurred risks during one common period of high risks in undertaking operations of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the Seanad amendment.  I find an overwhelming argument for that in the feeling that the legislation proposed here is legislation that should have been enacted before this.  I remember the time in July, 1922, when hostilities in Dublin had ceased, our motto was that O'Connell Street must <Col N="1092" /> be rebuilt inside 12 months, but unfortunately I suppose we never got sufficiently focussed on that question, or had energy enough to bring that desirable state of affairs about.  The idea was that O'Connell Street should be rebuilt within 12 months as a very effective way of getting back to normal, and I feel that if legislation along these lines had been possible to give facilities for new buildings a couple of years ago, the effect would have been very good.  Looking at matters as from to-day, and looking forward with the idea in our minds that buildings recently built should receive more benefit from the relaxation of rates, I think we must be all convinced that legislation such as this should have been passed a couple of years ago, and that consideration of that ought to make us give any relief we can to those people who did actually build during those years.  There is a natural lag in legislation, and while that is not an argument for all legislation being retrospective, in some sense I feel that in view of the particular circumstances in the building trade, and the particular general circumstances of the last two years, we should not enact legislation dealing with the building trade now that would not take into consideration the last couple of years, and give some relief to those people who gave employment and spent money on building at that particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Figgis has emphasised a point which must be very obvious, that is, that we are providing relief in the future for houses that were built&mdash;retrospectively, if you like.  In the matter of that relief I do not think it is right to say that the giving of relief in this particular way is taking money out of the pockets of the ratepayers.  At any rate, that is painting the picture in a light which is really not quite correct. As I understand it, the houses that have been built during the last four years have got a certain valuation, and compared house to house with those already existing, their valuation, I understand, is about one-and-a-half times the valuation of houses of that particular type in the immediate vicinity previously built.  Houses that have been built during the last four <Col N="1093" /> years are paying rates at a valuation half as great again as the houses standing around them of the same value have been paying, and the relief that we are giving&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Two-thirds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Two-thirds.  And in estimating what you are getting for the two-thirds you have to consider that you have already got one-half as much as an equivalent building would have brought you in during whatever year up to the present rates have been paid on it, and that you are giving that relief, or you should be giving that relief, to houses built during that particular time, that would have been given if this particular legislation had been passed a couple of years ago. From another point of view it is not taking money out of other people's pockets, because you have to take into consideration that even during a period of very considerable difficulty, and very considerable want of confidence from the point of view of spending money, the persons who put up these houses have increased the valuation of their own areas, and the places are more valuable now, and will be more valuable in the future, than they would have been if these houses had not been put up.  On the general question of giving a certain amount of relief for new buildings, we have seen that when railway companies desire to develop a particular suburban area they give free railway passes in respect of all new houses erected in these areas for a particular period of years.  As far as I know, legislation has recently been introduced into Italy giving very great relief for all new buildings, with very great stimulation to building.</P>

      <P>Well I hope the point I have made that this legislation should have been passed a couple of years ago will not be lost on the Dáil. We do require a very definite stimulation of our building industry, and we will require to stimulate it more and more during the next two or three years in order to take the industry from the very dull state in which it is at present, and bring the machinery to <Col N="1094" /> the very necessary work of giving us a greatly increased number of homes for our people.  The main point I wish to make is that relief for houses built previously should really be given, because this legislation should have been passed a couple of years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCULLOUGH</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the Seanad amendment, and I am very strongly of opinion that this House should give that amendment its approval.  I think those who listened to Deputy Figgis will realise, and he put it very clearly, that this is not a matter in respect of which any claim can be made for generosity, provided the Dáil approves of the Seanad amendment. It is a matter of absolute justice, a matter regarding which the Dáil should not hesitate for a moment to give its approval I do not think that even if the State were generous it could be held blameworthy in the matter.  In particular the owners of houses that were destroyed and who rebuilt them need generosity from the State, for they were the sufferers throughout this matter for the whole body of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Magennis used very strong arguments against this amendment.  I suppose he was enthused by the applause he received from the opposite benches.  All his arguments, like the arguments of the Minister for Justice, were, in my opinion, directed more against the whole spirit of the amendment giving a remission of taxation to those who built houses.  The State cannot afford to be unjust.  When I say unjust, I mean unjust to those who took chances in the years that have passed. I think it would be a decided injustice &mdash;and I do not think that even the Minister who has spoken against the amendment, or even Deputy Magennis, would agree to it&mdash;to exclude those who displayed their courage by taking chances, notwithstanding the disabilities that existed in the matter of building. They put up property, whatever the motives underlying their action may have been.  There are very few of those, I am afraid, who were moved by altruistic motives.  But those who did build will now be placed in the very disadvantageous position that they will have to compete with those whom Deputy Magennis termed bad eggs.  I <Col N="1095" /> think Father O'Flanagan used a different word the other evening.</P>
    <P>Those who waited until they saw the clouds had drifted past somewhat before they erected their premises, will now, under this enactment, get the advantage of the remission of two-thirds of the rates.  That may not seem a great deal, but industry is to-day in such a sluggish condition that it will mean a very considerable advantage to those firms to get the remission.  The larger they are, the bigger the advantage, because the bigger the rateable value of the premises will be.  It will be a big advantage for those people against their competitors, who, perhaps, were better citizens and better friends of the State.  They were, incidentally, the friends of the ratepayers and of the working classes engaged in the building trades, when they erected buildings in the years that have passed.  I think it is merely an appeal to the cupidity of people, and particularly of those who are representatives on public boards, to ask them to do this injustice, for it is an injustice, to those who took their courage in their hands when the atmosphere was not favourable to prospects of the kind, and built the houses that are to-day in use, and gave the advantage to those who waited.</P>
    <P>I think it is putting too big a burden on those people and it is imposing on them unfair competition.  They built the houses in the past, and now you are giving remission of rates to those who build from now on.  I think those who built in the years that have passed should be placed on an equal footing and should be given a remission of rates.  I do not think the Deputies should be a party to what is really an act of injustice.  The country can well afford to be as generous to those who built in the difficult years, and especially to those whose houses were destroyed and who were really the unlucky ones.  By the destruction of their houses they were placed in the position of suffering for the whole body of citizens in this country.</P>

I did not, and I do not intend to, call anyone a bad egg.  I did refer to the O.B.E., which is jocosely interpreted to mean, by Englishmen, the Order of the Bad Egg.  I gave as a parallel that whereas in England the individual is rewarded for conspicuous services with the O.B.E., we might, perhaps, if the Constitution allowed us, give those who built houses in the difficult period the Order of the O.G.E., or the Order of the Good Egg.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been some extraordinary principles advocated here to-day.  The most extraordinary was, I think, that it is incumbent on the legislative authority to impose upon a local authority the obligation of equalising the burden upon an industry by a variation in the rates according to the amount of capital, and the cost of the establishment of an industry in the particular area in which it would be set up.  Certain industrial companies started to build, say, in April, 1920, instead of January, 1920, and because they finished within the period 1920-25, when prices would be higher than in the period 1925-28, or 1930, 1933 or 1940, the suggestion is that the rates must be used as an equalising factor.  The local authorities must come to the aid of those companies by equalising the effect of the variation in currency rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked that the local authority should come along to the aid of the manufacturer who happened to invest at a time when prices were high, so as to meet the competition of those who waited and who were able to purchase necessaries for their establishment at a time of low prices.  That is a proposition which, I think, is a most extraordinary one to come from anyone in business.  It is put forward here, and I would like to re-emphasise that this proposal was not in the Bill which left the Dáil.  So far as the charge of injustice that Deputy McCullough made is concerned, he, as a member of the Dáil, has to bear part of the responsibility for allowing to go from the House a measure which would perpetuate an injustice.  Apparently he is <Col N="1097" /> only now awaking to the fact that this injustice has been law and that it is now intended to remedy this injustice in so far as it affects those persons who started to put up buildings in 1920 and finished in 1923.  The injustice that began before 1920 must continue. The injustice may continue after 1933, but between these times the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Deputy has not taken the responsibility of voting against the Seanad amendment <i>in toto.</i> My own inclination would be to support him if he did.  I am just as cowardly as he is in this matter, because I am not prepared to take the responsibility of saying to the building trades of the country that this inducement on future building should not be given in face of the statement made on the authority of the President and the Minister for Local Government, that such an inducement is required.  They tell us that such an inducement for future building is necessary.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared, in face of that statement, to say: &ldquo;No, I am not going to assist in making this gift to future builders,&rdquo; but so far as past building is concerned I am objecting to making this grant.  The position under this amendment from the Seanad should be restated.  There are certain buildings which were detroyed in 1916 and the reconstruction of which has taken place.  I am speaking at the moment of Dublin.  These buildings, though probably in many cases greatly improved and though they would be subject to revaluation on a much higher valuation than the pre-1916 valuation, are under the law exempt from revaluation until 1929. <Col N="1098" /> Now, the amendment of the Seanad proposes that when the valuation is brought up-to-date, in 1929, the occupier for the four succeeding years shall be only required to pay one-third of the rates.  That is as it affects the reconstruction in O'Connell Street, of the damage done in 1916.  Then we have the damage done in 1920.  The new buildings are exempt from revaluation until 1930; they are paying on the old valuation.  It is now proposed by this amendment to reduce the amount payable in rates to one-third of the new valuation for the three years succeeding 1930.  That is in respect of Dublin damage in 1916 and 1920.  Then we have other buildings which are not affected by either of these enactments, valued in the ordinary way.  The amendment of the Seanad proposes that the occupiers shall pay only one-third of the rates from 1926 until 1933, a period of seven years, and that that remission is to apply to all premises built since 1920.  The proposal does not affect specifically and solely buildings erected on sites where damage had been done, owing to the conflicts either during the British regime or during the civil war. Most of the arguments that have any validity have been used on the assumption that we were dealing only in this with reconstructed premises where there had been destruction owing to the civil strife.  There has been no proposal from the Seanad or from the Ministry to make this exemption applicable to such premises and possibly for the very good reason that the awards that were made were made on the cost of reconstruction at recent prices.  That is the reason that the Ministry has not proposed such an amendment as the Seanad has sent forward, to affect these premises which were reconstructed in the circumstances I have touched upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Good has told us that the number of dwelling-houses effected by this amendment of the Seanad is comparatively small, negligible almost, but people are talking as though you were penalising the occupiers of these houses and these people who took risks and built houses which at the time did not seem to be profitable.  I think Deputy Good's contribution on that point has helped to clear some of the misconceptions. <Col N="1099" /> I repeat that the effect of the amendment of the Seanad is to relieve of rates factories that had been built within this period, factories which were not built out of any desire to stimulate industry or building, not out of any altruistic motive whatever, but for the profitable investment of surplus monies derived out of high profits made during the period of the war.</P>

      <P>There has been no proposal from Deputy Figgis or any other Deputy that other classes of manufacturers or industrialists whose business did not require a large expenditure on building but required a large expenditure on machinery, for instance, should be relieved of anything because of the fact that they invested at the time of the high cost of machinery.  Only buildings are to be relieved under this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal is to insert in a Local Government Bill, a Bill dealing with the administration of local affairs, an amendment which is foreign to the purpose of the Bill, making a fiscal change affecting one very small section of the community. So far as factories are concerned, there have been a few factories built during this period, built not with a view to serving the public interest, not with a view to stimulating the building industry, but for the benefit of the manufacturers, who own these factories. The buildings which are mainly affected and the persons who are mainly beneficiaries under this section are the proprietors of banks, who have been confessedly making very heavy profits during these years out of other people's losses, and the proprietors of multiple shops and distributors <Col N="1100" /> of that kind.  That is the kind of person and the kind of institution which is mainly getting the benefit of this section.  Deputy Good spent a good deal of time to show us, taking the illustration of a tobacco factory, that under this section local authorities are going to benefit, that nothing is being taken from the local authority.  Deputy Mulcahy also made a contribution to that effect, that nothing has been taken from the local authority.</P>
      <P>If on a tobacco factory that was built last year, or the year before, rates have to be paid to the Dublin Corporation to the extent of £200, and by this enactment they were reduced to £65 or £70, or whatever the amount may be, you may not be taking the money from the local authority but you are preventing it going into their coffers, which is very nearly the same thing. Then we have the argument that by passing this enactment, so far as the future is concerned, you are likely to stimulate building.  I have admitted, on the authority of the information at the disposal of the Minister, that it requires this kind of stimulus to induce future building.</P>

      <P>I will deal with that in a minute or two.  What was the procedure adopted by the President a few months ago when we were dealing with the Housing Facilities Act?  We introduced a clause at his instigation enabling local authorities to remit rates for a period of years, and when they wanted to stimulate building, generally to add to the area of valuation.  We are not doing anything of that kind in this instance.  We are not suggesting to the local authorities that they may, if they wish, remit taxation on new banks, factories and shops.  We are telling them that they must, which is entirely different.  Are we to be the judges whether a local authority in such and such a place ought to encourage the building of this, that or the other structure, or that if they allowed such building to be erected in the past they must remit rates?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not, then again the local authority is to be called upon to adjust the burden on the manufacturer. It is the local authorities that are to be the equalising force, and rates are to be used to enable the profits of manufacturers to be regularly five, six or seven per cent.  The Minister for Finance may have a view upon that.  I cannot refrain from following Deputy Good into his pet subject of bricklayers. Bricklayers, poor bricklayers, are receiving £4 2s. 6d. a week in Dublin and £3 13s. 4d. in Manchester.  Is it Deputy Good's desire that Manchester bricklayers should have their wages raised to £4 2s. 6d. because they are competing with Dublin bricklayers?  As Deputy Magennis pointed out, there is 9/2 in the difference in the rate for a bricklayer who works a full week, and he also suggested, and I think it could easily be substantiated, that £3 13s. 4d. in Manchester would purchase more commodities of a similar quality there than £4 2s. 6d. would in Dublin.  The poor bricklayer is always brought forward in an argument on these matters. I took some trouble recently to get some figures.  The President told us that houses were built at a cost of £750 each.  The bricklaying cost, however, the wages of the skilled operator, who gets £4 2s. 6d. a week, amount only to £30 out of the £750.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that is so.  It has always been round about 50 per cent. of the total cost.  The bricklayer is a poor man who has always thrown at him his own bricks.  It is, we are told, the Dublin bricklayer who is responsible for the high cost of building. The Waterford bricklayer is paid 3½d per hour less than the Dublin bricklayer, and the Wexford bricklayer from 3½d. to 4d. per hour less.  Has the building trade been so active and prosperous in Waterford and Wexford, as compared with Dublin, to enable the argument to be brought forward that if you bring the wages of bricklayers in Dublin down to the Waterford and Wexford rates there would be nothing to complain of?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>However, this is the argument adopted in favour of the proposition, that it is necessary to stimulate building by reducing the valuation for a period ending 1933.  The President has touched upon the question of the difference of the years of 1927, 1928, and 1930.  The Vice-President had been impressed by the argument respecting the period.  I am not very definitely bound to the longer period or to the shorter period, but I put it this way to the President for his consideration. Dealing with the proposition that building must be stimulated by this offer, suppose some industrial organisation begins thinking about building on the date that this Bill becomes law.  It will be, say, six months before its plans are passed and everything ready to begin.  That possibly is not the longest time to give.  It is a fair time to allow to elapse between the moment the stimulus begins to act and the cutting of the first sod.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us say four or five months.  It may be possible that the active operations of this section would not begin immediately, and would take a month or two, but under the President's proposition you are going to crowd all the activities of the building trade into one or two years. Is that desirable?  Of course, if the President maintains that it is desirable so to call upon the resources of the building trade, to carry on at full speed even more than it can conveniently carry on during that period, his argument is sound.  I suggest, however, that it is worth considering whether the period of stimulus ought not to extend rather longer than two years from date.  From that point of view I think there is something to be said in favour of the year 1930 as against 1927.  One would have expected in having an amendment of this kind brought forward from the Seanad, supported so strongly as it has been by the President, that we should have heard either in the Seanad or here, some of the figures and facts relating to the effect of the section on rates.  You may not know that you may be taking a leap in the dark in respect to the future, but in respect to retroactive effects, as Deputy Figgis has called them&mdash;retrospective, as I would call them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are dealing with buildings erected in that period and with their valuation.  We ought to have adduced the number, character, and valuation of these buildings.  We should have some idea of the cost upon the local authority of this proposal in respect of buildings erected up to date.  We have had nothing of the kind.  We only know from observation that the bulk of the persons to be affected are banks, <Col N="1104" /> cinema proprietors and multiple shop owners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>We do, from observation. It is the only fact that we can go on.  We have had no other facts brought before us.  It is obvious to all.  I have stressed the point, and the argument put forward by several Deputies is, that people spent their money, who were good citizens, as Deputy McCullough said, by building during a period of higher prices, ought not to be prejudiced in favour of those people who waited and spent their money at periods of lower prices, and that, as a matter of justice, the local authorities should be called upon to make the levelling required in the interests of persons who invested their money at a time of high prices.  I think the local authority should not be called upon to come to the aid of the investor in such circumstances.  If the local authority is to be called upon it should be applicable to the other class of manufacturer who had to invest his money on capital expenditure of other kinds.  In neither case do I believe this to be a good principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is to be any remission of that kind let Deputies produce it for the consideration of the Minister for Finance to deal with in his next Finance Bill.  It is there that an equalisation proposal ought to be made and not in a local Government Bill of this kind.  If it is suggested that there might be variations made in respect of schedules and incomes earned and unearned or losses sustained by virtue of the fact that the income tax payers and the companies concerned had to undertake abnormal expenditure during these years, put these proposals before the Minister for Finance, and let it be done under the authority of the Executive Council as a whole, and at the expense of the State.  Do not throw it upon the local authorities, so that we can wash our hands of it and say, &ldquo;You are the people who suffer. We do not mind.&rdquo;  The President told us in his opening speech that he had so arranged, or, at least he did not say so but allowed us to infer, that he had <Col N="1105" /> made such arrangements that this amendment sent down by the Seanad would pass.</P>

He cannot induce the Minister for Finance to stimulate it out of his National Budget, but proposes to ask the local authorities to do it.  I am not going to take the responsibility of refusing that, but, in so far as past buildings are concerned, buildings out of which the owners have been making <Col N="1106" /> profits, I refuse to agree to the proposition that they should be exempt because buildings cost more money two years ago than they would to-day. The case for fixing April 1, 1920, has not been made.  I do not know why. No explanation has been given why that date has been fixed.  The only suggestion was that prices were at their peak at that time.  They were very nearly at their peak in 1919. People who built in 1919 or in January or February, 1920, are not going to get any benefit.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Magennis points out, a date has been stated which the Dáil has accepted.  Is the argument adduced in favour of the proposal, which Deputy Figgis has supported, that because costs were highest in 1920, and, as Deputy Good states, they are 25 per cent. lower now, then at some date previous to the peak they were higher than they are now?</P>
      <P>There is a considerable range between 25 per cent. less than the peak and the peak, and for some time anterior to April, 1920, prices were higher than they are to-day.  It is suggested that we should have a sliding scale, that as prices come down for building costs, the dates should recede, so that there will be an equivalent; that the cost of building in 1919 was the same as it was in 1925, and between that date and this date we will have an equalization through the medium of rating.  Unless Deputy Good and Deputy Figgis argue thus they have no case.  And they have not argued thus. No justification has been given for making the date April, 1920.  I cannot refrain from quoting from the Ministry of Local Government when they told every local authority and every member of a local authority, inferentially, in the year 1923, that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>all new works not urgently required should be rejected or postponed <Col N="1107" /> until a substantial improvement is effected in the condition of existing works.  No new works other than those vitally necessary should be undertaken during the present period of financial stringency.</P>
    <P>New works might have been undertaken but for the advice of the Government in this matter.  Work is now to be stimulated by a reduction in the annual charge for rates.  So be it.  I am accepting that proposition as from now onwards, but if people, despite the advice of the Government, erected new buildings&mdash;eliminating houses and including, almost wholly, buildings of the type that we have mentioned: banks, multiple shops, cinemas and insurance companies' establishments&mdash;no case has been made for relieving them of two-thirds of the valuation for a period of years until 1933 which could not be made to relieve them of the same amount of rates perpetually. I ask the House to stand by the amendment that was carried in Committee and to reject the President's motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some slight error with regard to the period of peak prices.  It was said that 1920 was the time of peak prices.  That is not so. The time of peak prices was before 1920 when timber and building materials were hardly procurable.  We had  and timber in 1920.  Previous to that they could hardly be procured at all.  They could be procured at a reasonable price in 1920 as compared with other years.  We heard the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; used to-day.  It is strange that it took the Seanad to discover injustice in this Bill.  It was strange that the wise men in the Dáil&mdash;and we have wise men&mdash;did not see this.  Factories have been mentioned and the only case made has been made for them, obviously for the reason that they are of public benefit.  I take it that if a case has been made for a factory we ought to leave it at that.  Factories, no doubt, are a public benefit when they are working.  If we are to adopt this principle of asking somebody else to carry our load we ought to confine it to factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this amendment we are asking <Col N="1108" /> somebody else to carry our load.  The builders went out a few years ago as a matter of pure speculation in many instances.  We have seen estates built on, between here and Dalkey, and those speculators who thought it good business to build are going to be relieved of rates.  I suggest that it is not factories that are in men's minds when they are making this case.  I suggest that only to a small extent does the question of factories arise.</P>

The person living in a house built any time prior to 1920 is a fool or is in a better position to carry our load than we are ourselves.  That is not playing the game.  It is asking one section of the community to subsidise another and to carry its load.  I disagree with the whole section and with this amendment from the Seanad, and I think it ought not to be sanctioned.  It has no element of justice in it.

      <P>As far as I can follow the arguments put forward against the Seanad amendment, they have reference to the areas from which the speakers come.  I should like to speak from the local or parochial point of view also on this matter.  As you are all aware, the City of Cork was burned down in 1921.  Naturally, an amount of unemployment was caused thereby.  A reconstruction committee was formed to rebuild the city as quickly as possible.  Every effort was made, when the compensation claims were paid, to get the work carried out.  Deputation after deputation came up here to the Government to try and push on the work on behalf of the unemployed who were walking the streets of Cork.  Nothing could be done.  All honour to the men who, at that particular period, stepped into the breach and put up buildings to give badly-needed employment.  Those <Col N="1109" /> people are carrying on business, I am sorry to state, at a considerable loss, in consequence of the bad state of trade in the city.  Is it not an awful state of affairs to think that in that city since then you have huts which were erected by people who were large shop owners, and that these people are paying no rates whatever to the Corporation of Cork or to the Commissioner? That is why I say that the men who had the pluck and the courage to step into the breach and to put up their buildings should not be penalised for having put them up, when the men who are going to build next week will be partially exempt as they have been exempt since the destruction of the property.  I say it is grossly unfair.</P>
      <P>I notice that Deputy Johnson said that he is afraid if this amendment is passed all the building will be crowded into the period in which exemption is given.  In Cork at that time we thought it would be necessary to import men to cope with all the building. Unfortunately, not half the available men were employed.  Some of the buildings are up now and others are in progress.  Surely if some of those people put up their building when there was a danger that it might be demolished again, they should not be penalised by being made pay a rate at a certain valuation from which people who build next week are to get an exemption? I say that is unfair.</P>

      <P>We have listened to a torrent of eloquence for and against this amendment.  Unfortunately, I feel myself unable to support this amendment, and I do not think it would be right for me to give a silent vote.  It is with very great regret I find myself unable to support it.  Deputy Gorey made a remark with which I agree, that it is a wonder it did not occur to the framers of the Bill to deal with this point before it was introduced.  It was left to the Seanad to discover it. That seems to me to be a reflection on the intelligence of the Dáil.  No doubt, there is some explanation which, perhaps, if it is worth while, we may get later on.  I am totally opposed to the principle.  While it may be quite right&mdash;and no doubt is&mdash;to <Col N="1110" /> encourage building in the future in every possible way, I cannot see that it is just or equitable to introduce a retrospective clause.  Why should it be confined to one sort of industry? Why should it not extend to all?  In the years mentioned many people did patriotic things, besides engaging in building.  They expended money in other ways and they are not claiming, nor would they think of claiming, a remission of rates.  Why should the people who built, because they thought it was a good thing for their own business, get remission of rates?  They may have been animated by patriotic feelings, but still they would hardly have built if they thought they would be at a loss.  In those years there were many people who bought land at a very high rate&mdash;far too high a rate. Are they going to get a remission of rates, because that land is not now the value it was then?  The question does not bear examination.  In the year 1919 many farmers lost money through the season being wet, although it was not as bad a season as last season. But wages were high and they suffered heavy losses.  Are they to be reimbursed for those losses by remission of rates?  The thing is ridiculous.  One could enlarge on this subject, but it all comes to this: Is it right to go back and give a remission of rates for a certain period of years to one set of people and not to all?  I say it is not. I regret that I cannot see that it would be just or equitable to support any such recommendation, even though it bears the impress of the President, whom I respect as everybody else does. On point of principle, I cannot vote for this amendment.  It may be just and right to give every inducement to people to build in the time to come, but it would be unfair, in my opinion, to go back and extend the same concession to those who have built.</P>

To-day <Col N="1111" /> I have heard from the President, Deputy Good and Deputy Figgis, arguments in favour of it, with which I am in complete accord.  From the genuine labour point of view, it is much better to encourage people to build than to prevent them.  This amendment gives a certain amount of encouragement to people to build.  We have had a lot of patriots in the country from 1898 and we have patriots amongst the farming community.  They were so patrotic since 1920 that they refused to till their land in order to give employment.  Now we find Deputy Wolfe suggesting that they should be subsidised for the service they rendered to the State; I suppose he means by placing so many people on the Labour Exchange.  Since 1920 a very dark cloud passed over this country.  People who gave employment by building, at a time when they did not know whether or not the place they had built would be blown up, deserve some recognition.  Why are you going to deprive the man who built since 1920 of the remission of two-thirds of his rate and grant that facility to the man who starts to build in 1925, when law in the country is well established?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly fail to see why the Dáil should go against the amendment of the Seanad, that is to make it retrospective since 1921.  I would be in favour of holding up the whole section. If an amendment had been put forward to reject the whole section I would be in favour of it.  We are told that we would be penalising the local authorities, who will not be able to collect or get in the amount of the rates they have been getting of late years, and so will not be able to give so much employment as heretofore.  That is a point that some Deputies raised.  To my mind, by giving facilities to people to build either business premises, whether wholesale or retail, or any other such buildings, you will be encouraging them to give more employment, and by this means you will have far more people employed than might be dismissed by the local authorities owing to lack of funds caused by this amendment. Deputy Gorey spoke about makers of potato kishes.  I would like to remind Deputy Gorey that if he is <Col N="1112" /> familiar with manufacturers of potato kishes I am not.</P>

      <P>Yes, and he is going now in the right direction.  As far as my vote is concerned I intend to vote in favour of the amendment simply for the purpose of encouraging people to give employment to the large number of people who are unemployed at present and to keep them from looking for the dole at the Labour Exchange. I am sorry to say that a great many of these have been knocked off lately.  I think if the Dáil accepts this amendment about the remission of rates it is as equitable to have that amendment apply to houses built since 1921 as to houses built from 1925 onwards. That will not mean anything extra.  It will not mean handing back money from the local authorities to the people who have paid it.  The rates that have been paid are somewhat similar to the water that has flown under the bridge, never again to return. That is quite true.  It can never again be returned to those who paid it.  I think the Dáil will be doing right and justice and assisting employment by encouraging the people who, in the slack times through which we have passed, erected those buildings. Consequently I am going to support this amendment.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Lyons, although I have a clearer conscience than he has, because I did not vote on this amendment when it was before the Dáil previously. In the building of houses that are so necessary and which entail so much employment every encouragement should be given.  Some of the arguments that I have heard to-day remind me very forcibly of an old saying in the country that eaten bread is soon forgotten.  When the people in the country were not in employment in 1920 or 1921, and when it was dangerous to start building, I say that those people who had the courage to come along then and start building operations should not now be forgotten. Every inducement that could be held out to the builder or the capitalist to invest his money in the erection of houses which would give employment, should be held out to him. Stress has been laid on the need for an incentive to builders.  I think the Government should show some gratitude to those people who in those dark days came out and gave employment and so relieved the economic pressure. Furthermore, they relieved the houseless people, and people are now living in those houses who would be in the slums or homeless altogether if these houses had not been built.  Then, again, you had factories built in Dublin. You had factories built in Cork, and at the present moment factories are in course of construction there, thanks to the judicious way in which the Minister for Finance handled his Budget last year.  I refer to the boot factory that is being built.  I am in favour of making this clause retrospective, because I think that, after all, the men who spent their money would feel that they had an incentive to do the same in the future if the representatives of the people now show them that they were grateful to those who in very dark days ventured to serve them.  I will vote for the amendment.</P>

      <P>In seeking permission to speak I asked that the Dáil should not accept this amendment. On the motion that the question be put I said that the case had not in reality been put forward for the landed interests and I am deputed to do it.  We have always put forward the claim, and we have always stood for the contention that the land is unjustly rated, and that the incidence of local taxation is unfair to the landed interests. Yet what are we asked to do now in the proposal before An Dáil?</P>
      <P>Land will still continue to bear the same valuation but not necessarily to bear the same rates, because the rates will be advanced. Yet buildings which have been erected &mdash; factories, cinemas, theatres, shops, even garages&mdash;since April 1st, 1920, will benefit by this proposed section.  Any building which has been substantially enlarged or improved will likewise benefit.  That is not a fair proposition to put up to the agricultural community.  I accept in a large measure what Deputy Gorey says about factories.  I do protest, however, against the proposal that buildings erected for pleasure and to make profit out of the inclinations of some people should benefit, and that the working people shall have to make good the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case was made by Deputy Good <Col N="1116" /> that it was more advantageous to a local authority to have a factory erected than to have a cabbage garden. If the proposal before the Dáil were accepted that would be a doubtful question.  The matter does not really end with the erection of the factory. Large charges have to be borne by the local authority.  Roads have to be constructed, mains have to be laid for water, gas and electricity.  All these things are very costly.  The question is, whether the one-third of the rates that will be paid will meet all that expenditure. It is very doubtful.  I have no figures to go into the matter, but from what we know as to the cost of making roads and carrying out services which local authorities are bound by law to provide, it is questionable whether the local authority will benefit.  At some time, which we can yet scarcely visualise, the local authority may benefit, but, I submit, it will not benefit immediately.</P>
    <P>The case put up by Deputy Figgis as to the retroactive side of it has been in a large measure met by the Minister for Justice.  Deputy Good, I submit, let himself down when he said that buildings being erected at present cost 25 per cent. less.  It is true that the Deputy made a great point in favour of the retroactive part of this.  On the other hand, he demolished the idea that the principle should be extended.  As a matter of fact he put forward what I conceive to be a great argument against the insertion of the section at all.  If the cost of building is down 25 per cent. now as compared with any time within the past five years, it is not a reasonable inference that the cost will continue to fall, and that the need for this concession will, in a large measure, disappear.</P>
    <P>I have heard of very few failures amongst those firms in the past four or five years.  If they have weathered the storm until this, can we not look forward with a great degree of certainty to their being able to weather it in future?  The point has been made that old-established firms benefit by having a lower valuation.  I submit that that is hardly a good argument.  I ask any business man whether, if he had his choice, he would take an old concern <Col N="1117" /> or a modern one, even with the disadvantage of a higher valuation.  I submit that he would take the newly-built premises with modern equipment even with the penalty of a higher valuation. I will put this question to Deputy Figgis: What percentage of the cost of production do the rates on any building represent?  I submit that they represent a very small percentage, that it is so infinitesimal that it might be regarded as negligible. Deputy Figgis emphasised the fact that the old-established firm had a manifest advantage over a competitor starting in business with this handicap of a high valuation.  I asked him from what did he draw that conclusion, but he failed to answer me.  He asked me how would I explain the conundrum. I have now got some figures about certain firms in Dublin which come within the scope of this section, if adopted by the Dáil.  I find, from Thom's Directory, that the valuation of Clery's is £2,880; Switzer's, £1,330; Arnott's, £2,850, and on some isolated premises £260; Pim's, £2,300; Todd Burns, £550.  These are comparative figures for business houses in Dublin.</P>

      <P>Dublin was revalued in 1914.  That does not apply to any other place in the Saorstát, with the exception of Waterford, and the new valuation has not come into force there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  Although these premises were revalued in 1914, I put it to the President, if he were investing his money in a business premises, whether he would buy Clery's, with a valuation of £2,880, or Pim's, with a valuation of £2,300.  Which is the better concern?  I am not speaking now so much with reference to the amount of business done in these concerns, but I ask, which of them, as a building, has the greater possibilities and the greater potentialities?  Take the case of Messrs. Guinness.  The <Col N="1118" /> valuation of their premises is put down at £12,314.  In the newspapers the other day I saw that the stock market was expecting a dividend of something like 30 per cent on the capital of this firm. What is the capital of Messrs. Guinness, and, I put it to Deputy Figgis, what is their output?  I leave it to him to ascertain that point.  How much, I ask, will the rates on a valuation of £12,000 odd represent?  What will the percentage for overhead charges and the cost of production be on the price of a pint? Why, the profits of Messrs. Guinness run into millions, and yet these are people who, if they have enlarged their premises since 1920, or have built new premises, will benefit automatically under this proposed section.  I am not grudging that to them as a matter of ethics, but I am putting forward the argument that, taking their case as an example, this is hardly a fair proposition to put before the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a tee-totaller. The position is much the same down the country.  Very few factories have been built down the country, but by those engaged in the retail and distributive trade there have been very great extensions of their business premises. The men who control these trades deal in the commodities which the agricultural population either require or sell, and these are a class of people who will benefit by this proposed section.  The effect of this, if it is passed, will be that you will narrow and restrict the incidence of local taxation and you will do that at the expense of the poorer classes.  You let off the rich and the well-to-do, the bigmonied people, and I think I might go so far as to say that, by this, you will give a fillip and a new lease of life to the profiteers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, if accepted, will put the rich and the well-to-do in a more privileged and favoured position than they occupy at present, and it will operate against the poor peasantry in the Saorstát.  I would ask the Dáil to remember this fact, that the man who has a publichouse in a local village <Col N="1119" /> in the country also uses the licensed premises as his place of residence, the valuation of which may be anything from ten to fifteen pounds a year.  There are very few of these houses which would be valued at more than fifteen pounds a year.  Consider, then, the case of a poor, wretched farmer living two or three miles away from that village.  He may be feeding two or three cows, and the valuation on his land is perhaps fifteen pounds a year.  He is rated, in addition, on the house in which he lives, which may be either a hovel or a comparatively decent house.  The publican in the village, to whom I referred, may have a turnover in his trade from ten to fifty times greater than that of the poor peasant, and yet he only pays the local authority pretty much the same amount of rates as the poor farmer. There is just the difference of the agricultural grant, which is very, very small at the present time.</P>
    <P>I put it to Deputies who represent agricultural constituencies, whether they are prepared to stand over the proposition that business men who have made large profits out of their business, profits so large that they have been able to extend their premises, should get this remission in the rates which are rightly due on their premises to the local authority.  I maintain that the proposition is one which cannot be sustained, because it is manifestly unjust.  I am rather surprised at the attitude that Deputy Lyons has taken up on this.  He stated to-day that he will vote in favour of the President's amendment, while he was of a different opinion a few days ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood Deputy Lyons to say that the remission of these rates would help on <Col N="1120" /> building, but let me point out to him what the President's amendment proposes to do as contrasted with Deputy Johnson's.  Deputy Johnson's amendment proposes that this section shall operate in the case of houses built between 1925 and 1930, while the President's amendment is that it shall only operate as from 1920 to 1927.  In other words, that the section shall only apply for two years more.  I cannot understand Deputy Lyons's attitude on this matter when it is considered that Deputy Johnson's amendment would encourage building for the next five years, while the President's only proposes to give assistance during the next two years.  Does Deputy Lyons think that it is better only to encourage building for two years rather than for five years?  Which, I ask, would be the better proposition for the tradesman and the labourer?  Obviously, of course, Deputy Johnson's would, and yet Deputy Lyons says that he is in favour, of the President's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government told us a few days ago that we should be just and equitable.  It is curious how, sub-consciously, the Minister can be influenced in his language in his dual professional role as barrister and politician. Certainly, we need to be just, but scarcely I think in the sense that he desires us.  He has not put forward any case as to why we should accept this proposal.  I have a distinct hostility to the idea which underlies all these doles and subsidies.  They are not just to the local authority, and in the higher sense they are scarcely just to the State.  I pointed out on the last day that there was something in the nature of pauperism about this.  It contains the principle of pauperism, and I submit it is a very dangerous precedent for us to adopt.  I see no reason why, if a man down the country decides to extend his business, he should be helped by the remission of rates that are justly due to the local authority, and at the expense, too, of the agricultural community.  To give relief of the kind proposed in the case of a man who wants to have up-to-date business premises, is not fair to the proprietors of older establishments.  These latter would be handicapped of course <Col N="1121" /> by having inferior business premises when competing against men with modernly equipped business houses.  It is unfair, I say, that one class of competitor should be subsidised at the expense of another competitor, and that is really what the President's amendment amounts to.</P>

      <P>The point appears to me to be this, that you have, as I know, in many streets in many towns in Ireland, a number of persons whose houses were blown up during the Black-and-Tan <i>régime</i>, as it was generally called.  I know of two cases in a particular town where they were blown up as official reprisals.  I went down there in 1922 and I asked the people, in these two cases, who were friends of the Treaty, and who stood for the stability of the State, and tried to help the State in functioning, for God's sake to try and relieve unemployment by going on with their buildings. I did that in a good many other towns in Kerry as well.  These people did what I asked.  Other people held their money in their hands because they were anxious that unemployment should continue in order that it might hamper the Government in its work, and in order that they might try to create chaos.  The one set of persons went along and built their houses at the greater cost of something like 25 per cent., I would say an addition of about £400 on a £2,500 house.  The other men drew their rate of interest and they will now build and get the benefit of this particular section. The man who took his courage in both hands&mdash;and it did take some courage down there&mdash;and expended a greater amount of money than he would have to expend if he waited to build until now, is not going to get any benefit from this section.  That is how it appears to me.  I do not need to philosophise whether retrospective legislation is good or bad.  The things I have mentioned are the things that faced me, and that is where I stand.  It is not fair that a man who did the decent thing a couple of years ago, and relieved unemployment in this particular area, so far as he could, should not get the same fair crack of the whip as the other man who held back until now gets.</P>

But we are not willing that this Bill should be amended so that the application of the section should benefit people other than those, and especially people like the big combines that came into this country in recent years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Daly, in the course of his statement, said that a red herring was being deliberately drawn across the track of men who intended to build houses.  I do not know how Deputy Daly or anyone else could make such a statement, because Deputy Johnson already proposed an amendment, the acceptance of which will act as an incentive to anybody who will build a house in the next five years. Anybody who built a house or a factory since 1920 did it with his eyes open, and I have yet to learn that the great combine of John Player &amp; Son is sufficiently philanthropic to come over to Dublin and build a factory in order to provide employment for Irish workers.  One of the reasons they came over was to make more profit than they were making out of the sale of their cigarettes in Ireland.</P>

They did give employment, and they gave that employment irrespective of whether this amendment is put in or not, and they would continue to give employment whether this amendment <Col N="1123" /> is put in or not, and I feel certain that they made no representation to the Government to the effect that they were not making a profit and that they should receive a subsidy from the local authorities, because that is what it means.</P>
      <P>Deputy Good has tried to educate this House as to what retrospective means, and he tried to get some people to believe that some of us thought that the retrospective clauses of this amendment meant that the local authorities would have to pay back rates collected in the past three or four years.  None of us understood it in that light.  We realise that rates once collected cannot be paid back.  But estimates for the last three or four months have been prepared, and have been based on the new estimated valuation in consequence of certain buildings and factories erected in certain towns, and interference with these estimates would now be a very serious thing so far as the public authorities are concerned.  If the valuation is to be altered&mdash;of course the valuation itself will not be altered&mdash; but the income from the valuation&mdash;it will materially affect every ratepayer in the district because when you have a certain valuation for two or three years and estimates are prepared on that valuation, as has been done all over the country, it means now that the ratepayers will have to make up the difference in consequence of those people being remitted two-thirds of their rates.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the President has made any better case to-day than he did on Wednesday last, and I cannot see, for a moment, what he said to-day that so affected Deputy Lyons's mind. I do not think that Deputy Lyons heard many of the arguments here to-day for or against this amendment, yet he has changed his mind.</P>

      <P>I must congratulate the President.  Deputy Michael Egan certainly made a special case for Cork, and I would agree that Cork should receive special consideration, but not in the way suggested in this amendment. Certainly the people in Cork, when their houses were destroyed, suffered a certain amount of consequential damage for which they were not compensated.  I do think these people should receive special consideration from the Government, but I object to the retrospective clauses in this amendment.  I am as anxious, and my party is as anxious, as anybody to offer some incentive to people to build. But persons who built in the past built with their eyes open knowing all the circumstances that prevailed and I have yet to learn that they are at any loss for having built.</P>

      <P>Tá géarghá le tithe sa tir.  Ní mór 40,000 tigh nua ar a luíod igcóir muintir na hEireann.  Isé ar dtuairim gur ceart don Rialtas cabhrú leis nn daoine atá toilteanach chun tithe do sholáthar, ach cad 'na thaobh go dtabharfimís airgead do dhaoine atá tar éis tithe do thógaint cheana féin?  Na daoine go mbeadh ortha an t-airgead san do dhíol cad a gheobhdís dá bhárr agus na tithe gur 'na gcóir a tabharfaí é ann cheana?  Do chualamair cainnt i dtaobh na honóra ba cheart a thabhairt do dhaoine a dhin monarchana agus siopaí do thógaint le ceithre bliana anuas.  Ní har mhaithe le n-a gcomharsain a thógadar iad ach ar mhaithe leo féin agus chun a ngnó féin do chur chun cinn.  Isé mo thuairim-se ná beadh ann ach dícéille airgead do dhíol leo súd i dtaobh rud do dhéanamh ná raibh ann ach gnáth-ghnó.  Nílim róshásta leis an leasú a thairg Tomás Mac Eoin.  Cé gur ceart cabhrú le daoine a thógfidh tithe i rith an chúpla bliain seo chughainn, nuair a bheidh géar-ghá le hobair, ní fheicim-se cad <Col N="1125" /> 'na thaobh go dtabharfaí congnamh do dhaoine ná tosnóidh ar thithe do dhéanamh go ceann trí no ceathair de bhlianta.</P>
